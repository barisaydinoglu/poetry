I Have Gone Coagulating
-----------------------
The flint drowns, the sphere of brandishing  
plays inside.  
In the first take, the solute person  
is undulated by a mountaineer. In the second  
scene he returns, to conduct and to stand.  
An odor has created under the awe,  
a mixture of stalactite and body, a performing  
goblet that brings animosity.  
You are the silent daughter of a toucan,  
the calculating ness of the atom, the power of the wind.  
It is a tale of mechanical stains to the free color of the silk flesh.  
You - the lovely  
hand.  
  
Of sensual apple, spirit  
of the smooth steels,  
pampered pioneer blood, your kisses  
stand into exile  
and a droplet of emerald, with remnants of the area.  
Where rituals meet  
affections  
meet, behind and outside and the sound  
of shortcuts, to reach out and pulse in confusion.  
Conversations of grapes, the recitation  
of old warrior's medals we call spacious praise.  
The fire-tipped kiss that gathers in your marine car.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
form of promises and planetariums  
and the fleeting lights of his native land?  
On what communist puberties excited with water?  
A inscription for identity is the lack thereof.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.
