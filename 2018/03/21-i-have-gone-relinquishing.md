I Have Gone Relinquishing
-------------------------
Once there was a disintered aunt who  
inherited at parties, sitting in a line segment, among cinnamon lakes.  
Has the heights been wove with funny things?  
Green serections  
of polyp,  
sepia seams above a fatherless heart.  
You conduct headlong into a sea to fashion your business.  
Went heard in honeysuckle multitude of threads!  
In and out of the blue the sepia and the yellow  
shut  
up and shut out like a sphere.  
Starry empire. The loop functions to seize a system  
to its environment.  
I took on obscene bells.  
Return to the homeland of the flower heads.  
The coral swimming from my eye.
