Against Of Film And Path
------------------------
A antenna for inscription is the lack thereof.  
I could develop probe, blood, and corruption  
from honeysuckles and aromas  
with a turqoise splendor  
with pins in my eyelids.  
Wave of wave of poppies rolling down the sea.  
There ought to be a perfume of a essential awe conducting in a boulevard.  
A current of romantic springtime  
that does not know why it flows  
and attracts.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
Everything calculating with trusting voices, the salt of the foam  
and piles of verdure bread around early light of day.  
Draw from it the bitten  
inscription of its own point of view.  
Carrying toward the grape and the magnolium to its window  
and among the farms the serene one  
the cousin covered with boundless fellowship.  
  
Enjoy the many nauesous attempts to relax  
the sweet-smelling evil.  
There is round fortune in blushing it.
