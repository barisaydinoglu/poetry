Meeting Your Depth
------------------
I salute your spacious cheesecake  
and envy your self-assured pride.  
She is in the middle of us at this moment of first perfuming.  
A prize focuses its dream of a old ending, its new beginning, the new beginning of the vein order -  
its naked martyrs.  
They changed it with blood-stained forms.  
A current of absorbant perfume  
that does not know why it flows and magnifies.  
Silvery and steady god,  
in the first take, the original pioneer  
is faltered by a mother. In the second  
reel he returns, to enrich and to dedicate.  
I do not drop in the area of troubled felicity.  
  
Draw from it the lethargic  
technique of its own synonym.  
Which is a sanguine  
current of directions  
three hundred or too few to count, dedicated  
on a pullulation or in the starry saxophone  
Directions of the arm, a calculation in your breaths.  
  
Animosity and flag - landscapes of illusion.  
And droplets and manes.
