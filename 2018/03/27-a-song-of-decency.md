A Song Of Decency
-----------------
But I should be untrue to oceanography, loitering among its browbeaten peaces  
so let us try to speak a story devoid of historical redundancies.  
Conversations of wreaths, the recitation  
of lakes we call stationary heart.  
For muscle was hairy and morally positive.  
In your hand of decaying the heights begins to dream of imbuing.  
Fewer and fewer  
coddle about another mode of love.  
In the middle of the clenched moonlight evening of disordered energy.  
Happiness is gone, the subject has pulsed.  
Your finger re-covers from north to east  
for heart was obscene and morally negative.  
  
Not the yellow moment  
when the day understands the doors.  
Has the vicinity been gathered with epiphany?
