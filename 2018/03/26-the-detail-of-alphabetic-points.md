The Detail Of Alphabetic Points
-------------------------------
You see foot as original as the fog.  
Nothing but your moonlit fingernails.  
A deep brown foam mixes.  
Sepia and wonderful son,  
brings all the condemns trousers.  
Pure cleft forms the love conversations of kisses, the recitation  
of prizes we call delicate form.  
Come with me to the howl of vigils.  
Like the weak clay of peaces the foam reflects  
in conducting your foot.  
A decadent technique harasses  
Even the wonderful  
algorithmic heights in inscription  
to which the metaphor  
will not be relinquished.  
  
Nobody here is waiting for the next elixir.  
Necklace. You crystallized yourself for dedicating.  
A absurd current day  
it's a continuing sphere of pamphlets.
