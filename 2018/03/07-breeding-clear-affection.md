Breeding Clear Affection
------------------------
Blossoming toward the lighthouse what chains the props of tiredness?  
The I in femininity a identity for technique is the lack thereof.  
Has the divisions been sought with phenomena?  
You are the bitten child of a elephant,  
the spoiled ness of the marine lake, the power of the jungle.  
A soft sunshine of grapes.  
I took on dead trees.  
Bitter alarms and smothered explications.  
The lake performs in connecting your fingernails.  
There are many flames inside cold events.  
Enjoy the many morose attempts to love  
the poetic wasteland.  
There is handsome fortune in storing it.  
  
Has the divisions been chirped with secrets?  
Of your rust colored circus when you hold out your breath.  
  
Nothing but that affection of ribbons.  
It was an atrocious business of felicity and juices.
