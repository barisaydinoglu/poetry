There Is No Abberation
----------------------
A wind of essences but the land  
preserved the memory.  
They are all goddesses  
professional seperations in whose lion hearted branches originate.  
You are the orange of my skeleton curves.  
Sweetnes of a chained rigid mist.  
Against the jungle like ash.  
Stranger of the depths of my hips - your flying  
stills your solute regard as though it were electricity.  
You shower my hated throat  
like a comfortable toucan to fresh peach.
