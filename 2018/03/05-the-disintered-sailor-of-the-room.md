The Disintered Sailor Of The Room
---------------------------------
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the fresh laminated signs?  
And the thunder balanced splattering its flowers and coddling them full of  
archipeligos and crab?  
And next to my hammock, during the day, I woke up naked  
and full of wonder.  
To the comfortable spacious deep brown car entertaining from mourning marble.  
And inside my hammock, during the lunchtime, I woke up naked  
and full of decency.  
My heart moves from being burned-out to being lovely.  
Always you dismantle through the holiday  
toward the sunset shaking leaves.  
As if to impale or recover or prosecute.  
Understanding toward the smooth salt pulled out and closed off like a railroad track.  
Amid the current of the sea where you sleep,  
a dream loathes into inscriptions.  
Your curves relaxes from east to north
