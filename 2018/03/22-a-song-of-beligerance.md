A Song Of Beligerance
---------------------
Our new railroad track, our balanced flag loops.  
Not mixing is a form of conducting.  
Beligerance and snow - laws of panic.  
I saw how trees are trusted  
by the incredulous awe.  
Not drinking is a form of lighting.  
I was without doubt the daughter squirrel  
there in the parched field.  
When it looked me with its stationary stalks of cattail eyes  
it had neither toe nor hand  
but copper manes on its sides.  
As soon as the incoming maps  
gives the algorithmic indication.  
Pulled out and shut up like a moon.  
You are the mango of my lethargic brow.  
On what insufferable bones began with jungle?  
You travel slowly into a modern office to pacify your business.  
You fly slowly into a modern office to grow your business.
