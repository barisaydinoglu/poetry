Meeting Your Death
------------------
Come with me to the death of imbroglios.  
The leaf promising from my fingernails.  
Come with me to the moth of daggers.  
Of a red stranger that reflects wine bottles.  
A projection for sequence is the lack thereof.  
The womb imposes nessecity.  
The parenthetical light gave it purity.  
Of a brimstone lady that flies bells.  
And a rigid serenity's heat will upgrade you.  
Forming the bell of her prize full of felicity.  
Everything atrocious with absent minded voices, the salt of the phemonana  
and piles of natural bread amid fortnight.  
  
The holiday starss in the sky you in its mortal water.
