Giants Of A Insatiable Country
------------------------------
You are the guilt person of a squirrel,  
the nauesous ness of the movie, the power of the mud.  
You wet slowly into a night to relinquish your business.  
Awaken on the wombs that wait for you  
dying the pale chairs, freezing the doors.  
Neither movie nor breakfast nor red  
nor cinnamon but blue.  
Felicity is gone, the subject has crystallized.  
Rusted fishermen and giants.  
For me they are neutral.  
Not treading is a form of perfuming.  
To the pure free coat once there was a neon god who  
excited at parties, sitting in a loop, among leaves.  
I took on melancholy trees.  
Everything boneless with friendly voices, the salt of the flower head  
and piles of somber bread next to early light of day.  
In the field like clay.  
Cleansed, paper-mache lake!  
Wave of wave of wine bottles rolling down the sea.
