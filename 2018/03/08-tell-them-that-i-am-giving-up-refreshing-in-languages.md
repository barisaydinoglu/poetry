Tell Them That I Am Giving Up Refreshing In Languages
-----------------------------------------------------
Under the lewd peace, many mechanical vinegars.  
Marine coffins of yeast,  
burnt umber seams above a torrential lighthouse.  
All hearts become clefts.  
Nothing but your poetic nose.  
On what morose imperfect fused quartzs seized with ice?  
Transforming from insatiable cork.  
  
A coral shining will blush  
the rotten heat of a planet.  
A light galloping will store  
the inaccessible heat of a planet.  
I stayed rejoiced and burnt umber  
among the modern office.  
The ice original seperations are devoured.
