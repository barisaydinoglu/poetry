I Expected Fathers
------------------
For quilt was delirious and morally neutral.  
I salute your fluidic cheesecake  
and envy your poetic pride.  
Enjoy the many muzzled attempts to rise  
the profound granule.  
There is stationary fortune in recovering it.  
As if to silence or  
entertain or gnaw.  
In the room like graphite.  
We get the color  
they must lots to understand  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but shrapnels.  
Perhaps they are not deformed.  
  
And the flower to its grape  
and among the quivers the cleansed  
one  
the one covered with secure vein.  
On what fractious enemies entertained with electricity?
