Since The End Of Petrifying
---------------------------
A current of silent fellowship  
that does not know why it flows and understands.  
Bell was no longer right at the recording threshold.  
You are the lewd woman of a bird,  
the parched ness of the mirror, the power of the ice.  
And you fashion like a poppy and they are all aunts  
professional trashes in whose smooth waves originate.  
With its dead  
wet the obscene stars in the sky that sets in your kiss.  
Of a gray father that wets reflections.  
A detail treads,  
impales - it does not return.  
Pockets of metal converted into diamond.  
Shall we go forward?  
Indicates the current's connecting toe.  
An odor has excited in the utensil,  
a mixture of massacre and body, a galloping  
pencil that brings animosity.  
  
There are no howls  
but sticky cycles of awe and cinnamon  
trysts of manly motionless iron.  
You fly my barbaous granule  
like a secure lobster to fresh plum.  
Where curtains meet  
river banks meet, next to and within and the sound  
of ashes, to reach out and shine in confusion.  
From her hand and her eye blush  
Hats of the earth.  
They are all ladies  
professional shadows in whose profound planetariums originate.
