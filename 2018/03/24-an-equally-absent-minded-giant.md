An Equally Absent Minded Giant
------------------------------
Always you erupt through the lunchtime  
toward the late afternoon loathing love.  
Harsh uncles and women.  
For me they are alphabetic.  
To seek another land but the angel flew the memory. The land impales, the sea's skin of aromatic  
perches behind.  
It was a disordered business of pamphlet and daggers.
