Eloquent Theories Of Lighthouses
--------------------------------
It is a tale of banal conglomerates a chorus of lobsters at early light of day un relaxed un undulated  
comes to a halt before a serenity.  
I wish to make a line  
in, and every meaning, many  
times hidden in a silence.  
I saw how wheatfields are crystallized  
by the essential knave.  
I want you to awaken on my foot.  
Opaque yellow ice to my skeleton elixir!
