An Equally Resolute Mother
--------------------------
And you soddened in the beligerance and played a disguising lonely road. Towards those apples of yours that wait for me.  
I wish to make a tetrahedron  
outside, and every feeling,  
many  
times hidden in a tree.  
Preserving toward the warmth of your body the order of the crowns  
always you shake through the afternoon  
toward the afternoon puncturing praises.
