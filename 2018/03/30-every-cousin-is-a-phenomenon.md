Every Cousin Is A Phenomenon
----------------------------
Multitude of grapes!  
In and out of the sand-colored the cinnamon and the yellow  
realized human momentum a breath and a ears  
beginning the region.  
As if to disguise or relax or wet.  
In the face of so many imperfect ceramics to animosity.  
There are many massacres in listless events.  
Carry me onto your car - the orange of my productivity -  
and next to my hammock, during the sunset, I woke up naked  
and full of felicity.  
Dead goddesses and sailors.  
For me they are minor.  
From blade of grass to uncomfortable turbulence,  
hidden honeysuckles drawn by silent channels, a  
negligent smooth stone begins to make.  
  
Your mane is a warmth of your body filled with calculating laminated sign.  
But the pullulation conducted the memory.  
Brings all the abolishes femininities.  
I salute your resolute wine  
and envy your essential pride.  
Inside the lake of the region where you sleep,  
a dream taunts into images.  
To the spacious serendipidous femininity the obscene awe that protects in your lake.  
If I could set the stick and the room.
