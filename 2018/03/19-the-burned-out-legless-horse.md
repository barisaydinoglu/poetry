The Burned-out Legless Horse
----------------------------
It is a tale of demonic funerals someone here is waiting for the next rose.  
Forest. You pacified yourself for enriching.  
Of your ultraviolet door when you hold out your toe.  
Wave of wave of farms rolling down the sea.  
I could crystallize saliva, billows of blood colored smoke, and phlegm  
from suns and films  
with a ultraviolet foam  
with vortices in my eyelids.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
And meetings of torrential curves closed off and shut out like a stars in the sky.  
When the area is full of rustling curves  
with yeasts and hollow putrid foams  
and the morose starry skies and the river banks  
at last give forth their inevitable ghost.  
In the striking imbroglios.  
The lightning wide stains are smothered.  
A tetrahedron with a line,  
the inevitable workings of hopeful law.  
A calcerous identity rejects  
even the promising  
grammatic moonlight evening in point of view  
to which the metaphor  
will not be dedicated.  
I saw how wreaths are stored  
by the loving warmth of your body.  
Towards those apples of yours that wait for me.  
You've asked me what the turkey  
is recovering there with his sunburst orange fingernails?  
I reply, the saxophone knows this.  
And a explosive tiger's electricity will blush you.  
You see arm as deedy as the sunshine.  
Sticky sunrise and the rigid mosaic  
twist at the walls of my house.  
We open the halves of a mysteries and the  
taunting of masks relaxes into the original universe.  
  
In your brow of depriving the land begins to dream of rescuing.  
Someone here is waiting for the next light.  
Juice. You crystallized yourself for flowing.  
  
The reasons for my respect  
are entertained in my brain of saphire.  
Door.
