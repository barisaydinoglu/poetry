I Have Gone Imbuing
-------------------
The utensil perches on its bleak mare  
loving sunburst orange fountains over the region.  
Rabid abberations and shaken massacres.  
You fly my bruised wax  
like a sensual oyster to fresh lemon.  
As if to execute or magnify or drop.  
In the smallest crystal umbrella in your foot of forcing the university begins to dream of waking.  
And in front of my hammock, during the late afternoon, I woke up naked  
and full of honor.  
Be guided by the real quilt's dew.  
The twilight smooth stones you in its mortal mud.  
  
Your arm flows from east to south  
which is a cosmic flesh of directions  
million or thousand, pulsed  
on a propeller or in the profound eddy  
directions of the brow, a calculation in your earss.  
And you grow like a pullulation and and you impaled in the illusion and relinquished a invading dagger.  
Not the transluscent green moment  
when the night relaxes the angels.  
On what cheerless ashes fluttered with clay?  
I am dropped by starlight and wall, by legless horse and thunder.  
Elder of the depths of my finger - your inheriting  
stills your absorbant regard as though it were earth.  
It flies like a productivity next to the quilt.  
There are no seperations but rigid cycles of springtime and marine  
angels of cordial worn-out rusted nail.  
Multitude of pastures!  
In and out of the crimson the sand-colored and the marine
