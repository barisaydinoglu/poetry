Since The End
-------------
Flute was no longer right at the transmission threshold.  
One technical option and enjoy the many dry attempts to flutter  
the equinoctial violence.  
There is serene fortune in reconciling it.  
A warm linoleum making an absent minded thing of a lucky meeting with a sailor.  
Fear and movie - echoes of confusion.  
Carry me onto your car - the banana of my garden -  
the muzzled pasture is acerb on your shoulder.  
Not living is a form of transforming.  
Wave of wave of smooth aluminums rolling down the sea.  
They are all elders  
professional phlegms in whose infinite movies originate.  
  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
mingle of guitars and quivers  
and the enchanting beds of his native land?
