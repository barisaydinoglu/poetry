From Earth To Mud
-----------------
If I could gather the imperfect silk and the room.  
One of them is enchanting,  
the other knows points of view.  
Where is someone  
he cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
We open the halves of a mysteries and the  
abandoning of jackals trusts into the great field.  
The order of the bells I'm the person to the promise of immediate kis.  
We get the abstraction  
they must lots to flutter  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but cities.  
Perhaps they are not entangled.  
As if to coddle or develop or bury.  
And the old warrior's medal to its essence  
and among the doors the hidden one  
the astronaut covered with secure wheatfield.  
As if to bury or chirp or abhor.  
In your eyelids of passing the room begins to dream of making.  
If you were not the wine the angellic moon  
cooks, sprinkling its plum across the area.  
The communist lobster enchants behind the somber beasts.  
An odor has awakened in the middle of the femininity,  
a mixture of wax and body, a relinquishing  
wave that brings animosity.  
Conversations of flags, the recitation  
of sea shells we call changeless lighthouse.
