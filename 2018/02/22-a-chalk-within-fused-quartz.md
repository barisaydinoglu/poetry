A Chalk Within Fused Quartz
---------------------------
Felicity is gone, the subject has rose.  
It continues like a bed with the sun.  
Halfway.  
I could expand cleft, moldy banana, and cleft  
from ribbons and graces  
with a blood colored foliage  
with vaginas in my nose.  
Of balanced grape, spirit  
of the goblets,  
executed bride blood, your kisses  
inherit into exile  
and a droplet of glass, with remnants of the university.  
When you upgrade lighted like a trouser.  
The I in droplet goddess of the depths of my arm - your circumscribing  
stills your free regard as though it were lightning.  
Not the sunburst orange moment  
when the sunrise dawns the laminated signs.  
Always you penetrate through the fortnight  
toward the sunrise compounding suns.  
With its bleak enchant there are many wounded soldiers outside sticky events.
