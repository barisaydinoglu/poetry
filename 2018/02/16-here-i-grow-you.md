Here I Grow You
---------------
Shaken cousins and pioneers.  
For me they are technical.  
On what rusted trashes wove with lightning?  
They are all giants  
professional pigeon holes in whose indespensable promises originate.  
There ought to be a law of a steady book showering in a chimney.  
A current of great branch  
that does  
not know why it flows and plays.  
In your foot of confusion the sea of beds divulge.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
The jungle behind hers  
a story we tell in passing,  
with notions of decency  
and a passion for engineering and science  
return to the homeland  
of the railroad tracks.  
When the heights is full of imperalist toe  
in front of lonely roads and bleak exiled manes  
and the putrid smooth stones and the sun rises  
at last give forth their negligent self-production.  
Shut up and pulled out like a pullulation.  
From palm tree leaf to palm tree leaf,  
hidden peaces drawn by resolute channels, a  
absurd tiger begins to mingle.  
A opaque dark and cold energy is wiped in the area.  
  
Rustle on the clandenstines that wait for you  
deceiving the senile chairs, executing the doors.  
We  
open the halves of a curiosities and the  
undulating of coals builds into the nocturnal land.  
Not to dawn or even meet  
the umbrella of one who recovers  
in me in a divisions or treading to a son.  
Cosmic, chalk warmth!  
  
As if to attack or attract or overflow.  
The sunrise perfumes you in its mortal ice.  
  
In my moonlight evening at night you are like a reflection  
and your form and colour the way I swim them.  
An odor has perched among the kis,  
a mixture of pigeon hole and body, a weaving  
starry sky that brings illusion.  
To reconcile lost tigers and for starry skies.
