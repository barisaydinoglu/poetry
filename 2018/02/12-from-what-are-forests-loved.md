From What Are Forests Loved
---------------------------
Be guided by the serendipidous autumn's sea's skin. The weak iguana reflects under the cosmic enemies. Draw from it the neon  
technique of its own antenna.  
The twilight reflections you in its mortal lightning.  
Not to conduct or even meet  
the guitar of one who returns  
against me in a room or pulsing to a person.  
Shall we proceed?  
A hand and a tail  
playing the modern office.  
And meetings of boney hand an aspen -like pigeon hole  
nothing but your vertical toe.  
Come with me to the lightning  
of legless horses.
