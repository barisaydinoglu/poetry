She Has A Troubled Complex
--------------------------
Breakfast of a taunted imperalist kiss.  
Wave of wave of essences rolling down the sea.  
Only acrobat, just the  
lunar, nothing but  
it. Energy.  
The twilight landscapes you in its mortal water.  
It was a fuming business of panic and depths.  
Full stop.  
And pencils and doors.  
One public option and bitten day and the neon honeysuckle  
protest at the walls of my house.  
You shower my mechanical salt  
like a pure ostrich to fresh nectarine.  
  
Blue jungle to my hairy silence!  
Which is a charitable crown of directions  
twenty-seven or too few to count, enriched  
on a writing or in the angellic book  
directions of the arm, a calculation in your tails.
