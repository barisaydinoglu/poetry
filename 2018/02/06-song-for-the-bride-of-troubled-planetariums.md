Song For The Bride Of Troubled Planetariums
-------------------------------------------
I saw how souls are pacified  
by the electrical praise.  
They are all brides  
professional nougats in whose promising quivers originate.  
A loaf of bread baked with burned-out respect and salt.  
Of angellic apple, spirit  
of the fountains,  
conquered gentleman blood, your kisses  
imbue into exile  
and a droplet of glass, with remnants of the divisions.  
What secrets does the jaguar contain?  
How little we travel and how much it develops the mysteries of this galaxy.  
Where hooves meet  
kisses meet, in front of and outside and the sound  
of cummerbunds, to reach out and develop in anger.  
Has the modern office been recovered with funny things?  
Went reflected in serendipity multitude of starss in the sky!  
In and out of the burnt umber the silvery and  
the opaque marine  
  
A opaque dark and disordered stone is loathed in the vicinity.  
Which is a resplendent goblet of directions  
three hundred or too few to count, galloped  
on a smooth stone or in the human grace  
directions of the fingernails, a calculation in your fingers.  
You - the fresh brow.  
Like lightnings faltering next to foliages.  
Some hear but I tread your clay like cactus.  
From her foot and her fingernails relinquish  
productivities of the earth.  
Halfway.
