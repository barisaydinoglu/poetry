Meeting Your Billows Of Dark Smoke
----------------------------------
We get the sight  
they must lots to shine  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but lightnings.  
Perhaps they are not fainted.  
I am bristled by flesh and corpse, by throat and clouds.  
When the field is full of melancholy hips  
behind abberations and hated putrid graces  
and the inevitable laws and the smooth stones  
at last give forth their acidulous circumstance.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
begin of foliages and magnoliums  
and the sensible autumns of his native land?  
Woman of the depths of my hips - your upgrading  
stills your rosy regard as though it were mud.  
Sterile morning and the boneless necklace  
attack at the walls of my house.  
I saw how shorelines are conducted  
by the celestial honeysuckle.  
A mist of telegraphs I rejoice as if outside a fire-tipped smoke.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
Nothing but your great eye.  
Which is a somber guitar of directions  
too few to count or too few to count, gathered  
on a momentum or in the homogeneous praise  
directions of the eyeballs, a calculation in your fingers.  
And the sepia lake  
to its stone  
and among the maternities the vertical one  
the person covered with wonderful pasture.  
Noble, silk bridge!
