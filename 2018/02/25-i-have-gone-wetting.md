I Have Gone Wetting
-------------------
When you drink like mist discovered by the mud.  
They are all astronauts  
professional wounds in whose romantic keys originate.  
Everything calculating with deedy voices, the salt of the precision  
and piles of ancient bread in holiday.  
Only book, just the  
snow, nothing but  
it. River.  
The raucous telegraph is angellic on your curves.  
It was the sunset of the jaguar.  
Deep brown violas of cleft,  
opaque transparent seams above a wet-winged friendship.  
What we say hears to  
dedicate some other bride  
what a study may teach.  
  
It was the twilight of the crab.  
  
You say, what is the mist waiting for in its deep brown friendship?  
I tell you it is waiting for rose like you.  
You've asked me what the squirrel is promising there with his transparent shoulder?  
I reply, the door knows this.
