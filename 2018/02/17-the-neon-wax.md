The Neon Wax
------------
Your coat is a prize filled with lonely land.  
They dismantled it with boneless juices.  
Of your black foam when you hold out your hand.  
And you excite like a telegraph and the honeysuckle passes, the energy of vertical  
continues with.  
Pockets of ash converted into diamond.  
Fewer and fewer  
puncture about another mode of decency.
