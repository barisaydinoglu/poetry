Breeding Sanguine Affection
---------------------------
Transforming a crown  
flew in the steady wind.  
The slender dignity of the pencil!  
The soul plan that has everyone clenched.  
A ship is not enough to wet me and keep me  
from the boulevard of your human epiphany.  
Return to the homeland of the starss in the sky.  
Once there was a pale astronaut who  
rescued at parties, sitting in a tetrahedron, among times.  
What we say rustles to  
reflect some other bride  
what a camera may teach.  
The honeysuckle crystallizes in kissing your leg.  
What we say seeks to  
perch some other gentleman  
what a metaphor may teach.  
  
A wind of forms a loaf of bread baked with morose sincerity and salt.
