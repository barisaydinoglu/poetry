The Complaint Fallen Into The Sea
---------------------------------
Not to refresh or even meet  
the school of one who inherits  
against me in a boulevard or entertaining to a custodian. One of them is cosmic,  
the other knows calculations.  
Where is noone  
she exclaims, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
I'd do it for the wheatfield in which you dawn  
for the wreaths of transparent you've connected.  
And meetings of crooked hips pity me and let my substance imbue.
