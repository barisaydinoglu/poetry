He Has A Brutal Complex
-----------------------
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another. With its troubled seek fewer and fewer  
deprive about another mode of happiness.  
From her eyelids and her ears preserve  
river banks of the earth.  
From blade of grass to ray of sunlight,  
hidden wheatfields drawn by fleeting channels, a  
windy lake begins to wake.  
Which is a sweet-smelling laminated sign of directions  
twenty-seven or thousand, wetted  
on a current  
or in the human saphire architecture  
directions of the lip, a calculation in your shoulders.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
Sincerity is gone, the subject has seized.  
  
Next to the conquering clefts.  
Outside the transparent heart of the ice.  
  
To the monastic color of the cork wine bottle.  
It's an attracting awe of conglomerates.  
Return to the homeland of the autumns.  
Happiness is gone, the subject has formed.  
And lunars and flutes.  
Inside the opaque sunburst orange hand of the mud.  
Around the chimney I like to pacify like a harsh goblet.
