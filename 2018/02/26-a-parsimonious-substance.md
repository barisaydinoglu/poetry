A Parsimonious Substance
------------------------
As  
if to execute or play or delude.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
One of them is full,  
the other knows antennae.  
Where is everybody  
she quips, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
The sunrise bells you in its mortal ice.  
I could rustle parallel wounded soldiers, torrent, and belt  
from goblets and coats  
with a dark fellowship  
with ashes in my shoulder.  
Our new juice, our affluent mosaic squares.  
Rescuing from phosphorus paper-mache.
