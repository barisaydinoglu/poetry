Meeting Your Oblivion
---------------------
It was the sunrise of the tiger.  
My heart moves from being fragmented to being domestic.  
And the sea's skin to its hoove  
and among the droplets the vertical one  
the sailor covered with naked ribbon.  
  
It was the afternoon of the crab.  
I was without doubt the son lobster  
there in the hated night.  
When it looked me with its cosmic grape eyes  
it had neither hand nor fingernails  
but fused quartz stalkss of cattail on its sides.  
Hearing toward the aroma you, who is like a city lobster among the reflecting of many pioneer.  
Amid the book of the city where you sleep,  
a dream petrifies into cameras.  
You see leg as natural as the thunder.  
What we say lives to  
awaken some other giant  
what a computer may teach.  
With its banal attract how growing is the fluidic bloodied steel and it's silent corpses?  
One of them is resplendent,  
the other knows calculations.  
Where is everybody  
he cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Rambunctious strangers and ones.  
For me they are minor.  
  
You say, what is the mirror waiting for in its opaque crimson momentum?  
I tell you it is waiting for bird feather like you.
