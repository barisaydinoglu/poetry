Custodians Of A Windy Country
-----------------------------
What is this projection but a memory punctured of its ribbons? Which is a dashing defender of directions  
million or thousand, flowed  
On  
a stars in the sky or in the warm saxophone  
directions of the brow, a calculation in your hearts.  
Because I love you, love, among the sky and with the clay.  
  
The vertical kis gave it love.  
The panic imposes nessecity.  
A fingernails and a eyelids  
creating the room.  
Sometimes a piece of the mud  
wipes like a precision in my heart.  
A harsh book day  
so the romantic tiredness lives on in a mango,  
the natural house of the evening star,  
the indespensable elixir that  
is parsimonious and sanguine.  
Pockets of rusted nail converted into chalk.  
What mysteries does the iguana contain?  
How little we appreciate and how much it trusts the funny things of this universe.
