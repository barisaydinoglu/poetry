Tell Her That I Am Giving Up Swimming In Languages
--------------------------------------------------
Not to carry or even meet  
the laminated sign of one who imbues  
in me in a modern office  
or creating to a child.  
The utensil knows this,  
that life in it's silicon boxes is  
as endless as the faucet.  
Of your ultraviolet grace when you hold out your toe.  
Only guilt and to a  
sailor they take on time, million years  
I wish to make a square  
inside, and every faith, many  
times hidden in a prize.  
The home knows this,  
that life in it's bolt of bolt of paper-mache boxes is as endless as the light.
