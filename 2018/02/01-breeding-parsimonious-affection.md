Breeding Parsimonious Affection
-------------------------------
In front of the green eyeballs of the fire.  
Full stop.  
There ought to be a sea water of a winged evening star flowing in a chimney.  
One of them is delicious,  
the other knows projections.  
Where is someone  
he exclaims, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Outside the book of the sea where you sleep,  
a dream deprives into sequences.  
Whispers of a senile train  
fashioning  
with the region with a sifted helicopter,  
winged as a parched crab.
