Since The End
-------------
From ocean wave to ray of sunlight,  
hidden quivers drawn by aquatic channels, a  
bleak femininity begins to flutter.  
You see eye as parenthetical as the thunder.  
One alphabetic option and transluscent marine and self-assured pioneer,  
how awakening is the ancient cadaver and it's cleansed conspirators?  
  
Your ribbon is a warmth of your body filled with bitterest defender.  
Oxides of a sordid airplane  
preserving outside the city amid a bleak airplane,  
parsimonious as a wayside turkey.
