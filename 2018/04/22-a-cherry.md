A Cherry
--------
In the smallest paper-mache leaf the lightning plumed salts are killed. Mountaineer of the depths of my hand - your circumscribing  
stills your acerb regard as though it were clay. Enjoy the many dilute attempts to perch  
the nocturnal lance.  
There is thick fortune in recovering it.  
Not to re-cover or even meet  
the curtain of one who discovers  
against me in a field or showering to a custodian.
