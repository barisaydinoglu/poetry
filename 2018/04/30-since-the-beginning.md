Since The Beginning
-------------------
The boulevard around hers  
a tale we tell in passing,  
with notions of pride  
and a passion  
for oceanography and mountaineering  
in the sea like rusted nail.  
Under the universe like graphite.  
The throat imposes nessecity.  
Realized secure sea shell  
realized fleeting splendor they are all sailors  
professional receptacles in whose incredulous beds originate.  
A gray and bruised telegraph is cracked in the area.  
I wish to make a quadrangle  
with, and every sense, many  
times hidden in a form.  
Fewer and fewer  
loiter  
about another mode of decency.  
  
Fractious weather, disordered lights like the forest.  
And you filtered in the illusion and continued a smearing ego.  
Not to preserve or even meet  
the starry sky  
of one who swims  
in me in a field or reflecting to a father.  
Return to the homeland of the necklaces.  
  
You - the winged arm.
