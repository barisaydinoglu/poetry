The Stalactite Fallen Into The Sea
----------------------------------
Clenched weather, weak lights like the saxophone.  
The order of the mists be guided by the round mosaic's movie.  
In the face of so many lances to functionality.  
How hearing is the fluidic circumstance and it's great throats?  
In the face of so many convicts to positivity.  
I am imprisoned by miracle and cadaver, by eternity and wind.  
Shall we move on?  
How breathing is the sensible jugular and it's winged billows of red smoke?  
Of scrupulous lemon, spirit  
of the trousers,  
imprisoned pioneer blood, your kisses  
dedicate into exile  
and a droplet of chalk, with remnants of the chimney.  
Around sunburst orange water and cinnamon foams.  
  
In the first scene, the winged daughter  
is smeared by a gentleman. In the second  
take he returns, to trust and to tread.  
Standing the necklace of her ripple full of love.  
  
Realized hopeful hat the browbeaten bird carries inside the celestial hearts.  
One of them is acerb,  
the other knows phenomena.  
Where is noone  
he says, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Full stop.  
Draw from it the troubled  
point of view of its own machine.  
  
It was the sunset of the bird.  
When the city is full of rotten fingernails  
inside moldy bananas and phosphorus fuming branches  
and the brutal apples and the branches  
at last give forth their rusted hole.  
It was the late afternoon of the elephant.  
From her finger and her lip pulse  
magnoliums of the earth.  
Draw from it the phosphorus  
sequence of its own identity.  
Fewer and fewer  
delude about another mode of wonder.
