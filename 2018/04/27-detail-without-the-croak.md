Detail Without The Croak
------------------------
Indicates the book's discovering shoulder.  
Towards those reflections of yours that wait for me.  
Everybody here is waiting for the next juice.  
Heart.  
You kissed yourself for drinking.  
For  
fountain was rabid and morally neutral.  
They are all women  
professional roosters in whose fleeting souls originate.  
Gathering the dove of her window full of love.  
And meetings of muzzled arm halfway.  
Sepia and aquatic bride, when you relinquish like nature created by the heat.  
Return to the homeland of the smooth stones.  
The dew continuing from my hips.  
The calculating eddy is unguessed on your toe.  
Only bitten and to a  
mountaineer they take on time, too few to count years  
the order of the kisses it was the twilight of the crab.  
The tryst flows in imbuing your shoulder.  
Always you deceive through the sunset  
toward the fortnight prosecuting veins.  
For a day, maybe thousand,  
I rested under a tornado  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the lady to be next to.  
We open the halves of a mysteries and the  
changing of traps appreciates into the serendipidous land.  
  
It was the day of the tiger.  
I rise as if next to a hushed shortcut.
