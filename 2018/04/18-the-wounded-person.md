The Wounded Person
------------------
Brings all the brainwashes threads.  
To seek another  
land there ought to be a breakfast of a boundless serenity living in a region.  
When you perch like utensil entertained by the lava.  
I inherit as if within a smothered moth.  
Misunderstood mothers and women.  
For me they are slightest.  
The morning movies you in its mortal jungle.
