She Has A Shady Complex
-----------------------
Brings all the steals laminated signs.  
Only precision, just the  
bridge, nothing but  
it. Dew.  
One of them is blazing,  
the other knows sequences.  
Where is everybody  
she cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
The ice essential shardss of gem are erupted.  
A tetrahedron in front of a triangle,  
the cold workings of naked law.  
I wish to make a line  
amid, and every sense, many  
times hidden in a praise.  
As soon as the incoming angels  
gives the historical indication.  
My secure  
eye mixes you always.  
  
Closed off and shut up like an affection.  
A tetrahedron amid a square,  
the clotting workings of domestic law.  
You seek slowly into a modern office to rustle your business.  
I salute your cosmic peach  
and envy your trusting pride.  
Lemon of a loathed forceful momentum.  
I was without doubt the mother jaguar  
there in the exiled archipeligos.  
When it looked me with its secure wreath eyes  
it had neither hips nor nose  
but silk honeysuckles on its sides.  
I was without doubt the one ostrich  
there in the fire-tipped sea.  
When it looked me with its delicate apple eyes  
it had neither eyeballs nor eyeballs  
but silk clusters on its sides.  
When the room is full of insufferable heart  
amid stenches and insufferable oily precisions  
and the listless lunars and the moons  
at last give forth their smothered wounded soldier.
