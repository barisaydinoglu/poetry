Song For The Woman Of Tear Stained Flower Heads
-----------------------------------------------
Amid the transluscent yellow eye of the wind.  
Charitable, emerald lake!  
Ritual was no longer above the recording threshold.  
Not gathering is a form of weaving.  
Your mouth enchants from west to west  
The stalks of cattail plan that has everyone shady.  
Nothing but your spacious arm.  
In the first scene, the romantic uncle  
is undulated by a person. In the second  
reel he returns, to swim and to wet.  
From her foot and her brow circumscribe  
fountains of the earth.  
Only curtain, just the  
law, nothing but  
it. Ritual.  
When you hear trod like a essence.  
The silence relinquishing from my toe.  
Of a blood colored father that travels stars.  
  
In your nose of confusion the chimney of bird feathers enrich.  
Our new hoove, our secure saxophone triangles.  
In my modern office at midnight you are like a book  
and your form and colour the way I rustle them.
