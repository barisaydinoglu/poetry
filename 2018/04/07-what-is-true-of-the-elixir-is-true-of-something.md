What Is True Of The Elixir Is True Of Something
-----------------------------------------------
Once there  
was a bruised father who  
upgraded at parties, sitting in a line, among mosaics. Rabid beasts and wounded moldy bananas. The coral carries in dedicating your heart.  
A quadrangle with a line,  
the smothered workings of mineral law.  
Some develop but I inherit your aluminum like dew.  
If you were not the wine the perfect moon  
cooks, sprinkling its apple across the modern office.
