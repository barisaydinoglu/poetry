Nauesous Love
-------------
My noble tail relinquishes you always.  
Come with me to the bone of clefts.  
Light.  
Silvery lightning to my distorted ship!  
For smooth ash was rabid and morally neutral.  
What velvety waves -  
the jungle is filled with  
it,  
laminated signs for the umbrella and the morbid diamond.  
Enjoy the many cold attempts to set  
The human lard.  
There is eager fortune in swimming it.
