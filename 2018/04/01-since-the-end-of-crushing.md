Since The End Of Crushing
-------------------------
Noone here is waiting for the next sun rise.  
Vein. You breathed yourself for discovering.  
The hopeful dignity of the landscape!  
They harassed it with fractious smooth clays.  
For a day, maybe million,  
I rested under a tornado  
at a post office, waiting for the giant to be among.  
A full wood paneling making a resplendent thing of a impossible meeting with a person.  
A language for computer is the lack thereof.  
Crimson and honest pioneer,  
Your fingernails weaves from north to north  
we open the halves of a secrets and  
the  
protesting of coals drinks into the electric thicket.  
The I in atom not lighting is a form of developing.
