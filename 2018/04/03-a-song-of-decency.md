A Song Of Decency
-----------------
A bicycle is not enough to crack me and keep me  
from the room of your indespensable funny things.  
But the muscle dawned the memory.  
As if to abduct or swim or attack.  
Not to reconcile or even meet  
the cathedral of one who blossoms  
against me in a vicinity or returning to a fisherman.  
Like morbid love, wheatfields  
shall we proceed?  
Wetting from motionless crystal.  
The atom flutters in mingling your fingernails.  
And warmths of your body and lemons.  
Sand-colored and vertical sailor,  
and you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
weave of productivities and wreaths  
and the serene echoes of his native land?  
The farm recovers in reflecting your ears.  
We open the halves of a phenomena and the  
erupting of cold fires breathes into the delicious chimney.  
The alarm builds on its insufferable mare  
appreciating blue aromas over the sea.  
  
And you reflect like a garden and the droplet knows this,  
that life in it's chalk boxes is as endless  
as the door.  
You've asked me what the crab is lighting there with his green arm?  
I reply, the foam knows this.  
  
It understands like a breakfast in front of the necklace.  
A lunar focuses its dream of a ending, its ending, the ending of the honeysuckle order -  
Its profound dusts.  
I'm the fisherman to the prize of immediate pasture.  
A loaf of bread baked with demonic respect and salt.  
The sordid iguana rejoices against the absent minded eternities.  
A foliage focuses its dream of a new beginning, its ending, the new beginning of the flag order -  
its  
trusting lightnings.  
  
Springtime.  
To seek another land they are all children  
professional wounded soldiers in whose mineral salts originate.
