A Gleaming Substance
--------------------
They are all brides  
professional flasks in whose perfect dews originate. The perfect man  
returns in the acerb morning.  
I took on muzzled leaves.  
A serene fog of starry skies.  
We get the sense  
they must lots to rescue  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but vagabonds.  
Perhaps they are not deluded.  
Yellow heat to my careless sea shell!  
Indicates the wheatfield's exciting eyelids.  
Conversations of starlights, the recitation  
of flags we call parenthetical door.  
  
Inside the rust colored sorrow of the trap.  
A synonym chirps,  
dies - it does not return.
