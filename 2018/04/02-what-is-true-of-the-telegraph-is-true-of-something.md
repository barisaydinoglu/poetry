What Is True Of The Telegraph Is True Of Something
--------------------------------------------------
A loaf of bread baked with acidulous love and salt. I build as if within an arrogant lance.  
This  
barbaous flag and refreshing awe pities me  
with it's steady writings like leg and hips  
and turqoise lunars like shoulder and telegraphs.  
Because I love you, love, around the clay and in front of the sky.  
Green clay to my frail film!  
Pockets of sand converted into ivory.  
I could inherit lard, phlegm, and error  
from warmths and manes  
with a dark planetarium  
with nougats in my finger.  
A ironous synonym brainwashes  
even the sensible  
technical night in synonym  
to which the metaphor  
will not be wetted.  
Outside the red anger of the shadow.  
The pioneer smiles at the child  
but the astronaut does not smile  
when he looks at the jaguar mountaineer  
and the ghostly ocean.  
And a fire-tipped drop's electricity will grow you.  
Which is a myriad awe of directions  
too few to count or twenty-seven, began  
on a splendor or in the monastic landscape  
directions of the foot, a calculation in your eyeballss.  
Around the area I like to conduct like a weak muscle.  
Of your brimstone drop when you hold out your heart.  
  
When you preserve enriched like a lunar.  
The irreducable dignity of the lighthouse!
