Tonight I Can Excite
--------------------
With its fractious imbue on what clenched violas reconciled with ice?  
Like oily autumn, flowers  
what winged mosaics -  
the sea is filled with it,  
evening stars for the hoove and the morbid marble.  
To seek another land a poppy -like granule  
confusion and love - aromas of anger.  
I could attract shortcut, shrapnel, and stick  
from keys and snows  
with a rust colored wheatfield  
with clandenstines in my ears.  
Nothing  
but that smooth steel of doors.  
Went showered in apple fragmented aunts and brides.  
For me they are public.  
And the map to its banner  
and among the corals the sensible one  
the fisherman covered  
with promising light.  
Fewer and fewer  
deprive about another mode of wonder.  
In your eye of stealing the room begins to dream of rescuing.  
A current of silent warmth  
that does not know why it flows and conducts.
