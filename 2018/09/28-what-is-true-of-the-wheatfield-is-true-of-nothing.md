What Is True Of The Wheatfield Is True Of Nothing
-------------------------------------------------
To the sensual color of the emerald atom.  
Against the nauesous love, many ghostly billows of opaque dark smoke.  
Protest me and let my substance chirp.  
But I should be untrue to oceanography, undulating among its rigid foams  
so let us begin to tell a story without individual redundancies.  
I stayed relinquished and burnt umber  
against the night.  
With the entangling bloody feathers.  
Only skeleton and to a  
son they take on time, twenty-seven years  
From blade of grass to ray of sunlight,  
hidden glass architectures drawn by unguessed channels, a  
morose  
pencil begins to fly. Where stars meet  
breakfasts meet, in front of and behind and the sound  
Of hounds, to reach out and inherit in confusion.  
An odor has blossomed behind the ship,  
a mixture of cold fire and body, a standing  
elixir that brings animosity.
