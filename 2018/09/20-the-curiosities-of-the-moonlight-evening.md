The Curiosities Of The Moonlight Evening
----------------------------------------
Always you deceive through the day  
toward the sunset depriving coats.  
I was without doubt the man crab  
there in the absurd heights.  
When it looked me with its iridescent autumn eyes  
it had neither tail nor heart  
but fused quartz smooth metals on its sides.  
The order of the forests the slender dignity of the quiver!  
A somber drizzle of precisions.  
If I could perch the cubicle and the sea.  
Around deep brown water  
and deep brown silences.  
My humble shoulder perches you always.
