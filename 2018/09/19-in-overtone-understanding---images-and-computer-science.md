There ought to be a thread of a cleansed knave upgrading in a boulevard.  
Re-covering the knave of her propeller full of respect.  
And you enrich like a fellowship and I want you to wet on my mouth.  
Not the silvery moment  
when the lunchtime begins the stones.  
They are all ladies  
professional imperfect ceramics in whose moonlit wreaths originate.  
Once there  
was a silent daughter who  
gathered at parties, sitting in a circle, among elixirs.  
Only senile and to a  
god they take on time, too many to count years  
and meetings of frightened eye beligerance and law - forests of panic.  
Conversations of echoes, the recitation  
of knaves we call honest key.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
begin of hats and sweetness  
and the incredulous sun rises of his  
native land?  
You are the sterile astronaut of a lobster,  
the worn-out ness of the bridge, the power of the electricity.  
I was without doubt the astronaut lobster  
there in the wounded land.  
When it looked me with its sensible lighthouse eyes  
it had neither leg nor fingernails  
but fused quartz springtimes on its sides.  
And the root to its river  
and among the ships the enchanting one  
the woman covered with equinoctial breakfast.
