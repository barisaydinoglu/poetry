Your Nose Is Enough
-------------------
Draw from it the parched  
point of view of its own image.  
I was without doubt the mother bird  
there in the worn-out heights.  
When it looked me with its musical shoreline eyes  
it had neither fingernails nor brow  
but copper souls on its sides.  
The neon atom that shines in your tryst.  
Behind the rabid flag, many harsh darkness.  
Of your red shades of crimson when you hold out your heart.  
To the soft color of the paper-mache quiver.  
Brandishing, saphire marble architecture!  
My heart  
is  
filled with honor like a marble railroad track.  
We  
get the meaning  
they must lots to reconcile  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but whispers.  
Perhaps they are not mutated.  
Here I am, a wonderful eye replaced in the vicinity of grape.  
Atrocious mothers and goddesses.  
For me they are minor.  
To the free color of the crystal map.  
  
In the face of so many vagabonds to functionality.  
I want you to flow on my ears.  
  
Always you abduct through the morning  
toward the day executing roses.  
And meetings of boney heart nothing  
but your thick brow.  
You see curves as affluent as the sunshine.  
If you were not the nectarine the free moon  
cooks, sprinkling its bread across the jungle.  
A finger and a lip  
conducting the sea.  
Behind the dead jungle of barbaous garden.  
  
An odor has connected under the ship,  
a mixture of stick and body, a preserving  
autumn that brings embarassement.  
In the first take, the unguessed giant  
is entangled by a goddess. In the second  
scene he returns, to relinquish and to crystallize.  
Attract on the nights that wait for you  
chaining the boney chairs, freezing the doors.  
Brings all the chains paths.
