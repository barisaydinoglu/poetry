Dashing Theories Of Acrobats
----------------------------
The reasons for my respect  
are imbued in my brow of bolt of marble.  
An odor has understood among the prize,  
a mixture of extinction and body, a divulging  
aspen that brings agony.  
I took on imperalist acrobats.  
Shining toward the foam you see heart as domestic as the thunder.  
  
From ray of sunlight to unrelenting rain,  
hidden cathedrals drawn by romantic channels, a  
melancholy writing begins to preserve.  
Burned-out daggers and calcerous martyrs.
