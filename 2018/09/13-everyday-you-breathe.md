Everyday You Breathe
--------------------
Amid the deep brown eyelids of the wind.  
Enriching a guitar  
loved in the ancient mist.  
Around the maternity of the sea where  
you sleep,  
a dream silences into projections.  
There ought to be a wreath of a secure fragrance of strawberry responding in a moonlight evening.  
You begin in the boulevard as in a myriad sea.  
This fuming precision and rising starlight petrifies me  
with it's enduring smooth ashes like lip and  
mouth  
and red jars like eyelids and energies.  
Realized full stars in the sky brutal men and women.  
For me they are algorithmic.  
A hairy projection petrifies  
even the verdure  
alphabetic land in phenomenon  
to which the metaphor  
will not be trusted.  
They are all mothers  
professional legumes in whose steady suns originate.
