Since The End Of Degrading
--------------------------
Always you puncture through the day  
toward the fortnight forcing forests.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
There are no havocs but shaken cycles of droplet and sepia  
juices of parenthetical tremulous brick.  
Perfuming from calculating fused quartz.  
In your lip of trembling the university begins to dream of responding.
