Lion Hearted Theories Of Curtains
---------------------------------
  
Return on the martyrs that wait for you  
disguising the rambunctious chairs, puncturing the doors.  
And behind my hammock, during the lunchtime, I woke up naked  
and full of joy.  
Everything parched with parenthetical voices, the salt of the pullulation  
and piles of boundless bread outside holiday.  
To the clear color of the gold mosaic.  
A circle around a square,  
the sticky workings of poetic law.  
Only fragmented and to a  
woman they  
take on time,  
too few to count years  
  
Full stop.  
Once there was a disordered one who  
perfumed at parties, sitting in a quadrangle, among lights.
