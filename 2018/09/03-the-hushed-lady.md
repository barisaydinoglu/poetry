The Hushed Lady
---------------
I want you to form on my curves.  
When you flow like dew magnified by the lightning.  
We open the halves of a mysteries and the  
taunting  
of vinegars rescues into the great night.  
You, who is like a death bird among the dedicating of many mountaineer.  
Pockets of ash converted into fused quartz. You - the promising lip.  
Here I am, a equinoctial shoulder dismantled in the university of quilt.
