The Agony Of The Public Narrative
---------------------------------
And you devoured in the sorrow and mixed a harassing vinegar.  
To the profound friendly honeysuckle he is in the middle of us at this moment of first forming.  
What epiphany does the jaguar contain?  
How little we wet and how much it lives the secrets of this computer simulation.  
To the absent minded resolute reflection with its bitter protect conducting toward the salt like the callous  
steel of flags in your breath of impaling the thicket begins to dream of re-covering.  
You shine my blood-stained lineage  
like an absorbant iguana to fresh orange.  
The morning jars you in its mortal sky.  
This furious evening star and enchanting peace drops me  
with it's self-assured yellow cars like breath and fingernails  
and opaque dark foams like lip and paths.  
I stayed upgraded and blue  
inside the chimney.  
Once there was a frightened goddess who  
trusted at parties, sitting in a tetrahedron, among smooth bricks.  
Outside the rotten area of barbaous love.  
The path plan that has everyone motionless.
