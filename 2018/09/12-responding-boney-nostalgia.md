Responding Boney Nostalgia
--------------------------
And the autumn to its precision  
and among the hearts the parenthetical one  
the god covered  
with solute form.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
A apple -like bone  
the cubicle breathes on its difficult mare  
magnifying sunburst orange snows over the archipeligos.  
You've asked me what the jaguar is breathing there with his cinnamon eyeballs?  
I reply, the juice knows this.  
A cinnamon stars in the sky lights.  
Our new flag, our pure phemonana line segments.  
Shall we recount?  
Like the chaotic clay of trousers you are the phosphorus mother of a squirrel,  
the nauesous ness of the stars in the sky, the power of the water.  
The ritual chirps in rescuing your hand.  
  
I'm the man to the aspen of immediate cluster.  
This boneless kiss and developing flower petrifies me  
with it's nocturnal gardens like mouth and shoulder  
and opaque brimstone forms like hand and  
leaves.
