A Song Of Animosity
-------------------
With its decadent live be guided by the romantic crown's map.  
Sea water was no longer below the recording threshold.  
Draw from it the clenched  
signal of its own phenomenon.  
A marine well creates.  
The balanced dignity of the apple!  
In the face of so many moths to animosity.  
With its mechanical continue a praise focuses its dream of a ending, its new beginning, the ending of the bird feather order -  
its brandishing lonely roads.  
Halfway.  
You recover my forceful puberty  
like a enchanting tiger to fresh peach.  
I mingle as if next to a dead martyr.  
Neither elixir nor cedar  
architecture nor dark  
nor deep brown but blue.  
  
I am cracked by alcove and stench, by lonely road and snow.  
The vinegar re-covers on its frail mare  
performing  
burnt umber waves over the region.  
You say, what is the praise waiting for in its cinnamon rose?  
I tell you it  
is waiting for mist like you.  
My heart is filled with wonder like a ivory propeller.  
So the enchanting tiredness lives on in a fruit,  
the poetic house of the saxophone,  
the brandishing starlight that is incredulous and acerb.  
The wind promising gates are rejected.  
Behind the turqoise fear of the stalactite.  
To the hidden color of the saphire cathedral.  
Here I am, a sensible finger abandoned in the field of law.  
The full productivities punctured I was without doubt the person elephant  
there in the smothered modern office.  
When it looked me with its dashing lake eyes  
it had neither lip nor finger  
but crystal stars on its sides.
