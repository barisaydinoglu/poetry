Here I Hear You
---------------
And the branch to its hat  
and among the fragrances of strawberry the poetic one  
the elder covered with solute praise.  
To the secure color of the crystal hat.  
If you were not the plum the parsimonious moon  
cooks, sprinkling its nectarine across the room.  
Brings all the undulates cork architectures.  
There are no imperfect corks but difficult cycles of mist and yellow  
grapes of electrical delirious steel.  
Shone and then set in the room.  
In your arm of fear the chimney of starry skies hear.
