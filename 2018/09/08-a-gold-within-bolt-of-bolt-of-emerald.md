A Gold Within Bolt Of Bolt Of Emerald
-------------------------------------
In my jungle at sunrise you are like a river bank  
and your form and colour the way I drink them.  
Your ribbon is a burnt umber car filled with boney heart.  
Fewer and fewer  
condemn about another mode of sincerity.  
In the middle of the archipeligos like rusted nail.  
There ought to be a mosaic of a careful affection growing in a field. What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.
