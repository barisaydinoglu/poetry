Feeling Is An Episode Of Wound
------------------------------
The lava wonderful cold fires are throttled. We open the halves of a phenomena and the  
pampering of corruptions blossoms into the indespensable jungle.  
And a rabid apple's electricity will connect you.  
And you hear like a pasture and in your eyelids of beligerance the jungle of railroad tracks hear.
