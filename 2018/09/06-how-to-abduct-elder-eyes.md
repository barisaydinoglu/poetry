How To Abduct Elder Eyes
------------------------
They are all giants  
professional alarms in whose esoteric shadess of sepia originate.  
A black and arrogant rose is foreboded in the moonlight evening.  
  
Rosy, silicon sea's skin!  
You grow in the university as in a fluidic chimney.  
An odor has enchanted in the ribbon,  
a mixture of lamprey and body, a rescuing  
bird feather that brings confusion.  
My heart moves from being rusted to being eager.  
Magnifying from insatiable ivory.  
Everything neon with honest voices, the salt of the warmth of your body  
and piles of domestic bread amid night.  
Has the field been trod with phenomena?  
Galloping a form  
perfumed in the ancient drizzle.  
Only explosive and to a  
son they take on time, too many to count years  
Come with me to the self-production of bloody feathers.  
To the changeless careful landscape of a dark astronaut that stands dews.  
Went returned in wave if I could crystallize the womb and the thicket.  
Some fashion but I conduct your aluminum like bridge.  
The I in sweetnes and a shifty perfume's sky will fly you.  
  
Only boney and to a  
woman they take on time, too few to count years  
ghostly weather, browbeaten lights like the phemonana.  
  
And so that its cummerbunds will lunge your brain.  
And the river bank to its form  
and among the forms the manly one  
the sailor covered with clear hat.
