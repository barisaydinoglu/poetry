There Is No Acid
----------------
I took on lethargic bridges.  
The forceful sun rise is great on your mouth.  
Towards those springtimes of yours that wait for me.  
Not standing is a form  
of wetting.  
A faucet discovering will discover  
the delirious lava of a planet.  
So the arcane purity lives on in a tomato,  
the homogeneous house of the atom,  
the pure grace that is affluent and wide.  
The order of the keys elder of the depths of my ears - your re-covering  
stills your boundless regard as though it were jungle.  
A machine makes,  
condemns - it does not return.  
The mosaic plan that has everyone calculating.  
In your shoulder of passing the night begins to dream of reflecting.
