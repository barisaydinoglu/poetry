Every Fisherman Is A Computer

I'd do it for the momentum in which you refresh  
for the spheres of sunburst  
orange you've heard. You circumscribe in the sea as in a hidden vicinity.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
The aspen plan that has everyone nauesous.  
What soft mirrors -  
the divisions is filled with it,  
bells for the book and the arrogant silicon.  
Full, cedar energy!  
A loaf of bread baked with listless love and salt.
