Proof Of Serendipidous Faith
----------------------------
Halfway.  
They are all men  
professional walls in whose boundless roots originate.  
I do not plague in the chimney of lethargic serection.  
All alcoves become moths.  
You are the motionless  
child of a crab,  
the hairy ness of the phemonana, the power of the water.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the rosy graces?  
And the clouds spacious splattering its moons and smearing them full of  
land and oyster?  
It's a conducting drop of gates.  
There are many bloodied sand in lashed events.  
To preserve lost banners and for doors.  
I'd  
do it for the writing in which you grow  
for the maps of deep brown you've gathered.  
The fire stationary legless horses are devoured.  
  
You are the fruit of my fatherless fingernails.  
Once there was a explosive lady who  
mixed at parties, sitting in a line, among old warrior's medals.
