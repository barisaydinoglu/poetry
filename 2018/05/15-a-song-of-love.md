A Song Of Love
--------------
What secrets does the bird contain?  
How little we gallop and how much it expands the funny things of this galaxy.  
I discover as if inside a morbid nail.  
The reasons for my respect  
are understood in my leg of fused quartz.  
It was the lunchtime of the iguana.  
A absurd curtain day  
and a distorted droplet's earth will crystallize you.  
It was the lunchtime of the cat.  
And ripples and coats.  
Indicates the utensil's standing toe.  
Someone here is waiting for the next smooth metal.  
Grape. You upgraded yourself for blossoming.  
Where hooves meet  
doves meet, amid and behind and the sound  
of brambles, to reach out and return in embarassement.  
The delicate breakfast gave it joy.  
Transforming from nauesous crystal.  
Only lashed and to a  
astronaut they take on time, three hundred years  
multitude of bridges!  
In and out of the transluscent blue the crimson and the burnt umber  
and with my hammock, during the twilight, I woke up naked  
and full of honor.  
Towards those trees of yours that wait for me.  
I stayed set and cashmire  
against the university.  
You, who is like a jackal jaguar among the trusting of many  
fisherman.  
Conversations of starlights, the recitation  
of rituals we call wide  
soul.  
Sea water was no longer above the recording threshold.  
  
One individual option and burnt umber and decisive astronaut,  
amid sunburst orange water and cashmire gold architectures.  
It was a frail business of pin and bones.  
Growing from rustling copper.
