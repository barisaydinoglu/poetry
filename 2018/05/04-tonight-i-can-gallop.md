Tonight I Can Gallop
--------------------
The scrupulous bells coddled as if to execute or preserve or fall. Bridge of a pampered forceful branch.  
In the smallest wooden telegraph I'd do it for the cathedral in which you recover  
for the springtimes of burnt umber you've recovered.  
  
The fragmented affection is perfect on your toe.  
The boulevard behind hers  
a story we divulge in passing,  
with notions of love  
and  
a passion for jouranlism and oceanography
