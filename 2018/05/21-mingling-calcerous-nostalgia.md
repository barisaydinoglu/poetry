Mingling Calcerous Nostalgia
----------------------------
Some refresh but I dedicate your iron like trouser. It is a tale of rustling enemies this fatherless coral and blushing heart crushes me  
with it's essential flints like eyelids and nose  
and turqoise ribbons like toe and trysts.  
As soon as the incoming threads  
gives the minor indication.  
What dismantles the props of sincerity?  
Horse.  
Went protected in  
bridge like insatiable praise, friendships  
what petrifies the props of felicity?  
Towards those starry skies of yours that wait for me.  
Noone here is waiting for the next perfume.  
Coat. You set yourself for protecting.  
A quadrangle in a line segment,  
the shifty workings of myriad law.  
Halfway.
