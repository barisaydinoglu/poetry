The Computer Called The Curves
------------------------------
For farm was callous and morally  
positive.  
The tryst plan that has everyone fire-tipped.  
A ship is not enough to throttle me and keep me  
from the divisions of your romantic phenomena.  
And echoes and lights.  
Imbuing the poppy of her candle full of wonder.  
Rising a snow  
breathed in the aquatic thunder.  
Sodden me and let  
my substance perch.
