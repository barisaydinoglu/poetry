A Fountain To Store The Books You Flutter
-----------------------------------------
There are many nails with clenched events. The heat sensible roosters are deformed.  
Of your ultraviolet perfume when you hold out your eye.  
Draw from it the delirious  
computer of its own phenomenon.  
If I could crystallize the pamphlet and the land.  
Carry me onto your raft - the apple of my candle -  
like molested propeller, momenta  
abyss of a distorted wheel  
discovering in front of the land inside a boney vessel,  
plumed as a guilt crab.  
It is a tale of dilute shrapnels it is a tale of demonic dominions of a black aunt that expands femininities.  
I'm the daughter to the home of immediate perfume.  
Shine on the parallel conglomeratess that wait for you  
smearing the violenet chairs, forcing the doors.
