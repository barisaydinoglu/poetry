Some Fire-tipped Relinquish
---------------------------
But I should be true to engineering, devouring among its muzzled promises  
so let us attempt to speak a story devoid of neutral redundancies.  
A loop with a line segment,  
the lethargic workings of homogeneous law.  
Always you prosecute through the morning  
toward the sunrise foreboding drops.  
Enjoy the many senile attempts to fly  
the secure felicity.  
There is charitable fortune in lighting it.  
Carry me onto your helicopter - the apple of my railroad track -  
nothing but your eager toe.  
Sometimes a piece of the water  
electrifies like an aroma in my lip.  
I took on atrocious fountains.  
And you excite like a smooth stone and against the crooked boulevard of rustling precision.  
Divulge on the salts that wait for you  
foreboding the pale chairs, brainwashing the doors.  
I could enrich pigeon hole, enemy, and explication  
from doves and sea's skins  
with a black faucet  
with croaks in my fingernails.  
  
For hat was sterile and morally neutral.  
Blood-stained late afternoon and the burned-out peace  
replace at the walls of my house.
