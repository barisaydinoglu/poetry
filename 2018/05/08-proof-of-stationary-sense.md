Proof Of Stationary Sense
-------------------------
Original, saphire key!  
Draw from it the burned-out  
phenomenon  
of its own metaphor.  
Spoiled sunrise and the directionless vein  
mutate at the walls of my house.  
The reasons for my respect  
are blushed in my ears of paper-mache.  
A language imbues,  
strikes - it does not return.  
Entertaining a tiger  
pacified in the blazing fog.  
Like the torrential graphite of rituals a goblet mixing will promise  
the wounded fire of a planet.  
Not promising is a form of perching.  
My heart is filled with felicity like a paper-mache splendor.  
And in front of my hammock, during the twilight, I woke up naked  
and full of wonder.  
It is a tale of shady wounds you mix my inevitable howl  
like a changeless iguana to fresh sugar.  
  
If you were not the orange the domestic moon  
cooks, sprinkling its apple across the room.  
Not storing is a form of storing.  
Enjoy the many troubled attempts to flutter  
the great lonely road.  
There is naked fortune in inheriting it.  
What is this phenomenon but a memory fell of its flowers?  
  
One of them is lion hearted,  
the other knows identities.  
Where is somebody  
he cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
You see curves as somber as the fog.
