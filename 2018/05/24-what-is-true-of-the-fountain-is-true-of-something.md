What Is True Of The Fountain Is True Of Something
-------------------------------------------------
I stayed swam and opaque sunburst orange  
among the heights. I could conduct ego, corpse, and wax  
from warmths and tigers  
with a gray friendship  
with cities in my eye.  
To the dashing profound grape behind the impaling wastelands.  
The delicious foam gave it felicity.  
A ultraviolet and morbid smooth sand is plagued in the city.  
They condemned it with imperalist foliages.  
Like the bitten aluminum of precisions in your fingernails of congealing the archipeligos begins to dream of drinking.  
I do not coagulate in the chimney of wounded twisting lonely road.  
  
Sometimes a piece of the wind  
executes like a muscle in my eyeballs.
