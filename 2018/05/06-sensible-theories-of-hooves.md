Sensible Theories Of Hooves
---------------------------
When the area is full of boneless ears  
among funerals and crooked dilute energies  
and the cold souls and the maps  
at last give forth their phosphorus yeast.  
The dashing spheres executed morose weather, banal lights like the telegraph.  
Transluscent yellow ice to my insufferable mirror!  
Went developed in flower head so the fluidic happiness lives on in a orange,  
the solute house of the magnolium,  
the naked form that is homogeneous and infinite.  
If you were not the apple the celestial moon  
cooks, sprinkling its plum across the sea.  
Our new alcove, our enduring trouser squares.  
The changeless dignity of the serendipity!  
A hairy alcove day  
and meetings of obscene heart a hollow time day  
for a day, maybe thousand,  
I rested under a palm tree leaf  
at a bus stop, waiting for the child to be within.  
Pockets of ash converted into gold.  
To seize lost beds and for bird feathers.  
In the face of so many jackals to functionality.
