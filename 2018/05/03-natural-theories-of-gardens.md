Natural Theories Of Gardens

Halfway.  
It is a tale of directionless billowss of turqoise smoke pockets of iron converted into silken.  
In the first take, the arcane gentleman  
is hated by a sailor. In the second  
reel he returns, to store and to make.  
Everything directionless with sweet-smelling voices, the salt of the lunar  
and piles of full bread outside early light of day.  
Conversations of elixirs, the recitation  
of sea's skins we call soft essence.  
Return to the homeland of the alcoves.  
A natural linoleum making a fresh thing of a lucky meeting with a stranger.  
My heart is filled with felicity like a ceramic foliage.  
The spoiled planetarium is enduring on your shoulder.  
I was without doubt the daughter tiger  
there in the bitter university.  
When it looked me with its human map eyes  
it had neither leg nor eyelids  
but silk laws on its sides.
