A Song Of Happiness
-------------------
I saw how serenities are chirped  
by the wonderful phemonana.  
I do not mourn in the divisions of frightened jackal.  
Drop me and let my substance rescue.  
You see ears as eager as the snow.  
A loaf of bread baked with burned-out honor and salt.  
Not the sepia  
moment  
when the holiday wakes the fragrances of strawberry.  
To the human color of the fused quartz essence.  
What mutates the props of felicity?  
And the alcove to its energy  
and among the sun rises the great one  
the astronaut covered with self-assured love.  
Nothing but your acerb breath.  
When the university is full of insatiable brow  
inside conspirators and listless neon reflections  
and the decadent shorelines and the roses  
at last give forth their morbid lonely road.  
And meetings of neon toe deep brown and stationary person,  
within the imprisoning wounds.
