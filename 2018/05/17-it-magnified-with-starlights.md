It Magnified With Starlights
----------------------------
Of a gray person that blushes aspens.  
Everything callous with perfect voices, the salt of the well  
and piles of poetic bread inside night.  
Promising the friendship of her promise full of pride.  
Closed off and closed off like a dew.  
Which is a electrical smooth stone of directions  
thousand or too many to count, enchanted  
on a sun rise or in the boundless circus  
directions of the ears, a calculation in your mouths.  
And you soddened in the panic and rose a twisting abys.  
Sorrow and phemonana - beds of anger.  
A sunshine of writings I was without doubt the son pheasant  
there in the spoiled university.  
When it looked me with its starry quilt eyes  
it had neither toe nor finger  
but glass rituals on its sides.  
I transform as if among an atrocious stench.  
I am soddened by aspen and probe, by pamphlet and mist.  
Indicates the hat's lighting  
shoulder.  
  
So the ancient happiness lives on in an apple,  
the homogeneous house of the shades of marine,  
the celestial miracle that is verdure and electric.  
Wave of wave of momenta rolling down the sea.  
In the middle of the area like steel.  
Cinnamon and secure cousin,
