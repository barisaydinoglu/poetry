Here I Appreciate You
---------------------
Of cordial orange, spirit  
of the curtains,  
chained one blood,  
your kisses  
flutter into exile  
and a droplet of paper-mache, with remnants of the area.  
Our new map, our original hat loops.  
When the night is full of thirsty mouth  
amid bloods and ghostly fractious salts  
and the parched fragrances of strawberry and the transparent lakes  
at last give forth their mechanical corpse.  
She is behind us at this moment of first conducting.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
refresh of ribbons and flags  
and the decisive flints of his native land?  
There are no moths but misunderstood cycles of banner and marine  
hats of domestic wet-winged clay.  
Of a dull shades of green sailor that pulses prizes.  
The sweetnes builds in gathering your ears.  
I do not forebode in the jungle of disordered clandenstine.  
A loaf of bread baked with hated tiredness and salt.  
The promise plan that has everyone calculating.  
  
Beligerance and bottle - angels of panic.  
The noble smooth stone gave it sincerity.
