Absorbant Theories Of Landscapes
--------------------------------
Nothing but that flint of ships. Phosphorus weather, misunderstood lights like the mane.  
I stayed transformed and sunburst orange  
inside the night.  
A melancholy metaphor bristles  
even the rosy  
algorithmic field in inscription  
to which the metaphor  
will not be built.  
Has the area been imbued with secrets?  
I do not crack in the field of rotten massacre.  
Of a blood colored son that swims propellers.  
In the middle of the heights like brick.  
A tetrahedron with a quadrangle,  
the shifty workings of fluidic law.
