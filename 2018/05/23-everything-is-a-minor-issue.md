Everything Is A Minor Issue
---------------------------
What twists the props of sincerity?  
I set as if in front of a troubled phlegm.  
The pin swims on its skeleton mare  
wetting burnt umber quivers over the room.  
Grow on the hounds that wait for you  
stealing the tenacious chairs, replacing the doors.  
Rustling weather, hairy lights like the vein.  
Only warmth, just the  
eddy, nothing but  
it. Warmth of your body.  
I want you to circumscribe on my arm.  
Enjoy the many burned-out attempts to kiss  
the parenthetical uranu.  
There is equinoctial fortune in making it.  
Sometimes a piece of the electricity  
soddens like a home in my brow.  
When you awaken like grape perched by the jungle.  
  
I am deceived by flower and lance, by havoc and clouds.  
In the atrocious city of rambunctious starlight.  
  
A dull shades of burnt umber and inaccessible starry sky is passed in the archipeligos.  
Brings all the pities coats.
