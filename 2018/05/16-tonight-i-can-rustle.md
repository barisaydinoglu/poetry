Tonight I Can Rustle
--------------------
The ice absent minded torrents are died.  
To conduct lost peaces and for honeysuckles.  
What is this synonym but a memory executed of its starlights?  
How setting is the cosmic vinegar and it's cleansed oxides?  
When you chirp performed like a tiger.  
As soon as the incoming farms  
gives the minor indication.  
Calculating midnight and the violenet movie  
freeze at the walls of my house.  
What eloquent magnoliums -  
the divisions is filled with it,  
threads for the pencil and the fragmented cedar.  
Come with me to the moth of cities.  
Our new stone, our serendipidous ritual squares.  
Blood-stained sunset and the weak peace  
overflow at  
the walls of my house.  
  
Only curtain, just the  
hoove, nothing but  
it. Honeysuckle.  
And the phemonana to its ribbon  
and among the silences the trusting one  
the astronaut covered with cosmic starlight.
