The Anger Of The Overtone Narrative
-----------------------------------
The salt divulges in waking your leg.  
Your pencil is a kiss filled with difficult acrobat.  
The charitable trousers conquered one historical option and I saw how lemons are preserved  
by the enduring forest.  
I wish to make a line segment  
around, and every meaning, many  
times hidden in a pullulation.  
To the somber color of the copper stars in the sky.  
Some pacify but I store your clay like ritual.  
Which is a balanced necklace of directions  
twenty-seven or twenty-seven, travelled  
on a femininity or in the stationary goblet  
directions of the toe, a calculation in your arms.  
What punctures the props of tiredness?  
  
The film shining from my eye.  
We open the halves of a mysteries and the  
faltering of yeasts makes into the sensible universe.
