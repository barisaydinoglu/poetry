Song For The Elder Of Explosive Flowers
---------------------------------------
Shall we keep going?  
Shady weather, delirious lights like the alcove.  
Here I am, a changeless finger invaded in the archipeligos of foam.  
I salute your angellic apple  
and envy your domestic pride.  
In your shoulder of dismantling the room begins to dream of expanding.  
A green mirror blossoms.  
So the delicate happiness lives on in a orange,  
the ancient house of the crown,  
the eloquent wreath that is trusting and mineral.  
I stayed rescued and sand-colored  
in the middle of the vicinity.  
To seek  
another land it is a tale of neon imbroglios you circumscribe my boneless smoke  
like a wide cat to fresh sugar.  
The order of the muscles a identity makes,  
replaces - it does not return.  
Shoreline was no longer right at the recording threshold.  
  
One side option and your faucet is an alcove filled with wet-winged kiss.  
Your foot lives from east to east
