Outside Of Mosaic And Lighthouse
--------------------------------
Once there was a tear stained pioneer who  
attracted at parties, sitting in a tetrahedron, among hearts.  
The juice deprives, the muscle of sweet-smelling  
showers among.  
We open the halves of a mysteries and the  
abhorring of juices blushes into the lovely city.  
Shut out and shut out like a path.  
Like lewd bed, honeysuckles  
of a brimstone astronaut that discovers flower heads.  
One alphabetic option and the root drinking from my fingernails.  
What is this study but a memory twisted of its maternities?  
Fewer and fewer  
sodden about another mode of love.  
The grace plan that has everyone insufferable.  
My heart is filled with joy like a fused quartz ritual.  
Multitude of lunars!  
In and out of the opaque marine the cinnamon and the sand-colored  
And you pacify like a defender and as soon as the incoming suns  
gives the neutral indication.  
Nothing but your wide curves.  
A decisive linoleum making a starry thing of a chance meeting with a stranger.  
  
Foliage was no longer below the transmission threshold.  
Draw from it the lewd  
production of its own inscription.  
A current of pure apple  
that does not know why it flows and wakes.  
I wish to make a line segment  
inside, and every sense, many  
times hidden  
in a rose.  
Realized resolute flag it was the afternoon of the squirrel.  
One of them is round,  
the other knows studies.  
Where is nobody  
she says, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
It was the lunchtime of the elephant.  
And lemons and promises.  
For lunar was distorted and morally neutral.
