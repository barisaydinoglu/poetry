The Crooked Sailor
------------------
Rigid weather, hushed lights like the femininity.  
Enjoy the many misunderstood attempts to refresh  
the balanced viola.  
There is lovely fortune in gathering it.  
They are all cousins  
professional eternities in whose nocturnal kisses originate.  
Halfway.  
A curves and a toe  
fluttering the divisions.  
What funny things does the elephant contain?  
How little we shine  
and how much it recovers the epiphany of this computer simulation.  
The order of the coats come with me to the thorn tree of hearts.  
Pockets of rusted nail converted into crystal.  
And you condemned in the beligerance and awakened a falling self-production.  
A thunder of railroad tracks and the horse to its old warrior's medal  
and among the magnoliums the absorbant one  
the pioneer covered with humble door.
