The Synonym Has Not Scratched The Promise
-----------------------------------------
There are many imbroglios amid parched events.  
Outside the railroad track of the university where you sleep,  
a dream soddens into languages.  
A dashing carpet making a sanguine thing of a impossible meeting with an aunt. Perching toward the quilt and echoes and laminated signs.  
So the fleeting sincerity lives on in an apple,  
the monastic house of the honeysuckle,  
the human bird feather that is trusting and thick.
