The Projection Of Algorithmic Points
------------------------------------
A burnt umber muscle flies.  
Outside the sunburst orange ears of the electricity.  
And awes and phemonanas.  
My real eye wakes you always.  
Indicates the yellow car's breathing brain.  
The bell scratches, the sphere of fluidic  
blushes outside.  
Once there was a directionless woman who  
enriched at parties, sitting in a line segment, among mosaics.  
It's a pulsing dew of shadows.  
Around cinnamon water and blue faucets.  
I'm the son to the landscape of immediate peace.  
The midnight schools you in its mortal mud.  
Sometimes a piece of the heat  
rejects like a foam in my toe.  
The rusted atom that rejoices in your love.  
You are the tomato of my rustling hand.  
A chorus of tigers at early light of day un woke un faltered  
comes to a halt before a quiver.  
As soon as the incoming atoms  
gives the side indication.  
Around the region I like to upgrade like a crooked rose.  
  
A silence focuses its dream of a old ending, its beginning, the new beginning of the aspen order -  
its lion hearted trashes.  
One historical option and like daggers penetrating in souls.
