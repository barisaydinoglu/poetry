Everything Is A Grammatic Issue
-------------------------------
With its boney perform a smooth broken glass -like wasteland  
a red and disintered bell is wetted in the archipeligos. Shall  
we set forth?  
With its callous relax return to the homeland of the wells.  
  
I wish to make a quadrangle  
outside, and every sense, many  
times hidden in a planetarium.  
Conversations of faucets, the recitation  
of manes we  
call great snow.
