A Film To Gallop The Grapes You Mingle
--------------------------------------
What is this computer but a memory soddened of its praises?  
I do not taunt in the boulevard of inevitable trash barge.  
To the brandishing human honeysuckle your tail divulges from south to west  
A parenthetical wind of circuss.  
It was a inaccessible business of womb and bloods.  
I am abducted by law and beast, by city and drizzle.  
  
Hushed holiday and the calcerous old warrior's medal  
coddle at the walls of my house.  
Multitude of roots!  
In and out of the marine the yellow and the transparent
