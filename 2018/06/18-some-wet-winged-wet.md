Some Wet-winged Wet
-------------------
But I should be true to computer science, abolishing among its wet-winged affections  
so let us seek to divulge a story without alphabetic redundancies.  
A time transforming will inherit  
the cold jungle of a planet.  
Inside the modern office like steel.  
Lashed night and the thirsty miracle  
drown at the walls of my house.  
Absorbant empire. The triangle functions to circumscribe a environment  
to its system.  
Root of a pitied communist guitar.
