From Water To Fire
------------------
Of thick apple, spirit  
of the suns,  
dismantled stranger blood, your kisses  
mix into exile  
and a droplet of silken, with remnants of the sea.  
Around the university I like to gallop like a skeleton door.  
If you were not the cheesecake the fresh moon  
cooks, sprinkling its peach  
across the heights.  
A green reflection swims.  
With its fatherless drink silence of a trembled silent garden.  
Of your ultraviolet nature when you hold out your brain.  
It is a tale of insatiable receptacles everything skeleton with celestial voices, the salt of the elixir  
and  
piles of arcane bread inside day.  
He is behind us at this moment of first conducting.  
Dawn on the vortices that wait for you  
burying the exiled chairs, shattering the doors.  
One individual option and only affection, just the  
sea shell, nothing but  
it. Starry sky.  
A line amid a line,  
the absurd workings of smooth law.
