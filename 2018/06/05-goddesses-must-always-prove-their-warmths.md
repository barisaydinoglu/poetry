Goddesses Must Always Prove Their Warmths
-----------------------------------------
Weak pioneers and fishermen.  
For me they are alphabetic.  
What epiphany does the tiger contain?  
How little we travel and how much it entertains the mysteries of this universe.  
Conducting from shaken fused quartz.  
To the brandishing color of the diamond awe.  
Full stop.  
Always you pamper through the midnight  
toward the late afternoon prosecuting necklaces.
