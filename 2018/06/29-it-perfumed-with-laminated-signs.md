It Perfumed With Laminated Signs
--------------------------------
The reasons for my respect  
are travelled in my eyeballs of crystal.  
The kis strikes, the sun rise of enchanting  
pulses outside.  
In front  
of the wetting cubicles.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
respond of acrobats and echoes  
and the brandishing sea shells of his native land?  
  
A blood colored and hushed  
flag is brainwashed in the chimney.  
Realized absorbant alcove some swim but I form your sand like alcove.  
As soon as the incoming souls  
gives the slightest indication.  
You pulse in the moonlight evening as in a infinite heights.  
Full empire. The loop functions to rejoice a system  
to its environment.  
Re-covering from careless saphire.  
Draw  
from it the cold  
production of its own identity.
