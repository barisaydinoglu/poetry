The Croak Fallen Into The Sea
-----------------------------
Some hear but I gallop your salt like acrobat.  
I saw how defenders are set  
by the acerb sweetnes.  
The giant smiles at the woman  
but the cousin does not smile  
when he looks at the iguana god  
and the browbeaten ocean.  
One overtone option and not the green moment  
when the late afternoon responds the autumns.
