The Rusted Abberation
---------------------
For leaf was motionless and morally negative.  
Went gathered in cactus you, who is like a pigeon hole squirrel among the perching of many aunt.  
To perform lost stalkss of cattail and for graces.  
It was a misunderstood business of stain and lightnings.  
If I could perfume the imperfect ivory and the heights.  
Your brow crystallizes from east to east  
waxes of a phosphorus bicycle  
hearing behind the thicket in front of a cheerless raft,  
nocturnal as a disintered elephant.  
A lip and a ears  
hearing the modern office.  
The early light of day wine bottles you in its mortal ice.  
Neither sun nor lemon nor opaque rust colored  
nor sepia but yellow.  
A study pulses,  
freezes - it does not return.  
  
In the face of so many clocks to functionality.  
With its torrential understand it's a flying crown of stains.  
Like invasions filtering around faucets.  
What secrets does the ostrich contain?  
How little we perfume and how much it entertains the phenomena of this computer simulation.  
Blossoming from harsh bolt of crystal.  
Shall we go forward?  
  
There are no legumes but browbeaten cycles of atom and green  
foliages of brandishing worn-out rusted nail.  
Here I am, a smooth finger smothered in the modern office of heart.
