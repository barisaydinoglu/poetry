Dedicating Harsh Nostalgia
--------------------------
Like the tear stained aluminum of keys wave of wave of smooth stones rolling down the sea. Pure flask wets the necklaces like lances entangling inside bird feathers.  
The awe smothers, the quiver of absent minded  
perches with.  
A mist -like vortex  
a clouds of trees when you hear like laminated sign imbued by the jungle.  
A prize focuses its dream of a ending, its ending, the beginning of the river order -  
its loving shrapnels.  
The abberation circumscribes on its inaccessible mare  
creating burnt umber atoms over the chimney.  
Galloping the circus of her serenity full of happiness.  
From ocean wave to tornado,  
hidden ripples drawn by brandishing channels, a  
shifty jar begins to expand.  
A full sun of paths.  
I'd do it for the coral in which you relinquish  
for the lemons of yellow you've enriched.  
I'm the stranger to the stalks of cattail of immediate awe.  
  
A triangle outside a quadrangle,  
the wet-winged workings of cordial law.  
A detail imbues,  
throttles - it does not return.
