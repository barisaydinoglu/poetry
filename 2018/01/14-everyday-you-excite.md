Everyday You Excite
-------------------
My heart is filled with tiredness like a glass curtain.  
Full stop.  
Be guided by the warm grape's droplet.  
And a tenacious laminated sign's wind will grow you.  
Grew and then attracted in the jungle.  
In your curves of panic the thicket of graces reconcile.  
I want you to create on my toe.
