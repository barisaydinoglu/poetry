I Have Gone Scratching
----------------------
You respond my dry lonely road  
like a mineral oyster to fresh cheesecake.  
In the first reel, the lion hearted mother  
is invaded by a goddess. In the second  
reel he returns, to carry and to stand.  
I salute your pure sugar  
and envy your affluent pride.  
Pure pigeon hole flies the hooves wave of wave of threads rolling down the sea.  
They are all sailors  
professional scandalmongerings in whose sanguine angels  
originate.  
What epiphany does the bird contain?  
How little we dawn and how much it crystallizes the funny things of this universe.  
Not the crimson moment  
when the fortnight transforms the friendships.
