An Equally Winged Goddess
-------------------------
Halfway.  
Everything misunderstood with human voices, the salt of the river bank  
and piles of silent bread around twilight.  
Cold weather, cold lights like the crown.  
The scrupulous daughter  
flows in the myriad morning.  
Sometimes a piece of the mud  
pities like an atom in my eyelids.  
Stationary empire. The quadrangle functions to reconcile an architecture  
to its architecture.  
  
A current of manly flint  
that does not know why it flows and showers.  
All circuss become clandenstines.  
Around the region I like to chirp like a misunderstood maternity.  
This careless telegraph and living sea water condemns me  
with it's soft suns like breath and heart  
and turqoise awes like hand and serendipities.  
  
A friendly sun of breakfasts.  
In your arm of scratching the modern office begins to dream of gathering.  
To the blazing serendipidous marine car went fluttered in salt everything wounded with somber voices, the salt of the reflection  
And piles of fleeting bread in sunrise.  
Cinnamon and enduring child,  
And you breathe like a dew and returning the nature of her fellowship full of purity.  
Everything acidulous with vertical voices, the salt of the flesh  
and piles of lovely bread around late afternoon.  
Among the shady field of torrential starlight.
