Song For The Elder Of Putrid Elixirs
------------------------------------
So the moonlit felicity lives on in a lemon,  
the musical house of the perfume,  
the noble grace that is indespensable and natural.  
And meetings of smothered lip you entertain slowly into an area to flutter your business.  
Wave of wave of silences rolling down the sea.  
Has the archipeligos been drank with phenomena?  
The momentum knows this,  
that life in it's cedar boxes is as endless as the serendipity.
