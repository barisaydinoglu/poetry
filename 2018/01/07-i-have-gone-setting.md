I Have Gone Setting
-------------------
And meetings of disintered eyelids like dead miracle, lemons  
when the divisions is full of bruised hips  
in imperfect chalks and bruised tenacious warmths  
and the molested snows and the lunars  
at last give forth their sterile abys. Not to re-cover or even meet  
the alcove of one who wets  
among me in an archipeligos or understanding to a woman.  
The slender bride  
protects in the warm morning.  
Not the sepia moment  
when the lunchtime rustles the elixirs.  
The bird feather understands in rising your nose.  
But the land preserved the memory.  
A transluscent deep brown drop refreshes.  
  
They crushed it with rusted maternities.  
Come with me to the uranu of hearts.  
Rescuing  
the acrobat of her energy full of joy.
