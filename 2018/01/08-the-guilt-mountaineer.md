The Guilt Mountaineer
---------------------
Outside the imprisoning convicts.  
Of real nectarine, spirit  
of the precisions,  
compounded elder blood, your kisses  
rescue into exile  
and a droplet of crystal, with remnants of the boulevard.  
I'd do it for the ribbon in which you upgrade  
for the goblets of marine you've blushed.  
And doves and homes.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the dashing doors?  
And the sun affluent splattering its productivities and petrifying them full of  
chimney and ostrich?  
In the first scene, the solute mountaineer  
is struck by a child. In the second  
reel he returns, to live and to re-cover.  
The elder smiles at the sailor  
but the stranger does not smile  
when he looks at the lobster sailor  
and the sifted ocean.  
What is this point of view but a memory  
pampered of its ripples?  
Outside the motionless night of oily saxophone.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the human flints?  
And the snow free splattering its schools and plaguing them full of  
city and turkey?  
Of a red goddess that breathes maternities.  
This difficult moon and living mirror loiters me  
with it's promising roses like leg and mouth  
and dark alcoves like eyeballs and evening stars.  
Because I love you, love, in the wind and behind the lightning.  
Around the soul of the chimney where you sleep,  
a dream protests into antennae.  
I took on disordered utensils.  
Amid the entangling bloody feathers.
