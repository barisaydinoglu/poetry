Meeting Your Trap
-----------------
You are the mango of my crooked foot.  
Pockets of ash converted into chalk.  
All wreaths become stalactites.  
Of absorbant cheesecake, spirit  
of the smooth sand,  
forced mother blood, your kisses  
entertain into exile  
and a droplet of diamond, with remnants of the vicinity.  
The senile lake is nocturnal on your ears.  
From her heart and her eye mingle  
movies of the earth.  
The uncle smiles at the gentleman  
but the child does not smile  
when he looks at the squirrel mountaineer  
and the rustling ocean.  
The domestic warmths of your body prosecuted if I could appreciate the billows of ultraviolet smoke and the chimney.  
When you understand recovered like a tree.  
I am plagued by cactus and scandalmongering, by clock and wind.  
You say, what is the ribbon waiting for in its sepia promise?  
I tell you it is waiting for lighthouse like you.  
Neither lunar nor pasture nor brimstone  
nor transluscent cinnamon but sepia.  
Our new farm, our decisive poppy circles.  
  
Transparent car.  
Where poppies meet  
flower heads meet, outside and with and the sound  
of cities, to reach out and fly in  
beligerance.  
  
A camera awakens,  
scratches - it does not return.  
On what tear stained whispers continued with mud?
