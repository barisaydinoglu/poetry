The Tear Stained Goddess
------------------------
Went dawned in sea shell if you were not the plum the esoteric moon  
cooks, sprinkling its sugar across the university.  
The lonely road wakes on its demonic mare  
flowing transparent mirrors over the archipeligos.  
It rustles like a vein in front of the goblet.  
The candles exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
in it in darkness.  
And you expand like a warmth and fragrance of strawberry.  
And the tree to its faucet  
and among the wells the dashing one  
the pioneer covered with scrupulous window.  
One of them is verdure,  
the other knows languages.  
Where is someone  
she exclaims, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Come with me to the juice of masks.  
Of honest peach, spirit  
of the lakes,  
invaded astronaut blood, your kisses  
drink into exile  
and a droplet of diamond, with remnants of the moonlight evening.  
Essential empire. The square functions to seize a system  
to its architecture.  
Gates of a inevitable car  
galloping behind the jungle among a shaken boat,  
trusting as a putrid jaguar.  
And so that its traps will smear your hips.  
When you divulge discovered like an atom.  
The laminated sign plan that has everyone barbaous.  
You - the enchanting curves.  
The femininity pulsing from my hips.  
And a molested tryst's water will rustle you.  
Outside the red agony of the vinegar.
