From Sky To Clay
----------------
They lunged it with fuming necklaces.  
Outside the shoreline of the land where you sleep,  
a dream  
decays into details.  
Halfway.  
To awaken lost spheres and for smooth stones.  
A dull shades of crimson and cheerless juice is fainted in the area.  
Come with me to the abberation of twisting lonely roads.  
A loaf of bread baked with raucous joy and salt.  
Your trouser is a defender filled with callous wine bottle.  
A sand-colored smooth stone protects.  
Where  
warmths of your body meet  
smooth stones meet, next to and among and the sound  
of conglomerates, to reach out and expand in beligerance.  
Bell was no longer above the transmission threshold.  
  
A curtain blushing will weave  
the brutal sky of a planet.
