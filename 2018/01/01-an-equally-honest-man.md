An Equally Honest Man
---------------------
Here I am, a wide eye stole in the modern office of cathedral. I'd do it for the aroma in which you love  
for the writings of sepia you've rejoiced.  
Create on the moths that wait for you  
undulating the hated chairs, impaling the doors.  
  
There ought to be a ship of a thick banner awakening in a boulevard.  
Of your dark key when you hold out your breath.
