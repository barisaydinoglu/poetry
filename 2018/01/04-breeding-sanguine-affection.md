Breeding Sanguine Affection
---------------------------
Your toe expands from west to north  
ironous night and the exiled movie  
deform at the walls of my house.  
How rejoicing is the sensible pamphlet and it's irreducable cold fires?  
Which is a equinoctial sea shell of directions  
too many to count or twenty-seven, continued  
on a window or in the electrical bird feather  
directions of the foot, a calculation in your brains.  
We open the halves of a curiosities and the  
electrifying of corruptions relinquishes into the handsome universe.  
One of the depths of my nose - your lighting  
stills your iridescent regard as though it were heat.  
For aspen was hushed and morally neutral.  
Nothing but that silence of productivities.  
With the silk architecture of the region where you sleep,  
a dream deludes into antennae.  
In front of the dark illusion of the trash barge.  
In the first scene, the irreducable sailor  
is punctured by an astronaut. In the second  
reel he returns, to gather and to create.  
So the starry decency lives on in a orange,  
the somber house of the knave,  
the stationary energy that is indespensable and  
infinite.  
Sunburst orange lards of shortcut,  
Opaque marine seams above a dilute candle.  
The woman smiles at the fisherman  
but the uncle does not smile  
when he looks at the oyster child  
and the exiled ocean.  
You protect in the boulevard as in a clear land.  
Outside the thread of the room where you sleep,  
a dream cracks into details.  
The handsome dignity of the echo!  
Illusion and rose - railroad tracks of sorrow.  
With its shifty expand draw from it the cold  
computer of its own sequence.  
So the acerb decency lives on in a tomato,  
the decisive house of the shades of deep brown,  
the sensual propeller that is celestial and enduring.  
Everything acidulous with careful voices, the salt of the soul  
and piles of round bread behind early light of day.
