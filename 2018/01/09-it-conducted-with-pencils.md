It Conducted With Pencils
-------------------------
The trysts exists even when there is  
little to say, and  
it ceases  
amid it in darkness.  
Not to seize or even meet  
the ribbon of one who trusts  
under me in a jungle or chirping to a cousin.  
Making from bleak silken.  
Fewer and  
fewer  
wet about another mode of decency.  
On what misunderstood bones shone with water?  
There are no jackals but blood-stained cycles of peace and blue  
maps of monastic inaccessible ash.  
A snow of bells like corruptions electrifying amid flutes.  
When you rise like flint  
inherited by the earth.
