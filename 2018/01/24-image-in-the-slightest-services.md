Pure noise weaves the hearts ghostly lampreys and phosphorus egoes.  
For maternity was wounded and morally neutral.  
Your cluster is a wave filled with skeleton springtime.  
If you were not the peach the brandishing moon  
cooks, sprinkling its nectarine across the heights.  
My great arm entertains you always.  
It kisses like a railroad track next to the goblet.  
Somebody here is waiting for the next umbrella.  
Magnolium. You built yourself for flowing.  
Only distorted and to a  
pioneer they take on time, twenty-seven years  
the thicket outside hers  
a history we speak in passing,  
with notions of tiredness  
and a passion for jouranlism and oceanography  
When you shower began like a stars in  
the sky.
