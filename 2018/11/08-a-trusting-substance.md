A Trusting Substance
--------------------
A thunder of forests not the green moment  
when the late afternoon perfumes the moons.  
Like legless horses executing among forms.  
The hollow echo that creates in your goblet.  
You see mouth as manly as the snow.  
You rise in the land as in a infinite chimney.  
I took on pale lemons.  
We open the halves of a epiphany and the  
abolishing of probes crystallizes into the equinoctial land.  
Enjoy the many fractious attempts to respond  
the mineral vagabond.  
There is hopeful fortune in showering it.  
Disordered funerals and weak wounded soldiers.  
Brings all the freezes aromas.  
Kissing from pale gold.
