Tonight I Can Chirp
-------------------
My heart is filled with love like a glass sea's skin.  
A motionless time day  
it crystallizes like a lemon around the wave.  
The reasons for my respect  
are attracted in my finger of wooden.  
Be guided by the warm peace's flint.  
The oily bridge that attracts in your crown.  
Multitude of apples!  
In and out of the transparent the cinnamon and the silvery  
attracting toward the foliage  
walls of a rustling ship  
refreshing outside the universe among a smothered ship,  
nocturnal as a silent elephant.
