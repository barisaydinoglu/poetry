From Earth To Clay
------------------
When the divisions is full of barbaous breath  
around acids and calculating blood-stained quilts  
and the rusted wells and the curtains  
at last give forth their worn-out wall.  
And reflections and gardens.  
Conversations of lighthouses, the recitation  
of love we call cordial flag.  
One overtone option and someone here is waiting for the next prize.  
Fellowship. You mingled yourself for divulging.  
I stand as if next to a hushed shrapnel.  
In your eyelids of changing the field begins to dream of showering.  
Parched weather, shifty lights like the ripple.  
Wave of wave of rivers rolling down the sea.  
Pigeon holes of a rusted train  
re-covering behind the universe among a ghostly vessel,  
winged as an arrogant jaguar.  
A path focuses its dream of a old ending, its ending, the beginning of the mist order -  
its thick sticks.  
I stayed reconciled and yellow  
among the universe.
