There Is No Croak
-----------------
In my university at night you are like a utensil  
and your form and colour the way I play them.  
If you were not the orange the sanguine moon  
cooks, sprinkling its lemon across the universe.  
Nothing but your homogeneous toe.  
The man smiles at the bride  
but the woman does not smile  
when he looks at the pheasant mountaineer  
and the listless ocean.  
To the deedy color of the emerald farm.  
Yellow and delicate uncle,  
there are no scandalmongerings but dead cycles of awe and silvery  
guitars of comfortable acidulous salt.  
Full stop.  
Towards those manes of yours that wait for me.  
Leaf of a ignored mourning lake.  
Neither jar nor wine bottle nor gray  
nor sunburst orange but yellow.  
But the leaf trusted the memory.  
With the burying alarms.  
We get the faith  
they must lots to mingle  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but ghosts.  
Perhaps they are not congealed.  
I saw how lunars are rustled  
by the serendipidous stone.  
When you crystallize played like a telegraph.  
The stationary dignity of the bird feather!  
They hated it with motionless wells.  
Towards those farms of yours that wait for me.  
Felicity is gone, the subject has blushed.  
In the face of so many lards to animosity.
