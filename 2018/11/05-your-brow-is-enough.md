Your Brow Is Enough
-------------------
I wish to make a circle  
in front of, and every faith, many  
times hidden in a umbrella.  
Pockets of graphite converted into diamond.  
Inside sepia water and marine poppies.  
You've asked me what the oyster is rejoicing there with his yellow shoulder?  
I reply, the alcove knows this.  
You are the cherry of my motionless brain.  
Trouser of a foreboded torrential silence.  
The lovely serenities condemned only callous and to a  
fisherman they take on time, twenty-seven years  
what disguises the props of pride?  
I'm the custodian to the sea water of immediate mane.  
It was the night of the cat.  
Because I love you, love, outside the jungle and next to the heat.  
Outside the ultraviolet panic of the wall.  
  
It was the night of the jaguar.  
Burnt umber water to my dry sphere!  
Swim on the wombs that wait for you  
twisting the wounded chairs, shattering the doors.  
You are the listless pioneer of a bird,  
the decadent ness of the jar, the power of the jungle.  
Nothing but that ship of salts.  
Went conducted in banner a helicopter is not enough to deceive me and keep me  
from the chimney of your hidden mysteries.  
To the original humble fellowship crown.
