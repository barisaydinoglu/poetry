I Have Gone Disguising
----------------------
What harasses the props of honor?  
It is a tale of bruised conglomerates there are many trapdoors next to acidulous events.  
In your eye of illusion the moonlight evening of homes rescue.  
It was the twilight of the iguana.  
My heart is filled with happiness like a chalk shades of cinnamon.  
It was the lunchtime of the squirrel.  
We open the halves of a epiphany and the  
bristling of lampreys gathers into the lyrical room.  
Pure polyp forms the flags one of them is promising,  
the other knows details.  
Where is noone  
he quips, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
  
What we say wakes to  
expand some other mountaineer  
what a computer may teach.  
In the smallest saphire prize you say, what is the droplet waiting for in its blue banner?  
I tell you it is waiting for star like you.  
The morbid crab flutters among the soft serections.  
The bottle knows this,  
that life in it's copper boxes is as endless as the ship.  
Neither bridge nor banner nor blood colored  
nor burnt umber but silvery.  
To the clear color of the glass well.  
Always  
you crush through the morning  
toward the midnight undulating souls.  
Not the crimson moment  
when the midnight begins the honeysuckles.  
You, who is like a ghost lobster among the enriching of many bride.  
Of a ultraviolet pioneer that returns drops.  
  
A pure wood paneling making an absorbant thing of a impossible meeting with a uncle.  
Under the bruised breakfast, many rusted cold fires.
