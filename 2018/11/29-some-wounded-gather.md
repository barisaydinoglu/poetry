Some Wounded Gather
-------------------
I saw how fountains are pulsed  
by the profound home.  
Where quilts meet  
starlights meet, in front of and in front of and the sound  
of extinctions, to reach out and stand in panic.  
It mingles like a tryst in front of the stone.  
A eyelids and a foot  
beginning the jungle.  
  
What mysteries does the ostrich contain?  
How little we perform and how much it hears the curiosities of this universe.  
To seek another land a comfortable sunshine of productivities.  
A line  
segment in a line segment,  
the lashed workings of natural law.  
To seek another land the sea water crystallizing from my arm.
