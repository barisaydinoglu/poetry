Since The End Of Awakening
--------------------------
How promising is the scrupulous stick and it's resplendent moths?  
My heart moves from being acidulous to being enduring.  
Fear and productivity - cactuss of confusion.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
mix of moons and mosaics  
and the natural sweetness of his native land?  
Neither time nor light nor red  
nor transluscent marine but burnt umber.  
You are the tomato of my atrocious eye.  
I wish to make a line segment  
outside, and every sight, many  
times hidden in a bottle.
