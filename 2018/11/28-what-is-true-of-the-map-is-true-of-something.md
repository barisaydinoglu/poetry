What Is True Of The Map Is True Of Something
--------------------------------------------
Where horses  
meet  
springtimes meet, behind and amid and the sound  
of beasts, to reach out and dedicate in sorrow.  
The fortnight pullulations you in its mortal fire.  
What mysteries does the turkey contain?  
How little we return and how much it makes the curiosities of this galaxy.  
Carry me onto your vessel - the mango of my umbrella -  
On what dry juices continued with clay?  
Which is a naked wave of directions  
too few to count or  
twenty-seven, inherited  
on a bottle or in the self-assured flute  
directions of the eyelids, a calculation in your brows.  
  
What coddles the props of happiness?
