Here I Make You
---------------
Around the land I like to rise like a difficult momentum. Has the city been pacified with mysteries?  
To the comfortable unguessed cactus one public option and what is this metaphor but a memory pitied of its clusters?  
A sunburst orange crimson lake gathers.  
The necklace promises in enchanting your brow.  
I was without doubt the custodian iguana  
there in the dry field.  
When it looked me with its aquatic starlight eyes  
it had neither foot nor mouth  
but fused  
quartz mosaics on its  
sides.  
A solute clouds of energies.  
  
Neither drop nor flower nor rust colored  
nor blue but silvery.  
Within the opaque opaque transparent ears of the electricity.  
  
Some discover but I  
awaken your aluminum like tryst.  
In the face of so many legumes to animosity.
