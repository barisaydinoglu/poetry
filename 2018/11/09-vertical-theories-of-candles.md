Vertical Theories Of Candles
----------------------------
Went recovered in juice but I should be untrue to photography, abolishing among its arrogant farms  
so let us seek to tell a story devoid of neutral redundancies.  
Because I love you, love, with the lightning and inside the heat.  
Of a turqoise father that dedicates flutes.  
On what delirious shadows attracted with sky?  
As soon as the incoming quivers  
gives the alphabetic indication.  
Of trusting orange, spirit  
of the autumns,  
mutated mother blood, your kisses  
transform into exile  
and a droplet of emerald, with remnants of the modern office.  
  
One of them is mineral,  
The other knows antennae.  
Where is noone  
he says, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
What phenomena does the oyster contain?  
How little we appreciate and how much it preserves the secrets of this computer simulation.
