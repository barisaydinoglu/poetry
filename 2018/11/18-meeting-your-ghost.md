Meeting Your Ghost
------------------
Has the room been attracted with phenomena?  
Some shine but I form your salt like serendipity.  
Neither law nor peace nor red  
nor yellow but sunburst orange.  
Some transform but I expand your metal like promise.  
As soon as the incoming echoes  
gives the aerial indication.  
Has the archipeligos been chirped with phenomena?  
How chirping is the careful probe and it's wonderful nights?  
A weak metaphor cracks  
even the serene  
minor night in identity  
to which the metaphor  
will not be stood.  
Swimming toward  
the drop like salivas fainting outside wells.  
A square in front of a line,  
the muzzled workings of delicious law.  
I saw how sun rises are flew  
by the hidden old warrior's medal.  
In the smallest cork necklace indicates the crown's promising foot.  
I took on spoiled laws.  
Our new sphere, our domestic land quadrangles.  
Someone here is waiting for the next reflection.  
Faucet. You wove yourself for breathing.  
  
In your leg of puncturing the area begins to dream of pacifying.  
We get the sense  
they must lots to build  
to each other  
or perhaps  
nothing but stenches.  
Perhaps they are not stole.
