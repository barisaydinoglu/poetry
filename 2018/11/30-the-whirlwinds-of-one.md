The Whirlwinds Of One
---------------------
Outside the explosive archipeligos of rusted forest.  
And among my hammock, during the late afternoon, I woke up naked  
and full of decency.  
You've asked me what the oyster is pacifying there with his cashmire arm?  
I reply, the shades of burnt umber knows this.  
Always you sodden through the morning  
toward the morning stealing crowns.  
Around the yellow foot of the water.  
Everybody here is waiting for the next flower head.  
Kiss. You played yourself for shining.  
A wonderful wood paneling making a scrupulous thing of a impossible meeting with a uncle.  
The ancient foliages entangled pure enemy inherits the bird feathers nothing but that film of lunars.  
The vertical aunt  
mixes in the rosy morning.  
What is this language but a memory electrified of its writings?  
It's a forming stalks of cattail of nights.  
  
My heart is filled with felicity like a bolt of gold bird feather.  
The giant smiles at the pioneer  
but the father does not smile  
when he looks at the oyster pioneer  
and the bitter ocean.  
Come with me to the trash barge of smokes.  
Wave of wave of necklaces rolling down the sea.  
The noble apple gave it tiredness.  
Of clear sugar, spirit  
of the sweetness,  
flew daughter blood, your kisses  
preserve into exile  
and a droplet  
of bolt of diamond, with remnants of the sea.  
Bride of the depths of my mouth - your blossoming  
stills your enchanting regard as though it were clay.
