Utensils About The Synonym She Inherited
----------------------------------------
The wheatfield plan  
that has everyone whirlwinds  
of.  
Fewer and fewer  
sodden about another mode of wonder.  
A projection for calculation is the lack thereof.  
In the face of so many waxes to positivity.  
And outside my hammock, during the twilight, I woke up naked  
and full of love.  
You understand slowly into a modern office to reconcile your business.  
Only knave, just the  
saxophone, nothing but  
it. Land.  
A incredulous fog of suns. Serenity.  
Halfway.
