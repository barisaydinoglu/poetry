Tell Her That I Am Giving Up Loving In Calculations
---------------------------------------------------
From her fingernails and her heart flutter  
mirrors of the earth. On what harsh noises stood with clay?  
A loaf of bread baked with weak respect and salt.  
  
Burnt umber rotten stumps of bomb,  
transparent seams above a neurotic shades of crimson.  
The pigeon hole imposes nessecity.
