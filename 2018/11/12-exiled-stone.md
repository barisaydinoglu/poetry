Exiled Stone
------------
For promise was crooked and morally negative.  
A neon technique dismantles  
even the full  
alphabetic sea in computer  
to which the metaphor  
will not be rescued.  
Brings all the drops awes.  
Cashmire heat to my arrogant apple!  
My heart moves from being insufferable to being resolute.  
You say, what is the ship waiting for in its deep brown  
utensil?  
I tell you it is waiting for stars in the sky like you.  
If  
I could conduct the vortex and the boulevard.  
Some flutter but I  
flow your sand like leaf. When the archipeligos is full of bitter eyelids  
in front of moldy bananas and atrocious harsh movies  
and the tremulous lights and the bottles  
at last give forth their hollow violence.  
And so that its evils will shake your lip.  
Somebody here is waiting for the next hat.  
Mirror. You blushed yourself for weaving.  
I wish to make a quadrangle  
in, and every abstraction, many  
times hidden in a love.
