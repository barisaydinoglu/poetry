The Wet-winged Custodian Of The Room
------------------------------------
An odor has chirped in the breakfast,  
a mixture of trap and body, a protecting  
perfume that brings illusion.  
Sometimes a piece of the clay  
plagues like a bed in my brain.  
Pockets of broken glass converted into paper-mache.  
If I  
could drink the viola and  
the region.  
A projection for production is the lack thereof.  
Oily sailors and mountaineers.  
For me they are neutral.  
The quiver plan that has everyone misunderstood.
