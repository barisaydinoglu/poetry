Projection With The Jugular
---------------------------
And fellowships and movies.  
From harrowing wind to palm tree leaf,  
hidden mosaics drawn by free channels, a  
skeleton bird feather begins to set.  
Like nauesous salt, springtimes  
waking toward the drop like fire-tipped salt, keys  
salivas of a disordered wheel  
rustling in front of the night in a putrid bicycle,  
balanced as a rustling crab.  
Seeking a miracle  
sought in the slender sun.  
All flower heads  
become shardss of chalk.  
It excites like a form outside the flower head.  
A lovely linoleum making a cosmic thing of a unlikely meeting with a mother.
