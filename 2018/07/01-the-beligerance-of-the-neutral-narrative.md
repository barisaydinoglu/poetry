The Beligerance Of The Neutral Narrative
----------------------------------------
In the archipeligos like sand. One historical option and an odor has swam in the middle of the flower,  
a mixture of whisper and body, a returning  
hoove that brings embarassement. From uncomfortable turbulence to ocean wave,  
hidden poppies drawn by homogeneous channels, a  
wounded pasture begins to hear.  
A chorus of jaguars at sunrise un woke un gnawn  
comes to a halt before a serenity.  
A ears and a brain  
breathing the city.  
Wetting a tiger  
entertained in the absorbant sun.
