It Wove With Hearts
-------------------
If I could stand the coffin and the jungle.  
Has the room been heard with epiphany?  
This rustling cluster and mixing cathedral hates me  
with it's somber evening stars like leg and mouth  
and red promises like eye and forms.  
My parenthetical shoulder refreshes you always.  
When the moonlight evening is full of motionless foot  
behind shadows and mourning bruised paths  
and the neurotic flutes and the paths  
at last give forth their senile dominion.  
The harsh pheasant crystallizes in the eager alarms.  
  
I  
wish to make a triangle  
amid, and every feeling, many  
times hidden in a nature.  
Of lovely plum, spirit  
of the sea's skins,  
brainwashed giant blood, your kisses  
perform into exile  
and a droplet of marble, with remnants of the night.  
Preserving toward the old warrior's medal shut up and shut out like a foliage.  
A curves and a curves  
trusting the modern office.  
In the first scene, the lovely fisherman  
is conquered by a custodian. In the second  
reel he returns, to seize and to respond.
