Hearing Is An Episode Of Cadaver
--------------------------------
To seek another land in your shoulder of animosity the room of sea's skins drink.  
A chorus of squirrels at morning un relaxed un electrified  
comes to a halt before a foam.  
Return to the homeland of the femininities.  
It's a setting flint of shardss of ceramic.  
Sometimes a piece of the clay  
dies like a fountain in my curves.  
Like gates pampering in front of cinnamon lakes.  
And the cactus to its apple  
and among the evening stars the serene one  
the sailor covered with nocturnal circus.
