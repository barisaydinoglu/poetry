Absurd Muscle
-------------
So the pure purity lives on in a grape,  
The infinite house of the starlight,  
the original lunar that is acerb and noble.  
All drops become moths.  
It was the lunchtime of the jaguar.  
Not the sand-colored moment  
when the afternoon hears the lemons.  
Loving, crystal apple!  
Realized  
wide acrobat next to cashmire water and burnt umber beds.  
A rain of apples the bell drinks in storing your brow.  
All wells become throats.  
How dawning is the parsimonious torrent and it's sensible extinctions?  
What self-assured planetariums -  
the modern office is filled with it,  
awes for the laminated sign and the inevitable fused quartz.  
On what sifted utensils performed with sky?  
And you deceived in the anger and discovered a devouring violence.  
Home of a shook boneless alcove.  
The river knows this,  
that life in it's fused quartz boxes is as endless as the bed.  
And so that its bloodied metals will entangle your arm.  
Green and scrupulous cousin,  
towards those circuss of yours that wait for me.  
  
It was the late afternoon of the bird.  
The mist expands in rising  
your fingernails.  
From her eyelids and her foot blush  
Ribbons of the earth.  
Return to the homeland of the autumns.  
But  
I should be untrue to photography, abolishing among its calcerous currents  
so let us try to speak a story devoid  
of overtone redundancies.  
  
It was the day of the elephant.  
Towards those foams of yours  
that wait for me.  
  
You seize in the moonlight evening as in a thick field.  
You've asked me what the squirrel is seeking there with his cashmire leg?  
I reply, the quiver knows this.  
  
The electricity cleansed polyps are deprived.  
In front of the coagulating wounds.  
  
It was the day of the toucan.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
rescue of mosaics and horses  
and the changeless doors of his native land?  
Fewer and fewer  
faint about another mode of felicity.  
A tryst magnifying will upgrade  
the mourning jungle of a planet.  
  
A chorus of turkeys at afternoon un mixed un soddened  
comes to a halt before a thread.  
You see lip as warm as the clouds.
