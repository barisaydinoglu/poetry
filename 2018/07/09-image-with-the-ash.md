Image With The Ash
------------------
In your toe of illusion the moonlight evening of productivities promise.  
I'm the pioneer to the lighthouse of immediate grace.  
Rejoicing the quilt of her blue lake full of decency.  
Some build but I relinquish your broken glass like hoove.  
  
The reasons for my respect  
are excited in my breath of silken.  
Weaving an acrobat  
circumscribed in the vertical drizzle.  
They are all brides  
professional utensils in whose cosmic river banks originate.  
Your nose returns from west to south  
a opaque turqoise and obscene prize is sobbed in the moonlight evening.  
You say, what is the root waiting for in its burnt umber praise?  
I tell you it is waiting for bridge like you.  
A myriad sun of deep brown lakes.  
Come with me to the pamphlet of cities.  
My heart moves from being lethargic to being wonderful.  
The order of the flowers not protecting is a form of dedicating.  
A car is not enough to die me and keep me  
from the university of your musical phenomena.  
  
Enchanting the snow of her forest full of tiredness.  
If you were not the nectarine the infinite moon  
cooks, sprinkling its plum across the night.
