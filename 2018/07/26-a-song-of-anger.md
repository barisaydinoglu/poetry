A Song Of Anger
---------------
In front of the protesting abyss.  
A current of boundless hoove  
that does not know why it flows and mingles.  
What replaces the props of pride?  
I conduct as if next to a ghostly vortex.  
  
Which is a cleansed affection of directions  
too few to count or too few to count, galloped  
on a home or in the round aspen  
directions of the eye, a calculation in your noses.
