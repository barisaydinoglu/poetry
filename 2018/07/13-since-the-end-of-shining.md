Since The End Of Shining
------------------------
I do not loathe in the jungle of clotting billows of gray smoke.  
Seeking the elixir of her cactus full of love.  
When you return like home carried by the heat.  
With its rigid protect in your hand of beligerance the city of ripples conduct.  
  
Pockets of brick converted into saphire.  
Towards those lighthouses of yours that wait for me.
