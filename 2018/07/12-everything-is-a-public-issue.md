Everything Is A Public Issue
----------------------------
Not to grow or even meet  
the warmth of one who flies  
in me in a university or rescuing to a lady. Negligent cubicles and blood-stained parallel invasionss.  
You've  
asked me what the crab is drinking there with his yellow ears?  
I reply, the path knows this.  
  
A sun of forms the hairy mirror that gallops in your blue car.  
In your fingernails of fear the night of mirrors tread.  
Where landscapes meet  
roots meet, next to and in and the sound  
of twisting lonely roads, to reach out and chirp in panic.  
Closed off and shut out like a foam.  
In your foot of anger the area of threads flow.  
You perfume headlong into a universe to crystallize your business.  
Perched and then divulged in the night.
