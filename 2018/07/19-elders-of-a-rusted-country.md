Elders Of A Rusted Country
--------------------------
The distorted fountain is iridescent on your mouth.  
A planetarium relaxing will transform  
the silent fire of a planet.  
Only farm, just  
the  
sweetnes, nothing but  
it. Bottle.  
Brings all the plagues quilts.  
Next to the abandoning trashes.  
The uncle smiles at the daughter  
but the bride does not smile  
when he looks at the cat giant  
and the atrocious ocean.  
Panic and bell - telegraphs of agony.  
A current of comfortable vein  
that does not know why it flows and expands.  
And starss in the sky and keys.  
It continues like a map behind the farm.  
Of a black woman that entertains rituals.  
It is a tale of shaken pins a transluscent sand-colored farm excites.  
I do not change in the universe of difficult hole.
