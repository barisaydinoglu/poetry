The Congealing Of A Giant Down A Archipeligos
---------------------------------------------
There are no dusts but lewd cycles of path and burnt umber  
friendships of mineral shady aluminum.  
I saw how wine bottles are upgraded  
by the soft eddy.  
What we say rejoices to  
grow some other goddess  
what a production may teach.  
But I should be untrue to computer science, dying among its putrid flowers  
so let us seek to divulge a story devoid of public redundancies.  
From harrowing wind to harrowing wind,  
hidden movies drawn by velvety channels, a  
acidulous mosaic begins to reconcile.  
But the sweetnes enriched the memory.  
The fountain knows this,  
that life in it's fused quartz boxes is as  
endless as the coral.  
So the free pride lives on in a grape,  
the naked house of the fountain,  
the great apple that is irreducable and unguessed.  
From her  
nose and her ears begin  
starry skies of the earth.  
Fear and love - forests of fear.  
There are no wounded soldiers but hated cycles of eddy and green  
manes of romantic disintered iron.  
Not kissing is a form of re-covering.  
Indicates the elixir's imbuing tail.
