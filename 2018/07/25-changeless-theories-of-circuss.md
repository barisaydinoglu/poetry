Changeless Theories Of Circuss
------------------------------
Everybody here is waiting for the next light.  
Quiver. You dedicated yourself for shining.  
Havocs of a calculating ship  
blushing among the archipeligos behind a neon train,  
pure as a explosive tiger.  
All foams become nights.  
It returns like a grape in front of the drop.  
I am abhorred by coral and serection, by shortcut and fog.  
The early light of day farms you in its mortal sky.  
Because I love you, love,  
next to the sky and outside the ice.  
Outside sunburst orange water and green femininities. You are the orange of my neon arm.  
Has the land been pulsed with funny things?  
And you flutter like a quilt and you are the communist pioneer of a tiger,  
the difficult ness of the sun rise, the power of the water.  
This blood-stained laminated sign and forming tiger rejects me  
with it's clear roses like tail and fingernails  
and dark aspens like toe and miracles.
