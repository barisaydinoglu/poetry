Meeting Your Night
------------------
Where farms meet  
starlights meet, outside and outside and the sound  
of polyps, to reach out and make in animosity. The room behind hers  
a story we divulge in  
passing,  
with notions  
of felicity  
and a passion for oceanography and science  
be guided by the spacious flower head's flower head.  
  
On what absurd shardss of marble recovered with mud?
