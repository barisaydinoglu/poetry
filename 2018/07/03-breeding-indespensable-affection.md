Breeding Indespensable Affection
--------------------------------
You see brow as acerb as the wind.  
Be guided by the myriad sea's skin's sea shell.  
What is this antenna but a memory crushed of its affections?  
From her brow and her eye attract  
graces of the earth.  
How inheriting is  
the indespensable cleft and it's unguessed evils?  
All pastures become evils.  
The phlegm imposes nessecity.
