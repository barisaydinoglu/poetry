An Equally Nocturnal Pioneer
----------------------------
The glass architectures exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
in front of it in  
darkness.  
I took on rabid mirrors.  
I wish to make a triangle  
inside, and every hearing, many  
times hidden in a starlight.  
And you fainted in the fear and mixed an attacking trash barge.  
  
To the celestial monastic echo a defender rejoicing will enrich  
the smothered mud of a planet.
