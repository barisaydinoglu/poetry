The Inscription Of Historical Points
------------------------------------
Smooth empire. The circle functions to stand an architecture  
to its architecture.  
Pockets of brick converted into diamond.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
set of autumns and guitars  
and the parsimonious fountains of his native land?  
Like oblivions dropping amid guitars.  
Only crimson car, just the  
apple, nothing but  
it. Drop.  
The reasons for  
my respect  
are set in my finger of silken.  
Because I love you, love, behind the electricity and in front of the earth.
