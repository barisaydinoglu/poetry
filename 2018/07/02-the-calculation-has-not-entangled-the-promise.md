The Calculation Has Not Entangled The Promise
---------------------------------------------
I wish to make a circle  
outside, and every sight, many  
times hidden in a tiger.  
Realized friendly maternity one of them is irreducable,  
the other knows metaphors.  
Where is nobody  
he exclaims, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Against the insatiable land of explosive magnolium.  
With its tremulous make here I am, a full heart chained in the region of kis.  
Like stains fainting within foliages.  
When you discover like mist fluttered by the fire.  
The serendipities exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
in front of it in darkness.  
You mix headlong into a chimney to breathe your business.  
A blood colored and morose window is stole in the night.  
If you were not the cheesecake the eager moon  
cooks, sprinkling its peach across the sea.  
Making the coral of her stone full of purity.  
Outside sand-colored water and silvery smooth stones.  
And you perfume like a flute and the morning droplets you in its mortal lightning.  
Fewer and fewer  
coagulate about another mode of felicity.  
Return to the homeland of the echoes.  
  
Not to enchant or even meet  
the dew of one who gathers  
in me in a sea or entertaining to a fisherman.  
Sometimes a piece of the fire  
devours like a praise in my eye.
