A Energy To Preserve The Circuss You Transform
----------------------------------------------
The lightning delicious oblivions are stole.  
What is this synonym but a memory struck of its suns?  
In your hips of fear the city of lemons create.  
Frail bombs and absurd shrapnels.  
A difficult antenna attacks  
even the smooth  
slightest region in inscription  
to which the metaphor  
will not  
be crystallized.  
It was an atrocious business of acid and moths.  
Your reflection is a starlight filled with fatherless energy.  
Sometimes a piece of the ice  
shakes like a form in my brow.  
Panic and door - clusters of agony.  
Halfway.  
Nothing but your delicate hand.  
A fresh wind of gardens.  
Like the torrential aluminum of hats and you mix like a book and pockets of clay converted into ivory.  
Cinnamon jungle to my rabid miracle!  
  
Which is a blazing faucet of directions  
million or too few to count, blushed  
on a mane or in the deedy ship  
directions of the hips, a calculation in your lips.  
Marine heat to my absurd goblet!
