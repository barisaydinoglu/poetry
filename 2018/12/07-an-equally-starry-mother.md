An Equally Starry Mother
------------------------
In front of the imprisoning wastelands.  
I was without doubt the mountaineer tiger  
there in the acidulous moonlight evening.  
When it looked me with its natural aspen eyes  
it had neither hand nor eyelids  
but ivory threads on its sides.  
Your drop is a branch filled with rigid cluster.  
A current of resplendent kiss  
that does not know why it flows and develops.  
The mosaic  
mixing from my eyeballs.  
A skeleton light day  
neither flint nor home nor turqoise  
nor cinnamon but green.  
The insufferable window that entertains in your promise.
