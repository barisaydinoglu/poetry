A Delicate Substance
--------------------
The brutal maternity that rustles in your fountain.  
Of your ultraviolet fountain when you hold out your mouth.  
What changes the props of pride?  
A dilute flint day  
to the secure color of the paper-mache leaf.  
Only flint, just the  
poppy, nothing but  
it. Sea's skin.  
There are many extinctions outside guilt events.  
My heart moves from being pale to being original.  
Behind the obscene flag, many melancholy vinegars.  
Indicates the star's crystallizing breath.  
  
You say, what is the eddy waiting  
for in its blue moon?  
I tell you it is waiting for forest like you.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.
