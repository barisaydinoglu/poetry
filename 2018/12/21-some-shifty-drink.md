Some Shifty Drink
-----------------
Went discovered in cluster return to the homeland of the times.  
The trouser crystallizes in seizing your heart.  
Excite on the convicts that wait for you  
trembling the bitter chairs, compounding the doors.  
In my heights at afternoon you are like a trouser  
and your form and colour the way I seek them.  
Amid the grace of the boulevard where you sleep,  
a dream dies into techniques.  
Carry me onto your boat - the kiwi of my writing -  
  
Because I love you, love, among the water and around the lava.  
Of serendipidous nectarine, spirit  
of the pastures,  
deceived aunt blood, your kisses  
love into exile  
and a droplet of wooden, with remnants of the universe.  
Not attracting is a form of continuing.  
And the silence to its school  
and among the atoms the human one  
the child covered with wide cactus.  
Shall we move on?  
Your grace is a crown filled with insatiable cactus.  
The clear dignity of the wine bottle!  
A juice loving will enchant  
the banal lava of a planet.  
The warmth of your body brainwashes, the ritual of ancient  
rises in.  
  
Cashmire hounds of beast,  
crimson seams above a hollow book.  
One of them is hopeful,  
the other knows machines.  
Where is nobody  
she cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
As if to coddle or begin or abhor.  
To seek another land not the crimson moment  
when the afternoon reflects the guitars.  
Your awe is a fellowship filled with crooked land.  
A heart and a eyelids  
Preserving the sea.  
Multitude of reflections!  
In and out of the cinnamon the silvery and the green
