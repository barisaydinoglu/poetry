From What Are Quilts Grew
-------------------------
Outside the wetting corpses.  
A dove blossoming will upgrade  
the blood-stained ice of a planet.  
Only thirsty and to a  
stranger they take on time,  
million years  
transluscent green mud to my exiled splendor!  
I could form self-production, pin, and polyp  
from umbrellas and starlights  
with a rust colored serenity  
with legless horses in my fingernails.  
Pockets of iron converted into ceramic.  
My heart moves from being bitter to being velvety.  
You've asked me what the tiger is pacifying there with his sepia brain?  
I reply, the propeller knows this.  
The mother smiles at the father  
but the lady does not smile  
when he looks at the toucan father  
and the worn-out ocean.  
Of delicate wine, spirit  
of the echoes,  
dismantled one blood, your kisses  
rescue into exile  
and a droplet of chalk, with remnants of the moonlight evening.  
I want you to respond on my finger.  
Woke and then stored in the room.  
Some magnify but I perform your aluminum like magnolium.
