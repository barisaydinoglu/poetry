Since The End
-------------
Be guided by the verdure tree's mist.  
Full stop.  
A deep brown grape hears.  
Of a blood colored goddess that perches warmths of your body.  
A chorus of lobsters at lunchtime un discovered un changed  
comes to a halt before a key.  
Guilt morning and the raucous time  
ignore at the walls of my house.  
  
From her hand and her hand rescue  
acrobats of the earth.  
But I should be true to science, rejecting among its motionless mirrors  
so let us begin to divulge a story without public redundancies.  
Of your rust colored moon when you hold out your curves.  
Shining from mourning marble.  
Attracting toward the flag here I am, a great foot buried in the field of bird feather.  
It's a loving lighthouse of waxes.  
There are many violas in front of torrential events.
