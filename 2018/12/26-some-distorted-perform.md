Some Distorted Perform
----------------------
Pockets of brick converted into paper-mache.  
It's a entertaining salt of lightnings.  
The mud boundless parallel yeastss are stole.  
It was the afternoon of the elephant.  
There are no extinctions but blood-stained cycles of bird feather and deep brown  
pencils of humble spoiled metal.  
Responding from wet-winged silicon.  
I'm the uncle to the mirror of immediate tryst.  
Recovered and then rescued in the university.  
A bicycle is not enough to wipe me and keep me  
from the field of your hidden phenomena.  
The home storing from my curves.  
How exciting  
is the somber smoke and it's promising abberations?  
  
It was the holiday of the pheasant.  
Conducting toward the star there are many bloods among decadent  
events.  
Fewer and fewer  
loathe about another mode of happiness.  
If I could rustle the stain and the archipeligos.  
You - the enduring brain.  
Clotting men and children.  
For me they are slightest.  
Carry me onto your vessel - the orange of my vein -  
The plumed dignity of the love!  
Because I love you, love, within the lightning and with the heat.  
In the first take, the homogeneous woman  
is plagued by a cousin. In the second  
scene he returns, to blossom and to mix.  
Nothing but your indespensable breath.  
There are no corruptions but ironous cycles of leaf and cashmire  
foams of soft frightened aluminum.  
  
A enchanting mist of aspens.  
Return to the homeland of the bottles.  
A loaf of bread baked with listless sincerity and salt.  
The land dawning from my hips.
