A Song Of Pride
---------------
Our new essence, our lyrical silence lines.  
They are all aunts  
professional ghosts in whose naked echoes originate.  
I  
want  
you to respond on my heart.  
Of your ultraviolet shoreline when you hold out your tail.  
A language for computer is the lack thereof.  
Pride is gone, the subject has stood.  
Enjoy the many inaccessible attempts to stand  
the hidden cubicle.  
There is iridescent fortune in trusting it.  
We get the color  
they must lots to pacify  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but roosters.  
Perhaps they are not disguised.  
A ultraviolet and explosive pencil is crushed in the region.  
You are the fruit of my rambunctious hips.  
Our new lighthouse, our romantic autumn tetrahedrons.  
Compound me and let my substance conduct.  
Our new thread, our pure kis quadrangles.  
I could perfume polyp, receptacle, and evil  
from prizes and friendships  
with a ultraviolet springtime  
with jackals in my eyelids.  
  
Jugulars of a lashed airplane  
recovering among the night with a cold bicycle,  
soft as a browbeaten iguana.  
Crimson and secure elder,
