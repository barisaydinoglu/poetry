A Apple
-------
In your eye of embarassement the sea of energies wake.  
Only motionless and to a  
one they take on time, million years  
of your turqoise cluster when you hold out your finger.  
Has the modern office been reflected with curiosities?  
Flying a knave  
continued in the stationary drizzle.  
In  
the modern office like rusted nail.  
A rain of kisses a sand-colored hat transforms.  
Lighting from bitten fused quartz.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the somber eddies?  
And the snow unguessed splattering its peaces and protesting them full of  
universe and toucan?  
When you wake like circus travelled by the ice.
