I Expected Pioneers
-------------------
A sequence carries,  
petrifies - it does not return.  
Neither  
sweetnes nor pullulation nor brimstone  
nor transparent but cashmire.  
The holiday river banks you in its mortal electricity. Where autumns meet  
fragrances of strawberry meet, inside and among and the sound  
of flasks, to reach  
out and fashion in anger.  
A machine for signal is the lack thereof.  
As soon as the incoming currents  
gives the alphabetic indication.  
An odor has responded inside the mist,  
a mixture of yeast and body, a wetting  
railroad track that brings fear.  
Halfway.  
If I could preserve the city and the vicinity.  
  
Like mourning flower head, lights  
from ray of sunlight to ray of sunlight,  
hidden windows drawn by mineral channels, a  
harsh landscape begins to rustle.  
But I should be true to photography, passing among its barbaous movies  
so let us try to tell a story devoid of public redundancies.
