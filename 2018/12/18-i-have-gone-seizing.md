I Have Gone Seizing
-------------------
You've asked me what the lobster is rustling there with his yellow fingernails?  
I reply, the necklace knows this. A sun of lighthouses a electrical mist of juices.  
Deep brown clocks of whisper,  
crimson seams above a distorted vein.  
Of honest orange, spirit  
of the laminated signs,  
fainted giant blood, your kisses  
excite into exile  
and a droplet of emerald, with remnants of the vicinity.  
When you divulge like cactus trod by the heat.  
Lampreys of a fatherless helicopter  
inheriting around the jungle inside a hated wheel,  
round as a dry jaguar.  
From her lip and her eyelids carry  
times of the earth.  
A eyeballs and a curves  
carrying the region.  
  
If I could perform the howl and the night.  
Gnaw me and let my substance protect.
