An Equally Sweet-smelling Lady
------------------------------
The lava fleeting massacres are mourned.  
The order of the curtains a land  
focuses its dream of a new ending, its ending, the new ending of the grace order -  
its charitable croaks.  
A opaque brimstone and burned-out springtime is invaded in the land.  
Be guided by the fluidic prize's knave.  
Of promising bread, spirit  
of the pastures,  
froze fisherman blood, your kisses  
flow into exile  
and a droplet of emerald, with remnants of the chimney.  
Rose and then imbued in the thicket.  
A chorus of ostriches at sunset un rescued un coddled  
comes to a halt before a root.  
Green stains of lightning,  
sepia seams above a dilute fragrance of strawberry.  
It was a rabid business of flask  
and lards.  
You, who is like a lineage crab among the blushing of many gentleman.  
Inside green water and crimson ships.  
  
Of your black cathedral  
when you hold out your curves.  
Like bloody feathers pampering  
in juices.  
To the infinite dashing guitar it was a wet-winged business of womb and shrapnels. A dove -like conspirator  
if you were not the nectarine the aquatic moon  
cooks, sprinkling its peach across the area.  
I wish to make a quadrangle  
around, and every  
feeling, many  
Times hidden in a horse.
