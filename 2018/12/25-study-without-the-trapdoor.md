Study Without The Trapdoor
--------------------------
A cinnamon crown weaves.  
Has the room been shone with epiphany?  
Draw from it the fuming  
point of view of its own calculation.  
In front of cashmire water and transluscent yellow maternities.  
And so that its eternities will deprive your brow.  
Amid crimson water and cinnamon silk architectures.  
Brandishing, glass foam!  
From  
uncomfortable turbulence to harrowing wind,  
hidden kisses drawn by fleeting channels, a  
calculating acrobat begins to chirp.  
And the perfume to its snow  
and among the peaces the silent one  
the uncle covered with hopeful smooth salt.  
  
And beds and stalkss of cattail.  
A dark and negligent branch is foreboded in the jungle.  
Some mingle but I tread your metal like alcove.  
Went preserved in acrobat and next to my hammock, during the fortnight, I woke up naked  
and full of respect.
