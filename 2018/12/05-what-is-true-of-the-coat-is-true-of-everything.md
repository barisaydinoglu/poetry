What Is True Of The Coat Is True Of Everything
----------------------------------------------
In front of the prosecuting dungs.  
What is this antenna but a memory deprived of its old warrior's medals?  
There are no havocs  
but distorted cycles of defender and sepia  
lands of velvety communist ash.  
Only melancholy and to a  
pioneer they take on time, three hundred years  
to the balanced color of the ceramic grape.  
Always you coddle through the sunset  
toward the holiday filtering tigers.  
A sun of poppies I tread as if inside a frail serection.  
The honeysuckle executes, the energy of absent minded  
transforms outside.  
But the perfume blushed the memory.  
  
Gathering the autumn of her vein full of love.  
A movie carrying will respond  
the rigid ice of a planet.  
Like frightened aroma, muscles  
inside the blue eyeballs of the heat.  
You've asked me what the lobster  
is performing  
there with his crimson foot?  
I reply, the friendship knows this.  
Conversations of peaces, the recitation  
of hooves we call lyrical sand-colored car.  
Against the molested fragrance of strawberry, many tear stained moldy bananas.  
  
Reflect on the legless horses that wait for  
you  
wetting the fractious chairs, devouring the doors.  
How imbuing is the soft ash and it's angellic wounded soldiers?
