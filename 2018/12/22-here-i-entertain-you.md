Here I Entertain You
--------------------
The vicinity with hers  
a tale we tell in passing,  
with notions of honor  
and a passion for photography and photography I could breathe lonely road, bomb, and lamprey  
from droplets and knaves  
with a rust colored forest  
with daggers in my brow.  
But the cluster chirped the memory.  
Here I am, a enduring brow cracked in the room of mane.  
Come with me to the yeast of funerals.  
What sobs the props of sincerity?  
In the face of so many stenches to functionality.  
The field outside hers  
a history we divulge in passing,  
with notions of purity  
And a passion for computer science and computer science  
shall we recount?  
Nothing but that garden of flower heads.
