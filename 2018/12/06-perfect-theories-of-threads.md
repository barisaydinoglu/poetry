Perfect Theories Of Threads
---------------------------
A fog of moons you are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the arcane landscapes?  
And the fog musical splattering its quilts and hating them full of  
jungle and toucan?  
Of your blood colored affection when you hold out your hand.  
Once there was a clotting bride who  
dedicated at parties, sitting in a loop,  
among honeysuckles.  
Moon.  
Everybody here is waiting for the next juice.  
Book. You returned yourself for beginning.  
Joy is gone, the subject has sought.  
The candle responds in pacifying your brow.  
Fewer and fewer  
pass about another mode of joy.  
  
The delicious  
rose gave it wonder.  
Chaotic weather, burned-out lights like the fountain.  
  
Not the silvery moment  
when the sunset enriches the flower heads.
