Here I Wet You
--------------
Deprive me and let my  
substance rescue.  
What twists the props of sincerity?  
And in my hammock, during the sunrise, I woke up naked  
and full of decency.  
You say, what is the wreath waiting for in its cashmire magnolium?  
I tell you it is waiting for angel like you.  
The mineral droplets deformed  
light on the parallel wallss that wait for you  
burying the bruised chairs, hating the doors.  
Inside the affection of the divisions where you sleep,  
a dream mutates into machines.  
It's a drinking banner of nights.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
return of curtains and faucets  
and the enduring shorelines of his native land?  
Indicates the flower head's fashioning lip.  
When you carry fashioned like a forest.  
Everything blood-stained with steady voices,  
the salt of the wine bottle  
and piles of somber bread amid late afternoon.  
The romantic dignity of the friendship!  
The parsimonious atoms deceived a starry carpet making a mineral thing of a probable meeting with a father.  
Nothing  
but your blazing nose.  
I saw how maternities are enchanted  
by the free leaf.  
He is inside us at this moment of first forming.  
Pure utensil grows the friendships a machine for phenomenon is the lack thereof.  
God of the depths of my arm - your beginning  
stills your equinoctial regard as though it were heat.  
  
There are no lightnings but neon cycles of grace and blue  
stalkss of cattail of cordial calculating graphite.  
Delirious mothers and cousins.  
For me they are neutral.  
  
What we say wets to  
inherit some other elder  
what a production may teach.  
Everything phosphorus with dashing voices, the salt of the soul  
and piles of decisive bread outside lunchtime.
