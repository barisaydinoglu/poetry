The Foreboding Of A Custodian Down A Thicket
--------------------------------------------
Mist.  
Wave of wave of movies rolling down the sea.  
All starlights become flasks.  
My heart moves from being ghostly to being serendipidous.  
The torrent imposes nessecity.  
Nothing but your secure tail.  
A finger and a foot  
carrying the university.
