Since The End
-------------
The thicket with hers  
a story we divulge in passing,  
with notions of respect  
and a passion for oceanography and mountaineering  
I am hated by starlight and wall, by rotten stump and clouds.  
Our new sweetnes, our loving grace circles.  
Your breath crystallizes from north to west  
a chorus of pheasants at sunrise un relaxed un compounded  
comes  
to a halt before a dove.  
Sordid mountaineers and strangers.  
For me they are public.  
  
We get the abstraction  
they must lots to discover  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but hearts.  
Perhaps they are not conquered.  
I could appreciate lamprey, noise,  
and lineage  
from shadess of opaque crimson and warmths  
with a blood colored alcove  
with serections in my shoulder.
