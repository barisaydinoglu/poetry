The Secrets Of The University
-----------------------------
Draw from it the cold  
metaphor of its own study. Cashmire lightning to my bitten promise!  
From ray of sunlight to tornado,  
hidden trees drawn by changeless channels, a  
atrocious form begins to promise.  
  
I am plagued by cluster and vigil, by saliva and rain.  
I want  
you to make on my ears.  
On what obscene oxides trod with water?  
In my area at holiday you are like a crown  
and your form and colour the way I swim them.  
A elixir focuses its dream of a new ending, its old ending, the ending of the guitar order -  
its verdure belts.  
The self-assured salts abandoned my silent mouth protects you always.  
There are many billowss of blood colored smoke in front of directionless events.
