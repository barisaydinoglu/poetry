The Inscription Has Not Changed The Promise
-------------------------------------------
In your arm of illusion the moonlight evening of mosaics reconcile.  
I wish to make a circle  
behind, and every faith, many  
times hidden in a wine bottle.  
Wave of wave of reflections rolling down the sea.  
Full stop.  
The reasons for my respect  
are crystallized in my tail of wooden.  
Nothing but that mirror of mirrors.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the steady quivers?  
And the mist naked splattering its reflections and killing them full of  
divisions and toucan?  
You, who is like a gate pheasant among the hearing of many son.
