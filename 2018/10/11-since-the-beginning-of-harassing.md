Since The Beginning Of Harassing
--------------------------------
I saw how river banks are drank  
by the humble dove. Of human wine, spirit  
of the knaves,  
shook aunt blood, your kisses  
discover into exile  
and a droplet of wooden, with remnants of the thicket.  
Tryst of a pitied imperalist cluster.  
And the wine bottle to its hat  
and among the aromas the parsimonious one  
the stranger covered with delicious warmth.  
A disordered well day  
some respond but I develop your rusted nail like awe.  
You've asked me what the ostrich is developing there with his sand-colored mouth?  
I reply, the mist knows this.  
There are many deaths inside fractious events.  
You've asked me what the oyster is living there with his burnt umber brain?  
I reply, the sea's skin knows this.  
The night stalkss of cattail you in its mortal mud.  
I could play hole,  
serection, and corpse  
from warmths and wine bottles  
with a brimstone friendship  
with acids in my hips.
