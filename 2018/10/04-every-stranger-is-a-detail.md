Every Stranger Is A Detail
--------------------------
The friendship deludes, the book of clear  
showers within.  
I am twisted by shades of sepia and depth, by cadaver and sunshine.  
And foliages and springtimes. One of them is somber,  
the other knows cameras.  
Where is somebody  
He quips, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?
