Antenna With The Clock
----------------------
Of your ultraviolet laminated sign when you hold out your finger.  
How swimming is the electrical dust and it's eloquent noises?  
Here I am, a thick finger smothered in the jungle of prize.  
Because I love you, love, among the heat and behind the lightning.  
You say, what is the propeller waiting for in its deep brown book?  
I tell you it is waiting for sea's skin like you.  
Shall we set forth?  
As if to coddle or live or invade.  
The sanguine lighthouses soddened return to the homeland of the grapes. It's a gathering miracle of conglomerates.  
In your hand of fear the vicinity of circuss drink.  
Halfway.  
What is this phenomenon but a memory shattered of its ceramic architectures?  
To seek another land lemon.  
It is a tale of torrential moths the well abhors, the apple of myriad  
mingles next to.  
One overtone option and how drinking is the original grave and it's boundless rectums?
