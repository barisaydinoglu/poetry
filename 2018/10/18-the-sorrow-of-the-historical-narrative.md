The Sorrow Of The Historical Narrative
--------------------------------------
Enjoy the many senile attempts to mix  
the real vagabond.  
There is cordial fortune in beginning it.  
A mist of sea shells only exiled and to a  
daughter they take on time, too many to count years  
the hidden gentleman  
connects in the charitable morning.  
For aroma was boneless and morally negative.  
Sometimes a piece of the heat  
deludes like a kis in my finger.  
To seek another land the oily maternity that begins in your flower head.  
Serenity of a soddened parched thread.
