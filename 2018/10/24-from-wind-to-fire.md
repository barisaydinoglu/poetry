From Wind To Fire
-----------------
A chorus of turkeys at day un transformed un deluded  
comes to a halt before a quiver.  
When you develop like guitar formed by the clay.  
I wish to make a line segment  
Next to, and every color, many  
times hidden in a magnolium.  
It's a exciting wreath of circumstances.  
A current of balanced flag  
that does not know why it flows and fashions.  
You say, what is the ship waiting for in its deep brown telegraph?  
I tell you it is waiting for stalks of cattail like you.  
  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
So the essential joy lives on in a grape,  
the pure house of the wave,  
the delicious map that is smooth and careful.
