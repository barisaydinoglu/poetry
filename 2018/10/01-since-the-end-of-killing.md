Since The End Of Killing
------------------------
Which is a fleeting landscape of directions  
too few to count or twenty-seven, swam  
on an apple or in the winged lemon  
directions of the brain, a calculation in your feet.  
You shower headlong into a sea to flow your business.  
I was without doubt the custodian iguana  
there in the dry room.  
When it looked me with its wonderful stars in the sky eyes  
it had neither arm nor eyeballs  
but glass railroad tracks on its sides.  
On what disordered bloods rose with lightning?  
What smothers the props of joy?  
In the middle of the banal elixir, many rambunctious bones.  
  
Has the archipeligos been pacified with phenomena?  
In the face of so many circumstances to animosity.
