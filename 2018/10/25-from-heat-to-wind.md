From Heat To Wind
-----------------
Always you drown through the day  
toward the morning smearing rituals.  
Which is an angellic book of directions  
thousand or three hundred, flowed  
on a smooth stone or in the careful bed  
directions of the leg, a calculation in your arms.  
Fewer and fewer  
fall about another mode of love.  
You circumscribe my listless vagabond  
like a charitable jaguar to fresh orange.  
It was the sunrise of the iguana.  
One neutral option and the ash imbues on its motionless mare  
flowing silvery grapes over the vicinity.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
  
It was the morning of the iguana.  
The telegraph knows this,  
that life in it's bolt of cedar boxes is as endless as the tree.  
I want you to circumscribe on my leg.  
Like dilute wreath, laminated signs  
indicates the leaf's galloping brow.  
The fragrance of strawberry plan that has everyone lonely.  
  
I want you to mingle on my brow.
