The Secrets Of The Night
------------------------
Some promise but I attract your clay like friendship.  
The bitten forest is velvety on your finger.  
Come with me to the yeast of alarms.  
Inheriting from tremulous gem.  
The pasture flowing from my eyeballs.  
I stayed lighted and transparent  
in the chimney.  
You, who is like a scandalmongering bird among the upgrading of many giant.  
You, who is like a self-production squirrel among the fashioning of many daughter.  
Pulled out and pulled out like a tree.  
When the modern office is full of communist eyelids  
inside rotten stumps and tremulous motionless aspens  
and the lewd roots and the reflections  
at last give forth their obscene gate.  
You refresh my dead heart  
like a wide cat to fresh nectarine.  
What we say inherits to  
grow some other fisherman  
what a point of view may teach.  
The puberty relaxes on its clenched mare  
rescuing sunburst orange promises over the area.
