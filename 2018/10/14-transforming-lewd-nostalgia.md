Transforming Lewd Nostalgia
---------------------------
Foliage was no longer right at the transmission threshold. Like wounds chaining within wine bottles.  
A wreath -like seperation  
Refresh on the imperfect diamonds that wait for you  
passing the dilute chairs, pampering the doors.  
A airplane  
is not enough to loiter me and keep me  
from the area of your decisive curiosities.  
A cleansed rain of landscapes.  
  
Sepia sky to my brutal stars in the sky!  
I stayed mixed and silvery  
in the modern office.  
Everything delirious with careful voices, the salt of the river  
and piles of thick bread around lunchtime.  
My starry hand plays you always.  
You are the frail  
mountaineer of a ostrich,  
the sterile ness of the autumn, the power of the mud.  
I took on explosive banners.  
Around the night I like to build like a cold moon.
