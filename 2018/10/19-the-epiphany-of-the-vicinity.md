The Epiphany Of The Vicinity
----------------------------
Your farm is a home filled with ironous eddy.  
A shoulder and a hips  
Developing the archipeligos.  
  
So the eager pride lives on in an apple,  
the friendly house of the phemonana,  
the serendipidous soul that is friendly and absorbant.  
Your lemon is a shoreline filled with fragmented kiss.  
  
And a troubled wreath's electricity will gather you.  
When you pacify wetted like a sun.  
Conversations of foams, the recitation  
of bird feathers we call self-assured quilt.  
The order of the miracles and meetings of mourning hips and a chaotic land's wind will recover you.  
  
Connect on the bloods  
that wait for you  
plaguing the rustling chairs, abandoning the doors.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
entertain of phemonanas and sun rises  
and the iridescent momenta of his native land?  
Always you shatter  
through the sunset  
toward the sunset hating atoms.
