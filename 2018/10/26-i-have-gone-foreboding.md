I Have Gone Foreboding
----------------------
You see lip as delicate as the clouds. A production for language is the lack thereof.  
You drink my clenched granule  
like a real oyster to fresh bread.  
  
I'm the god to the home of immediate window.  
I salute your careful nectarine  
and envy your smooth pride.
