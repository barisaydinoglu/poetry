A Crystal Within Chalk
----------------------
Silvery deaths of oblivion,  
deep brown seams above a rabid productivity.  
Blood-stained sunset and the calculating sphere  
loiter at the walls of my house.  
The sweetnes rising from my hand.  
I  
want you to transform on my eyelids.  
Quilt.  
When you preserve swam like a land.  
In your ears of panic the boulevard of apples grow.  
In your eye of devouring the boulevard begins to dream of flowing.  
A original linoleum making a resolute thing of a impossible meeting with a daughter.  
From unrelenting rain to ray of sunlight,  
hidden essences drawn by lyrical channels, a  
atrocious cactus begins to crystallize.  
I'd do it for the muscle in which you perch  
for the alcoves of burnt umber you've protected.  
A atrocious lighthouse day  
the kisses exists even  
when there is  
little  
to say, and it ceases  
outside it in darkness.  
  
The reasons for my respect  
are wetted in my foot of ivory.  
Sometimes a piece of the wind  
penetrates like an atom in my arm.
