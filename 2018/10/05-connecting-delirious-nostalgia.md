Connecting Delirious Nostalgia
------------------------------
And you dedicate like a pasture and transluscent marine ashes of trash barge,  
deep brown seams above a windy star.  
Not the deep brown moment  
when the fortnight rustles the phemonanas.  
Bridge of a degraded difficult bird feather.  
My plumed toe enchants you always.  
Wave of wave of planetariums rolling down the sea.  
Opaque green and natural woman,  
  
Neither ship nor marine car nor red  
nor silvery but silvery.  
Like nougats gnawing in front of alcoves.
