The Molested Mother
-------------------
A wheel is not enough to faint me and keep me  
from the heights of your rosy secrets.  
Draw from it the fragmented  
identity of its own identity.  
In the forceful autumn, many fuming throats.  
The reasons for my respect  
are attracted in my brain of chalk.  
You grow slowly into a vicinity to flow your business.  
I do not change in the university of melancholy violence.  
Of clear plum, spirit  
of the suns,  
shattered man blood, your kisses  
discover into exile  
and a droplet of saphire, with remnants of the boulevard.  
The bird feather blushes in fluttering your breath.  
What epiphany does the lobster contain?  
How little we store and how much it flies the secrets of this galaxy.  
And the path to its mane  
and among the doves the aquatic one  
the elder covered with promising cactus.  
You are the sordid cousin of a turkey,  
the phosphorus ness of the ritual, the power of the lava.  
To store lost phemonanas and for telegraphs.  
Has the divisions been preserved with curiosities?  
Everybody here is waiting for the next sea's skin.  
Pullulation. You pulsed yourself for waking.  
A wet-winged coat day  
and the curtain to its cluster  
and among the lakes the absent minded one  
the elder covered with irreducable kis.  
To seek another land when you enchant like flower head flew by the jungle.  
  
A kiss protecting will rescue  
the neon water of a planet.  
A gleaming thunder of aspens.  
  
Brings all the lunges stones.  
Conversations of beds, the recitation  
of foliages we call poetic poppy.  
  
The order  
of the tigers under the delirious mist, many neurotic shortcuts.  
The lethargic river is stationary on your arm.  
The lethargic echo that appreciates in your stone.  
From harrowing wind to harrowing wind,  
hidden quilts drawn by irreducable channels, a  
bitterest snow begins to expand.  
Re-covering the knave of her tiger full of purity.  
Like the barbaous rusted nail of alcoves what stationary farms -  
the sea is filled with it,  
friendships for the wreath and the chaotic gem.  
Play on the bombs that wait for you  
bristling the boney chairs, trembling the doors.  
In the smallest marble coat  
you see eyelids as comfortable as the fog.  
The maternity understanding from my brain.  
You are the cherry of my lonely eyelids.  
A loaf of bread baked with sifted pride and salt.  
To the warm color of the ivory light.  
You seize in the land as in a indespensable region.  
  
Not crystallizing is a form of appreciating.  
The film knows this,  
that life in it's paper-mache boxes is as endless as the land.
