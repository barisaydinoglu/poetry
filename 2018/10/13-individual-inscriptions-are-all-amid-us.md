Individual Inscriptions Are All Amid Us
---------------------------------------
You are the ghostly fisherman of a lobster,  
the shaken ness of the marine car, the power of the earth.  
Shut out and shut up like a hat.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another. I stayed preserved and transluscent sepia  
behind the city.  
I dedicate as if among a neurotic smoke.  
And crowns and maps.  
Only propeller, just the  
rose, nothing but  
it. Opaque sand-colored car.
