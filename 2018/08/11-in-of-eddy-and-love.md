In Of Eddy And Love
-------------------
Discovered and then returned in the field.  
What pure ships -  
the universe is filled with it,  
trousers for the kiss and the worn-out ceramic.  
A vessel is not enough to replace me and keep me  
from the archipeligos of your deedy curiosities.  
The apple plan that has everyone disordered.  
My heart moves from being fractious to being promising. All marine cars become funerals.
