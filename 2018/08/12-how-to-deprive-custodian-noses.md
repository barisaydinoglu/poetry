How To Deprive Custodian Noses
------------------------------
A sequence for production is the lack thereof.  
Promising an aroma  
set in the eager rain.  
It was the fortnight of the toucan.  
Your maternity is a stars in the sky filled with obscene key.  
It was the night of the tiger.  
Brings all the falters windows.  
Which is  
a parenthetical ritual of directions  
thousand or too many to count, relaxed  
on a home or in the absorbant productivity  
directions of the toe, a calculation in your lips.  
I was without doubt the father ostrich  
there in the obscene region.  
When it looked me with its naked sand-colored lake eyes  
it had neither leg nor arm  
but silk stones on its sides.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem  
so to another.  
Enjoy the many guilt attempts to swim  
the essential bramble.  
There is great fortune in dedicating it.  
When you crystallize seized like a miracle.  
Not to magnify or even meet  
the evening star of one who recovers  
outside me in a jungle or reconciling to a uncle.  
Of a dull shades of silvery custodian that enchants flags.  
  
Only lonely and to a  
woman they take on time, too many to count years  
but I should be true to engineering, abhorring among its putrid silences  
so let us begin to speak a story without public redundancies.
