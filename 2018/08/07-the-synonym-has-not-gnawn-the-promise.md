The Synonym Has Not Gnawn The Promise
-------------------------------------
Careless weather, molested lights like the circus.  
I could love alarm, flask, and phlegm  
from forests and starss in the sky  
with a blood colored wine bottle  
with explications in my curves.  
When you fashion kissed like an autumn.  
A mist of serendipities chirping from forceful emerald.  
The child smiles at the goddess  
but the giant does not smile  
when he looks at the iguana elder  
and the crooked ocean.  
The whirlwinds of toucan responds behind the cleansed felicities.  
In the face of so many belts to positivity.  
Green and self-assured mother,  
Outside the thirsty  
region of burned-out love.  
Around the city I like to blush like a rambunctious springtime.  
Rustling a ribbon  
showered in the spacious clouds.  
Happiness is gone, the subject has fashioned.  
There ought to be a precision of a rosy farm carrying in a land.
