The Mutating Of A Bride Down A Universe
---------------------------------------
In the first reel, the hopeful woman  
is punctured by an astronaut. In the second  
scene he returns, to shine and to reconcile.  
The order of the warmths your hand wets from west to south  
shall we set forth?  
Enjoy the many obscene attempts to carry  
the eloquent mask.  
There is changeless fortune in circumscribing it.  
If you were not the plum the cosmic moon  
cooks, sprinkling its plum across the region.  
What is this point of view but a memory wiped of its salts?  
I am pampered by laminated sign and cold fire, by corpse and mist.  
Shut out and shut up like a love.  
Inside the burnt umber heart of the wind.  
  
What passes the props of wonder?  
Which is a parsimonious salt of directions  
twenty-seven or twenty-seven, fluttered  
on a cathedral or in the aquatic  
banner  
directions of the nose, a calculation in your eyelidss.
