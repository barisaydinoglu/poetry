Tonight I Can Fly
-----------------
From her mouth and her brain seek  
dews of the earth.  
Of a dull shades of transparent uncle that responds aromas.  
When you make flew like a sun.  
  
Gallop on the brambles that wait for you  
attacking the callous chairs, abolishing the doors.  
There are no extinctions but hushed cycles of affection and sepia  
horses of moonlit rigid steel.  
You travel my cold lonely road  
like a enchanting tiger to fresh grape.  
A fog of stars illusion and hat - awes of beligerance.
