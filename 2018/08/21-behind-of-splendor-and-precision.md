Behind Of Splendor And Precision
--------------------------------
The shaken lobster rises outside the serendipidous seperations.  
You seize headlong into an area to mix your business.  
The indespensable daughter  
fashions in the myriad morning.  
It's a storing garden of wounded soldiers.  
I'd do  
it for the aspen in which you create  
for the alcoves of marine you've pulsed.  
Everything rustling with electric voices, the salt of the precision  
and piles of angellic bread among morning.  
With the green brow of the lightning.  
A dark and oily bridge is wiped in the divisions.  
  
A chaotic technique deludes  
even the perfect  
historical boulevard in detail  
to which the metaphor  
will not be upgraded.  
Here I am, a slender heart filtered in the heights of grace.
