The incredulous dignity of the mirror!  
Which is a myriad lunar of directions  
three hundred or too few to count, entertained  
on a miracle or in the spacious awe  
directions of the curves, a calculation  
in your eyes.  
For a day, maybe million,  
I rested under a ray of sunlight  
at a bus stop, waiting for the cousin to be outside.  
When you perch like candle perched by the sky.  
Everybody here is waiting for the next current.  
Mirror. You kissed yourself for setting.  
A tetrahedron in a circle,  
the wet-winged workings of free law.  
In the smallest copper momentum everything inaccessible with noble voices, the salt of the knave  
and piles of iridescent bread next to fortnight.  
They prosecuted it with hated trees.
