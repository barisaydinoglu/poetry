A Song Of Joy
-------------
I do not sodden in the land of absurd wasteland. To the sweet-smelling thick faucet one of them is resplendent,  
the other knows productions.  
Where is noone  
she quips, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Of your gray flower head when you hold out your arm.  
In the misunderstood universe of burned-out goblet.  
The reasons for my respect  
are woke in my eyelids of silken.  
Disintered weather, violenet lights like the wave.  
It was the sunset of the ostrich.  
Gathering a door  
divulged in the solute clouds.  
Not carrying is a form of rescuing.  
When you understand like starry sky relaxed by the wind.  
Forceful morning and the shifty praise  
compound at the walls of my house.  
Like crooked hoove, paths  
for smooth rusted nail was ironous and morally positive.  
Inside the ritual of the area where you sleep,  
a dream falters into antennae.  
And echoes and salts.  
  
It was the holiday of the bird.  
Perching the awe of her wine bottle full of pride.  
Path was no longer below the recording threshold.
