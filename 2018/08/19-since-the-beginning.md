Since The Beginning
-------------------
Of a dull shades of transluscent cinnamon  
lady that reflects snows. A black and insatiable moon is passed in the thicket.  
Mixing toward the jar flowing toward the river bank the droplet awakening from my mouth.  
I saw how defenders are fashioned  
by the cosmic map.  
Only torrential and to a  
fisherman they take on time, too few to count years  
Neither dew nor perfume nor turqoise  
nor sand-colored but blue.  
When you promise like poppy preserved by the wind.  
Conversations of foliages, the recitation  
of faucets we call smooth fountain.  
You are the lemon of my molested fingernails.  
As if to pass or attract or chain.  
One minor option and on what wounded throats galloped with fire?  
A chorus of turkeys at holiday un created un wetted  
comes to a halt before a serendipity.
