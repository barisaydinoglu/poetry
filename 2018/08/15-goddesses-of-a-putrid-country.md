Goddesses Of A Putrid Country
-----------------------------
An odor has mingled behind the wheatfield,  
a mixture of cold fire and body, a mixing  
kiss that brings beligerance. I saw how breakfasts are mixed  
by the absorbant root.  
The reasons for my respect  
are attracted in my heart of crystal.  
Bitterest scandalmongerings and callous billows of dark smoke.  
I took on boney friendships.  
Wave of wave of ripples rolling down the sea.  
I want you to grow on my arm.  
A nose and a hips  
galloping the divisions.  
  
It relinquishes like a film inside the aroma.  
This rabid wheatfield and perfuming jar punctures me  
with it's plumed farms like shoulder and leg  
and brimstone sea shells like curves and friendships.
