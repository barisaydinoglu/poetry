Machine With The Puberty
------------------------
And flutes and wheatfields.  
The droplet knows this,  
that life in it's copper boxes is as endless as the old warrior's medal.  
Went wetted in flesh your curtain is a femininity filled with hushed nature.  
Of your dark aspen when you hold out your curves.  
There are many scandalmongerings in front of obscene events.  
Pure shadow returns the splendors we get the abstraction  
they must lots to drink  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but violences.  
Perhaps they are not silenced.  
A eddy dedicating will magnify  
the insatiable wind of a planet.  
I am lunged by current and pigeon hole, by abberation and wind.  
It reflects like a knave in front of the smooth stone.  
In your fingernails of stealing the boulevard begins to dream of mingling.  
It was the lunchtime of the ostrich.  
It is a tale of inevitable polyps lunge me and let my substance attract.  
The obscene sun rise that responds in your leaf.  
  
It was the afternoon of the elephant.
