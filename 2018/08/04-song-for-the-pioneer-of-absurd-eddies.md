Song For The Pioneer Of Absurd Eddies
-------------------------------------
Animosity and dew - lands of anger.  
If you were not the apple the parenthetical moon  
cooks, sprinkling  
its orange across the land.  
Not the crimson moment  
when the morning builds the wheatfields.  
Sunburst orange flasks of legless horse,  
transluscent cashmire seams above a hushed eddy.
