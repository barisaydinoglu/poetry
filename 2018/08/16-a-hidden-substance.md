A Hidden Substance
------------------
Once there was a forceful person who  
mixed at parties, sitting in a circle, among films.  
Divulging from insufferable ceramic.  
And you'll ask  
why doesn't his poetry  
respond of landscapes and quilts  
and the parenthetical graces of his native land? As soon as the incoming keys  
gives the minor indication.
