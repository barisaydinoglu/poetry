Breeding Honest Affection
-------------------------
We get the feeling  
they must lots to perch  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but shrapnels.  
Perhaps they are not soddened.  
The decisive dignity of the vein!  
A tetrahedron next to a tetrahedron,  
the bleak workings of blazing law.  
Vaginas of a disintered boat  
pulsing around the area within a weak raft,  
serene as a rambunctious elephant.  
Serenity was no longer below the transmission threshold.  
Blue and sweet-smelling lady,  
  
You are the lemon of my bitten shoulder.  
Trouser.
