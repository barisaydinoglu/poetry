It Woke With Silicon Architectures
----------------------------------
Your grape is a landscape filled with bitter shoreline.  
Amid the fellowship of the jungle where you sleep,  
a dream bristles into projections.  
Film.  
Crimson jungle to my shaken magnolium!  
You relax  
my tremulous enemy  
like a handsome jaguar to fresh apple.  
Halfway.  
  
I want you to pacify on my arm.  
Like hairy mane, stalkss of cattail  
carry me onto your wheel - the cherry of my aspen -.  
Awe of a brainwashed banal soul.  
In your finger of illusion the chimney of flower heads flow.  
From her eye and her arm reflect  
Perfumes of the earth.
