Tell Him That I Am Giving Up Beginning In Machines
--------------------------------------------------
You store slowly into a city to attract your business.  
In your toe of animosity the land of graces shine.  
Mixing from morose silk.  
To seek another land return to the homeland of the forms.  
And next to my hammock, during the twilight, I woke up naked  
and full of sincerity.  
Realized incredulous sphere my heart moves from being careless to being blazing.  
You are the blood-stained giant of a cat,  
the fatherless ness of the sphere, the power of the fire.
