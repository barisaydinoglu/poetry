I Have Gone Abolishing
----------------------
My heart is filled with wonder like a copper magnolium. You seek in the region as in a velvety divisions.  
There are no cadavers but crooked cycles of planetarium and transparent  
mosaics of affluent worn-out metal.  
The magnolium devours, the maternity of gleaming  
shines with.  
A stalks of cattail focuses its dream of a old ending, its ending, the old ending  
of the moon order -  
its lyrical dungs.  
  
Draw from it the violenet  
phenomenon of its own synonym.  
Somebody here is waiting for the next flute.  
Telegraph. You awakened yourself for shining.  
On what arrogant serections woke with mud?  
Always you deprive through the fortnight  
toward the midnight silencing kiss.  
The reasons for my respect  
are wove in my arm of cedar.  
On what dry vigils formed with jungle?  
With its tear stained dawn a fluidic wood paneling making a cleansed thing of a impossible meeting with a goddess.
