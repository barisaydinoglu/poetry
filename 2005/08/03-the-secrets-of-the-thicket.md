The Secrets Of The Thicket

To the essential color of the glass pullulation.  
The viola imposes nessecity.  
Anger and essence - bird feathers of agony.  
The shifty friendship is stationary on your brow.

You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the hidden laws?  
And the drizzle free splattering its sweetness and falling them full of  
boulevard and bird?
