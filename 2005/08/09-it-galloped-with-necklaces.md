It Galloped With Necklaces
--------------------------
Shut out and closed off like a form.  
I'd do it for the vein in which you build  
for the miracles of cashmire you've excited.  
The bell building from my curves.  
Neither diamond architecture nor perfume nor black  
nor green but yellow.  
  
Nothing but your lovely lip.
