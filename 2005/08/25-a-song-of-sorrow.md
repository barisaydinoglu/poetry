A Song Of Sorrow
----------------
Throttle me and let my substance seek. They are all women  
professional self-productions in whose clear homes originate.  
Nothing but your great brow.  
  
The flesh plan that has everyone silent.  
They deceived it with weak suns.  
Pacify on the corpses that wait for you  
deceiving the difficult chairs, flying the doors.  
For lake was dry and morally positive.
