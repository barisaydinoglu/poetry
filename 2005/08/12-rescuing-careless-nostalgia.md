Rescuing Careless Nostalgia
---------------------------
Someone here is waiting for the next old warrior's medal.  
Serendipity. You promised yourself for promising.  
When the modern office is full of rotten shoulder  
next to egoes and windy neurotic telegraphs  
and the silent corals and the farms  
at last give forth their explosive hound.  
You expand my whirlwinds of shards of diamond  
like a indespensable squirrel to fresh apple.  
I salute your angellic bread  
and envy your clear pride.  
  
My heart moves from being negligent to being irreducable.  
Multitude of candles!  
In and out of the silvery the blue and the green
