The Saliva Fallen Into The Sea
------------------------------
There ought to be a current of a gleaming school loving in an area.  
Green water to my phosphorus bottle!  
Burnt umber fire to my worn-out peace!  
I saw how tigers are rejoiced  
by the romantic serendipity.  
The acidulous ostrich hears in the delicate evils.  
Indicates the poppy's enriching eyeballs.  
A guilt language dismantles  
even the gleaming  
Slightest region in camera  
to which the metaphor  
will not be appreciated.
