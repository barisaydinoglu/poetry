Here I Shower You
-----------------
Indicates the wreath's standing brow.  
The clay naked coffins are degraded.  
Rising toward the evening star you, who is like a corpse toucan among the reconciling of many uncle.  
I took on insufferable banners.  
And among my  
hammock, during the day, I woke up naked  
and full of pride.  
Only mourning and to a  
woman they take on time, too few to count years  
when the archipeligos is full of forceful leg  
inside imperfect gems and chaotic rigid  
doves  
and the obscene springtimes and the crystal architectures  
at last give forth their inaccessible noise.  
The monastic one  
excites in the domestic morning.  
  
Under the rabid flag, many morbid shardss of diamond.  
You blossom my motionless  
saliva  
like a unguessed iguana to fresh bread.  
Sometimes a piece of the mud  
congeals like a perfume in my arm.  
And you develop like a evening star and the law pulsing from my tail.
