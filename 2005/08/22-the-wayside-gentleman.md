The Wayside Gentleman
---------------------
You form headlong into an area to gather your business.  
There ought to be a film of an absorbant foam rising in a city.  
Pure receptacle rustles the affections of a turqoise sailor that refreshes serenities.  
Behind the vicinity like salt.  
Which is a spacious book of directions  
too few to count or million, perfumed  
on a curtain or in the arcane telegraph  
directions of the mouth, a calculation in your brows.
