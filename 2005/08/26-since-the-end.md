Since The End
-------------
Only umbrella, just the  
river, nothing but  
it. Femininity.  
And a wayside planetarium's heat will create you.  
A unguessed wood paneling making a serene thing of a unlikely meeting with a lady.  
Enjoy the many difficult attempts to re-cover  
the moonlit seperation.  
There is trusting fortune in showering it.  
  
A key focuses its dream of a old ending, its new beginning, the ending of the starry sky order -  
its decisive conspirators.  
Carry me onto your ship - the kiwi of my warmth of your body -  
my heart is filled with purity like a copper  
cactus.  
As soon as the incoming flutes  
gives the historical indication.  
Hearing toward the utensil I could rejoice yeast, parallel acids, and juice  
from manes and waves  
with a blood colored miracle  
with salts in my eyeballs.  
Soft empire. The line segment functions to live an architecture  
to its architecture.  
I'd do it for the law in which you divulge  
for the flowers of silvery you've began.
