Negligent Splendor
------------------
A camera lives,  
deprives - it does not return.  
So the acerb sincerity lives on in a grape,  
the resolute house of the apple,  
the thick planetarium that is handsome and humble.  
And the springtime to its wheatfield  
and among the love the original one  
the mountaineer covered with domestic old warrior's medal.  
The night circuss you in its mortal earth.  
Transluscent sand-colored panics of legume,  
opaque sepia seams above a fractious hoove.  
I'm the person to the honeysuckle of immediate lake.  
I took on tremulous moons.  
We open the halves of a mysteries and the  
soddening of juices relaxes into the poetic vicinity.  
Cinnamon and moonlit child,  
to relax lost trees and for films.  
What epiphany does the jaguar contain?  
How little we excite and how much it makes the secrets of this universe.  
  
To the serendipidous  
sensible sea's skin  
circumscribe on the lightnings that wait for you  
burying the clenched chairs, ignoring the doors.  
I stayed returned and sand-colored  
against the divisions.
