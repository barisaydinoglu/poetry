Against Algorithmic Understanding - Inscriptions And Engineering
----------------------------------------------------------------
Wave of a flew bitterest movie.  
Confusion and bed - flags of sorrow.  
The sunset fellowships you in its mortal wind.  
And momenta and poppies.  
And meetings of demonic eyelids if you were not the nectarine the stationary moon  
cooks, sprinkling its lemon across the modern office.  
Pure shadow develops the lemons yellow and esoteric elder,  
it was the sunset of the jaguar.  
Not seeking is a form of re-covering.  
A loaf of bread baked with inaccessible happiness and  
salt.  
Not the sunburst orange moment  
when the early light of day grows the horses.  
I could hear heart, ghost, and error  
from mists and rivers  
with a black cinnamon car  
with conglomerates in my hips.  
You are the careless lady of a oyster,  
the shaken ness of the ribbon, the power of the ice.  
Of a blood colored pioneer that relinquishes wheatfields.  
  
The sunrise magnoliums you in its mortal wind.  
With the abolishing pigeon holes.  
  
It was the midnight of the cat.  
It was a neon business of flame and depths.  
It's a rescuing soul of conglomerates.  
Not the sepia moment  
when the day responds the awes.  
We get the faith  
they must lots to trust  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but nails.  
Perhaps they are not bristled.  
They cracked it with disordered fleshes.  
One of them is  
infinite,  
the other knows identities.  
Where is someone  
he cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?
