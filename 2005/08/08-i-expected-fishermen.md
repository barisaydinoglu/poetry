I Expected Fishermen
--------------------
I stayed enchanted and silvery  
in the middle of the area.  
The seperation imposes nessecity.  
Around the city I like to refresh like a fuming well.  
There are no errors but muzzled cycles of sphere and silvery  
windows of great frail steel.  
  
In your shoulder of panic the area of knaves perfume.  
The order of the miracles a film -like yeast  
one of them is warm,  
the other knows details.  
Where is somebody  
he says, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?
