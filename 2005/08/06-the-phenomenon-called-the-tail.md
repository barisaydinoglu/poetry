The Phenomenon Called The Tail
------------------------------
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another. And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
enchant of bird feathers and lakes  
and the manly gardens of his native land?  
On what listless bones transformed with earth?  
Not dawning is a form of setting.
