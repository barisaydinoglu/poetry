Since The End Of Silencing
--------------------------
The earth fleeting granules are wiped.  
Recovering from arrogant cork.  
A wheatfield connecting will blossom  
the cold sky of a planet.  
I'm the god to the umbrella of immediate leaf.  
The charitable dignity of the maternity!  
When the field is full of delirious arm  
with lonely roads and frightened morose forests  
and the fatherless spheres and the forests  
at last give forth their motionless flask.  
Of your blood colored land when you hold out your lip.  
There are many enemies amid sordid events. As soon as  
the incoming bells  
gives the alphabetic indication.
