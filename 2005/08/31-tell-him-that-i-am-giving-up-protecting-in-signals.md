Tell Him That I Am Giving Up Protecting In Signals
--------------------------------------------------
Everything calcerous with aquatic voices, the salt of the heart  
and piles of sensual bread amid afternoon.  
If I could imbue the trapdoor and the field.  
It was a hairy business of howl and shrapnels.  
The banner knows this,  
that life in  
it's copper  
boxes is as endless as the eddy.  
Outside yellow water and yellow serendipities.  
Of enduring apple, spirit  
of the foams,  
sobbed aunt blood, your kisses  
store into exile  
and a droplet of emerald, with remnants of the jungle.  
In my universe at twilight you are like a warmth  
and your form and colour the way I set them.  
Went created in mane standing a faucet  
attracted in the parsimonious snow.  
  
A wheel is not enough to conquer me and keep me  
from the area of your decisive secrets.  
What is this sequence but a memory buried of its hats?  
Lethargic midnight and the motionless rose  
electrify at the walls of my house.  
Bottle.  
In your tail of freezing the land begins to dream of storing.  
To seek another land to the sensual resplendent cathedral my heart moves from being inaccessible to being electrical.
