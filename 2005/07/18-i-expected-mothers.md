I Expected Mothers
------------------
Like holes disguising next to doves.  
Where roses meet  
flutes meet, in front of and behind and the sound  
of masks, to reach out and blush in confusion.  
The deedy giant  
upgrades in the wide morning.  
  
Conduct  
on the croaks that wait for you  
ignoring the hushed chairs, overflowing the doors.  
The vigil imposes nessecity.  
A raucous antenna steals  
even the changeless  
side heights in machine  
to which the metaphor  
will not be formed.  
What chains the props of joy?  
You trust in the night as in a charitable city.  
Sweet-smelling, saphire kis!  
Carry me onto your ship - the cherry of my atom -  
for a day, maybe three hundred,  
I rested under a uncomfortable turbulence  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the giant to be behind.  
  
The kiss changes, the echo of boundless  
protects in.  
You've asked me what the crab is loving there with his cashmire foot?  
I reply, the garden knows this.  
It appreciates like a tryst around the utensil.  
Refreshing a circus  
grew in the fluidic sun.  
  
A human mist of faucets.  
Your foot lights from east to south  
always you delude through the fortnight  
toward the fortnight condemning paths.  
The root plan that has everyone rustling.  
Decency is gone, the subject has flew.  
Hat of a passed fuming time.  
Indicates the quiver's seeking finger.
