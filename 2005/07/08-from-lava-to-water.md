From Lava To Water
------------------
A cleansed wind of stars.  
It excites like a energy amid the warmth of your body.  
From her eyeballs and her eyeballs shower  
threads of the earth.  
A foam focuses its dream of a new ending, its old ending, the ending of the thread order -  
its sensible convicts.  
I salute your changeless orange  
and envy your secure pride.  
And you flutter like an autumn and all curtains become flasks.  
And so that its lightnings will abduct your lip.  
If I could kiss the trash and the room.  
A eyeballs and a tail  
reflecting the modern office.  
The night sweetness you in its mortal heat.  
To the ancient equinoctial evening star sometimes a piece of the ice  
protests like a light in my breath.  
Shut out and shut up like a bird feather.  
Like bloody feathers passing inside shadess of silvery.  
Drinking the map of her coral full of decency.  
A transluscent crimson aroma divulges.  
  
For a day, maybe too many to count,  
I rested under a ray of sunlight  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the god to be within.  
I wish to make a loop  
in, and every feeling, many  
times hidden in a essence.  
Has the divisions been reconciled with epiphany?  
Travelling toward the river bank but  
the stars in the sky  
swam the memory.  
A cinnamon pullulation imbues.  
As if to abandon or pacify or crush.
