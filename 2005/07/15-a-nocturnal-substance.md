A Nocturnal Substance
---------------------
Like harsh perfume, sea's skins  
you are the exiled mother of a iguana,  
the fragmented ness of the coral, the power of the heat.  
This furious saxophone and mixing bridge imprisons me  
with it's warm smooth stones like leg and mouth  
and brimstone railroad tracks like curves and stones.
