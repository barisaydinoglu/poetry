The Noise Fallen Into The Sea
-----------------------------
Halfway. What is this metaphor but a memory replaced of its dews? They punctured it with rigid keys.  
Some imbue but I set your brick like banner.  
One of them is sensible,  
the other knows identities.  
Where is nobody  
she  
exclaims, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
As soon  
as the incoming silences  
gives the aerial indication.
