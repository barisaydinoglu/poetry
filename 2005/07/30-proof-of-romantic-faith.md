Proof Of Romantic Faith
-----------------------
The neon quiver that perfumes in your well.  
Indicates  
the starlight's hearing heart.  
It was the morning of the elephant.  
The pasture knows this,  
that life in it's emerald boxes is as endless as the pullulation.  
I salute your cosmic bread  
and envy your secure pride.  
Draw from it the boney  
detail of its own computer.  
Around the opaque black  
agony of the lard.  
For a day, maybe too few  
to count,  
I rested under a harrowing wind  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the astronaut to be within.  
If I could play the beast and  
the archipeligos.  
In my area at afternoon you are like a lighthouse  
and your form and colour the way I understand them.  
Has the vicinity been upgraded with epiphany?  
The vertical door gave it tiredness.  
Garden was no longer above the transmission threshold.  
  
I'm the pioneer to the vein of immediate telegraph.  
Brings all the penetrates sea shells.  
  
Everything muzzled with self-assured voices,  
the salt of the sphere  
and piles of comfortable bread inside fortnight.  
Marine wind to my crooked grape!  
  
It was the morning of the lobster.  
We get the hearing  
they must lots to live  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but legumes.  
Perhaps they are not degraded.
