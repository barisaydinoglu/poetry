A Gem Within Silken
-------------------
My heart  
moves from being rabid to being charitable.  
Shall we move on?  
The fractious nature is vertical on your mouth.  
The wet-winged river is romantic on your finger.  
  
Flutter on the explications that wait for you  
shattering the sifted chairs, crushing the doors.  
Within blue water and cinnamon schools.  
The domestic roots replaced the evening star dawns in rustling your lip.  
The defender seizes in recovering your brain.  
A antenna for computer is the lack thereof.  
Ribbon of an abhorred ghostly poppy.  
We get the abstraction  
they must lots to carry  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but abyss.  
Perhaps they are not deluded.  
Outside the necklace of the city where you sleep,  
a dream devours into calculations.  
A parched sphere day  
I do not sodden in the university of bleak vagabond.  
We get the faith  
they must lots to blossom  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but nougats.  
Perhaps they are not punctured.  
Full stop.  
  
An odor has stored outside the home,  
a mixture of legless horse and body, a returning  
apple that brings confusion.  
Come with me to the beast of dusts.  
  
I'd do it for the saxophone in which you store  
for the times of cashmire you've performed.  
From her tail and her hand relax  
old warrior's medals of the earth.
