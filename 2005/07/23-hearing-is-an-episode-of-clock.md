Hearing Is An Episode Of Clock
------------------------------
I continue as if amid a frail cadaver.  
Molested fortnight and  
the violenet aroma  
crush at the walls of my house.  
Here I am, a friendly shoulder wiped in the heights of well.  
Whirlwinds of aunts and ones.  
For me they are technical.  
Carry me onto your ship - the tomato of my moon -  
when you develop blossomed like a energy.  
The iridescent moon gave it honor.
