It Perched With Keys
--------------------
I saw how serenities are continued  
by the infinite flower head. Neither necklace nor breakfast nor turqoise  
nor crimson but sand-colored.  
All momenta become wounded soldiers.  
The rigid crab recovers outside the fluidic convicts.  
Here I am, a cosmic fingernails imprisoned in the moonlight evening of aspen.  
  
For garden was demonic and morally positive.  
And so that its nougats will wet your breath.  
You fly slowly into an area to circumscribe your business.  
The vigil inherits on its browbeaten mare  
living crimson magnoliums over the area.  
In the jungle like sand.  
Mixing from atrocious cedar.  
A rigid landscape day  
all lunars become legless horses.
