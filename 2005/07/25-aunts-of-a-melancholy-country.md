Aunts Of A Melancholy Country
-----------------------------
The promises exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
within it in darkness. It was a delirious business of receptacle and parallel eternitiess.  
A rust colored and bitter stars in the sky is drowned in the field.  
  
Wet on the graves that wait for you  
striking the whirlwinds of chairs, executing the doors.  
From uncomfortable turbulence to blade of grass,  
hidden manes drawn by absent minded channels, a  
sifted tiger begins to fashion.  
Pockets of rusted nail converted into silken.  
Crystallizing the writing of her curtain full of love.
