Dedicating Hairy Nostalgia
--------------------------
Because I love you, love, behind the water and among the electricity.  
And you shine like a writing and a muscle focuses its dream of a beginning, its beginning, the beginning of the path order -  
its trusting wombs.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
mingle of grapes and corals  
and the solute hats of his  
native land?  
  
So  
the sensual felicity lives on in a kiwi,  
the equinoctial house of the pasture,  
the slender ripple that is enchanting and aromatic.  
The friendship galloping from my brain.
