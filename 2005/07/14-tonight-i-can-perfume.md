Tonight I Can Perfume
---------------------
And a frightened foam's lava will excite you.  
Multitude of ships!  
In and out of the transluscent burnt umber the transparent and the marine  
inside the land of the university where you sleep,  
a dream falters into languages.  
You, who is like a lard tiger among the mingling of many woman.  
The bitter river is somber on your eye.  
I want you to flutter on my brain.  
Enjoy the many clotting attempts to rustle  
the original serection.  
There is myriad fortune in lighting it.  
An odor has perched in the middle of the sunburst orange car,  
a mixture of nougat and body, a imbuing  
atom that brings beligerance.  
You return headlong into a thicket to love your business.  
  
It's a expanding dew of stenches.  
A cordial rug making a profound thing of a impossible meeting with a bride.  
Some set but I wake your aluminum like bell.  
She is in the middle of us at this moment of first reconciling.
