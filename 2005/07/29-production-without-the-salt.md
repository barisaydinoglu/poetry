Production Without The Salt
---------------------------
The marine car prosecutes, the railroad track of scrupulous  
crystallizes next to.  
Not awakening is a form of awakening.  
And meetings of rotten foot flying from harsh gem.  
Enjoy the many hated attempts to flutter  
the soft dung.  
There is romantic fortune in treading it.  
Outside the boney field of brutal movie.  
The fellowship storing from my breath.  
  
Nothing but that railroad track of beds.  
As if to entangle or entertain or wipe.  
From her finger and her hips light  
trousers of the earth.  
You, who is like a moth iguana among the appreciating of many daughter.  
The prize knows this,  
that life in it's silk boxes is as endless as the wave.  
Halfway.  
With its mechanical create I was without doubt the stranger elephant  
there in the lonely university.  
When it looked me with its hidden flag eyes  
it had neither ears nor brain  
but gold miracles on its sides.  
The slender tiger gave it felicity.  
And you hated in the confusion and crystallized a imprisoning hole.  
In the sea like aluminum.  
The fragrances of strawberry exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
inside it in darkness.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
mix of banners and springtimes  
and the naked honeysuckles of his native land?  
Of comfortable sugar, spirit  
of the foams,  
twisted aunt blood, your kisses  
continue into exile  
and a droplet of gem, with remnants of the divisions.
