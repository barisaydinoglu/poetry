Breeding Spacious Affection
---------------------------
Not rejoicing is a form of entertaining. And warmths of your body and kisses.  
The boneless drop is great on your arm.  
A chorus of elephants at night un flew un abandoned  
comes to a halt before a branch.  
Nothing but your domestic arm.  
If I could make the stalactite and the region.  
A current of boundless landscape  
that does not know why it flows and protects.  
Like the muzzled metal of evening stars like morose promise, lemons  
our new energy, our eloquent warmth of your body tetrahedrons.  
Which is a resplendent path  
of directions  
thousand or million, performed  
on a lighthouse or in the serendipidous moon  
directions of the lip, a calculation in your feet.  
You reflect my rigid parallel twisting lonely roads  
like a iridescent iguana to fresh sugar.
