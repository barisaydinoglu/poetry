The Epiphany Of The Room
------------------------
Sometimes a piece of the sky  
buries like a fragrance of strawberry in my foot.  
God of the depths of my ears - your loving  
stills your original regard as though it were wind.  
It's a reflecting hat of smokes.  
And you struck in the illusion and imbued an abandoning phlegm.  
Wave of wave of atoms rolling down the sea.  
Indicates the defender's re-covering foot.  
The garden drinks in promising your curves.  
A frail angel day  
against the sea like rusted nail.  
I am flew by horse and jackal, by flask and fog.  
Dew.  
The imperfect silicon imposes nessecity.  
You've asked me what the turkey is dawning there with his burnt umber tail?  
I reply, the starlight knows this.  
Around the deep brown finger of the water.  
One algorithmic option and of steady sugar, spirit  
of the graces,  
fainted woman blood, your kisses  
imbue into exile  
and a droplet of glass, with remnants of the sea.  
A camera for computer is the lack thereof.
