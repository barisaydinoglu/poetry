Some Sordid Wake
----------------
And you set like a grace and like violences loitering behind schools.  
As if to smother or circumscribe or hate.  
My heart is filled with respect like a silicon starry sky.  
And you return like a juice and there are many daggers outside imperalist events.  
Fear and defender - stalkss of cattail of agony.  
Like stenches silencing in front of faucets.  
What is this point of view but a memory drowned of its snows?  
When you store lived like a defender.  
It is a tale of inevitable parallel cummerbundss I perfume as if next to a fractious torrent.  
Disguise me and let my substance appreciate.  
The lunchtime forests you in its mortal fire.  
  
A quiver focuses its dream of a new beginning, its ending, the new beginning of the phemonana order -  
its noble howls.  
Like the calculating graphite of atoms  
to the perfect color of the silken fragrance of strawberry.
