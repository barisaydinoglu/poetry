Since The End Of Gathering
--------------------------
What delicious affections -  
the room is filled with it,  
times for the knave  
and the difficult emerald. What replaces the props of purity?  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
shine of coats and curtains  
and the perfect roses of his native land?  
Towards those smooth irons of yours that wait for me.  
Has the heights been entertained with epiphany?  
A hips and a lip  
responding the archipeligos.  
The sordid land is resolute on your mouth.  
And a tear stained evening star's lava will shower you.  
Rustling toward the shades of sepia wave of wave of forests rolling down the sea.
