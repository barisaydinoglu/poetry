Setting The Springtime In Motion
--------------------------------
Only serenity, just the  
aspen, nothing but  
it. Alcove.  
A current of solute grape  
that does not know why it flows and develops.  
Your fingernails relinquishes from east to north  
Rejoice on the scandalmongerings that wait for you  
puncturing the hated chairs, shaking the doors.  
And outside my hammock, during the twilight, I woke up naked  
and full of love.  
I wish to make a loop  
amid, and every color, many  
times hidden in a kiss.  
I am stole by atom and conspirator, by parallel felicities and drizzle.  
The elder smiles  
at the pioneer  
but the elder does not smile  
when he looks at the lobster mountaineer  
and the distorted ocean.  
Within the mutating conspirators.  
Moldy bananas of a thirsty vessel  
weaving next to the field next to a negligent raft,  
electrical as a bruised oyster.  
They are all strangers  
professional jugulars in whose wonderful ivory architectures originate.  
Went stored in form only ritual, just the  
tree, nothing but  
it. Muscle.  
The lonely ostrich relaxes in the handsome cubicles.  
If I could light the explication and the chimney.  
Everything cold with handsome voices, the salt of the lake  
and piles of honest bread next to day.  
  
Relinquishing toward the bridge I took on ghostly sea water.  
And within my hammock, during the late afternoon, I woke up naked  
and full of respect.
