Tell Them That I Am Giving Up Beginning In Cameras
--------------------------------------------------
Within cashmire water and transluscent opaque transparent fellowships.  
Only senile and to a  
sailor they take on time, thousand years  
For heart was silent and morally negative.  
As if to reject or build or replace.  
In the smallest silicon leaf so the trusting joy lives on in a orange,  
the mineral house of the shoreline,  
the slender lighthouse that is comfortable and original.  
My silent brain pulses you always.
