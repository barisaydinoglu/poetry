The Senile Pioneer Of The City
------------------------------
And you magnify like a dove and she is in the middle of us at this moment of first living. Sometimes a piece of the ice  
forebodes like a landscape in my eyeballs.  
She is in us at this moment of first seizing.  
Against the arrogant femininity, many tear stained conspirators.  
Cashmire eternities of utensil,  
yellow seams above a shaken banner.
