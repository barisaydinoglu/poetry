A Old Warrior's Medal To Weave The Shadess Of Green You Play
------------------------------------------------------------
Neon thorn trees and clenched nights.  
A foam -like conspirator  
I stayed set and transluscent crimson  
outside the vicinity.  
The windy flower is secure on your mouth.  
Indicates the green lake's wetting toe.  
You see arm  
as cosmic as the snow.  
You store in the divisions as in a slender city.  
Full stop.  
The morose affection that mingles in your tryst.  
  
Which is a stationary telegraph of directions  
twenty-seven or too few to count, rustled  
on a river or in the balanced railroad track  
directions of the nose, a calculation in your eyeballss.  
It flies like a sun outside the shades of yellow.  
  
Come with me  
to the shards of copper of convicts.
