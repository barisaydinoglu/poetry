Tonight I Can Respond
---------------------
An odor has carried inside the old warrior's medal,  
a mixture of bloody feather and body, a storing  
writing that brings fear.  
I am smothered by atom and stench, by probe and sun.  
Full stop.  
This  
sifted crown and expanding flower deprives me  
with it's sensual corals like arm and hand  
and ultraviolet lighthouses like mouth and umbrellas.  
You say, what is the salt waiting for in its transluscent yellow praise?  
I tell you it is waiting for mosaic like you.  
A rain of lemons a loaf of bread baked with frightened pride and salt.  
So the unguessed honor lives on in a tomato,  
the eager house of the bell,  
the lion hearted grace that is aquatic and essential.
