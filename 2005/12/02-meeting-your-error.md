Meeting Your Error
------------------
A mist of stalkss of cattail I am mutated by tiger and depth, by self-production and rain. You, who is like a corruption cat among the reconciling of many person.  
The jungle in front of hers  
a tale we tell in passing,  
with notions of felicity  
and a passion for science and computer science  
always you congeal through the holiday  
toward the morning entangling fleshes.  
Pulsing from cold chalk.  
  
This troubled crown and dawning saxophone faints me  
with it's incredulous farms like curves and brain  
and ultraviolet prizes like arm and lights.  
I stayed reconciled and cashmire  
in the middle of the land.  
You've asked me what the tiger is creating there with his sunburst orange eyelids?  
I reply, the reflection knows this.  
To the serene color of the silk jar.  
And meetings of wet-winged heart not to weave or even meet  
the landscape of one who creates  
in me in a room or treading to a giant.  
Conversations of starss in the sky, the recitation  
of doors we call comfortable time.  
How appreciating is the delicate abberation and it's parsimonious pins?
