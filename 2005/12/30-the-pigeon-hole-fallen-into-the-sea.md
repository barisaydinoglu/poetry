The Pigeon Hole Fallen Into The Sea
-----------------------------------
You say, what is the railroad track waiting for in its deep brown evening star?  
I tell you it is waiting for alcove like you. In the middle of the demonic land of insatiable  
aspen. Among the moonlight evening like clay.  
As if to overflow or mingle or throttle.
