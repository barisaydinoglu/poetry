Tonight I Can Live
------------------
Sea shell of a dismantled negligent angel.  
In the face of so many graves to animosity.  
I'd do it for the wave in which you return  
for the lunars of sand-colored you've heard.  
Loathe me and let my substance develop.  
He is in the middle of us at this moment of first conducting.  
Indicates the fountain's relinquishing hand.  
How treading is the eager vortex and it's verdure traps?  
From her eyeballs and her hips inherit  
coats of the earth.
