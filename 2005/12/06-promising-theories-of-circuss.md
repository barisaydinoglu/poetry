Promising Theories Of Circuss
-----------------------------
What fresh landscapes -  
the chimney is filled with it,  
poppies for the flesh and the tremulous silken.  
She is outside us at this moment of first loving.  
The ice eager corruptions are gnawn.  
Outside the crooked thicket of acidulous hat.  
If I could kiss the conspirator and the divisions.  
They punctured it with misunderstood dews.  
A tetrahedron outside a triangle,  
the callous workings of steady law.
