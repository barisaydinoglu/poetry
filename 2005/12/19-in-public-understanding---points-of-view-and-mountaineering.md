In Public Understanding - Points Of View And Mountaineering
-----------------------------------------------------------
There ought to be an angel of a spacious wave promising in a room.  
Where hats meet  
ships meet, with and with and the sound  
of evils, to reach out and conduct in illusion.  
I was without doubt the daughter tiger  
there in the negligent sea.  
When it looked me with its sensible crown eyes  
It had neither shoulder nor arm  
but marble wreaths on its sides.  
Nothing but your celestial mouth.  
The moon seizes in transforming your breath. Weaving toward the bed it was the midnight of the cat.  
Around the moonlight evening I like to pacify like a fatherless cluster.  
Which is a honest pencil of directions  
too many to count or twenty-seven, developed  
on a serendipity or in the soft sea water  
directions of the brow, a calculation in your brows.  
You've asked me what the toucan is perfuming there with his green brow?  
I reply, the leaf knows this.  
The velvety dignity of the curtain!  
A chorus of turkeys at night un enchanted un penetrated  
comes to a halt before a circus.  
For juice was demonic and morally negative.  
Sepia moldy bananas of dominion,  
burnt umber seams above a callous aspen.  
  
It was the fortnight of the crab.  
Against the lashed divisions of inaccessible reflection.
