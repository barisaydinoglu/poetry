Computer With The Salt
----------------------
Draw from it the senile  
projection of its own camera.  
A phemonana -like oxide  
forebode me and let my substance flow.  
The order of the angels you say, what is the magnolium waiting for in its crimson cathedral?  
I tell you it is waiting for coral like you.  
A tiger -like phlegm  
next to the turqoise sorrow of the moldy banana.  
Abyss of a dry car  
discovering outside the room behind a parched airplane,  
secure as a wayside  
elephant.  
Where friendships meet  
mists meet, outside and among and the sound  
of belts, to reach out and gallop in illusion.  
Shut up and shut up like a shoreline.  
In the first reel, the delicious god  
is drowned by a stranger. In the second  
reel he returns, to trust and to enchant.  
Towards those keys of yours that wait for me.  
  
Of promising nectarine, spirit  
of the lemons,  
pitied child blood, your kisses  
set into exile  
and a droplet of crystal, with remnants of the city.  
A serendipity -like heart  
here I am, a full arm plagued in the modern office of shades of cinnamon.
