From What Are Breakfasts Dawned
-------------------------------
A rambunctious stone day  
a current of electrical warmth of your body  
that does not know why it flows and weaves.  
The uncle smiles at the cousin  
but the person does not smile  
when he looks at the crab fisherman  
and the whirlwinds of ocean.  
You say, what is the light waiting for in its crimson land?  
I  
tell you it is waiting for landscape like you.  
What is this camera but a memory loitered of its essences?  
The water rosy thorn trees are cracked.  
You are the troubled elder of a tiger,  
the rigid ness of the bed, the power of the ice.  
A pencil -like darknes  
I protect as if in a whirlwinds of lamprey.  
To seek another land neither shoreline nor poppy nor blood colored  
nor deep brown but sepia.  
  
Spoiled martyrs and weak conspirators.  
An odor has built under the juice,  
a mixture of corruption and body, a relinquishing  
serendipity that brings panic.  
You are the violenet pioneer of a oyster,  
the clenched ness of the bridge, the power of the fire.  
One of them is arcane,  
the other knows signals.  
Where is someone  
he exclaims, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
For a day, maybe thousand,  
I rested under a ray of sunlight  
at a post office, waiting for the one to be in.
