A Song Of Wonder
----------------
They condemned it with pale angels.  
Develop on the belts that wait for you  
fainting the decadent chairs, compounding the doors.  
Shall we proceed?  
  
Around the sunburst orange fingernails of the lava.  
A sunburst orange poppy promises.  
The maps exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
inside it in darkness.  
What wets the props of love?  
I am coagulated by shoreline and bomb, by dagger and thunder.  
The ancient atoms killed shall we go forward?  
And so that its cold fires will shatter your ears.
