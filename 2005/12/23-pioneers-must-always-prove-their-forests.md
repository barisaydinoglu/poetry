Pioneers Must Always Prove Their Forests
----------------------------------------
Nothing but that stars in the sky of precisions. What curiosities does the crab contain?  
How little we weave and how much it relinquishes the funny things of this universe.  
And a harsh  
splendor's ice will set you.  
Like traps puncturing inside autumns.  
Forming a sea water  
excited in  
the sensual fog.  
  
In burnt umber water and opaque green flints.  
Not refreshing is a form of wetting.  
The alcove knows this,  
that life in it's saphire boxes is as endless as the peace.  
Our new forest, our essential well loops.
