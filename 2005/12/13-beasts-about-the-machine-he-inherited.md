Beasts About The Machine He Inherited
-------------------------------------
Gleaming, saphire stone!  
The dead crab dedicates among the free clefts.  
What wets the props of felicity?  
Behind the cracking vaginas.  
My esoteric finger rises you always.  
I do not plague in the room of parched salt.  
  
But the starry sky stood the memory.  
Outside blue water and burnt umber flower heads.  
A circle in front of a square,  
the careless workings of domestic law.  
For a day, maybe million,  
I rested under a tornado  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the man to be around.  
  
In the first take, the secure astronaut  
is abolished by a father. In the second  
take he returns, to pacify and to appreciate.  
Enjoy the many mechanical attempts to attract  
the poetic saliva.  
There is blazing fortune in hearing it.  
In the smallest chalk law of a gray lady that upgrades knaves.  
A hips and a leg  
expanding the divisions.
