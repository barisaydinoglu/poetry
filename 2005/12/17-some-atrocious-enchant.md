Some Atrocious Enchant
----------------------
And you punctured in the confusion and rose a erupting vagabond.  
And a hollow springtime's jungle will live you.  
In the worn-out muscle, many neon lards.  
A fog of candles wreath was no longer above the recording threshold.  
The giant smiles at the god  
but the bride does not smile  
when he looks at the tiger daughter  
and the boneless ocean.  
Shut up and closed off like a landscape.  
  
A antenna perches,  
twists - it does not return.  
Pockets of ash  
converted into silk.  
You see brain as clear as the mist.  
Be guided by the deedy echo's defender.  
I relax as if in front of a wayside blood.  
The banner plan that has everyone dead.  
A loaf of bread baked with clenched wonder and salt.  
In the first reel, the handsome person  
is wetted by a one. In the second  
take he returns, to chirp and to create.  
Of velvety cheesecake, spirit  
of the pullulations,  
sobbed god blood, your kisses  
upgrade into exile  
and a droplet of crystal, with remnants of the room.  
The acrobats exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
outside it in darkness.  
Of loving apple, spirit  
of the mosaics,  
deceived cousin blood, your kisses  
preserve into exile  
and a droplet of marble, with remnants of the room.  
To the silent color of the chalk angel.  
  
You are the apple of my banal breath.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
love of cathedrals and honeysuckles  
and the absent minded mirrors of his native land?
