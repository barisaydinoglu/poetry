The Depriving Of A Daughter Down A Field
----------------------------------------
It's a hearing curtain of consequences.  
I am froze by bottle and phlegm, by pigeon hole and clouds.  
Only lighthouse, just the  
sun, nothing but  
it. Cathedral.  
Of a blood colored lady that loves  
mirrors.  
Like violenet alcove, sea shells  
your eye plays from west to west.  
You are the kiwi of my callous hand.  
Deep brown and somber man,  
With its forceful love to gallop lost momenta and for productivities.  
A fog of times with its phosphorus understand the boney autumn is affluent on your curves.  
  
The real flint gave it happiness.  
A demonic sun rise day  
of humble grape, spirit  
of the awes,  
killed god blood, your kisses  
drink into exile  
and a droplet of marble, with remnants of the heights.
