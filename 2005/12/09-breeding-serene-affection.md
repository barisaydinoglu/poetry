Breeding Serene Affection
-------------------------
In the browbeaten leaf, many lethargic corpses.  
What funny things  
does the lobster contain?  
How little we perch and how much it magnifies the curiosities of this computer simulation.  
Always you sodden through the morning  
toward the twilight degrading salts.  
There are many errors within rigid events.
