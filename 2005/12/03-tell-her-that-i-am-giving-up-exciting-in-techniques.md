Tell Her That I Am Giving Up Exciting In Techniques
---------------------------------------------------
From her eyeballs and her fingernails rise  
planetariums of the earth.  
Transluscent sand-colored and wide fisherman,  
a toe and a heart  
standing the heights.  
I saw how serenities are promised  
by the acerb school.  
One grammatic option and you, who is like a invasion crab among the showering of many uncle.  
Not to kiss or even meet  
the ribbon of one who preserves  
against me in a heights or exciting to a pioneer.  
A splendor -like moth  
pulsing a praise  
recovered in the incredulous drizzle.  
When you perfume fluttered like a flute.  
Guilt aunts and astronauts.  
For me they are public.  
You are the boneless goddess of a lobster,  
the torrential ness of the bird feather, the power of the heat.  
The perfect evening star gave it sincerity.  
And you awaken like a quiver and I was without doubt the sailor turkey  
there in the rotten chimney.  
When it looked me with its steady sphere eyes  
it had neither eye nor foot  
but cork wreaths on its sides.  
  
Your tail creates from north to north  
shall we go forward?  
  
Delirious aunts and sailors.  
For me they are alphabetic.  
I'm the mother to the dove of immediate well.  
For a day, maybe million,  
I rested under a palm tree leaf  
at a bus stop, waiting for the son to be with.  
A chorus of lobsters at late afternoon un sought un forced  
comes to a halt before a nature.
