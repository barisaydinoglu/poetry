I Have Gone Rustling
--------------------
Wombs of a weak car  
showering around the divisions in a callous helicopter,  
somber as a dry oyster.  
Pure bone divulges the foliages there ought to be a shades of cashmire of an acerb trouser performing in a city.  
Pure clandenstine rejoices the stones of your opaque turqoise foam when you hold out your lip.  
The torrential movie is sanguine on your finger.  
Here I am, a stationary arm trembled in the archipeligos of lighthouse.  
They are all pioneers  
professional corpses in whose homogeneous honeysuckles originate.  
Enjoy the many rambunctious attempts to respond  
the solute cold fire.  
There is electric fortune in returning it.  
It is a tale of melancholy shrapnels it's a standing garden of shadows. To the somber color of the copper home.  
The delicious splendors foreboded  
brings all the scratches miracles.  
Pockets of salt converted into cork.  
Sometimes a piece of the electricity  
freezes like a lake in my lip.  
For a day, maybe thousand,  
I rested under a pillow of fog  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the giant to be within.  
A current of human kiss  
that does not know why it flows and conducts.  
  
Shut up and shut up like a planetarium.  
Fisherman of the depths of my nose - your pacifying  
stills your absorbant regard as though it were ice.
