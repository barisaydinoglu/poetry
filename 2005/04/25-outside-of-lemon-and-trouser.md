Outside Of Lemon And Trouser
----------------------------
My heart moves from being burned-out to being cordial.  
Cinnamon blades of stalactite,  
blue seams above a whirlwinds of light.  
Full stop.  
And the vein to its prize  
and among the bridges the irreducable one  
the one covered with eloquent old warrior's medal.  
Sometimes a piece of the wind  
deceives like a serendipity in my leg.
