What Is True Of The Sun Rise Is True Of Everything
--------------------------------------------------
Halfway.  
A tiger focuses its dream of a beginning, its beginning, the new  
beginning of the ripple order -  
its rosy torrents.  
From her  
breath and her foot perform  
fragrances of strawberry of the earth.  
The mother smiles at the man  
but the son does not smile  
when he looks at the ostrich lady  
and the lewd ocean.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
Divulging the hat of her curtain full of love.  
I am replaced by heart and lineage, by abys and rain.  
Has  
the universe been travelled with mysteries?  
Under the disordered affection, many fractious jackals.
