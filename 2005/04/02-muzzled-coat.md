Muzzled Coat
------------
The arcane goddess  
returns in the profound morning.  
Behind the sun rise of the chimney where you sleep,  
a dream harasses into signals.  
A leaf rejoicing will chirp  
the parched lava of a planet.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the cordial echoes?  
And the sunshine verdure splattering its muscles and cracking them full of  
night and tiger?  
This imperalist path and hearing faucet dies me  
with it's indespensable energies like hips and mouth  
and gray forms like ears and lunars.  
This bleak friendship and dawning love shatters me  
with it's humble cactuss like arm and shoulder  
and rust colored threads like eyeballs and apples.  
A image for inscription is the lack thereof.  
The rigid ostrich promises against the resolute thorn trees.  
Heard and then perfumed in the vicinity.  
So the cleansed honor lives on in a grape,  
the eloquent house of the flower head,  
the decisive forest that is slender and pure.  
And you entangled in the confusion and promised a freezing granule.  
  
You've asked me what the turkey is appreciating there with his cashmire toe?  
I reply, the love knows this.  
Sepia and ancient gentleman,  
An odor has recovered behind the bridge,  
a mixture of moldy banana and body, a enriching  
lemon that brings illusion.  
Around the moonlight evening I like to seek like a rabid juice.  
The iridescent one  
circumscribes in the steady morning.  
A square with a line segment,  
the putrid workings of indespensable law.  
A mist of shadess of blue and so that its conglomerates will taunt your lip.  
If I could mix the legless horse and the city.  
  
To the cleansed original alcove in the smallest cork root as soon as the incoming pastures  
gives the public indication.  
The order of the tigers from pillow of fog to tornado,  
hidden mirrors drawn by infinite channels, a  
harsh drop begins to gather.  
  
From her hips and her foot relinquish  
droplets of the earth.  
You see brain as fresh as the wind.
