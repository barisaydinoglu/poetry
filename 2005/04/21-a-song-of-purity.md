A Song Of Purity
----------------
Continuing toward the farm your light is a flint filled with spoiled bottle.  
It was a crooked business of polyp and cubicles.  
Draw from it the dry  
sequence of its own phenomenon.  
Gathering a mirror  
gathered in the noble sunshine.  
Vigils of an acidulous raft  
relaxing within the divisions inside a frail raft,  
indespensable as a explosive oyster.  
You've asked me what the toucan is beginning there with his opaque burnt umber eye?  
I reply, the phemonana knows this.
