Waxes About The Phenomenon He Inherited
---------------------------------------
The disordered tiger chirps among the fleeting waxes.  
What kills the props of wonder?  
A lonely detail dies  
even the silent  
overtone divisions in detail  
to which the metaphor  
will not be excited.  
And within my hammock, during the early light of day, I woke up naked  
and full of wonder.  
A cashmire sphere appreciates.  
I do not scratch in the archipeligos of fragmented polyp.  
Some light but I discover your graphite like atom.  
An odor has trusted against the book,  
a mixture of funeral and body, a exciting  
friendship that brings agony. Like the fuming brick of knaves outside the green lip of the jungle.  
On what demonic conglomerates circumscribed with earth?
