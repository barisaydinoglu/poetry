Setting The Snow In Motion
--------------------------
Nothing but your clear toe.  
Realized irreducable grace the coat builds in seeking your heart.  
When you perch carried like a eddy.  
I stayed made and sunburst orange  
among  
the chimney.  
I took on hollow sweetness.  
Halfway.  
A airplane is not enough to force me and keep me  
from the boulevard of your original  
funny things.  
The unguessed goddess  
sets in the resolute morning.  
What forces the props of wonder?  
  
What moonlit ribbons -  
the modern office is filled with it,  
lands for the banner and the melancholy saphire.  
A current of homogeneous grace  
that does not know why it flows and makes.
