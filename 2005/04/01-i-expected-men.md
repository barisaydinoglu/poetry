I Expected Men
--------------
I was without doubt the one pheasant  
there in the communist city.  
When it looked me with its full book eyes  
it had neither toe nor breath  
but gold flutes on its sides.  
When you magnify formed like a love.  
You see arm as stationary as the mist.  
Furious fishermen and uncles.  
For me they are side.  
Pockets of metal converted into gold.  
You pulse my raucous cleft  
like a mineral oyster to fresh bread.  
  
A harsh camera conquers  
even the soft  
alphabetic night in detail  
to which the metaphor  
will not be swam.  
I perform as if with a fragmented blade.
