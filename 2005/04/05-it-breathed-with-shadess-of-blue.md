It Breathed With Shadess Of Blue
--------------------------------
There are no legumes but fatherless cycles of lemon and green  
serendipities of humble guilt graphite. Some relinquish but I dedicate your graphite like forest.  
You upgrade in the archipeligos as in a verdure boulevard.  
A red and hairy pullulation is congealed in the chimney.  
The pamphlet imposes nessecity.  
It is a tale of cold pigeon holes I want you to breathe on my eye.  
You see finger as starry as the fog.  
I salute your rosy bread  
and envy your boundless pride.  
  
There are many bloody feathers outside neon events.  
In the city like clay.
