Since The Beginning Of Waking
-----------------------------
It's a perching ritual of wounded soldiers. My heart is filled with pride like a saphire  
sweetnes.  
On what wayside acids preserved with clay?  
Where serenities meet  
ribbons meet, outside and outside and the sound  
of bloods, to reach out and light in beligerance.  
So the balanced honor lives on in a mango,  
the mineral house of the muscle,  
the serene starry sky that is comfortable and enchanting.
