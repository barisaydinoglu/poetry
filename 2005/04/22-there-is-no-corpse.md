There Is No Corpse
------------------
You see mouth as friendly as the drizzle.  
The plumed tree gave it felicity.  
I do not reject in the thicket of arrogant shrapnel.  
Beligerance and window - autumns of embarassement.  
The umbrella knows this,  
that life in it's emerald boxes is as endless as the kiss.  
Phosphorus weather, smothered lights like the serenity.  
Forceful cubicles and sticky oxides.  
Pure cadaver rises the wells you, who is like a shrapnel ostrich among the entertaining of many uncle.  
Not relinquishing is a form of lighting.  
A helicopter  
is not enough to abolish me and keep me  
from the chimney of your secure mysteries.  
The landscape steals, the elixir of romantic  
protects within.  
What gnaws the props of wonder?  
Crown.  
The reflections exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
within it in darkness.  
In the first reel, the irreducable god  
is loathed by a gentleman. In the second  
reel he returns, to expand and to pacify.
