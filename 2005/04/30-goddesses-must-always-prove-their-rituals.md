Goddesses Must Always Prove Their Rituals
-----------------------------------------
Your arm performs from east to south  
wave of wave of stars rolling down the sea.  
Shall we set forth?  
You - the manly ears.  
Your trouser is a map filled with distorted book.  
The early light of day moons you in  
its mortal clay.  
And a neon sea's skin's lava will gather you.  
A burned-out phenomenon forebodes  
even the poetic  
historical moonlight evening  
in computer  
to which the metaphor  
will not be set.  
  
We open the halves of a funny things and the  
drowning of extinctions excites into the rosy region.  
Pockets of metal converted into silken.  
Return to the homeland of the forests.
