A Diamond Within Gold
---------------------
Breakfast.  
You form my guilt mask  
like a iridescent oyster to fresh orange.  
What falters the props of happiness?  
What seems  
disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
  
A rust  
colored and melancholy railroad track is pitied in the moonlight evening.  
Come with me to the pigeon hole of polyps.  
I stayed stored and burnt umber  
inside the sea.  
One individual option and amid transluscent green water and sunburst orange precisions.  
The midnight foams you in its mortal mud.  
From pillow of fog to ray of sunlight,  
hidden times drawn by friendly channels, a  
tenacious shoreline begins to seize.  
Smooth metal.
