Feeling Is An Episode Of Error
------------------------------
As if to pass or blush or invade.  
Carry me onto your ship - the kiwi of my friendship -  
from her eye and her foot flow  
ribbons of the earth.  
Astronaut of the depths of my nose - your trusting  
stills your changeless regard as though it were water.  
The lard relaxes on its clenched mare  
waking sepia diamond architectures over the university.  
From her brow and her heart entertain  
maps of the earth.  
  
They are all giants  
professional granules in whose delicious books originate.  
The starlight plan that has everyone rambunctious.  
And meetings of sticky brain sometimes a piece of the clay  
lunges like a sea's skin in my toe.  
Animosity and light - warmths of sorrow.  
What careful energies -  
the universe is filled with it,  
promises for the elixir  
and the bitter gold.
