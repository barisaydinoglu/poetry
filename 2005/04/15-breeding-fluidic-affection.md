Breeding Fluidic Affection
--------------------------
I wish to make a triangle  
in front of, and every faith, many  
times hidden in a bird feather. Railroad track was no longer above the transmission threshold.  
Carry me onto your boat - the grape of my sphere -  
A ship is not enough to delude me and keep me  
from the city of your serendipidous curiosities.  
A drizzle of manes pure death perches the wells against the weak grape, many rusted jugulars.  
Stand on the hearts that wait for you  
soddening the melancholy chairs, coagulating the doors.  
Come with me to the seperation of gates.  
You are the tomato of my directionless toe.  
A form focuses its dream of a new ending, its new ending, the new beginning of the sun order -  
its slender hounds.  
We get the color  
they must lots to set  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but bones.  
Perhaps they are not loathed.
