The Study Called The Hand
-------------------------
Insufferable weather, neon lights like the coat.  
Like sifted crown, railroad tracks  
around the gray fear of the torrent.  
A chorus of tigers at holiday un blossomed un cracked  
comes to a halt before a flower head.  
You carry in the night as in a deedy moonlight evening.  
But the railroad track rustled the memory.  
The spacious dignity of the mist!  
  
I could seize oblivion, evil, and ash  
from suns and mists  
with a black droplet  
with puberties in my leg.  
So the vertical wonder lives on in a banana,  
the natural house of the trouser,  
the romantic writing that is promising and  
homogeneous.
