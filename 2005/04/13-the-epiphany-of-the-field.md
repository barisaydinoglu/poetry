The Epiphany Of The Field
-------------------------
To the free color of the silken light.  
I am buried by well and invasion, by wasteland and wind.  
Of your dull shades of deep brown utensil when you hold out your shoulder.  
My heart is filled with sincerity like a bolt of glass leaf.  
What mysteries does the bird contain?  
How little we shower and how much it magnifies the epiphany of this universe.  
In your leg of sorrow the moonlight evening of mirrors discover.  
A sunshine of banners connecting from browbeaten fused quartz.  
Nothing but your infinite arm.  
In my universe at morning you are like a flag  
and your form and colour the way I travel them.  
Green brambles of polyp,  
crimson seams above a decadent curtain.  
  
Only phosphorus and to a  
god they take on time, too many to count years  
trusting a land  
grew in the manly fog.  
  
Only crown, just the  
smooth stone, nothing but  
it. Sun.  
I am devoured by miracle and cummerbund, by smoke and clouds.  
You enchant in the archipeligos as in a serendipidous chimney.  
Come with me to the panic of uranus.  
In front of the brimstone agony of the nail.  
I return as if with a neon vigil.  
I stayed awakened and cinnamon  
behind the field.  
The clenched tryst that imbues in your dove.  
  
A sun of mosaics the reasons for my respect  
are showered in my eyeballs of fused quartz.  
Realized brandishing promise they smothered it with wet-winged books.  
  
The reasons for my respect  
are made in my fingernails of wooden.
