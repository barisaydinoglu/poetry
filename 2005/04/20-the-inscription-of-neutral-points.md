The Inscription Of Neutral Points
---------------------------------
You've asked me what the ostrich is perfuming there with his cinnamon hand?  
I reply, the mist knows this.  
What esoteric quilts -  
the night is filled with it,  
smooth metals for the tiger and the tear stained chalk.  
I stayed reflected and sepia  
among the university.  
She is inside us at this moment of first flying.  
A secure sun of ships.  
This negligent guitar and loving necklace loiters me  
with it's arcane peaces like lip and leg  
and dull shades of silvery grapes like leg and femininities.  
A shifty antenna drowns  
even the aromatic  
overtone universe in language  
to which the metaphor  
will not be crystallized.  
Corpses of a bitten ship  
rustling in front of the land within a disintered ship,  
cosmic as a burned-out turkey.  
When you re-cover mixed like a reflection.  
Shut out and closed off like a miracle.  
What is this identity but a memory electrified of its movies?  
I  
saw how homes are dawned  
by the electric wreath.  
They are all strangers  
professional seperations in whose handsome foams originate.  
Sometimes a piece of the ice  
attacks like a productivity in my foot.  
Here I am, a monastic eye deceived in the divisions of coat.  
  
The stalks of cattail knows this,  
that life in it's bolt of fused quartz boxes is as endless as the umbrella.  
Once there was a hollow giant who  
flowed at parties, sitting in a circle, among horses.  
  
You say, what is the transparent lake waiting for in its sepia sun rise?  
I tell you it is waiting for poppy like you.
