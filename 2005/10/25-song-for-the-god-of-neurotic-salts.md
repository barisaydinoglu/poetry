Song For The God Of Neurotic Salts
----------------------------------
Your foot preserves from south to west  
behind burnt umber water and cashmire old warrior's medals.  
A loaf of bread baked with banal honor and salt.  
You rise my rotten self-production  
like a balanced iguana to fresh  
bread.  
For a day, maybe thousand,  
I  
rested under a pillow of fog  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the stranger to be next to.  
Green legless horses of trash barge,  
green seams above a nauesous stars in the sky.  
A salt -like lard  
my heart is filled with felicity like a emerald ribbon.  
As if to overflow or re-cover or devour.  
What we say flies to  
love some other pioneer  
what a projection may teach.  
  
This dilute heart and attracting mirror pities me  
with it's lion hearted silences like hand and finger  
and dark lights like ears and snows.  
From harrowing wind to unrelenting rain,  
hidden starry skies drawn by eager channels, a  
violenet flint begins to upgrade.
