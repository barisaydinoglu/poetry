Since The Beginning
-------------------
If you were not the grape  
the acerb moon  
cooks, sprinkling its wine across the heights.  
Comfortable, marble crown!  
My heart is filled with purity like a wooden farm.  
In the middle of the tear stained cathedral, many cheerless convicts.  
In the smallest gold friendship went divulged in warmth of your body a circle inside a square,  
the rotten workings of real law.
