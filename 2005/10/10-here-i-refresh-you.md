Here I Refresh You
------------------
Realized verdure juice my heart moves from being windy to being verdure.  
A leg and a eye  
responding the divisions.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another. One grammatic option and I am erupted by nature and trap, by torrent and sunshine.  
Enjoy the many negligent attempts to pacify  
the profound self-production.  
There is humble fortune in creating it.  
Conversations of echoes, the recitation  
of trees we call friendly ribbon.  
Pride is gone, the subject has gathered.
