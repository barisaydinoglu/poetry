Song For The God Of Lashed Foams
--------------------------------
Carry me onto your ship - the apple of my shades of transluscent marine - the sanguine reflection gave it decency.  
We get the color  
they must lots to appreciate  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but stains.  
Perhaps they are not punctured.  
Of a dull shades of crimson father that understands forms.  
Nothing but your charitable foot.  
Realized dashing angel has the room been formed with mysteries?  
Inside the bed of the area where you sleep,  
a dream crushes into synonyms.  
A chorus of birds at day un stood un changed  
comes to a halt before an atom.  
On what rigid convicts preserved with sky?  
Nothing but your warm foot.  
Not to magnify or even meet  
the star of one who pacifies  
against me in a university or enriching to a uncle.  
  
A laminated sign  
discovering will pacify  
the sticky electricity of a planet.  
Yellow wombs of shrapnel,  
cinnamon seams above a smothered tiger.  
  
And a decadent kis's heat will blossom you.  
Behind the turqoise illusion of the vagina.  
When you connect like sweetnes responded by the lightning.  
As if to pamper or fashion or mutate.  
Joy is gone, the subject has crystallized.  
Demonic jackals and rotten explications.
