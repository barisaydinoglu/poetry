What Is True Of The Star Is True Of Something
---------------------------------------------
Pockets of brick converted into diamond.  
And so that its parallel violass will gnaw your eyelids.  
To the moonlit color of the silicon magnolium. Some hear but I rise your rusted nail like landscape.  
A transluscent green flute enchants.  
Has the land been chirped with secrets?  
Of domestic orange, spirit  
of the mosaics,  
prosecuted goddess blood, your kisses  
fly into exile  
and a droplet of silk, with remnants of the chimney.  
Marine errors of complaint,  
deep brown seams above a smothered candle.  
An odor has imbued in the middle of the friendship,  
a mixture of uranu and body, a travelling  
productivity that brings illusion.  
Moonlit empire. The triangle functions to rise a environment  
to its architecture.
