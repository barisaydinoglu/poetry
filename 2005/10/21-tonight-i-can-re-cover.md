Tonight I Can Re-cover
----------------------
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the hopeful landscapes?  
And the sun soft splattering its alcoves and soddening them full of  
university and tiger? This absurd goblet and imbuing elixir loathes me  
with it's poetic candles like curves and mouth  
And ultraviolet fleshes like fingernails and phemonanas.  
I saw how echoes are performed  
by the manly sea water.  
Outside the turqoise fear of the trash.  
One aerial option and the reasons for my respect  
Are loved in my leg of diamond.  
Marine electricity to my nauesous sea shell!  
You, who is like a vigil bird among the attracting of many mother.  
Like sticky magnolium, bird feathers  
of a red gentleman that understands breakfasts.  
Not the transparent moment  
when the twilight reflects the stones.  
Be guided by the domestic bottle's propeller.
