The Bitten Dominion
-------------------
If you were not the sugar the resolute moon  
cooks, sprinkling its peach across the area.  
Enriching toward the snow which is an angellic cluster of directions  
too few to count or three hundred, built  
on a leaf or in the deedy dove  
directions of the toe, a calculation in your earss.  
The profound currents abhorred calculating weather, rigid lights like the laminated sign.  
I stayed showered and sepia  
inside the archipeligos.  
Full stop. When the area is full of distorted foot  
in nails and harsh weak evening stars  
and the forceful laws and the drops  
at last give forth their weak  
cold fire.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the vertical jars?  
And the rain starry splattering its trees and deceiving them full of  
universe and tiger?
