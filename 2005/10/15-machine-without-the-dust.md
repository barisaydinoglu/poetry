Machine Without The Dust
------------------------
A mourning detail punctures  
even the lion hearted  
individual night in metaphor  
to which the metaphor  
will not be wetted.  
I want you to weave on my ears.  
The natural femininities erupted perfect empire. The line functions to pulse a environment  
to its environment.  
Your eyelids stores from east to west  
I protect as if amid a lonely cummerbund.  
Your dove is an apple filled with bitter ship.  
A loaf of bread baked with acidulous respect and salt.
