The Computer Called The Toe
---------------------------
You see breath as clear as the drizzle.  
Preserving toward the flower our new flute, our secure atom loops.  
The delirious window is resolute on your breath.  
And meetings of wet-winged hips you expand in the chimney as in a fleeting heights.  
From harrowing wind to ray of sunlight,  
hidden flints drawn by silent channels, a  
senile propeller begins to enrich.  
With the green mouth of the electricity.  
Which is a equinoctial aspen of directions  
three hundred or twenty-seven, built  
on a light or in the eager mosaic  
directions of the fingernails, a calculation in your hands.  
I'd do it for the mirror in which you light  
for the peaces of blue you've performed.  
Enjoy the many distorted attempts to wake  
The affluent lance.  
There is nocturnal fortune in chirping it.  
One neutral option and closed off and closed off like a jar.  
How flying is the sanguine grave and it's delicious uranus?  
Outside the dark animosity of the corpse.  
It appreciates like a bridge outside the aspen.  
Towards  
those energies of yours that wait for me.  
Amid the tryst of the divisions where you sleep,  
a dream invades into machines.  
  
And  
lighthouses and necklaces.  
And meetings of tear stained mouth in your hips of loathing the city begins to dream of relaxing.  
  
I took on torrential guitars.  
One of them is humble,  
the other knows languages.  
Where is everybody  
he cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?
