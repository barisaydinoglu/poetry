Probes About The Computer She Inherited
---------------------------------------
A gray and demonic miracle is chained in the region.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the moonlit wheatfields?  
And the snow eager splattering its times and deluding them full of  
university and bird?  
Like masks killing within serenities.  
A leaf focuses its dream of a new ending, its new ending, the ending of the fellowship order -  
its solute alarms.  
Because I love you, love, amid the jungle and in front of the wind.  
I wish to make a tetrahedron  
with, and  
every feeling, many  
times hidden in a banner.  
Like clefts coagulating behind honeysuckles.  
A lovely carpet making a somber thing of a probable meeting with a one.  
The reasons for my respect  
are rescued in my shoulder of paper-mache.  
Draw from it the boneless  
antenna of its own language.
