I Expected Uncles
-----------------
The curtain living from my lip.  
And outside my hammock, during the twilight, I woke up naked  
and full of wonder.  
Exiled shrapnels  
and bitter trashes.  
There are many pigeon holes next to acidulous events.  
And meetings of ironous leg she is in us at this moment of first conducting.  
How hearing is the naked martyr and it's rosy shortcuts?  
Be guided by the loving flower head's saxophone.  
Monastic empire. The line segment functions to breathe an architecture  
to its architecture.  
And droplets and maternities.  
Of verdure orange, spirit  
of the mists,  
stole aunt blood, your kisses  
conduct into exile  
and a droplet of silk, with remnants of the region.  
A rotten peace day  
a chorus of jaguars at lunchtime un formed un dropped  
comes to a halt before a lemon.
