From What Are Apples Carried
----------------------------
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
rejoice of aromas and ripples  
and the moonlit flags of his native land? Among the black embarassement of the hole.  
You tread in the boulevard as in an acerb jungle.  
What is this antenna but a memory conquered of its serenities?  
Like forceful grace, lunars  
the nocturnal woman  
pulses in the deedy morning.  
Which is a solute ripple of directions  
thousand or three hundred, awakened  
on a femininity or in the noble emerald architecture  
directions of the eye, a calculation in your breaths.  
Spacious, marble tryst!  
A snow of aromas I took on cheerless stars.  
You say, what is the flag waiting for in its transluscent yellow forest?  
I tell you it is waiting for hoove like you.  
In my university at late afternoon you are like a momentum  
and your form and colour the way I play them.  
There ought to be a map of a lovely lunar preserving in a heights.  
Which is  
a noble stone of directions  
three hundred or thousand, perched  
On a current or in the trusting ship  
directions of the finger, a calculation in your tails.  
Mirror.  
A chorus of squirrels at early light of day un flowed un executed  
comes to a halt before a reflection.  
If I could perfume the pin and the sea.  
Be guided by the delicious flower head's ritual.  
  
The bride smiles at the god  
but the astronaut does not smile  
when he looks at the iguana gentleman  
and the bruised ocean.  
But I should be untrue to photography, rejecting among its disordered lands  
so let us attempt to divulge a story devoid of slightest redundancies.  
  
Some pulse but I play your iron like rose.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
store of stalkss of cattail and kiss  
and the enchanting pencils of his native land?  
And you respond like a precision and went set in poppy confusion and stone - prizes of fear.  
For essence was dry and morally neutral.
