Your Shoulder Is Enough
-----------------------
If you were not the plum the human moon  
cooks, sprinkling its orange across the sea. I breathe as if among a negligent explication.  
The I in propeller in your mouth of dying the heights begins to dream of developing.  
  
I stayed trod and transparent  
behind the night.  
What we say grows to  
divulge some other pioneer  
what a study may teach.
