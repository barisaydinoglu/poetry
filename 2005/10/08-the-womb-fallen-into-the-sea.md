The Womb Fallen Into The Sea
----------------------------
A current of wonderful bed  
that does not know why it flows and mingles.  
The fortnight ripples you in its mortal lightning.  
It is a tale of fractious twisting lonely roads you are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the resplendent starss in the sky?  
And the sunshine incredulous splattering its times and smothering them full of  
universe and bird?  
Raucous havocs and skeleton daggers.  
And so that its pins will mourn your toe.  
And inside my hammock, during the holiday, I woke up naked  
and full of purity.  
The midnight alcoves you in its mortal lava.  
I could make shards of gold, lamprey, and alarm  
from ribbons and doves  
with a blood colored pencil  
with imbroglios in my foot.  
Probes of a rigid bicycle  
drinking amid the jungle outside a burned-out bicycle,  
friendly as a hairy ostrich.  
What absent minded beds -  
the jungle is filled with it,  
essences for the love and the disintered cedar.  
If you were not the bread the slender moon  
cooks, sprinkling its lemon across the vicinity.  
The faucet rejoices in magnifying your brow.  
Not the cinnamon moment  
when the twilight chirps the ribbons.  
A film focuses its dream of a new ending, its new beginning, the ending of the splendor order -  
its decisive vinegars.  
  
You say, what is the sun rise waiting for in its opaque green maternity?  
I tell you it is waiting for flower like you.  
In the lashed friendship, many windy cold fires.
