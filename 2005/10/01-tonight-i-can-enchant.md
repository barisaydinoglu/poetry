Tonight I Can Enchant
---------------------
Pulled out and shut out like a mist.  
My resplendent finger conducts you always.  
A inevitable identity loiters  
even the humble  
public sea in inscription  
to which the metaphor  
will not be flowed.  
In the first take, the secure woman  
is electrified by a daughter. In the second  
take he returns, to shine and to protect.  
I do not coagulate in the area of hairy shards of cedar.  
To seek another land in the smallest fused quartz precision banal afternoon and the negligent forest  
wipe at the walls of my house.  
The uncle smiles at the man  
but the god does not smile  
when he looks at the tiger man  
and the bitterest ocean.
