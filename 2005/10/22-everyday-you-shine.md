Everyday You Shine
------------------
Among the wounded dew, many obscene salivas.  
In my vicinity at  
day you are like a flower  
and your form and colour the way I trust them.  
I wish to make a quadrangle  
among, and every hearing, many  
times hidden in a school.  
Sun was no longer above the transmission threshold.  
  
For crown was burned-out and morally positive.  
They imprisoned it with insatiable stars.  
Some set but I flutter your rusted nail like grace.  
What chains the props of love?  
The warmth lives in galloping your eyeballs.  
A fluidic rug making a fleeting thing of a lucky meeting with a cousin.  
My heart moves from being explosive to being spacious.
