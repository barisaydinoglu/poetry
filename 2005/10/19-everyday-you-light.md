Everyday You Light
------------------
Inside the moonlight evening like aluminum. The bride smiles at the stranger  
but the bride does not smile  
when he looks at the toucan son  
and the molested ocean.  
The coat plan that has everyone bitterest.  
The bruised  
jar is profound on your hips.  
Like the worn-out brick of acrobats the star trusting from my finger.  
  
Which is a soft aroma of directions  
million or thousand, built  
on a prize or in the resolute stars in the sky  
directions of the mouth, a calculation in your toes.  
The brutal circus is pure on your leg.
