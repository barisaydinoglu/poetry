Playing Worn-out Nostalgia
--------------------------
The juice dedicates in circumscribing your breath.  
Marine and scrupulous stranger,  
from her mouth and her brow refresh  
lands of the earth.  
Our new serenity, our hopeful bottle circles.  
A drop rustling will shower  
the morose wind of a planet.  
And so that its wastelands will mutate your finger.  
Your reflection is a tiger filled with rusted evening star.  
Wave of wave of kisses rolling down the sea.  
Has the sea been relinquished with secrets?  
  
It was the early light of day of the pheasant.  
You, who is like a legless horse cat among the expanding of many son.  
It was the sunset of the oyster.
