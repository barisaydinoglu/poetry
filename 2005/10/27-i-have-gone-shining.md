I Have Gone Shining
-------------------
From her ears and her leg appreciate  
roots of the earth.  
And so that its seperations will sodden your nose.  
Your eyeballs appreciates from west to east only tear stained and to a  
bride they take on time,  
too few to count years  
what essential crowns -  
the city is filled with it,  
pullulations for the quilt and the neurotic fused quartz.
