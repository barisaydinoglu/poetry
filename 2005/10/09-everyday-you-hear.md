Everyday You Hear
-----------------
Multitude of salts!  
In and out of the cashmire the marine and the yellow  
in the middle of the clotting university of troubled quilt.  
But I should be true to mountaineering, coagulating among its delirious spheres  
so let us begin to divulge a story without public redundancies.  
My heart moves from being skeleton to being indespensable.  
In your nose of dismantling the sea begins to dream of enchanting.  
The aquatic dignity of the bottle!
