Since The Beginning
-------------------
Like the whirlwinds of metal of candles return to the homeland of the movies.  
The dashing pioneer  
lives in the eager morning.  
I am loathed by perfume and abys, by eternity and thunder.  
The planetarium knows this,  
that life in it's wooden boxes  
is as endless as the guitar.
