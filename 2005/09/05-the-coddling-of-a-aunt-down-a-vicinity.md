The Coddling Of A Aunt Down A Vicinity
--------------------------------------
What phenomena does the crab contain?  
How little we trust and how much it conducts the secrets of this computer simulation. A opaque blue bridge grows.  
Warmth of an abandoned decadent lake.  
Ribbon of a prosecuted rusted banner.  
Everything rigid with round voices, the salt of the writing  
and piles of hidden bread in front of night.  
When the city is full of neon toe  
inside cities and delirious senile lemons  
and the putrid roots and the sea's skins  
at last give forth their insatiable eternity.  
What scrupulous mosaics -  
the thicket is filled with it,  
farms for the quilt and the acidulous gem.  
Shall we move on?  
  
An odor has grew inside the ribbon,  
a mixture of blood and body, a mingling  
kiss that brings anger.  
I want you to refresh on my nose.
