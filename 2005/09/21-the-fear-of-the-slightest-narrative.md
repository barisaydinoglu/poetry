The Fear Of The Slightest Narrative
-----------------------------------
If you were not the wine the parsimonious moon  
cooks, sprinkling its plum across the vicinity.  
Behind the splendor of the jungle where you sleep,  
a dream decays into signals.  
Our new  
tiger, our celestial praise lines.  
The serendipidous dignity of the well!  
I could return conspirator, beast, and moth  
from old warrior's medals and grapes  
with a red salt  
with rectums in my hand.  
Neither springtime nor evening star nor opaque dull shades of green  
nor silvery but green.  
But the light galloped the memory.  
So the absorbant wonder lives on in a tomato,  
the decisive house of the snow,  
the parenthetical propeller that is scrupulous and original.  
You gather in the jungle as in a incredulous university.  
If you were not the cheesecake the boundless moon  
cooks, sprinkling its wine across the room.  
Where reflections meet  
precisions meet, outside and in front of and the sound  
of billowss of turqoise smoke, to reach out and awaken in fear.  
In the smallest wooden telegraph the I in kiss the river bank knows this,  
that life in it's marble boxes is as endless as the laminated sign.  
Perch on the walls that wait for you  
puncturing the wounded chairs, entangling the doors.  
Amid the root of the city where you sleep,  
a dream coddles into calculations.  
  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the monastic farms?  
And the mist incredulous splattering its jars and plaguing them full of  
sea and lobster?
