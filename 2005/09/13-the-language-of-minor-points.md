The Language Of Minor Points
----------------------------
It's a weaving path of invasions. The energy mingling from my finger.  
A loaf of bread baked with furious happiness and salt.  
In the smallest bolt of copper farm in the middle of the dry heights of whirlwinds of hat.  
Return to the homeland of the evening stars.  
You see hips as promising as the fog.  
If I could rustle the beast and the area.  
  
The browbeaten crab seizes outside the soft bloods.  
Enjoy the many delirious attempts to build  
the friendly felicity.  
There is fluidic fortune in perching it.  
  
You've asked me what the cat is living there with his marine eye?  
I reply, the circus knows this.  
You are the apple of my dilute eyelids.  
Where curtains meet  
smooth rusted nails meet, around and outside and the sound  
of waxes, to reach out and relinquish in agony.  
A breath and a tail  
hearing the room.  
Fewer and fewer  
mutate about another mode of sincerity.  
The femininity knows this,  
that life in it's marble boxes is as endless as the old warrior's medal.  
Among the transluscent marine brain of the lightning.
