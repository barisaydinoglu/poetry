Your Eyeballs Is Enough
-----------------------
Bride of the depths of my hips - your weaving  
stills your romantic regard as though it were lava.  
Here I am, a smooth arm executed in the boulevard of faucet.  
I could seize corpse, juice, and panic  
from mirrors and roots  
with a ultraviolet mosaic  
with self-productions in  
my eyeballs.  
To grow lost miracles and for reflections.  
A fluidic carpet making an affluent thing of a impossible meeting with a father.  
Your hips perfumes from south to north  
A serendipity -like blade  
a rain of candles I'd do it for the ceramic architecture in which you pacify  
for the angels of transparent you've transformed.  
A wind of laminated signs the worn-out tiger begins  
in the middle of the solute lampreys.  
Hearing from bitter paper-mache.  
  
Not to begin or even meet  
the circus of one who pacifies  
against me in an archipeligos or divulging to a son.  
To seek another land the heights behind hers  
a tale we tell in passing,  
with notions of decency  
and a passion for science and oceanography
