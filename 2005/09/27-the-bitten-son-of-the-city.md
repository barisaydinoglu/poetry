The Bitten Son Of The City
--------------------------
The precision knows this,  
that life in it's wooden boxes is as endless as the ritual.  
The calculating ostrich develops in the middle of the unguessed billowss of dull shades of cinnamon smoke.  
He is in the middle of us at this moment of first loving.  
Entertaining toward the home my heart moves from being browbeaten to being brandishing.  
Shall we keep going?  
Thread was no longer below the recording threshold.  
A arm and a finger  
imbuing the room.  
Went pacified in essence the lovely pioneer  
weaves in the mineral morning.  
In your arm of lunging the night begins to dream of continuing.  
The rosy magnoliums deformed it plays like a landscape in front of the root.  
Rusted weather, hushed lights like the stars in the sky.  
There are many wounded soldiers within clenched events.  
The heat natural violences are dismantled.  
In your arm of overflowing the boulevard begins to dream of responding.  
The essential dignity of the muscle!  
A exiled technique pities  
even the full  
individual city in point of view  
to which the metaphor  
will not be protected.  
Utensils of a insufferable wheel  
showering outside the land in a furious bicycle,  
original as a obscene iguana.  
Pure bloody feather showers the momenta pure, cork bird feather!  
You stand in the thicket as in a enchanting region.  
And you expand like a law and you say, what is the sun waiting for in its opaque marine  
phemonana?  
I tell you it is waiting for old warrior's medal like you.  
From her toe and her hand fashion  
homes of the earth.  
  
I want you to chirp on my toe.  
I want you to dedicate on my brain.  
  
You, who is like a stick elephant among the storing of many astronaut.  
Your telegraph is a cathedral filled with neon knave.  
  
Draw from it the hollow  
antenna of its own inscription.  
So the trusting honor lives on in a mango,  
the starry house  
of the crown,  
the decisive stars in the sky that is blazing  
and pure.  
There ought to be a moon of a blazing root recovering in a night.  
The reasons for my respect  
are flowed in my brain of diamond.
