Since The Beginning Of Relaxing
-------------------------------
And outside my hammock, during the midnight, I woke up naked  
and full of honor.  
I was without doubt the custodian toucan  
there in the dry night.  
When it looked me with its trusting precision eyes  
it had neither eyeballs nor brow  
but cedar glass architectures on its sides.  
Your fingernails chirps from south to west  
when you rise like honeysuckle loved by the sky.
