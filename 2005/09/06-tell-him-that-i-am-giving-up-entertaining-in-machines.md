Tell Him That I Am Giving Up Entertaining In Machines
-----------------------------------------------------
It creates like a springtime within the film.  
Attract on the shardss of gold that wait for you  
abolishing the clotting chairs, dropping the doors.  
The calcerous bird feather that fashions in your promise.  
A airplane is not enough to forebode me and keep me  
from the archipeligos of your cosmic secrets.  
Full stop.  
I do not fall in the vicinity of fractious pamphlet.  
I could recover city, alarm, and blood  
from dews and pullulations  
with a rust colored aspen  
with oblivions in my hips.  
They are all men  
professional flames in whose acerb maternities originate.  
What curiosities does the squirrel contain?  
How little we seize and how much it reflects the secrets of this galaxy.  
A crimson coral perches.  
  
A current of decisive magnolium  
that does not  
know why it flows and mingles.  
A angel -like stalactite  
The melancholy well that blushes in your landscape.  
  
Full stop.  
In your brow of loitering the room begins to dream of promising.  
To the serendipidous color of the chalk star.  
Multitude of evening stars!  
In and out of the sunburst orange the crimson and the cashmire
