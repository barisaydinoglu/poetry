Pale Sea Shell
--------------
The day love you in its mortal clay.  
The faucet plan that has everyone melancholy.  
In the gray panic of the conspirator.  
Once there was a raucous daughter who  
lived at parties, sitting in a quadrangle, among flints.  
  
Not the yellow moment  
when the morning pacifies the splendors.  
From palm tree leaf to unrelenting rain,  
hidden trees drawn by affluent channels, a  
lewd mosaic begins to expand.  
The gentleman smiles at the child  
but the father does not smile  
when he looks at the iguana god  
and the calculating ocean.  
The unguessed necklaces coddled conversations of splendors, the recitation  
of juices we call eloquent maternity.  
Sifted sunrise and the wayside aroma  
coddle at the walls of my house.  
I am buried by flint and dung, by havoc and wind.  
A mist of flints an odor has mixed among the wave,  
a mixture of vigil and body, a gathering  
awe that brings anger.
