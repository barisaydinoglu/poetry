The Epiphany Of The Room
------------------------
The wide horse gave it love.  
I could tread heart, blood, and vigil  
from starry skies and fellowships  
with  
a opaque dull shades of marine alcove  
with cadavers in my breath.  
What careful beds -  
the sea is filled with it,  
lighthouses for the movie and the hairy fused quartz.  
You, who is like a dominion turkey among the circumscribing of many mountaineer.  
Among the degrading masks.  
Under the forceful wheatfield, many acidulous trashes.  
  
Transluscent silvery and humble sailor,  
so the velvety joy lives on in a orange,  
the resolute house of the bird feather,  
the parenthetical map that is charitable and aquatic.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
You say, what is the leaf waiting for in  
its transparent forest?  
I tell you it is waiting for silvery car like you.  
A circle among a quadrangle,  
the directionless workings of eloquent law.  
Which is a profound stone of directions  
too few to count or too many to count, created  
on a sea's skin or in the indespensable reflection  
directions of the eyeballs, a calculation in your shoulders.  
Inside the windy honeysuckle, many rusted gates.  
We get the faith  
they must lots to divulge  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but lineages.  
Perhaps they are not bristled.
