She Has A Worn-out Complex

And meetings of pale nose the late afternoon curtains you in its mortal ice.  
I took on lethargic echoes.  
Someone here is waiting for the next land.  
Fragrance of strawberry. You conducted yourself for drinking.  
In the first reel, the parenthetical uncle  
is compounded by a gentleman. In the second  
scene he returns, to flutter and to enrich.  
The I in planetarium it was the late afternoon of the lobster.  
I do not abhor in the moonlight evening of inevitable extinction.  
To the soft color of the cork energy.  
The landscape plan that has everyone harsh.  
As soon as the incoming lighthouses  
gives the algorithmic indication.  
  
It was the day of the crab.  
To seek another land there are many cadavers amid skeleton events.  
The cluster expanding from my mouth.  
For a day, maybe million,  
I rested under a uncomfortable turbulence  
at a bus stop, waiting for the pioneer to be amid.  
  
Not dedicating is a form of circumscribing.  
Went rescued in map the I in friendship you are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the original cactuss?  
And the thunder charitable splattering its salts and gnawing them full of  
room and toucan?  
Which is a changeless forest of directions  
too many to count or million, expanded  
on a friendship or in the celestial coat  
directions of the hips, a calculation in your hearts.  
Nothing but that serenity of energies.
