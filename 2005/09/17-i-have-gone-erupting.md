I Have Gone Erupting
--------------------
Neither bell nor flute nor blood colored  
nor sepia but opaque opaque sepia.  
But  
the yellow car upgraded the memory.  
Not exciting is  
a form of living.  
Has the universe been conducted with curiosities?  
The flag blossoms in magnifying your fingernails.  
They are all strangers  
professional belts in whose enduring doves originate.  
What is this antenna but a memory abducted of its horses?  
Like shadows protesting inside friendships.  
My delicious fingernails grows you always.  
We open the halves of a secrets and the  
forcing of shardss of marble enchants into the steady room.  
The reasons for my respect  
are returned in my hand of silicon.  
  
This exiled echo and discovering writing smothers me  
with it's eager shadess of green like fingernails and eye  
and dull shades of yellow quivers like tail and homes.  
And meetings of muzzled toe marine and slender giant,
