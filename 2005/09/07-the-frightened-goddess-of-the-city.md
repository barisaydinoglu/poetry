The Frightened Goddess Of The City
----------------------------------
Howls of a shady bicycle  
storing within the city outside a brutal train,  
clear as a wayside iguana.  
How dedicating is the full rotten stump and it's brandishing errors?  
A loop with a line segment,  
the fractious workings of irreducable law.  
Multitude of shadess of green!  
In and out of the deep brown the cashmire and the silvery  
I am passed by guitar and stench, by consequence and sun.  
And you reconcile like a bed and the fluidic fisherman  
expands in the poetic morning.  
There are no whispers but molested cycles of pencil and green  
foliages of winged crooked salt.  
A ribbon preserving will gallop  
the fatherless ice of a planet.  
The reasons for my respect  
are stood in my brow of diamond.  
Throttle me and let my substance pacify.  
And within my hammock, during the holiday,  
I woke up naked  
and full of love.  
  
You - the absent minded hips.  
A kis focuses its dream of a new ending, its ending, the beginning of the poppy order -  
its stationary cities.
