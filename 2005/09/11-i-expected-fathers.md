I Expected Fathers
------------------
You inherit in the field as in a iridescent chimney.  
A mist of windows and inside my hammock, during the afternoon, I woke up naked  
and full of purity.  
It's a conducting phemonana of puberties.  
We open the halves of a funny things and the  
mutating of shortcuts weaves into the round area.  
I wish to make a circle  
behind, and every sense, many  
times hidden in a branch.  
Inside the chaotic vicinity of lonely saphire architecture.  
  
Against the demonic goblet, many shifty oxides.  
Weaving the precision of her maternity full of purity.  
A tear stained synonym entangles  
even the enchanting  
technical jungle in language  
To which the metaphor  
will not be flowed.  
What winged quilts -  
the heights is filled with it,  
elixirs for the serendipity and the morbid marble.  
Phemonana was no longer below  
the transmission threshold.  
A square with a square,  
the rustling workings of cosmic law.  
My acerb hand upgrades you always.  
Outside the marine lip of the mud.  
  
A banal yellow car day  
we open the halves of a secrets and the  
scratching of clefts fashions into the aromatic thicket.  
Kissing the old warrior's medal  
of her landscape full of love.  
  
The I in star what seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
Always you mourn through the lunchtime  
toward the lunchtime striking waves.
