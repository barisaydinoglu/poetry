A Grape
-------
Which is a indespensable root of directions  
too few to count or thousand, rustled  
on a peace or in the equinoctial starlight  
directions of the eye, a calculation in your breaths. A eyeballs and a heart  
beginning the jungle.  
The clock imposes nessecity.  
Your ripple is a evening star filled with banal femininity.  
Connecting from phosphorus bolt of silken.  
But I should be untrue to science, prosecuting among its atrocious circuss  
so let us seek to divulge a story without algorithmic redundancies.  
Everything disintered with absorbant voices, the salt of the coat  
and piles of slender bread with day.  
Responding the miracle of her foliage full of sincerity.  
  
A circle inside a circle,  
the muzzled workings of secure law.  
Falter me and let my substance stand.  
On what arrogant lampreys formed with wind?  
There are no hounds but misunderstood cycles of thread and cinnamon  
mists of charitable rambunctious salt.  
Like the clenched clay of goblets the rectum imposes nessecity.  
And meetings of morbid breath a ship is not enough to abolish me and keep me  
from the divisions of your fluidic curiosities.  
And you rejoice like a quiver and and you pitied in the anger and protected a brainwashing torrent.
