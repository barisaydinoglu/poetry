Everything Is A Minor Issue
---------------------------
And the lemon to its friendship  
and among the momenta the fresh one  
the man covered with delicate apple.  
I protect as if in front of a pale oblivion.  
If I could flutter the rooster and the jungle.  
I'm the astronaut to the garden of immediate springtime.  
Blue and homogeneous pioneer,  
I do not drown in the field of sifted bone.  
  
In your leg of panic the room of peaces understand.  
But I should be true to science, burying among its atrocious mosaics  
so let us attempt to tell a story without grammatic redundancies.  
I do not shake in the vicinity of insufferable womb.  
I'd do it for the laminated sign in which you blossom  
for the salts of opaque crimson you've crystallized.  
Around the thicket I like to make like a shady fragrance of strawberry.  
Realized monastic film pockets of ash converted into copper.  
You pulse in the thicket as in a electrical field.
