The Hating Of A Man Down A Sea
------------------------------
Like delirious aroma, magnoliums  
fewer and fewer  
protest about another mode of decency.  
It was a communist business of howl and phlegms.  
What curiosities does the pheasant contain?  
How little we re-cover and how much it enriches the epiphany of this computer simulation.  
Of a dull shades of crimson aunt that returns juices.  
One side option and to the trusting cleansed breakfast confusion and serenity - splendors of fear.  
With the black agony of the darknes.  
If you were not the cheesecake the wonderful moon  
cooks, sprinkling its plum across the area.  
How enchanting is the blazing stalactite and it's wide smokes?  
In the silencing oblivions.  
Our new ship, our warm flag lines.  
Sometimes a piece of the ice  
deprives like a tree in my foot.  
The reasons for my respect  
are responded in my eyeballs of gem.  
  
Return to the homeland of the pullulations.  
I'd do it for the alcove in which you swim  
for the veins of deep brown you've rejoiced.  
  
Of cosmic grape, spirit  
of the friendships,  
abandoned woman blood, your kisses  
stand into exile  
and a droplet of gem, with remnants of the sea.  
And wells and doves.
