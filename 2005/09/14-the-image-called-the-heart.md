The Image Called The Heart
--------------------------
I'm the giant to the stone of immediate sea's skin.  
Fewer and fewer  
invade about another mode of decency.  
I do not mutate in the night of bitterest wax.  
Draw from it the oily  
image of its own antenna.  
A tail and a eye  
hearing the region.  
Nothing but your arcane foot.  
  
A loaf of bread baked with tear stained wonder and salt.
