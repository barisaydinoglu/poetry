Song For The Woman Of Guilt Umbrellas
-------------------------------------
From her finger and her ears awaken  
trysts of the earth.  
I'm the son to the lunar of immediate apple.  
Draw from it the obscene  
inscription of its own phenomenon.  
Noone  
here is waiting for the next forest.  
Forest. You wetted yourself for reconciling.
