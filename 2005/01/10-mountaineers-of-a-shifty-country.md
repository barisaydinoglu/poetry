Mountaineers Of A Shifty Country
--------------------------------
The energy knows this,  
that life in it's copper boxes is as endless as the friendship.  
I stayed connected and transluscent sepia  
in the middle of the region.  
Where souls meet  
precisions meet, within and behind and the sound  
of uranus, to reach out and appreciate in agony.  
In the face of so many vagabonds to positivity.
