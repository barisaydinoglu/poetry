Tell Them That I Am Giving Up Continuing In Images
--------------------------------------------------
The I in fellowship of a turqoise woman that dawns currents.  
Come with me to the havoc of invasions.  
You relinquish in the sea as in a sensible vicinity.  
They throttled it with skeleton spheres.  
What serendipidous keys -  
the heights is filled with it,  
veins for the poppy and the lewd bolt of glass.  
Of a brimstone uncle that enriches laminated signs.  
You promise slowly into a thicket to set your business.  
How dedicating is the changeless jackal and it's round gates?  
  
Always you hate through the midnight  
toward the sunset erupting bridges.  
Some return but I blossom your salt like praise.  
I was without doubt the cousin oyster  
there in the ghostly land.  
When it looked me with its blazing lighthouse eyes  
It had neither toe nor nose  
but cork cathedrals on its sides.  
Elder of the depths of my ears - your storing  
stills your monastic regard as though it were fire.  
On what neurotic shrapnels circumscribed with sky?
