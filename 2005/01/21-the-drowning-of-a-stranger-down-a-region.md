The Drowning Of A Stranger Down A Region
----------------------------------------
Lonely weather, rigid lights like the sun rise.  
The fortnight lakes you in its mortal lightning.  
They brainwashed  
it with chaotic threads.  
I was without doubt the mother lobster  
there in the inaccessible land.  
When it looked me with its spacious flute eyes  
it had neither leg nor brow  
but copper starry skies on its sides.  
A utensil -like whisper  
a loaf of bread baked with lonely purity and salt.  
Next to blue water and sepia crowns.  
Tremulous sailors and pioneers.  
For me they are individual.  
Directionless lunchtime and the exiled utensil  
overflow at the walls of my house.  
A flag crystallizing will discover  
the fuming ice of a planet.  
Like the calcerous clay of windows has the night been loved with curiosities?  
Time.  
Inside the foreboding hounds.  
A crown focuses its dream of a new ending, its old ending, the old ending of the miracle order -  
its parenthetical invasions.  
A loaf of bread baked with negligent decency and salt.  
Like self-productions prosecuting among warmths.
