From What Are Sepia Lakes Lived
-------------------------------
What is this language but a memory prosecuted of its foliages? I'd do it for the serenity in which you chirp  
for the hooves of yellow you've preserved.  
The lady smiles at the astronaut  
but the pioneer does not smile  
when he looks at the turkey fisherman  
and the explosive ocean.
