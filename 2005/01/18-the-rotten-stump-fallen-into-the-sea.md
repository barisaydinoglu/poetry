The Rotten Stump Fallen Into The Sea
------------------------------------
The I in wheatfield in your tail of embarassement the thicket of schools magnify.  
If you were not the grape the fresh moon  
cooks, sprinkling its plum across the vicinity.  
Only misunderstood and to a  
man they take on time, too few to count years  
and the warmth to its splendor  
and among the goblets the fluidic one  
the pioneer covered with aromatic mirror.  
  
Which is a romantic goblet of directions  
thousand or three hundred, heard  
on a nature or in the iridescent vein  
directions of the brain, a calculation in your arms.  
Smear me and let my substance tread.  
We get the sense  
they must lots to swim  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but masks.  
Perhaps they are not  
deceived.  
  
Shine on the utensils that wait for you  
harassing the sterile chairs, striking the doors.  
But I should be untrue to computer science, abolishing among its violenet muscles  
so let us seek to divulge a story devoid of individual redundancies.  
A shaken antenna buries  
even the resolute  
algorithmic boulevard in identity  
to which the metaphor  
will not be rescued.  
  
From tornado to uncomfortable turbulence,  
hidden souls drawn by blazing channels, a  
arrogant awe begins to rise.  
My eager brain mingles you always.
