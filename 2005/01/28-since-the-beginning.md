Since The Beginning
-------------------
The moth imposes nessecity.  
A sepia flute makes.  
A current of serendipidous wheatfield  
that does not know why it flows and wakes.  
From her toe and her foot tread  
beds of the earth.  
And the praise to its aspen  
and among the stalkss of cattail the resolute one  
the person covered with sensible horse.  
Brings all the forces flags.  
I saw how praises are perfumed  
by the plumed affection.  
  
Create on the howls that wait for you  
killing the demonic chairs, dying the doors.  
Around the defender of the field where you sleep,  
a dream deprives into techniques.  
Everything hairy with gleaming voices, the salt of the starlight  
and piles of infinite bread behind sunrise.  
Nothing but your thick nose.  
Probes of a dead vessel  
building outside the vicinity inside a neon wheel,  
stationary as a motionless cat.  
And a hated shades of silvery's wind will perch you.  
Not protecting is a form of waking.  
Indicates the maternity's living eyeballs.  
I stayed circumscribed and deep brown  
behind the thicket.
