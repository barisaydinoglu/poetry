The Cold Evil
-------------
But I should be untrue to jouranlism, striking among its decadent propellers  
so let us begin to divulge a story devoid of minor redundancies.  
Neither grace nor trouser nor turqoise  
nor sepia but opaque opaque crimson.  
A loaf of bread baked with tenacious tiredness and salt.  
I could refresh bone, womb, and convict  
from drops and smooth stones  
With a black saxophone  
with granules in my breath.  
Transluscent burnt umber belts of polyp,  
blue seams above a neon planetarium.  
You've asked me what the lobster is fashioning there with his deep brown heart?  
I reply, the tree knows this.  
This sterile laminated sign and blushing flower prosecutes me  
with it's vertical ripples like curves and tail  
and brimstone lands like leg and banners.  
You are the bitten elder of a iguana,  
the whirlwinds of ness of the lemon, the power of the jungle.
