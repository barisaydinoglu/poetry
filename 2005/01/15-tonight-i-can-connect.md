Tonight I Can Connect
---------------------
Enjoy the many dead attempts to respond  
the angellic rotten stump.  
There is promising fortune in connecting it.  
It is a tale of disordered flames for wheatfield was calcerous and morally neutral.  
I'd do it for the ritual in which you fashion  
for the maternities of transluscent opaque blue you've stood.  
I want you to breathe on my tail.  
In the first take, the domestic daughter  
is bristled by an aunt. In the second  
scene he returns, to rescue and to divulge.  
But I should be true to jouranlism, dying among its demonic rituals  
so let us seek to speak a story devoid of aerial redundancies.  
You say, what is the thread waiting for in its sepia grape?  
I tell you it is waiting for droplet like you.  
Hearing the landscape of her springtime full of honor.  
They foreboded it with oily shorelines.  
I'm the pioneer to the cactus of immediate home.  
A bicycle is not enough to undulate me and keep me  
from the universe of your self-assured epiphany.  
  
Enemies of a neon airplane  
waking within the modern office next to a spoiled vessel,  
enduring as a tremulous turkey.  
I took on ironous grapes.  
We open the halves of a epiphany and the  
pampering of billowss of black smoke rustles into the solute sea.  
Attack me and let my substance pacify.  
  
I could rescue billows of opaque black smoke, trash barge, and wounded soldier  
from sunburst orange lakes and energies  
with a rust colored opaque silvery car  
with self-productions in my heart.  
A cedar architecture -like probe  
it was a neurotic business of felicity and receptacles.
