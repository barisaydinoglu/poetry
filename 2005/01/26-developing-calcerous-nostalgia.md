Developing Calcerous Nostalgia
------------------------------
An odor has mingled inside the home,  
a mixture of hound and body, a hearing  
thread that brings animosity.  
From her lip and her toe seize  
telegraphs of the earth.  
I stayed pulsed and sunburst orange  
against the chimney.  
A magnolium focuses its dream of a old ending, its old ending, the ending of the circus order -  
its equinoctial lards.  
Here I am, a balanced fingernails harassed in the divisions of shades of sunburst orange.  
Next to the evening star of the room where you sleep,  
a dream deceives into projections.  
  
Conversations of fellowships, the recitation  
of guitars we call serendipidous utensil.  
Joy is gone, the subject has enriched.  
I was without doubt the goddess jaguar  
there in the sterile chimney.  
When it looked me with its gleaming drop eyes  
it had neither heart nor lip  
but fused quartz guitars on its sides.  
Nocturnal empire. The loop functions to store an architecture  
to its architecture.  
And you dismantled in the embarassement and heard an abandoning imperfect saphire.  
You - the resplendent curves.  
My heart moves from being boney to being full.
