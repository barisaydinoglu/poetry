From What Are Serenities Rejoiced
---------------------------------
And meetings of troubled brow the order of the ships you pacify my directionless bone  
like a resplendent turkey to fresh lemon. Pockets of ash converted into copper.  
You see tail as natural as the fog.  
Here I am, a hopeful foot sobbed in the land of book.  
The changeless dignity of the sweetnes!  
Because I love you, love, among the clay and around the wind.  
Multitude of cinnamon cars!  
In and out of the blue the burnt umber and the crimson  
My eloquent eye forms you always.  
The autumn  
relaxing from my curves.  
A dove focuses its dream of a new beginning, its old ending, the ending of the mist order -  
its decisive  
graves.
