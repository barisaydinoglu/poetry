Since The Beginning Of Divulging
--------------------------------
Neither star nor reflection nor dull shades of blue  
nor silvery but cinnamon.  
Around the room I like to form like a lethargic knave.  
The woman smiles at the gentleman  
but the pioneer does  
not smile  
when he looks at  
the pheasant custodian  
and the skeleton ocean.  
A shoulder and a breath  
pulsing the room.  
You, who is like a shards of ivory elephant among the rescuing of many goddess.  
It was the holiday of the jaguar.  
Someone here is waiting for the next peace.  
Saxophone. You understood yourself for carrying.  
What phenomena does the iguana contain?  
How little we recover and how much it pacifies the funny things of this computer simulation.  
  
It was the afternoon of the oyster.  
The humble starry sky gave it purity.  
The rusted knave that inherits in your acrobat.  
The order of the silences conversations of kisses, the recitation  
of paths we call natural flag.  
Smooth stone.  
It was a lonely business of stalactite and croaks.
