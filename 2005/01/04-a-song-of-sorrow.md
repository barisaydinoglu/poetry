A Song Of Sorrow
----------------
Nothing but that flower head of flags. One technical option and everything mourning with cosmic voices, the salt of the apple  
and piles of velvety bread in front of early light of day.  
But the wave chirped the memory.  
Be guided by the cosmic droplet's defender.  
You, who is like a hole bird among the flowing of many astronaut.  
But I should be true to science,  
compounding among its frail landscapes  
so let us try to tell a story devoid of alphabetic redundancies.  
My warm foot breathes you always.  
A misunderstood heart day  
what forces the props of respect?  
Fewer and fewer  
steal about another mode of happiness.  
Your fingernails pacifies from north to south  
a fleeting wind of jars.  
A line next to a tetrahedron,  
the wayside workings of loving law.  
Rejoiced and then dedicated in the archipeligos.  
  
If you were not the peach the pure moon  
cooks, sprinkling its bread  
across the city.  
You - the lion hearted hand.  
  
Your nose blossoms from south to north  
one of them is domestic,  
The other knows identities.  
Where is someone  
she cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
The calcerous pheasant pacifies behind the soft cold fires.  
Closed off and pulled out like a railroad track.  
My heart moves from being violenet to being steady.  
Refreshing the drop of her aroma full of respect.  
I salute your velvety apple  
and envy your delicious pride.  
When you gallop relaxed like a mirror.  
I salute your unguessed bread  
and envy your stationary pride.  
To seek another land nothing but that awe of stalkss of cattail.  
  
I wish to make a line  
inside, and every feeling, many  
times hidden in a drop.  
Sunburst orange and delicious elder,
