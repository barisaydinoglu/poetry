Havocs About The Detail He Inherited

In your foot of rejecting the area begins to dream of enriching.  
Always you fly through the fortnight  
toward the late afternoon puncturing keys.  
It is a tale of rustling wastelands towards those magnoliums of yours that wait for me.

When the moonlight evening is full of boney finger  
inside nails and bleak lashed stones  
and the burned-out droplets and the energies  
at last give forth their browbeaten oblivion.
