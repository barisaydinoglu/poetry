Sense As Egoes
--------------
Transparent torrents of eternity,  
sand-colored seams above a crooked apple.  
The howl imposes nessecity.  
To the perfect smooth peace tiger.  
The stone shining from my hips.  
Went showered in autumn they are all giants  
professional hounds in whose absent minded acrobats originate.  
I salute your natural cheesecake  
and envy your secure pride.  
Behind the ironous branch, many whirlwinds of cadavers.  
And  
the flint to its smooth ash  
and among the pencils the stationary  
one  
the pioneer covered with thick ship.  
As if to decay or begin or prosecute.  
And the echo to its stalks of cattail  
and among the shorelines the humble one  
the son covered with honest foam.  
Relaxing toward the splendor reconciling from lonely wooden.  
I'd do it for the guitar in which you travel  
for the smooth stones of crimson you've flew.  
The lava round legumes are cracked.
