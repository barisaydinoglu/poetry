What Is True Of The Wine Bottle Is True Of Everything
-----------------------------------------------------
The raucous school that makes in your bird feather. In the penetrating throats.  
A dark and fire-tipped coral is foreboded in the region.  
To seek another land magnified and then perfumed in the vicinity.  
There ought to be a sea's skin of a rosy soul standing in a city.  
The goddess smiles at the aunt  
but the mountaineer does not smile  
when he looks at the lobster one  
and the molested ocean.  
Neither sea water nor sun nor blood colored  
nor crimson but crimson.  
Sunburst orange lampreys of cleft,  
transluscent silvery seams above a molested quiver.  
When you rescue like wheatfield  
divulged by the earth.  
You rustle my imperalist oblivion  
like a iridescent oyster to fresh bread.  
And guitars and branches.  
The current recovers in creating your finger.
