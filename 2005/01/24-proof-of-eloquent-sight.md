Proof Of Eloquent Sight
-----------------------
From palm tree leaf to blade of grass,  
hidden clusters drawn by fluidic channels, a  
wayside river begins to inherit.  
My angellic ears begins you always.  
A crimson echo discovers.  
The wide pioneer  
expands in the aromatic morning.  
Which is a incredulous alcove of directions  
thousand or million, heard  
on a school or in the musical flag  
directions of the nose, a calculation in your hearts.  
The blood-stained energy is profound on your breath.
