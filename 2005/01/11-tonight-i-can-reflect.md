Tonight I Can Reflect
---------------------
Return to the homeland of the muscles.  
Silvery clocks of utensil,  
deep brown seams above a sticky time.  
The I in serenity in the first take, the winged  
gentleman  
is chained by a man. In the second  
scene he returns, to seize and to grow.  
Dedicating the ship of her crown full of decency.  
My heart moves from being fuming  
to being free.
