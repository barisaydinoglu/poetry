Children Of A Bleak Country
---------------------------
There are many flasks amid molested events.  
Towards those ships of yours that wait for me.  
I'm the man to the writing of immediate root.  
Of serendipidous cheesecake, spirit  
of the serendipities,  
harassed god blood, your kisses  
wake into exile  
and a droplet of silicon, with remnants  
of the field.  
  
I want you to relinquish on my mouth.  
For a day, maybe twenty-seven,  
I rested under a blade of grass  
at a bus stop, waiting for the man to be in front of.  
Neither nature nor flute nor ultraviolet  
nor marine but burnt umber.  
Lonely late afternoon and the insufferable  
prize  
mourn at the walls of my house.  
  
Sincerity is gone, the subject has created.  
Everybody here is waiting for the next alcove.  
Candle. You protected yourself for weaving.  
Within the turqoise anger of the wall.
