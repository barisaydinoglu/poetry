The Mysteries Of The Area
-------------------------
A chorus of oysters at  
sunrise un made un condemned  
comes to a halt before a elixir.  
You recover my whirlwinds of self-production  
like a hopeful pheasant to fresh sugar.  
Your mouth plays from west to west  
we get the abstraction  
they must lots to connect  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but vigils.  
Perhaps they are not forced.  
So the handsome purity lives on in an apple,  
the winged house of the mosaic,  
the lion hearted bed that is hidden and trusting.  
Your candle is a sweetnes filled with bruised aspen.  
From ray of sunlight  
to harrowing wind,  
hidden lemons drawn by romantic channels, a  
inevitable peace begins to wake.  
Not the green moment  
when the morning creates the perfumes.  
A burnt umber praise inherits.  
Nobody here is waiting for the next stone.  
Stars in the sky. You galloped yourself for responding.  
With its neon kiss outside the blood colored agony of the havoc.
