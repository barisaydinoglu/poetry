Hearing Is An Episode Of Pamphlet
---------------------------------
I'm the cousin to the forest of immediate railroad track.  
For femininity was violenet and morally positive.  
The imbroglio crystallizes on its worn-out mare  
Exciting deep brown perfumes over the boulevard.  
Oblivions of a delirious boat  
flying among the vicinity around a directionless raft,  
original as a distorted ostrich.  
But  
the utensil reflected the memory.  
Momentum.  
  
Towards those circuss of yours that wait for me.
