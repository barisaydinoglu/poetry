Image With The Complaint
------------------------
The sky parsimonious puberties are protested. To discover lost veins and for miracles. Shall  
we keep going?  
A boney synonym passes  
even the comfortable  
neutral universe in machine  
to which the metaphor  
will not be stood.  
In the careless door, many hated pigeon holes.  
What epiphany does the oyster contain?  
How little we perform and how much it relaxes the mysteries of this universe.  
And you'll ask  
why doesn't his poetry  
live of quivers and umbrellas  
and the equinoctial awes of his native land?  
In the face of so many egoes to functionality.  
Swimming the peace of her crown full of purity.
