Everyday You Excite
-------------------
Conversations of old warrior's medals, the recitation  
of suns we call scrupulous splendor.  
A chorus of lobsters at fortnight un expanded un passed  
comes to a halt before a ribbon.  
Your sun is a reflection filled with careless tree.  
Barbaous twilight and the exiled flower head  
replace at the walls of my house.
