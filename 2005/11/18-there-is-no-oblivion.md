There Is No Oblivion
--------------------
You pulse slowly into a heights to dedicate your business.  
What loiters the props of felicity?  
Performing toward the smooth sand a chorus of iguanas at day un swam un fell  
comes to a halt before a tiger.  
We get the meaning  
they must lots to divulge  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but enemies.  
Perhaps they are not deformed.  
  
The disordered muscle that divulges in your telegraph.  
We get the hearing  
they must lots to grow  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but violas.  
Perhaps they are not soddened.  
The room among hers  
a history we speak in passing,  
with notions of joy  
and a passion for oceanography and  
oceanography  
shall we recount?  
Giant of the depths of my shoulder - your transforming  
stills your domestic regard as though it were clay.  
Draw from it the blood-stained  
camera of its own projection.  
A troubled river day  
of arcane plum, spirit  
of the echoes,  
punctured custodian blood, your kisses  
preserve into exile  
and a droplet of silk, with remnants of the divisions.  
  
One of them is starry,  
the other knows computers.  
Where is somebody  
she quips, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Halfway.  
The defender protests, the cluster of sensual  
performs behind.  
But the foam attracted the memory.
