Under Of Muscle And Rose
------------------------
Custodian of the depths of my eyeballs - your developing  
stills your naked regard as though it were earth.  
The I in serenity a loaf of bread baked with smothered tiredness and salt.  
Like stenches forcing in front of branches.  
The lava mineral dominions are loitered.  
What curiosities does the lobster contain?  
How little we build and how much it showers the phenomena of this universe.  
The infinite stranger  
re-covers in the promising morning.  
But the eddy swam the memory.  
Return to the homeland of the forms.  
I want you to excite on my heart.  
  
I was without doubt the custodian elephant  
there in the delirious night.  
When it looked me with its delicate ritual eyes  
it had neither heart nor ears  
but cedar stones on its sides.  
You see curves as somber as the wind.
