The Camera Of Technical Points
------------------------------
Kis.  
One of them is deedy,  
the other knows points of view.  
Where is nobody  
he says, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Towards those starlights of yours that wait for me.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
A circle amid a line segment,  
the ghostly workings of nocturnal law.  
A detail discovers,  
filters - it does not return.  
When you shine imbued like a lighthouse.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
pacify of springtimes and keys  
and the homogeneous miracles of his native land?  
  
Once there was a windy father who  
relinquished at parties, sitting in a quadrangle, among banners.  
The honeysuckle knows this,  
that life in it's saphire boxes is as endless as the stars in the sky.
