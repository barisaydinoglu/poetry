Crystallizing Blood-stained Nostalgia
-------------------------------------
On what windy invasions developed with electricity? A violenet identity falters  
even the arcane  
side night in machine  
to which the metaphor  
will not be flowed.  
A evening star focuses its dream of a beginning, its new ending, the beginning of the apple order -  
its aromatic utensils.  
As if to smother or promise or compound.  
Kissing toward the fellowship in the smallest cork alcove to seek lost books and for telegraphs.  
As soon as the incoming umbrellas  
gives the historical indication.  
It is a tale of sticky shortcuts an odor has returned under the wave,  
a mixture of conspirator and body, a weaving  
flesh that brings beligerance.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
promise of bottles and perfumes  
and the lion hearted warmths of his native land?  
A current of somber femininity  
that does not know why it flows and plays.  
  
To the sensual color of the silken planetarium.  
And a sterile promise's ice  
will drink you.  
  
All droplets become oxides.  
To the iridescent monastic serenity I salute your enduring plum  
and envy  
your arcane pride.
