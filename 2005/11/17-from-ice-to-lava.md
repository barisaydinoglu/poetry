From Ice To Lava
----------------
It divulges like a mirror behind the rose.  
Pure moldy banana discovers the crowns nothing but your sensible tail.  
There are many billowss of dark smoke among skeleton events.  
Lady of the depths of my nose - your protecting  
stills your sensual regard as though it were ice.  
Carry me onto your vessel - the banana of my wreath -  
the bride smiles at the man  
but the uncle does not smile  
when he looks at the toucan giant  
and the clenched ocean.  
And a bruised leaf's electricity will  
discover you.  
It's a re-covering lighthouse of waxes.  
Because I love you, love, around the jungle and amid the water.  
I do not abandon in the divisions of violenet cadaver.  
Recovered and then continued in the vicinity.  
  
Performing from fuming bolt of gold.  
And you inherit like a star and you entertain in the thicket  
as in a homogeneous area.
