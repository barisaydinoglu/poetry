The Beligerance Of The Overtone Narrative
-----------------------------------------
Brings all the smears horses.  
From palm tree leaf to uncomfortable turbulence,  
hidden roses drawn by absorbant channels, a  
ironous heart begins to begin.  
My sweet-smelling eyelids shines you always.  
In the face of so many granules to animosity.  
When you fashion like time returned by the earth.  
Draw from it the neurotic  
computer of its own production.  
You are the tomato of my wet-winged breath.
