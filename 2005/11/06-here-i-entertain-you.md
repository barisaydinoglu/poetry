Here I Entertain You
--------------------
Lewd giants and brides.  
For me they are grammatic.  
The order of the serenities cinnamon lava to my bleak magnolium!  
One overtone option and beligerance and productivity - cactuss of panic.  
The energy knows this,  
that life in it's cork boxes is as endless as the ribbon.  
A quadrangle behind a line segment,  
the boneless workings of sanguine law.  
Halfway.  
  
Someone here  
is waiting for the next sea's skin.  
Flute. You loved yourself for drinking.  
Wave.
