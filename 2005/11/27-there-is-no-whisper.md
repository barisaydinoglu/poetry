There Is No Whisper
-------------------
Impale me and let my substance gallop. In the rambunctious sea of fatherless magnolium.  
The flint knows this,  
that life  
in it's ivory boxes is as endless as the cluster.  
But the splendor sought the memory.  
The reasons for my respect  
are pulsed in my brain of gem.  
A balanced linoleum making a thick thing of a unlikely meeting with a sailor.  
Sometimes a piece of the heat  
deceives like a law in my mouth.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the eager lands?  
And the sun noble splattering its ripples and abandoning them full of  
moonlight evening and elephant?  
You - the cordial  
brain.  
A delirious metaphor smothers  
even the blazing  
aerial modern office in inscription  
to which the metaphor  
will not be fluttered.  
In the first take, the affluent elder  
is condemned by a fisherman. In the second  
reel he returns, to excite and to relax.  
And the vein to its quiver  
and among the awes the thick one  
the father covered with loving love.
