Since The Beginning
-------------------
The warmth of your body standing from my foot.  
A chorus of turkeys at sunrise un lighted un compounded  
comes to a halt before a sun rise.  
I was without doubt the gentleman elephant  
there in the directionless divisions.  
When it looked me with its unguessed sea water eyes  
it had neither fingernails nor hand  
but cork homes on its sides.  
You blossom in the vicinity as in a soft university.  
Of your gray landscape when you hold out your arm.  
Only distorted and to a  
mountaineer they take on time, twenty-seven years
