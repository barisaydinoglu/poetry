Your Foot Is Enough
-------------------
It is a tale of rambunctious deaths crystallizing toward the snow banner of a wiped directionless quilt.  
To the hidden poetic garden a sanguine rug making a cleansed thing of a impossible meeting with an aunt.  
The ribbons exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
next to it in darkness.  
Performing the momentum of her salt full of love.  
The smooth moon gave it tiredness.  
Went protected in farm there are many probes inside calculating events.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the ancient cathedrals?  
And the rain sensual splattering its forests and prosecuting  
them full of  
archipeligos and toucan?  
Some conduct but I perfume your clay like wheatfield.  
The dilute pheasant swims behind the esoteric lards.  
Full stop.  
We open the halves of a epiphany and the  
abhorring of conspirators connects into the enchanting heights.  
As if to strike or drink or loiter.  
Stored and then carried in the heights.  
Nothing but that utensil of kisses.  
To the rosy secure salt carrying a moon  
built in the celestial mist.  
A current of romantic aroma  
that does not know why it flows and makes.  
Enjoy the many decadent attempts to rejoice  
the soft trash barge.  
There is profound fortune in pacifying it.  
A tetrahedron inside a loop,  
the forceful workings of esoteric law.  
The laminated sign relinquishing from my curves.  
You've asked me what the jaguar is carrying there with his transparent ears?  
I reply, the landscape knows this.  
Outside crimson water and green farms.
