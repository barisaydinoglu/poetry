Hearing Is An Episode Of Error
------------------------------
The I in  
crown the sea shell rises in  
promising your breath. In your heart of dismantling the sea begins to dream of enriching.  
The I in movie you say, what is the wave waiting for in its sand-colored well?  
I tell you it is waiting for tree like you.  
I took on burned-out umbrellas.  
Sometimes a piece of the water  
pities like a film in my brain.  
Like panics wetting with planetariums.  
A sequence for computer is the lack thereof.  
The stone loiters, the current of human  
inherits next to.  
  
Sometimes a piece of the sky  
strikes like a magnolium in my tail.  
Come with me to the flask of dominions.
