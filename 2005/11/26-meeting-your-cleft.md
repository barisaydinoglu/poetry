Meeting Your Cleft
------------------
Always you undulate through the holiday  
toward the fortnight invading cathedrals.  
I want you to blush on my arm.  
The pigeon hole pacifies on its mourning mare  
protecting sand-colored yellow cars over the sea.  
Towards those starss in the sky of yours that wait for me.  
Went trusted in ship what coagulates the props of sincerity?  
To the fluidic color of the silken rose.  
The imperfect cork imposes nessecity.  
I hear as if around a disordered cubicle.  
I stayed perfumed and blue  
outside the region.  
The oily praise is iridescent on your arm.  
Always you invade through the early light of day  
toward the holiday falling pastures.  
  
When you hear like sun rise made by the heat.  
The afternoon stones you in its mortal earth.  
A flesh focuses its dream of a new beginning, its new ending, the beginning of the productivity order -  
its dashing graves.  
But the fragrance of strawberry galloped the memory.  
Appreciating toward the poppy sometimes a piece of the lightning  
shakes like a serenity in my hand.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
Warmth.
