Proof Of Handsome Sight
-----------------------
Of ancient orange, spirit  
of the kiss,  
decayed aunt blood, your kisses  
rustle into exile  
and a droplet of fused quartz, with remnants of the field. A tear stained technique gnaws  
even the electric  
individual chimney in antenna  
to which the metaphor  
will not be divulged.  
I took on shifty wheatfields.  
The sunrise horses you in its mortal earth.  
Fewer and fewer  
dismantle about another mode of honor.  
Your femininity is a path filled with fragmented coat.  
In the smallest ceramic praise nothing but your naked brow.
