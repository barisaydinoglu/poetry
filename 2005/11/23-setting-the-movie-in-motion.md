Setting The Movie In Motion
---------------------------
You are the orange of my fractious toe.  
And so that its throats will compound your brow.  
It dawns like a garden within the rose.  
But I should be true to mountaineering, condemning among its hairy spheres  
so let us begin to tell a story devoid of neutral redundancies.  
This lonely stone and rejoicing curtain wets me  
with it's comfortable poppies like hand and finger  
and red writings like leg and kiss.  
Brings all the scratches leaves.  
A burnt umber grace connects.  
We get the meaning  
they must lots to circumscribe  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but clefts.  
Perhaps they are not abandoned.
