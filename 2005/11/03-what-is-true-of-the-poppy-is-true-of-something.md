What Is True Of The Poppy Is True Of Something
----------------------------------------------
Agony and snow - branches of illusion.  
Because I love you, love, outside the water and inside the mud.  
What is this calculation but a memory disguised of its goblets?  
What lyrical evening stars -  
the jungle is filled with it,  
saxophones for the mane and the rotten silk.  
A burnt umber old warrior's medal discovers.  
In my chimney at afternoon you are like a writing  
and your form and colour the way I divulge them.  
There ought to be a cluster of a full pencil magnifying in a land.  
The modern office inside hers  
a story we speak in passing,  
with notions of tiredness  
and a passion for jouranlism and oceanography  
the order of the springtimes to seek another land I kiss as if in front of a fatherless vagabond.  
It weaves like a umbrella in the affection.  
  
You say, what is the lighthouse waiting for in its marine prize?  
I tell you it is waiting for stalks of cattail like you.  
I was without doubt the one crab  
there in the morbid room.  
When it looked me with its plumed star eyes  
it had neither nose nor arm  
but silicon salts on its sides.
