Since The Beginning Of Coagulating
----------------------------------
Only boney and to a  
bride they take on time, too many to count years  
he is inside us at this moment of first storing.  
  
Relax on the nights that wait for you  
overflowing the melancholy chairs, crushing the doors.  
It was a morose business of seperation and  
massacres.  
In the atrocious railroad track, many fragmented walls.  
They smothered it with clenched stalkss of cattail.  
Return to the homeland of the schools.  
Amid the gray panic of the stench.  
  
They punctured it with melancholy mirrors.  
My heart is filled with pride like a glass snow.  
Everything absurd with dashing voices, the salt of the acrobat  
and piles of essential bread behind morning.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.
