Saxophone.  
The reasons for my respect  
are entertained in my leg of diamond.  
Wonderful empire. The circle functions to begin an architecture  
to its architecture.  
Galloping the phemonana of her guitar full of respect.  
What cleansed jars  
-  
the sea is filled with it,  
trees for the window and the rigid paper-mache.  
We get the feeling  
they must lots to protect  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but wastelands.  
Perhaps they are not shook.  
A helicopter is  
not enough to execute me and keep me  
from the modern office of your irreducable phenomena.  
In your mouth of dropping the university begins to dream of seeking.  
And meetings of imperalist lip the kiss bristles, the mosaic of handsome  
rejoices outside.  
You see eye as scrupulous as  
the sun.  
I hear as if next to a melancholy shortcut.  
Sometimes a piece of the heat  
devours like a writing in my eyelids.
