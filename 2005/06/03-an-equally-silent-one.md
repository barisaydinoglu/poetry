An Equally Silent One
---------------------
You protect in the boulevard as in a free boulevard.  
We open the halves of a epiphany and the  
invading of flames awakens  
into the iridescent universe.  
Deprive me and let my substance trust.  
The heart imbues on its bitten mare  
flying cinnamon honeysuckles over the university.  
I want you to perform on my eyeballs.  
Only umbrella, just the  
silence, nothing but  
it. Cluster.  
  
Wave of wave of keys rolling down the sea.  
A loaf of bread baked with fatherless purity and salt.  
Your ears enchants from north to north  
only furious and to a  
goddess they  
take on time, million years  
It's a conducting sweetnes of alarms.  
The putrid elephant seeks in the cleansed throats.
