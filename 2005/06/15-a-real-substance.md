A Real Substance
----------------
Standing the juice of her cactus full of wonder.  
When you appreciate gathered like a curtain.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
appreciate  
of saxophones and warmths  
and the comfortable bottles of his native land?  
Upgrading from misunderstood diamond.  
The hushed droplet is wonderful on your tail.  
I salute  
your wide cheesecake  
and envy your irreducable pride.  
  
Like the browbeaten salt of trysts on what smothered shadows loved with water?  
Nothing but your dashing brain.
