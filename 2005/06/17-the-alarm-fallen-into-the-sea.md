The Alarm Fallen Into The Sea
-----------------------------
A current of electric mane  
that does not know why it flows and circumscribes.  
A serene thunder of wells.  
Because I love you, love, around the sky and in front of the heat.  
When you perform crystallized like a hat.  
For a day, maybe three hundred,  
I rested under a unrelenting rain  
at a post office, waiting for the lady to be outside.  
Always you abolish through the afternoon  
toward the midnight wetting flower heads.
