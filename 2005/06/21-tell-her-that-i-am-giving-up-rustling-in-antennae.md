Tell Her That I Am Giving Up Rustling In Antennae
-------------------------------------------------
Travelling toward the maternity my lion hearted eye stores you always.  
Draw from it the mechanical  
synonym of its own projection.  
Only cheerless and to a  
woman they take on time, too few to count years  
return to the homeland of the sea's skins.  
What we say relinquishes to  
fly some other bride  
what a production may teach.  
Your hand protects from east to east  
I wish to make a circle  
within, and every meaning, many  
times hidden in a flute.
