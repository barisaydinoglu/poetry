I Expected Children
-------------------
I'm the god to the energy of immediate love.  
What is this synonym but a memory shattered of its wells?  
All lands become traps.  
For a day, maybe too few to count,  
I rested under a blade of grass  
at a bus stop, waiting for the custodian to be amid.
