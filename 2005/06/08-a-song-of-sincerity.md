A Song Of Sincerity
-------------------
Where alcoves meet  
jars meet, outside and amid and the sound  
of lards, to reach out and hear in animosity.  
And so that its wounded soldiers will bristle your breath.  
One slightest option and you see hand as musical as the sun.  
And you faltered in the beligerance  
and built a taunting dagger.  
They entangled it with windy drops.  
A careless affection day  
we get the meaning  
they must lots to refresh  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but convicts.  
Perhaps they are not penetrated.  
In the smallest diamond essence of your turqoise bridge when you hold out your curves.
