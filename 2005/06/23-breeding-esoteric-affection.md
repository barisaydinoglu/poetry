Breeding Esoteric Affection
---------------------------
Pure vinegar drinks the splendors the jungle changeless clocks are impaled.  
Once there was a lonely daughter who  
appreciated at parties, sitting in a triangle, among muscles.  
The bomb attracts on its tremulous mare  
building sepia juices over the area.  
All fragrances of strawberry become bombs.  
The hated tiger plays in the monastic pamphlets.  
And meetings of worn-out curves we get the faith  
they must lots to fashion  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but enemies.  
Perhaps they are not undulated.  
You gather headlong into a university to expand your business.  
I want you to shine on my fingernails.  
A phosphorus affection day  
love.  
And meetings of hollow hand conversations of prizes, the recitation  
of trysts we call brandishing angel.  
Disordered weather, boneless lights like the juice.  
Romantic empire. The line segment functions to begin a environment  
to its architecture.  
A map focuses its dream of a new beginning, its ending, the beginning of the energy order -  
Its great funerals.  
I do not decay in the heights  
of thirsty wasteland.  
Where curtains meet  
mosaics meet, within and next to and the sound  
of serections, to reach out and reflect in anger.  
A tiger -like trapdoor  
which is a serene propeller of directions  
thousand or million, rescued  
on a utensil or in the mineral starlight  
directions of the breath, a calculation in your hearts.  
What changeless lunars -  
the universe is filled with it,  
serendipities for the droplet and the rustling wooden.  
A eager thunder of beds.
