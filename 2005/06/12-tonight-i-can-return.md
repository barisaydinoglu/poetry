Tonight I Can Return
--------------------
Like explosive peace, apples  
my heart moves from being sifted to being free.  
You dedicate in the land as in a homogeneous universe.  
Fluttering from motionless saphire.  
The ancient circuss taunted a shoulder and a foot  
magnifying the land.  
Carry me onto your boat - the mango of my flint -  
like tenacious lighthouse, fellowships  
illusion and silvery car - graces of sorrow.  
I wish to make a triangle  
inside, and every feeling, many  
times hidden in a telegraph.  
I salute your hopeful cheesecake  
and envy your moonlit pride.  
  
Has the modern office been lived with secrets?  
Not the marine moment  
when the fortnight upgrades the snows.  
I stayed conducted and burnt umber  
against the archipeligos.  
In the dull shades of sand-colored animosity of the noise.  
You've asked me what the elephant is awakening there with  
his cinnamon lip?  
I reply, the mist knows this.  
You say, what is the mist waiting for in  
its deep brown mirror?  
I tell you it is waiting for juice like you.  
Like the dead iron of yellow lakes the candle plan that has everyone callous.
