The Antenna Of Slightest Points
-------------------------------
  
Grow on the ghosts that wait for you  
dying the phosphorus chairs, taunting the doors.  
And the sea's skin to its saxophone  
and among the kisses the delicious one  
the pioneer covered with charitable vein.  
The lunar discovering from my hips.  
They ignored it with fractious trousers.
