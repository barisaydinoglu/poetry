A Charitable Substance
----------------------
Of stationary apple, spirit  
of the books,  
condemned man blood, your kisses  
rescue into exile  
and a droplet of crystal, with remnants of the thicket.  
Amid the flower head of the boulevard where you sleep,  
a dream devours into metaphors.  
Of a brimstone mother that awakens stalkss of cattail.  
Inside the city like broken glass.  
You are the apple of my rigid nose.  
Maternity.  
Of cleansed lemon, spirit  
of the poppies,  
electrified  
god blood, your kisses  
live into exile  
and a droplet of fused quartz, with remnants of the boulevard.
