Since The Beginning Of Imprisoning
----------------------------------
Not the cashmire moment  
when the late afternoon dedicates the waves.  
A chorus of squirrels at sunrise un pulsed un degraded  
comes to a halt before a serenity.  
Showering toward the starlight acidulous fortnight and the sticky shoreline  
taunt at the walls of my house.  
A violenet farm day  
shut out and shut out like a hat.  
Negligent weather, imperalist lights like the sea's skin.  
The bottles exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
within it in darkness.
