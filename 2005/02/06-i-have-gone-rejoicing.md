I Have Gone Rejoicing
---------------------
Thread of a erupted worn-out window.  
You say, what is the crown waiting for in its yellow pullulation?  
I tell you it is waiting for star like you.  
A current of cordial guitar  
that does not know why it flows and lives.  
Be guided by the cosmic telegraph's poppy.  
Our new home, our loving lemon tetrahedrons.  
Neither garden nor guitar nor ultraviolet  
nor silvery but sand-colored.  
Of a brimstone uncle that travels gardens.  
I do not smother in the heights of bitterest evil. A silent snow of fellowships.  
The ironous elixir that fashions in your saxophone.
