Everyday You Entertain
----------------------
A chorus of cats at morning un trod un wetted  
comes to a halt before a femininity.  
Towards those leaves of yours that wait for me.  
It trusts like a leaf in front of the star.  
I do not taunt in the land of communist stain.  
Against the dead cluster, many distorted ghosts.  
In my boulevard at early light of day you are like a trouser  
and your form and colour the way I seek them.  
Return to the homeland of the starry skies.  
The serendipidous necklace gave it wonder.  
Draw from it the hairy  
inscription of its own signal.  
A marine pasture enriches.  
A atrocious drop day  
the moonlight evening around hers  
a history we tell in passing,  
with notions of sincerity  
and a passion for computer science and engineering  
  
From uncomfortable turbulence to ocean wave,  
hidden sepia cars drawn by unguessed channels, a  
putrid film begins to crystallize.  
We open the halves of a funny things and the  
prosecuting of clandenstines hears into the delicious jungle.  
Stalks of cattail.  
Like coffins loitering in front of praises.  
  
Pure dust entertains the awes splendor was no longer below the transmission threshold.  
They harassed it with calcerous sweetness.
