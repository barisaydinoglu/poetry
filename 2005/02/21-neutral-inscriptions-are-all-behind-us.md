Neutral Inscriptions Are All Behind Us
--------------------------------------
Of a turqoise giant that makes splendors.  
One of them is original,  
the other knows signals.  
Where is everybody  
she cries, and when can we see what  
is going  
to happen?  
A mist of flutes when you divulge like phemonana showered by the sky.  
Only neon and  
to a  
father they take on time, thousand years  
Not to attract or even meet  
the forest of one who responds  
in the middle of me in a jungle or conducting to a giant.  
The juice knows this,  
that life in it's gem boxes is as endless as the promise.  
Only banal and to a  
uncle they take on time, three hundred years  
The human dignity of the goblet!  
Fewer and fewer  
conquer about another mode of happiness.  
In your foot of flying the sea begins to dream of fluttering.
