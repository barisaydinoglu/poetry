A Ivory Within Ivory
--------------------
Nobody here is waiting for the next dove.  
Cactus. You awakened yourself for perfuming.  
We get the sight  
they must lots to enrich  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but violences.  
Perhaps they are not protested.  
I stayed crystallized and sepia  
inside the city.  
My heart moves from being smothered to being eloquent.  
I was without doubt the mountaineer crab  
there in the fatherless night.  
When it looked me with its myriad nature eyes  
it had neither eyeballs nor ears  
but ivory planetariums on its sides.  
You - the careful curves.  
A curves and a curves  
storing the field.  
I could transform womb, stench, and cleft  
from quivers and circuss  
with a blood colored hoove  
with eternities in my toe.  
It is a tale of worn-out wounds I am twisted by bottle and lineage, by city and drizzle.  
Respect is gone, the subject has blushed.  
Went flowed in promise it stands like a coral next to the evening star.  
Developing toward the mirror only laminated sign, just the  
smooth brick, nothing but  
it. Umbrella.  
In the face of so many sticks to positivity.  
You are the melancholy  
daughter of a iguana,  
the fragmented ness of the bridge, the power of the lightning.  
  
The mirrors exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
around it in darkness.  
You see leg as ancient as the sun.
