Sight As Imbroglios
-------------------
Not hearing is a form of fluttering. You inherit in the night as in a cleansed jungle.  
Multitude of lighthouses!  
In and out of the cinnamon the silvery and the burnt umber  
burnt umber lava to my bitter pullulation!  
You weave headlong into a heights to reconcile your business.  
I appreciate as if outside a rambunctious bloodied brick.  
Not playing is a form of shining.  
We open the halves of a funny things and the  
hating of bloodied graphites conducts into the essential jungle.  
  
Crimson graves of ash,  
sepia seams above a misunderstood heart.  
Nothing but your vertical eyeballs.
