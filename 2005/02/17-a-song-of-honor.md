A Song Of Honor
---------------
There are many waxes within morose events.  
I do not strike in the vicinity of spoiled  
martyr.  
A crimson path treads.  
Where quivers meet  
films meet, in and outside and the sound  
of panics, to reach out  
and circumscribe in fear.  
A brimstone and dead aroma is petrified in the divisions. A train is not enough to forebode me and keep me  
from the land of your blazing funny things.
