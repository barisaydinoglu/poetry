Tell Them That I Am Giving Up Hearing In Calculations
-----------------------------------------------------
You are the kiwi of my clenched eyeballs.  
And so that its ghosts will protest your eyelids.  
Draw from it the muzzled  
technique of its own image.  
A opaque transparent farm seeks.  
Not to circumscribe or even meet  
the lake of one who inherits  
outside me in a jungle or fluttering to a cousin.  
You - the honest fingernails.  
Wave of wave of poppies rolling down the sea.  
Around the mutating funerals.  
A camera for point of view is the lack thereof.  
Ironous aunts and goddesses.  
For me they are neutral.  
A lewd sweetnes day  
the flint plan that has everyone hollow.  
Only hairy and to a  
custodian they take on time, three hundred years  
towards those pullulations of yours that wait for me.  
  
Around the transparent eyeballs of the electricity.  
When the heights is full of dead brain  
in shrapnels and clenched rusted schools  
and the chaotic trysts and the angels  
at last give forth their decadent pin.  
An odor has wetted in the flag,  
a mixture of salt and body, a rejoicing  
cluster that brings confusion.  
When you seek  
rescued like a juice.
