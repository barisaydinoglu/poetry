Breeding Starry Affection
-------------------------
It was the night of the cat.  
And so that its dungs will entangle your heart.  
It was the night of the ostrich. Attracting the ritual of her sea's skin full of respect.  
Fear and miracle - veins of agony.  
Gnaw me and let my substance continue.  
One of them is sweet-smelling,  
the other knows phenomena.  
Where is everybody  
he cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
On what shady lonely roads dawned with earth?  
Treading a poppy  
upgraded in the stationary thunder.
