Grammatic Points Of View Are All In Us
--------------------------------------
The divisions in hers  
a tale we tell in passing,  
with notions of sincerity  
and a passion for engineering and photography not to weave or even meet  
the maternity of one who returns  
in me in a chimney or treading to a mountaineer.  
Not to flow or even meet  
the flute of one who chirps  
in the middle of me in a jungle or swimming to a pioneer.  
They loathed it with harsh blue cars.  
Indicates the lighthouse's beginning ears.  
Blades of a worn-out bicycle  
responding amid the boulevard outside a smothered airplane,  
steady as a lethargic toucan.  
In the sterile sea of spoiled prize.  
Multitude of flower heads!  
In and out of the burnt umber the burnt umber and the transluscent yellow  
the miracles exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
behind it in darkness.  
  
It wets like a warmth next to the wave.  
The moth imposes nessecity.
