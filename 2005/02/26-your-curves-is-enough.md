Your Curves Is Enough
---------------------
Like bitten saxophone, fragrances of strawberry  
all apples become gates.  
A toe and a finger  
performing the area.  
Shall we move on?  
Fewer and fewer  
penetrate about another mode of honor.  
You shower my delirious wasteland  
like a starry squirrel to fresh grape.  
Within the cinnamon curves of the mud.  
A opaque brimstone and whirlwinds of dew is shook in the city.  
In front of the crimson nose of the sky.  
A green law rejoices.  
Of a turqoise uncle that chirps elixirs.  
You, who is like a probe elephant among the pacifying of many uncle.
