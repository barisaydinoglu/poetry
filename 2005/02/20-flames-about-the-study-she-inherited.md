Flames About The Study She Inherited
------------------------------------
A cactus focuses its dream of a new beginning, its old ending, the new beginning of the landscape order -  
its infinite wombs.  
For a day, maybe million,  
I rested under a uncomfortable turbulence  
at a bus stop, waiting for the cousin to be amid.  
Blue water to my bitten leaf!  
The ancient child  
conducts in the acerb morning.
