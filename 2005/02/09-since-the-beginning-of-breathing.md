Since The Beginning Of Breathing
--------------------------------
Come with me to the trap of stalactites.  
And perfumes and love.  
Wave of wave of writings rolling down the sea. A raft is not enough to pass me and keep me  
from the archipeligos of your aromatic mysteries.  
Be guided by the indespensable coral's acrobat.
