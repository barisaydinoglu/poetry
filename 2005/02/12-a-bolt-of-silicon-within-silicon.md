A Bolt Of Silicon Within Silicon
--------------------------------
For mosaic was lonely and morally negative.  
The bitterest garden is iridescent on your fingernails.  
Everybody here is waiting for the next kis.  
Praise. You lived yourself for setting.  
Rescuing the sea shell of her landscape full of happiness.  
And behind my hammock, during the holiday, I woke up naked  
and full of purity.  
The essential woman  
relinquishes in the profound morning.  
An odor has blossomed behind the circus,  
a mixture of funeral and body, a showering  
quiver that brings sorrow.
