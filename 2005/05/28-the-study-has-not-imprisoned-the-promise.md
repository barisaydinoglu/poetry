The Study Has Not Imprisoned The Promise
----------------------------------------
We open the halves of a secrets and the  
silencing of coffins re-covers into the blazing moonlight evening.  
How travelling is the starry shortcut and it's soft brambles?  
The decisive person  
breathes in the domestic morning.  
I wish to make a line segment  
outside, and every hearing, many  
times hidden in a candle.  
  
You hear my delirious yeast  
like a stationary toucan to fresh apple.  
Bleak weather, violenet lights like the river.
