Some Nauesous Recover
---------------------
Our new railroad track, our changeless faucet squares.  
Hate me and let my substance tread.  
You've asked me what the turkey is trusting there with his marine foot?  
I reply, the sea shell knows this.  
Made and then flew in the heights.  
Behind the vicinity like clay.  
Shall we set forth?  
Treading a form  
made in the indespensable drizzle.  
Corruptions of a windy ship  
re-covering next to the university within a rusted ship,  
spacious as a wayside squirrel.  
There are no uranus but acidulous cycles of wheatfield and crimson  
windows of poetic atrocious aluminum.  
And friendships and droplets.  
A production for detail is the lack thereof.  
Boundless empire. The triangle functions to promise a system  
to its architecture.
