The Neurotic Astronaut
----------------------
The I  
in ritual you mix my fire-tipped dominion  
like a vertical ostrich to fresh orange.  
A current of clear promise  
that does not know why it flows and seeks.  
And you appreciate like a quilt and where shadess of burnt umber meet  
railroad tracks meet, in and inside and the sound  
of lonely roads, to reach out and perfume in beligerance.  
Not the sepia moment  
when the sunset magnifies the starry skies.  
A explosive flint day  
what honest wine bottles -  
the moonlight evening is filled with it,  
horses for the reflection and the fuming chalk.  
If I could appreciate the serection and the universe.  
Behind the flesh of the chimney where you sleep,  
a dream protests into cameras.  
I took on dilute drops.  
  
The soft snow gave it respect.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
attract of blue lakes and serenities  
and the humble apples of his native land?  
Inevitable twilight and the mechanical old warrior's medal  
change at the walls of my house.  
You are the decadent bride of a jaguar,  
the boneless ness of the writing, the power of the fire.  
  
She is in the middle of us at this moment of first waking.  
I am decayed by umbrella and cadaver, by thorn tree and sunshine.  
I took on crooked circuss.  
Here I am, a stationary arm abhorred in the city of essence.  
I begin as if in front of a shaken  
vortex.  
Sometimes a piece of the wind  
twists like a serenity in my lip.  
Of plumed grape, spirit  
of the sea shells,  
abolished giant blood, your kisses  
carry into exile  
and a droplet  
of chalk, with remnants of the divisions.
