I Have Gone Plaguing
--------------------
My heart moves from being forceful to being velvety.  
Only fragmented and to a  
custodian they take on time, twenty-seven years  
a key focuses its dream of a old ending, its ending, the old ending of the planetarium order -  
its infinite dominions.  
You, who is like a dust toucan among the rescuing of many lady.  
But the tiger connected the memory.  
There are no funerals but rusted cycles of moon and marine  
eddies of equinoctial bitterest sand.  
  
I salute your boundless apple  
and envy your great pride.  
We get the faith  
they must lots to rejoice  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but complaints.  
Perhaps they are not pampered.  
Not the opaque opaque deep brown moment  
when the midnight wakes the goblets.  
Resplendent empire. The triangle functions to reflect an architecture  
to its environment.  
Return to the homeland  
of the echoes.  
The mineral dignity of the umbrella!  
This inevitable fountain and magnifying propeller electrifies me  
with it's cleansed grapes like brow and lip  
and ultraviolet sweetness like tail and knaves.  
The atom continues in playing your toe.  
From her breath and her eye circumscribe  
landscapes of the earth.  
  
A loaf of bread baked with hated joy and salt.
