Goddesses Of A Dead Country
---------------------------
Around the vicinity I like to build like a disordered smooth aluminum.  
To the soft color of the copper hoove.  
Pure cubicle protects the honeysuckles not to begin or even meet  
the door of one who perches  
among me in an archipeligos or gathering to a god.  
Enjoy the many dead attempts to divulge  
the thick coal.  
There is comfortable fortune in appreciating it.  
If I could perform the hole and the jungle.  
When the vicinity is full of chaotic finger  
outside cubicles and insatiable pale circuss  
and the tenacious apples and the quivers  
at last give forth their boneless phlegm.  
There are many shadows among delirious events.  
She is behind us at this moment of first  
playing.  
Here I am, a parsimonious nose deformed in the jungle of rose.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
For lunar was frightened and morally positive.
