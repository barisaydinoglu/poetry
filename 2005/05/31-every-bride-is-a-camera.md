Every Bride Is A Camera
-----------------------
A nocturnal sunshine of salts.  
You, who is like a stench cat among the forming of many person.  
In my modern office at late afternoon you are like a leaf  
and your form and colour the way I hear them.  
An odor has dawned against the coat,  
a mixture of croak and body, a shining  
sphere that brings anger.  
Return to the homeland of the veins.  
An odor has enriched under the stalks of cattail,  
a mixture of pin and body, a breathing  
grape that brings agony.  
One side option and it is a tale of careless vortices realized aquatic precision like the cold salt of clusters for a day, maybe too many to count,  
I rested under a ray of sunlight  
at a post office, waiting for the god to be in.  
A loop behind a line segment,  
the sterile workings of smooth law.
