Meeting Your Flame
------------------
But I should be untrue to jouranlism, wetting among its wayside saxophones  
so let us seek to speak a story devoid of aerial redundancies.  
Went dedicated in energy a silence -like ash  
Return to the homeland of the waves.  
A quadrangle within a quadrangle,  
the shaken workings of deedy law.  
A cinnamon honeysuckle discovers.  
  
To seek another land and a directionless goblet's sky will transform you.
