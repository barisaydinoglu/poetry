From What Are Salts Heard
-------------------------
They are all custodians  
professional scandalmongerings in whose winged lemons originate.  
There ought to be a rose of a boundless bell developing in a boulevard.  
In your brain of imprisoning the jungle begins to dream of re-covering.  
Transparent havocs of clandenstine,  
yellow seams above a distorted magnolium.  
The reasons for my respect  
are connected in  
my finger of wooden.  
When the chimney is full of fire-tipped toe  
behind rotten stumps and lewd delirious wine bottles  
and the careless salts and the lemons  
at last give forth their fractious dagger.  
The profound hat gave it sincerity.  
You enchant headlong into a modern office to crystallize your business.  
Seeking toward the time my heart is filled with tiredness like a marble foam.  
Under the room like broken glass.  
The morning laminated signs you in its mortal wind.
