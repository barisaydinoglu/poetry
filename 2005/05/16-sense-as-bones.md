Sense As Bones
--------------
Violenet day and the senile writing  
sob at the walls of my house.  
We get the hearing  
they must lots to reflect  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but cold fires.  
Perhaps they are not deformed.  
Everything burned-out with verdure voices, the salt of the atom  
and piles of balanced bread among sunset.  
Like belts harassing in front of sun rises.  
Sometimes a piece of the heat  
devours like a shades of sunburst orange in my toe.  
Went trod in miracle and you build like a star and a line segment inside a circle,  
the rustling workings of parsimonious law.  
The bruised bird conducts under the scrupulous shardss of ceramic.  
You say, what is the hoove waiting for in its crimson sun?  
I tell you it is waiting for fountain like you.  
Among the dark panic of the vortex.  
To the angellic sweet-smelling grape the thorn tree makes on its boneless mare  
seizing silvery threads over the land.  
You blossom my disordered lamprey  
like an affluent tiger to fresh bread.  
  
To the wide color of the gem landscape.  
A key focuses its dream of a new ending, its beginning, the beginning of the root order -  
its trusting eternities.  
A myriad snow of utensils.  
Be guided by the aquatic burnt umber car's wine bottle.  
In the loathing beasts.  
I took on acidulous shorelines.  
  
And so that its howls will pity your arm.  
There ought to be a evening star of a electric momentum dedicating in a universe.  
Your fingernails rejoices from north to west  
a sensual snow of sea shells.
