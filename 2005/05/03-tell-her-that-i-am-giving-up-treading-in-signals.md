Tell Her That I Am Giving Up Treading In Signals
------------------------------------------------
Because I love you, love, outside the electricity and in front of the wind.  
Of your red  
telegraph when you hold out your tail.  
The jar growing from my leg.  
Abberations of a motionless raft  
expanding around the archipeligos with a cold boat,  
human as a negligent turkey.
