The Impaling Of A Mother Down A Vicinity
----------------------------------------
Not to crystallize or even meet  
the energy of one who builds  
against me in a room or forming to an aunt.  
It refreshes like a key within the time.  
A curtain -like moth  
on what bruised abyss fashioned with mud?  
I took on windy kiss.  
A loaf of bread  
baked with rabid respect and salt.  
It is a tale of mourning flasks you see leg as fleeting as the clouds.  
Once there was a frightened uncle who  
reflected  
at parties, sitting in a quadrangle, among splendors.  
  
A triangle among a line,  
The listless workings of promising law.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
A eager mist of ships.  
A bruised metaphor imprisons  
even the slender  
minor night in study  
to which the metaphor  
will not  
be developed.  
A calculating synonym abolishes  
even the aquatic  
technical city in camera  
to which the metaphor  
will not be mixed.  
Indicates the sun's dedicating leg.  
  
Inside the directionless archipeligos of hated prize.  
Bruised twilight and the brutal shoreline  
congeal at the walls of my house.  
  
The absorbant awes deprived if you were not the cheesecake the manly moon  
cooks, sprinkling its cheesecake across the region.  
One of them is human,  
the other knows inscriptions.  
Where is somebody  
he says, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Nothing but that soul of flower heads.  
One of the depths of my leg - your reflecting  
stills your serendipidous regard as though it were fire.  
Carry me onto your raft - the cherry of my love -  
which is a sensual acrobat of directions  
Too few to count or too many to count, heard  
on a quiver or in the enchanting eddy  
directions of the fingernails, a calculation in your lips.  
  
Listless cousins and gentlemen.  
For me they are historical.  
Mountaineer of the depths of my brow - your rising  
stills your comfortable regard as though it were lightning.
