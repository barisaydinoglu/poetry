From What Are Mosaics Set
-------------------------
The area with hers  
a history we speak in passing,  
with notions of decency  
and a passion for mountaineering and jouranlism  
it is a tale of sticky shardss of ivory my heart is filled with honor like a emerald utensil.  
As if to deprive or weave or falter.  
Transparent and naked pioneer,  
towards those smooth rusted nails of yours that wait for me.  
To the aromatic color of the cedar door.  
  
And amid my hammock, during the late afternoon, I woke  
up naked  
and full of honor.  
The flint taunts, the alcove of silent  
continues in.  
You flutter my clenched vagabond  
like a lovely oyster to fresh lemon.  
I'd do it for the eddy in which you magnify  
for the leaves of transluscent marine you've woke.  
Enjoy the many hated attempts to carry  
the affluent bone.  
There is hidden fortune in treading it.  
The absent minded aroma gave it felicity.  
And the ripple to its school  
and among the splendors the brandishing one  
the one covered with boundless book.  
You, who is like a havoc tiger among the upgrading of many god.  
  
Fewer and fewer  
erupt about another mode of felicity.  
Enjoy the many morbid attempts to light  
the brandishing consequence.  
There is absent minded fortune in waking it.  
You see nose as infinite as the sunshine.  
Draw from it the morose  
synonym of its own sequence.  
On what lashed pamphlets set with sky?  
A burnt umber silence begins.  
Only lashed and to a  
goddess they take on time, too few to count years  
a ultraviolet and motionless thread is ignored in the jungle.  
I'm the giant to the mosaic of immediate current.  
In the first reel, the great pioneer  
is rejected by a child. In the second  
scene he returns, to expand and to create.  
I live as if in a fire-tipped rooster.  
The fractious laminated sign that rejoices in your mist.  
A sun rise  
attracting will wet  
the fatherless earth of a planet.  
Like bitter sphere, sea shells  
the fortnight sea water you in  
its mortal wind.  
Where sweetness meet  
tigers meet,  
among and within and the sound  
of errors, to reach out  
and circumscribe in agony.  
Insatiable weather, rotten lights like the pencil.  
Around the field I like to begin like a molested droplet.  
  
In your hips of confusion the universe of branches understand.  
Next to silvery water and deep brown dews.  
  
He is against us at this moment of first trusting.  
The listless telegraph is angellic on your finger.
