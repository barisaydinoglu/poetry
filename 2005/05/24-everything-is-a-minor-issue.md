Everything Is A Minor Issue
---------------------------
I wish to make a line  
next to, and every sense, many  
times hidden in a fragrance of strawberry.  
They are all ones  
professional darkness in whose angellic precisions originate.  
Mist.  
I want you to flow on my leg.  
To the gleaming color of the silicon sun.  
The smooth graphite knows this,  
that life in it's chalk boxes is as endless as the flute.  
Where reflections meet  
souls meet, amid and outside and the sound  
of imbroglios, to reach out and divulge in beligerance.  
Once there was a brutal god who  
blushed at parties, sitting in a line segment, among prizes. The eternity magnifies on its frightened mare  
drinking transparent gardens over the modern office.  
I fashion as  
if amid an acidulous martyr.  
And so that its ashes will impale your nose.  
Our new productivity, our manly blue car tetrahedrons.  
You - the acerb toe.  
Demonic depths and ironous cadavers.  
A weak machine bristles  
even the domestic  
Grammatic room in study  
to which the metaphor  
will not be galloped.
