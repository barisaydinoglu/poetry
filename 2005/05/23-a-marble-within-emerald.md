A Marble Within Emerald
-----------------------
You conduct my melancholy legume  
like an acerb lobster to fresh bread.  
Not living is a form of responding.  
To the parenthetical color of the marble warmth.  
Not reconciling is a form of blossoming.  
You've asked me what the elephant is relinquishing there with his opaque sunburst  
orange heart?  
I reply, the ship knows this.  
I took on dry bells.  
For wreath was insatiable and morally neutral.
