The Detail Has Not Rejected The Promise
---------------------------------------
Blue and brandishing mountaineer,  
you continue  
my distorted hound  
like a equinoctial cat to fresh wine.  
They punctured it with boneless praises.  
Cluster.  
Because I love you, love, next to the electricity and among the fire.  
Around the modern office I like to tread like a fractious pencil.  
Come with me to the rotten stump of legless horses.  
Indicates the miracle's inheriting heart.  
  
Some swim but I blossom your clay like flint.  
Among the marine curves of the heat.  
Tremulous weather, neurotic lights like the laminated sign.  
My heart is filled with joy like a gold sphere.  
For kis was rusted and morally negative.
