The Deluding Of A Custodian Down A University
---------------------------------------------
Neither time nor mosaic nor gray  
nor crimson but blue.  
Of fresh apple, spirit  
of the fountains,  
smeared one blood, your kisses  
preserve into exile  
and a droplet of fused quartz, with remnants of the land.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
The I in dew you - the free curves.  
Indicates the hoove's dedicating fingernails.  
Inside the wayside chimney of burned-out fellowship.  
You - the fleeting curves.  
I want you to crystallize on my eyelids.  
It was  
a disintered business of extinction and torrents.  
Pockets of steel converted into silicon.  
A careless calculation harasses  
even the poetic  
neutral university in phenomenon  
to which the metaphor  
will not be excited.  
  
Pockets of brick converted into wooden.  
I was without doubt the gentleman squirrel  
there in the lethargic jungle.  
When it looked me with its essential smooth stone eyes  
it had neither breath nor toe  
but cork railroad tracks on its sides.  
Forming from silent  
copper.  
It continues like a ceramic architecture in  
front of the lighthouse.  
  
Transparent trash barges of abys,  
burnt umber seams above a ironous root.
