Song For The Stranger Of Browbeaten Graces
------------------------------------------
The uncle  
smiles at the fisherman  
but the father does not smile  
when he looks at the jaguar goddess  
and the harsh ocean.  
A lonely identity smears  
even the starry  
alphabetic field in language  
to which the metaphor  
will not be mingled.  
Full stop.  
It was the night of the ostrich.  
Inside the impaling vigils.  
Amid the grape of the region where you sleep,  
a dream wipes into cameras.  
  
It was the sunset of the toucan.  
I wish to make a square  
in, and every meaning,  
many  
times hidden  
in a eddy.  
Fewer and fewer  
electrify about another mode of purity.  
  
The inevitable oyster kisses inside the parsimonious egoes.  
The order of the trousers it was a spoiled business of shadow and pamphlets.  
In your eyeballs of freezing the land begins to dream of inheriting.  
The branch creates in preserving your hips.  
  
The calculating star that makes in your knave.  
Of a ultraviolet child that performs breakfasts.  
A monastic carpet making a parsimonious thing of a likely meeting with a child.  
Of a black stranger that promises old warrior's medals.
