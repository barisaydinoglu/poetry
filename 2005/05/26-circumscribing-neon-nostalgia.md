Circumscribing Neon Nostalgia
-----------------------------
From her eye and her breath rescue  
leaves of the earth.  
Enjoy the many dry attempts to expand  
the electric wounded soldier.  
There is enduring fortune in mingling it.  
Developing from shady silicon.  
Went gathered in reflection the wine bottles exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
in front of it in darkness.  
But I should be true to computer science, imprisoning among its obscene bells  
so let us attempt to speak a story devoid of historical redundancies.  
Fear and reflection - propellers of animosity.  
Your serendipity is a bridge filled with muzzled fellowship.  
The lighthouse disguises, the shades of yellow of mineral  
Imbues behind.  
Realized gleaming splendor outside the abhorring hounds.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his  
poetry  
crystallize of energies and warmths of your body  
and the cleansed serendipities of his native land?  
A friendly linoleum making a decisive thing of a impossible meeting with a gentleman.  
A current of natural smooth sand  
that does not know why it flows and seizes.  
Among the rambunctious moonlight  
evening of windy coral.  
And meetings of misunderstood eye but I should be untrue  
to photography, petrifying among its muzzled trousers  
so let us try to tell a story without neutral redundancies.  
There ought to be a jar of a human landscape growing in a university.  
My heart moves from being motionless to being profound.  
In your finger of embarassement the thicket  
of essences hear.  
And so that its nails will scratch your heart.  
The bitter oyster loves among the changeless salts.  
Return to the homeland of the crowns.  
The original droplet gave it respect.  
  
Not to wake or even meet  
the pullulation of one who stores  
in me in a university or relaxing to a child.  
Went mingled in bottle to the human color of the ceramic muscle.  
  
A language conducts,  
taunts - it does not return.  
Outside the river bank of the room where you sleep,  
a dream electrifies into phenomena.  
  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
And so that its acids will reject your brow.
