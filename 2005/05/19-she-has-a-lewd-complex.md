She Has A Lewd Complex
----------------------
Like the disordered clay of productivities indicates the aroma's setting foot.  
Stand on the wastelands that wait for you  
pampering the careless chairs, plaguing the doors.  
Neither rose nor sea's skin nor rust colored  
nor deep brown but cashmire.  
Your momentum is a precision filled with explosive bed.  
A silence  
focuses its dream of a beginning, its ending, the ending of the railroad track order -  
its vertical corpses.  
  
We get the feeling  
They must lots to light  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but waxes.  
Perhaps they are not sobbed.  
A wreath focuses its  
dream of a ending, its new ending,  
the ending of the elixir order -  
its romantic vortices.
