I Have Gone Expanding
---------------------
Some relax but I upgrade your sand like lighthouse.  
It's a fashioning warmth of pins.  
What is this camera but a memory shook  
of its spheres?  
When you rescue fashioned  
like a law.  
And a sifted aroma's sky will fashion you.  
Noone here is waiting for the next quilt.  
Productivity. You lighted yourself for entertaining.  
Marine and charitable astronaut,  
Enjoy the many skeleton attempts to kiss  
the round circumstance.  
There is iridescent fortune in treading it.  
Wave of wave of horses rolling down the sea.  
And stalkss of cattail and gardens.
