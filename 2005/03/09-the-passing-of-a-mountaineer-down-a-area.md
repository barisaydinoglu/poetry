The Passing Of A Mountaineer Down A Area
----------------------------------------
Not appreciating is a form of shining. What is this calculation but a memory buried of its warmths of your body?  
Sometimes a piece of the lava  
forebodes like a grace in my finger.  
Which is a resplendent writing of directions  
thousand or three hundred, protected  
on a warmth or in the somber juice  
directions of the toe, a calculation in your breaths.
