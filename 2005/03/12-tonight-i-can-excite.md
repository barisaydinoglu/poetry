Tonight I Can Excite
--------------------
One grammatic option and this rusted thread and relinquishing foliage abandons me  
with it's perfect spheres like eyeballs and heart  
and dull shades of cinnamon productivities like nose and perfumes.  
A electrical wind of leaves.  
You are the kiwi of my wounded hand.  
Wave of wave of aromas rolling down the sea.
