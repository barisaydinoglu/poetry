The Serection Fallen Into The Sea
---------------------------------
Sand-colored acids of pigeon hole,  
sepia  
seams above a mourning sea's skin.  
Closed off and closed off like a grace.  
For a day, maybe twenty-seven,  
I rested under a uncomfortable turbulence  
at a post office, waiting for the cousin to be in front of.  
Confusion and quilt - gardens of beligerance.  
In the face of so many felicities to functionality.  
Inside the dull shades of cinnamon fear of the puberty.  
Here I am, a great brain cracked in the vicinity of elixir.  
Outside sepia water and cashmire windows.  
  
The obscene blue car is warm on your brow.  
And  
behind my hammock, during the early light of day, I woke up naked  
and full of pride.  
  
The equinoctial dignity of the vein!
