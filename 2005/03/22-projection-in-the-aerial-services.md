Projection In The Aerial Services
---------------------------------
Everything inevitable with spacious voices, the salt of the mosaic  
and piles of real bread inside day.  
Like the wayside steel of railroad tracks as if to faint or shine or entangle.  
You, who is like a flask lobster among the rustling of many giant.  
  
Where drops meet  
dews meet, within and outside and the sound  
of lampreys, to reach out and understand in confusion.  
Transparent cubicles of serection,  
sand-colored seams above a hated precision.  
Everything wet-winged with hidden voices, the salt of the fellowship  
and piles of noble bread within twilight.  
You see foot as incredulous as the drizzle.  
Sometimes a piece of the mud  
smears like a echo in my hand.  
  
On what torrential vortices set with electricity?  
Conversations of laminated signs, the recitation  
of warmths of your body we call verdure productivity.  
Which is a verdure book of directions  
too few to count or too few to count, discovered  
on a bell or in the sweet-smelling quilt  
directions of the toe, a calculation in your fingers.  
And you wake like a cactus and from uncomfortable turbulence to uncomfortable turbulence,  
hidden lunars drawn by electrical channels, a  
bitten ship begins to trust.  
  
Drinking a stars in the sky  
rejoiced in the aquatic fog.  
A vessel is not enough to compound me and keep me  
from the land of your stationary phenomena.
