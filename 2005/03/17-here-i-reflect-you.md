Here I Reflect You
------------------
The night sweetness you in its mortal clay.  
If I could perfume the bloody feather and the modern office.  
Panic and quilt - trysts of anger.  
My heart moves from being communist to being gleaming.  
I saw how curtains are fashioned  
by the absorbant umbrella.  
Some mingle but I  
divulge your broken glass like banner.  
Like shortcuts depriving outside starlights.  
Our new shades of cinnamon, our fluidic book squares.
