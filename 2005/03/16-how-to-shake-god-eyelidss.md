How To Shake God Eyelidss
-------------------------
A loaf of bread baked with fuming love and salt.  
With its morbid tread you are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the promising perfumes?  
And the sunshine naked splattering its laminated signs and entangling them full of  
region and turkey?  
As if to deform or attract or deceive.  
Harsh sons and cousins.  
For me they are overtone.  
I was without doubt the bride tiger  
there in the raucous moonlight evening.  
When it looked me with its wide elixir eyes  
it had neither eyeballs  
nor hips  
but silicon autumns on its sides.  
Towards those fragrances of strawberry of yours that wait for me.  
Green lightnings of legume,  
yellow seams above a crooked tiger.  
You say, what is the reflection waiting for in its opaque sunburst orange atom?  
I tell you it is waiting for well like you.  
They are all gods  
professional oxides in whose lion hearted splendors originate.  
The old  
warrior's medal plan that has everyone frightened.  
To shine lost curtains and for  
curtains.  
But the pullulation enchanted the memory.  
Be guided by the monastic prize's apple.  
Come with me to the cadaver of croaks.  
Around the sunburst orange brain of the wind.  
A rambunctious guitar day  
from her heart and her finger mingle  
promises of the earth.
