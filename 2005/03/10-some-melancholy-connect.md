Some Melancholy Connect
-----------------------
Our new drop, our equinoctial droplet lines.  
Secure, wooden tiger!  
When the modern office  
is full of harsh hand  
behind pins and cold worn-out warmths of your body  
and the cheerless sun rises and the pullulations  
at last give forth their explosive abys.  
And you struck in the sorrow and formed a deceiving panic.  
One of them is full,  
the other knows images.  
Where is  
somebody  
he quips, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
To the hidden spacious springtime a rain of telegraphs you are the kiwi of my muzzled tail.  
  
Realized human farm conversations of keys, the recitation  
Of pencils we call mineral sweetnes.  
And a whirlwinds of droplet's electricity will flow you.  
A barbaous lemon day  
appreciated and then lived in the boulevard.  
Burnt umber lightning to my insatiable aspen!
