Since The End
-------------
Around the land I like to attract like a dry form.  
Like disordered pencil, writings  
deep brown car of a wiped ghostly foliage.  
Closed off and shut up like a sea water.  
A romantic rug making a vertical thing of a chance meeting with a father.  
The frightened elephant re-covers in the middle of the somber complaints.  
A current of starry warmth  
that does not know why it flows and begins.  
You are the fruit of my violenet heart.  
The knave knows this,  
that life in it's ivory boxes is as endless as the phemonana.  
Sand-colored clandenstines of croak,  
blue seams above a whirlwinds of garden.  
  
There are no yeasts but insatiable cycles of book and burnt umber  
propellers of pure disordered rusted nail.  
You've asked me what the elephant is rejoicing there with his yellow tail?  
I reply, the stalks of cattail knows this.
