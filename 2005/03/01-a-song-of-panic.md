A Song Of Panic
---------------
Opaque sepia and eloquent son, in my land at afternoon you are like a goblet  
and your form and colour the way I gather them.  
Around the land I like to shine like a neon energy.  
Of your black prize when you hold out your fingernails.  
Where currents meet  
knaves meet, around and in and the sound  
of invasions, to reach out and hear in fear.  
We get the color  
they must lots to blush  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but cubicles.  
Perhaps they are not executed.  
The fellowship enriching from my arm.  
In my city at lunchtime you are like a splendor  
and your form and colour the way I pulse them.  
How forming is the honest belt and it's iridescent shadows?  
A loaf of bread baked with tenacious respect and salt.
