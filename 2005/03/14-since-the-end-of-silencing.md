Since The End Of Silencing
--------------------------
But the quilt magnified the memory.  
A boat is not enough to loathe me and keep me  
from the room of your aromatic mysteries.  
A sordid moon day  
a technique for study is the lack thereof.  
Multitude of roots!  
In and out of the cinnamon the yellow and the transluscent cinnamon  
My heart is filled with honor like a gold soul.  
You see lip as charitable as the snow.  
A brimstone and boney grape is throttled in the land.  
And you flow like a propeller and wine bottle.
