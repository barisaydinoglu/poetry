From What Are Times Developed
-----------------------------
Outside the black panic of the invasion.  
The I in laminated sign in the first reel, the slender sailor  
is imprisoned by a pioneer. In the second  
reel he returns, to perch and to upgrade.  
My iridescent shoulder breathes you always.  
A burned-out coral day  
and meetings of inevitable hand a sun focuses its dream of a beginning, its new ending, the beginning of the stalks of cattail order -  
its iridescent lampreys.  
You, who is like a billow of gray smoke bird among the seeking of many goddess.  
The I in bell joy is gone, the subject has reflected.
