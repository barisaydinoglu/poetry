A Apple To Travel The Sea's Skins You Inherit
---------------------------------------------
The smoke imposes nessecity.  
Draw from it the neon  
calculation of its own machine.  
Rotten sunset and the burned-out pasture  
forebode at the walls of my house.  
Conversations of leaves, the recitation  
of planetariums we call scrupulous salt.  
Outside the room like iron.  
In the mane of the night where you sleep,  
a dream protests into computers.  
There are many conspirators with atrocious events.  
In your breath of agony the sea of flags seize.  
What we say circumscribes to  
wake some other cousin  
what a projection may  
teach.  
I am fell by energy and conspirator, by torrent and mist.  
Absorbant, wooden law!  
I am changed by forest and havoc, by havoc and clouds.
