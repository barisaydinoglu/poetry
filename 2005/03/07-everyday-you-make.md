Everyday You Make
-----------------
In your finger of agony the sea of splendors wet.  
A quadrangle inside a square,  
the rusted workings of promising law.  
Flower.  
A current of serene crown  
that does not know why it flows and loves.  
Which is a pure flute of directions  
too few to count or three hundred, preserved  
on a vein or in the dashing fellowship  
directions of the shoulder, a calculation in your arms.  
It promises like a horse behind the grace.  
Dead holiday and the callous flower  
imprison at the walls of my house.  
You - the electrical leg. Once there was a smothered son who  
dawned at parties, sitting in a circle, among atoms.
