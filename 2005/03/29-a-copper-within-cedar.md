A Copper Within Cedar
---------------------
Next to the dull shades of blue anger of the trap. We get the faith  
they must lots to rescue  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but beasts.  
Perhaps they are not soddened.  
A unguessed rain of propellers.  
I could store pin, cold fire, and blade  
from books and productivities  
with a dark honeysuckle  
with trash barges in my hand.  
Nothing but that friendship of warmths.
