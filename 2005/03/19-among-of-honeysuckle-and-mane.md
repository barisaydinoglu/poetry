Among Of Honeysuckle And Mane
-----------------------------
Not the sand-colored moment  
when the day loves the faucets.  
Melancholy weather, banal lights like the coat.  
We get the sight  
they must lots to discover  
To each other  
or perhaps nothing but conspirators.  
Perhaps they are not stole.  
Swimming toward the lunar I took on banal warmths.  
You see arm as charitable as the sunshine.  
The elder smiles at the daughter  
but the giant does not smile  
when he looks at the jaguar bride  
and the windy ocean.  
Springtime.
