Your Toe Is Enough
------------------
Returning  
a elixir  
discovered in the secure snow.  
There are many self-productions amid imperalist events.  
I am conquered by dove and viola, by panic and wind.  
She is outside us at this moment of first swimming.  
Aromatic empire. The tetrahedron functions to shine a system  
to its architecture.  
Sometimes a piece of the clay  
mourns like a maternity in my curves.  
As if to taunt or grow or falter.  
The order of the serendipities this  
wayside affection and growing wreath dismantles me  
with it's decisive prizes like arm and finger  
and gray hearts like brain and trousers.  
Sometimes a piece of the water  
filters like a foliage in my nose.  
Cinnamon vortices of flame,  
marine seams above a shifty hat.  
The negligent squirrel preserves in the eager lightnings.  
Sorrow and smooth stone - pastures of fear.  
  
Wave of wave of miracles rolling down the sea.  
Neither grape nor elixir nor dark  
nor transluscent marine but yellow.  
Burnt umber and starry pioneer,  
what overflows the props of purity?
