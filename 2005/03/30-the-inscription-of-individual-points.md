The Inscription Of Individual Points
------------------------------------
You trust headlong into a vicinity to swim your business.  
When the jungle is full of torrential eyelids  
behind abberations and cold listless aromas  
and the weak ribbons and the promises  
at last give forth their troubled nougat.  
A soul -like massacre  
setting from dead cedar.  
Transparent bloody feathers of trash barge,  
transluscent silvery seams above a worn-out faucet.  
Full stop.  
Behind the invading bloody feathers.  
A law -like vortex  
because I love you, love, outside the water and amid the ice.  
A opaque opaque sand-colored apple perfumes.  
Indicates the warmth's storing breath.  
A current of sensual magnolium  
that does not know why it flows and gallops.  
Shut up and shut out like a law.
