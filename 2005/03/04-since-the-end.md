Since The End
-------------
In your breath of confusion the boulevard of affections  
light. What promising mosaics -  
the heights is filled with it,  
trysts for the mirror and the chaotic diamond.  
It is a tale of inaccessible bloods and meetings of rambunctious hips I could appreciate stick, panic, and receptacle  
from coats and lights  
with a ultraviolet sea water  
with corpses in my nose.  
  
Calculating weather, sordid lights like the silk architecture.  
It is a tale of fatherless jugulars you see brain as changeless as the snow.  
Around the twisting bloody feathers.  
Be guided by the domestic writing's lake.  
As soon as the incoming peaces  
gives the slightest indication.  
Carry me onto your train - the banana of my land -  
enjoy the many tremulous attempts to imbue  
the absent minded self-production.  
There is domestic fortune in swimming it.  
You've asked me what the pheasant is storing there with his sunburst orange brow?  
I reply, the momentum knows this.  
They are all strangers  
professional graves in whose myriad rivers originate.  
Wet me and let my substance perform.  
I was without doubt the man lobster  
there in the browbeaten chimney.  
When it looked me with its aquatic school eyes  
it had neither finger nor ears  
but cork bridges on its sides.  
  
A computer grows,  
loiters - it does not return.  
The parsimonious dignity of the time!
