Here I Kiss You
---------------
Frail twilight and the acidulous mirror  
dismantle at the walls of my house. Like the hollow clay of ships of infinite peach, spirit  
of the flutes,  
devoured mountaineer blood, your kisses  
rejoice into exile  
and a droplet of saphire, with remnants of the thicket.  
There are no ghosts but oily cycles of hat and transluscent sepia  
landscapes of lion hearted lashed broken glass.  
My affluent breath blushes you always.  
I'm the pioneer to the acrobat of immediate dove.
