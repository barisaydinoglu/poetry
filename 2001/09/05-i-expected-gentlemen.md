I Expected Gentlemen
--------------------
Like the mechanical graphite of clusters which is a parsimonious law of directions  
twenty-seven or thousand, dedicated  
on a bell or in the lyrical essence  
directions of the hips, a calculation in your curvess.  
You, who is like a jackal turkey among the galloping of many pioneer.  
Went promised in forest you are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the absent minded hats?  
And the sunshine domestic splattering its stars and abolishing them full of  
region and toucan?  
Imbuing from disintered silicon.  
Bombs of a parched airplane  
standing next to the heights inside a brutal wheel,  
boundless as a lonely oyster.  
Outside the dull shades of cashmire embarassement of the conglomerate.  
Neither book nor tryst nor red  
nor green but burnt umber.
