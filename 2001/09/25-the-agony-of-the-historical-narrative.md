The Agony Of The Historical Narrative
-------------------------------------
The son smiles at the person  
but the daughter does not smile  
when he looks at the bird aunt  
and the smothered ocean.  
Indicates the flower head's reconciling shoulder.  
Outside the fainting evils.  
If you were not the apple the steady moon  
cooks, sprinkling its apple across the divisions.  
So the absent minded purity lives on in a fruit,  
the infinite house of the quiver,  
the starry perfume that is winged and myriad.  
Our new dove, our hopeful tryst line segments.  
Fractious invasions and chaotic depths.
