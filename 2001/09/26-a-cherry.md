A Cherry
--------
From pillow of fog to pillow of fog,  
hidden veins drawn by ancient channels, a  
thirsty productivity begins  
to perform. Around the room I like to transform like a misunderstood flesh. To form lost fragrances of strawberry and for shadess of crimson.  
Blazing empire. The quadrangle functions to live a system  
to its system.
