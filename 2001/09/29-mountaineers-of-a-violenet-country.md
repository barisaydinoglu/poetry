Mountaineers Of A Violenet Country
----------------------------------
And you stand like a form and the panic reflects on its dry mare  
refreshing burnt umber atoms over the jungle.  
Raucous weather, demonic lights like the vein.  
Serendipidous, glass flower!  
Because I love you, love, with the fire and among the ice.  
I am decayed by rose and death, by corpse and clouds.  
Our new mane, our velvety starlight lines.  
Closed off and pulled out like an aroma.  
A old  
warrior's medal living will light  
The fire-tipped fire of a planet.
