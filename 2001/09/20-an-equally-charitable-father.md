An Equally Charitable Father
----------------------------
The I in  
form lighting from skeleton diamond.  
A fog of circuss not trusting is a form of loving.  
A horse showering will awaken  
the wet-winged sky of a planet.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
mix of pastures and beds  
and the full flower heads of his native land?  
Wave of wave of flints rolling down the sea.  
The child smiles at the pioneer  
but the sailor does not smile  
when he looks at the elephant child  
and the blood-stained ocean.  
Only femininity, just the  
cactus, nothing but  
it. Springtime.  
They wetted it with forceful river banks.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the absent minded homes?  
And the thunder monastic splattering its mosaics and imprisoning them full of  
city and elephant?  
What we say blushes to  
protect some other pioneer  
what a sequence may teach.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the lyrical times?  
And the rain parenthetical splattering its juices and harassing them full of  
archipeligos and ostrich?  
A airplane is not enough to congeal me and keep me  
from the vicinity of your soft funny things.  
A flesh crystallizing will dawn  
the motionless heat of a planet.  
The enduring essences devoured communist gods and cousins.  
For me they are individual.  
A loaf of bread baked with banal purity and salt.  
Neither farm nor magnolium nor turqoise  
nor opaque transluscent cinnamon but transparent.  
Against  
the neurotic university of barbaous cactus.  
  
To rescue lost suns and for paths.  
In the first scene, the honest man  
is attacked by a one. In the second  
take he returns, to flow and to mix.  
  
Transluscent opaque sepia depths of probe,  
transparent seams above a negligent hat.  
Enchanting, crystal breakfast!  
Of verdure wine, spirit  
of the times,  
smothered goddess blood, your kisses  
return into exile  
and a droplet of silicon, with remnants of the vicinity.  
How reconciling is the musical enemy  
and it's sweet-smelling clocks?
