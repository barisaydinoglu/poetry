Under Of Necklace And Splendor
------------------------------
My serendipidous fingernails entertains you always.  
Rescue on the massacres that wait for you  
congealing the insatiable chairs, executing the doors.  
One historical option and  
tremble me and let my substance stand.  
A vertical rug making a steady thing of a lucky meeting with a god.  
Brings all the wipes currents.  
But I should be true to engineering, mourning among its rambunctious banners  
so let us try to speak a story without aerial redundancies.  
There are many ghosts outside obscene events.  
In your tail of panic the field of gardens form.  
  
Closed off and shut up like a jar.  
I took on barbaous trees.  
Like the molested metal of necklaces conversations of wreaths, the recitation  
of crowns we call balanced momentum.
