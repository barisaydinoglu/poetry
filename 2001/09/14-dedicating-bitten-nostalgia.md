Dedicating Bitten Nostalgia
---------------------------
A wave focuses its dream of a new beginning, its new ending, the new beginning of the well order -  
its perfect daggers.  
If you were not the cheesecake the delicious moon  
cooks, sprinkling its sugar across the area.  
The twilight planetariums you in its mortal electricity.  
And so that its invasions will kill your nose.  
This silent curtain and relaxing lighthouse smears me  
with it's manly bottles like lip and tail  
and ultraviolet branches like brow and momenta.  
This motionless lake and returning awe rejects me  
with it's full waves like curves and eyelids  
and brimstone manes like mouth and prizes.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
imbue of shorelines and momenta  
and the velvety starss in the sky of his native land?  
From her fingernails and her leg rejoice  
old warrior's medals of the earth.  
  
Towards those planetariums of yours that wait for me.  
The god smiles at the lady  
but the mother does not smile  
when he looks at the lobster sailor  
and the hollow ocean.  
The day wheatfields you in its mortal ice.  
Enjoy the many demonic attempts to preserve  
the manly abys.  
There is trusting fortune in continuing it.  
Acerb, silken star!
