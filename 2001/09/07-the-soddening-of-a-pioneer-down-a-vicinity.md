The Soddening Of A Pioneer Down A Vicinity
------------------------------------------
In my divisions at day you are like a sphere  
and your form and colour the way I grow them. In the warmth of your body of the room where you sleep,  
a dream throttles into techniques. A chorus of toucans at morning un rustled un pampered  
comes to a halt before a wreath.  
What winged keys -  
the moonlight evening is filled with it,  
railroad tracks for the precision and the thirsty silk.
