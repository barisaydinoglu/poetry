A Apple To Drink The Bridges You Hear
-------------------------------------
There are no smokes but furious cycles of echo and cinnamon  
poppies of blazing wayside sand.  
A chorus of lobsters at sunrise un blushed un shook  
comes to a halt before a tiger.  
Not to gallop or even meet  
the garden of one who circumscribes  
in the middle of me in a chimney or flowing to a custodian.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
Your film is a sea shell filled with  
lethargic mist.
