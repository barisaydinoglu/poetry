Identity In The Algorithmic Services
------------------------------------
Home was no longer above the transmission threshold.  
The ice warm walls are conquered.  
I'd do it for the kiss in which you chirp  
for the leaves of transparent you've responded.  
Wounded weather, shaken lights like the quiver.  
With its putrid travel a mouth and a lip  
making the land.  
Outside the brimstone panic of the jugular.  
Changeless, cork tiger!  
Transforming from raucous cedar.  
In the university like metal.  
You are the grape of my windy mouth.  
The morning forms you in its mortal lightning.  
Fluttering a juice  
shone in the lovely rain.  
My deedy mouth upgrades you always.  
Enjoy the many wounded attempts to connect  
the lion hearted wound.  
There is iridescent fortune in weaving it.  
Sometimes a piece of the fire  
deforms like a poppy in my finger.  
  
What we say weaves to  
excite some other son  
what a signal may teach.  
But I should be true to science, deforming among its bleak fountains  
so let us try to speak a story devoid of alphabetic redundancies.  
  
And the eddy to its dew  
and among the writings the honest one  
the father covered with naked knave.  
I stayed attracted and sand-colored  
in the archipeligos.  
It is a tale of hollow lightnings your sun is a well filled with neon rose. The curtain ignores, the wreath of serene  
mixes among.  
Pockets of rusted nail converted into silicon.
