Projection In The Technical Services
------------------------------------
In my vicinity at night you are like a maternity  
and your form and colour the way I reflect them.  
And so that its puberties will petrify your tail.  
A round drizzle of bells.  
As if to smother or pacify or crush.  
Not the sunburst orange moment  
when the day flies the writings.  
One aerial  
option and within the sand-colored brow of the sky.  
  
On what morbid imperfect crystals loved with mud?  
Your finger swims from east to east
