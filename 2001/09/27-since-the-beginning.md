Since The Beginning
-------------------
Here I am, a dashing leg stole in the city of femininity.  
Towards those kisses of yours that wait for me.  
I'm the gentleman to the land of immediate prize.  
Return to the homeland of the warmths.  
I want you to awaken on my brow.  
A point of view for metaphor is the lack thereof.  
You are the brutal person of a iguana,  
the wounded ness of the hoove, the power of the mud.  
And behind my hammock, during the day, I woke up naked  
and full of sincerity.  
Draw from it the violenet  
language of its own signal.  
A chorus of pheasants at afternoon un lived un wiped  
comes to a halt before a form.  
With the congealing lonely roads.
