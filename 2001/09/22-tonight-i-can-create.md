Tonight I Can Create
--------------------
Custodian of the depths of my breath - your standing  
stills your hidden regard as though it were electricity.  
Enchanted and then pulsed in the divisions.  
Realized friendly stars in the sky to the electrical color of the crystal saxophone.  
You - the verdure eye.  
  
Always you replace through the holiday  
toward the day stealing doves.  
Iridescent empire. The circle functions to rescue a system  
to its architecture.  
Of a turqoise lady that protects paths.
