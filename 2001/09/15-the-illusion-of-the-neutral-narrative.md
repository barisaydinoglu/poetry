The Illusion Of The Neutral Narrative
-------------------------------------
Outside the blue heart of the fire.  
I saw how graces are fashioned  
by the cosmic reflection.  
Nature was no longer above the transmission threshold.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
I'm the man to the sun rise of immediate quilt.  
Which is a scrupulous juice of directions  
too few to count or million, loved  
on a wreath or in the deedy telegraph  
directions of the heart, a calculation in your eyes.  
One of them is lyrical,  
the other knows synonyms.  
Where is everybody  
he exclaims, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?
