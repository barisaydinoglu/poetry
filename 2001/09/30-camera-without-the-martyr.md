Camera Without The Martyr
-------------------------
Neither guitar nor old warrior's medal nor dark  
nor yellow but cashmire. I took on disintered schools.  
Some relax but I wake your sand like garden.  
  
Only disintered and to a  
custodian they take on time, too few to count years  
shall we keep going?
