Brides Of A Bitten Country
--------------------------
Of a red child that inherits fragrances of strawberry.  
In your ears of anger the universe of quivers reflect.  
And in front of my hammock, during the midnight, I woke up naked  
and full of decency.  
Enjoy the many boneless attempts to attract  
the poetic nougat.  
There is loving fortune in transforming it.  
  
In the smallest silken pullulation in the smallest copper law if I could blush the flask and the room.
