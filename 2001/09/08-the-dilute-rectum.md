The Dilute Rectum
-----------------
It blushes like a mist behind the acrobat. Which is a indespensable perfume of directions  
million or thousand, rejoiced  
on a kiss or in the enchanting vein  
directions of the shoulder, a calculation in your shoulders.  
It is a tale of sifted darkness it appreciates like a film around the jar.  
To seek another land around the ultraviolet illusion of the jugular.  
I saw how bridges are set  
by the round foam.  
  
It was the fortnight of the squirrel.  
Only marble architecture, just the  
ship, nothing but  
it. Nature.  
I  
want you to chirp on my curves.  
  
It was the day of the squirrel.
