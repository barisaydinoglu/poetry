The Detail Has Not Punctured The Promise
----------------------------------------
A loaf of bread baked with bleak joy and salt.  
The region within hers  
a story we speak in passing,  
with notions of respect  
and a passion for oceanography and photography  
And meetings of lashed shoulder I travel as if among a fragmented convict.  
I do not bury in the city of guilt imperfect gold.  
Once there was a imperalist mother who  
preserved at parties, sitting in a loop, among sun rises.  
There are many massacres amid phosphorus events.  
Somebody here is waiting for the next flesh.  
Peace. You flowed yourself for returning.  
There are many depths inside sterile events.
