Since The End Of Filtering
--------------------------
If I could crystallize the panic and the modern office.  
And so that its lightnings will deprive your mouth.  
What is this computer but a memory scratched of its productivities?  
I saw how love are rustled  
by the sanguine vein.  
My heart moves from being cold to being profound.  
A chorus of birds at afternoon un built un wiped  
comes to a halt before a starry sky.  
Inside the insatiable cluster, many rabid trash barges.  
So the brandishing wonder lives on in a orange,  
the lyrical house of the curtain,  
the pure sea's skin that is scrupulous and secure.
