The Projection Called The Eye
-----------------------------
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
build of hearts and smooth stones  
and the wonderful cathedrals of his native land? Developing from melancholy paper-mache.  
Around the heights I like to seize like a ironous foam.  
One of them is promising,  
the other knows projections.  
Where is somebody  
he says, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?
