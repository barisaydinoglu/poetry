Slightest Images Are All With Us
--------------------------------
Our new ritual, our aromatic current quadrangles.  
All corals become trapdoors.  
I want you to blush on my brow.  
All pencils become blades.  
Your eyeballs returns from east to west  
always you deprive through the midnight  
toward the day dying landscapes.  
And the defender to its acrobat  
and among the spheres the promising one  
the sailor covered with sweet-smelling flint.  
I wish to make a line segment  
behind, and every sense, many  
times hidden in a fellowship.  
If I could reflect the shards of silk and the night.  
Inside the crimson brow of the electricity.  
In your hips of dying the modern office begins to dream of growing.  
And apples and laminated signs.  
I was without doubt the person lobster  
there in the inevitable sea.  
When it looked me with its essential jar eyes  
it had neither breath nor ears  
but wooden beds on its sides.  
Pockets of sand converted into ceramic.  
Not to shower or even meet  
the necklace of one who gathers  
outside me in  
a jungle or discovering to a sailor.  
A foliage awakening will divulge  
the calcerous mud of a planet.
