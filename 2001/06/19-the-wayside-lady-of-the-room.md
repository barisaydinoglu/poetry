The Wayside Lady Of The Room
----------------------------
Full stop.  
Of electric plum, spirit  
of the rituals,  
died astronaut blood, your kisses  
awaken into exile  
and a droplet of ceramic, with remnants of the archipeligos.  
This demonic stars in the sky and attracting fragrance of strawberry plagues me  
with it's human grapes like breath and foot  
and turqoise bells like eyeballs and juices.  
What eager elixirs -  
the area is filled with it,  
candles for the echo and the bitterest silk.  
  
I took on ironous banners.
