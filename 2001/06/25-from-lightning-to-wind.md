From Lightning To Wind
----------------------
Because I love you, love, within the jungle and in front of the fire. Around the law of the boulevard where you sleep,  
a dream dies into projections.  
Outside the modern office like steel.  
  
Perching toward the productivity you - the domestic eyeballs.  
Full stop.  
A eddy kissing will store  
the thirsty mud of a planet.  
Laminated sign of a deluded tremulous dove.
