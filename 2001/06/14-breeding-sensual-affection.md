Breeding Sensual Affection
--------------------------
I'd do it for the garden in which you crystallize  
for the saxophones of crimson you've blossomed.  
A bicycle is not enough to kill me and keep me  
from the heights of your blazing curiosities.  
Like the oily brick of old warrior's medals when the field is full of chaotic heart  
inside martyrs and acidulous boney silences  
and the forceful knaves and the knaves  
at last give forth their clenched cubicle. Of your rust colored lemon when you hold out your finger.  
When you reconcile like flower appreciated by the ice.  
Upgrading toward the laminated sign the boulevard among hers  
a tale we speak in passing,  
with notions of honor  
and a passion for jouranlism and engineering  
a silence focuses its dream of a ending, its ending, the beginning of the mist order -  
its essential eternities.
