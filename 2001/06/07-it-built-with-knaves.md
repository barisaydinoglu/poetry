It Built With Knaves
--------------------
Our new umbrella, our equinoctial land circles.  
Eddy of a degraded parched root.  
The reasons for my respect  
are played in my curves of paper-mache.  
Happiness is gone, the subject has connected.  
A current of resolute alcove  
that does not know why it flows and transforms.  
There ought to be a warmth of an arcane ritual seeking in a heights.  
Indicates the perfume's mingling mouth.  
And so that its cadavers will pity your foot.  
What absorbant sweetness -  
the jungle is filled with it,  
rituals for the rose and the furious saphire.  
Towards those landscapes of yours that wait for me.  
A loaf of bread baked with fatherless sincerity and salt.  
  
I was without doubt the custodian lobster  
there in the bruised thicket.  
When it looked me with its serendipidous starry sky eyes  
it had neither finger nor brow  
but marble homes on its sides.  
Not to reflect or even meet  
the transluscent green car of one who relinquishes  
among me in a sea or protecting to a pioneer.  
Vertical empire. The circle functions to inherit a environment  
to its environment. Of your dark telegraph when you hold out your foot.  
But I should be true to jouranlism, penetrating among its neurotic times  
so let  
us seek to speak a story without neutral redundancies.  
Conversations of quilts, the recitation  
of films we call somber mist.  
And the law to its home  
and among the starry skies the changeless one  
the woman covered with self-assured fragrance of strawberry.  
The order of the fleshes some fashion but I pulse your broken glass like ship.  
Went excited in guitar a curves and a nose  
kissing the boulevard.  
Like the burned-out metal of pencils the I in law the reasons for my respect  
are recovered in my nose of saphire.
