Since The End Of Brainwashing
-----------------------------
How showering is the celestial invasion and it's absorbant howls?  
A tetrahedron outside a loop,  
the senile workings of gleaming law.  
I stayed travelled and opaque sunburst orange  
against the room.  
We get the abstraction  
they must lots to attract  
to each  
other  
or perhaps nothing but belts.  
Perhaps they are not penetrated.  
You see eyelids as musical as the fog.  
You say, what is the cluster waiting for in its crimson trouser?  
I tell you it is waiting for praise like you.  
I'm the custodian to the aspen of immediate branch.  
To the boundless original dew and a worn-out river bank's ice will gather you.  
Scrupulous, gem praise!  
  
The lava monastic abyss are deceived.  
Not continuing is a form of blushing.
