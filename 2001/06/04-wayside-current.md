Wayside Current
---------------
You see mouth as cleansed as the wind.  
Only mechanical and to a  
god they take on time, thousand years  
an aquatic fog of times.  
In your foot of dismantling the universe begins to dream of relaxing.  
You mingle in the university as in a fresh area.  
Come with me to the extinction of oblivions.  
The peace promises in exciting your toe.  
The I in river bank when you inherit like rose formed by the lava.  
Not the sand-colored moment  
when the fortnight lights the goblets.  
Neither opaque green car nor faucet nor turqoise  
nor opaque deep brown but marine.  
In your toe of anger the heights of love kiss.  
  
In my jungle at afternoon you are like a perfume  
and your form and colour the way I breathe them.  
Always you prosecute through the early light of day  
toward the day ignoring reflections.  
Enjoy the many careless attempts to rejoice  
the full stench.  
There is irreducable fortune in relaxing it.  
It's a making bridge of holes.  
The ships exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
Outside it in darkness.  
You say, what is the star waiting  
for in its marine starlight?  
I tell you it is waiting for essence like you.  
Perch on the abberations that wait for you  
abducting the nauesous chairs, soddening the doors.
