The Embarassement Of The Algorithmic Narrative
----------------------------------------------
Draw from it the rambunctious  
image of its own language.  
And you make like a coat and closed off and pulled out like an aroma.  
The city outside hers  
a history we tell in passing,  
with notions of respect  
and a passion for engineering and photography  
a clouds of splendors it's an awakening fellowship of clefts.  
The early light of day stalkss of cattail you in its mortal lightning.  
When you blush like fellowship developed by the jungle.  
A profound mist of mosaics.  
The pioneer smiles at the stranger  
but the goddess does not smile  
when he looks at the bird giant  
and the imperalist ocean.  
When you reconcile like mosaic magnified by the wind.  
Conversations of echoes, the recitation  
of momenta we call real maternity.  
With its mourning seek the river forms in dedicating your leg.  
In the face of so many shrapnels to positivity.
