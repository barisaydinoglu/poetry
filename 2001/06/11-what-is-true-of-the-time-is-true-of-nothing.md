What Is True Of The Time Is True Of Nothing
-------------------------------------------
Outside the sphere of the jungle where you sleep,  
a dream soddens into projections.  
For a day, maybe too many to count,  
I rested under a tornado  
at a bus stop, waiting for the mountaineer to be around.  
Pockets of brick converted into copper.  
Halfway.  
They are all fathers  
professional wastelands in whose acerb juices originate.  
The morbid serenity that crystallizes in your tryst.  
Essence of a executed bitten jar.  
Juice.  
We open the halves of a curiosities and the  
smothering of puberties pulses into the aromatic region.  
  
Relax on the depths that wait for you  
disguising the insatiable chairs, drowning the doors.  
Shut out and closed off like a star.
