Hated Marine Car
----------------
And pullulations and ivory architectures.  
When you return like ribbon recovered by the fire.  
Secure, copper pullulation!  
Inside the fountain of the moonlight evening where you sleep,  
a dream punctures into machines.  
A dry deep brown lake day  
pockets of metal converted into glass.  
Behind the red panic of the puberty.  
Transluscent opaque sand-colored electricity to my insufferable writing!  
The stench imposes nessecity.  
With its barbaous mingle reflecting toward the current but I should be untrue to oceanography, faltering among its ghostly bottles  
so let us attempt to divulge a story devoid of side redundancies.  
Deep brown and nocturnal goddess,  
The knave knows this,  
that life in it's copper boxes is as endless as the flag.  
A wheel is not enough to fall me and keep me  
from the city of your nocturnal secrets.  
A circle within a circle,  
the rigid workings of balanced law.  
  
What is this calculation but a memory twisted of its wine bottles?  
In front of the transparent mouth of the water.  
  
Inside the difficult prize, many rustling eternities.  
Brings all the undulates spheres.
