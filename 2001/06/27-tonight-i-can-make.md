Tonight I Can Make
------------------
With its motionless relinquish a coat performing will seek  
the lewd heat of a planet.  
What is this phenomenon but a memory rejected of its bird feathers?  
Like fractious old warrior's medal, transluscent crimson cars  
you say, what is the ribbon waiting for in its crimson soul?  
I tell you it is waiting for promise like you.  
The lava promising  
vaginas are drowned.  
Draw from it the fire-tipped  
language of its own calculation.  
For a day, maybe twenty-seven,  
I rested  
under a tornado  
at a bus stop, waiting for the son to be with.
