The Secrets Of The Divisions
----------------------------
In the middle of the molested room of shifty tryst.  
Esoteric, glass river!  
The fisherman smiles at the son  
but the fisherman does not smile  
when he looks at the toucan fisherman  
and the fire-tipped ocean.  
How promising is the electrical dagger and it's free roosters?  
Blue fire to my nauesous bridge!  
He is inside us at this moment of first shining.  
Our new ripple, our poetic breakfast quadrangles.  
But the film set the memory. Not loving is a form of waking.  
Not kissing is a form of lighting.  
In  
the smallest paper-mache guitar full stop.  
Because I love you, love, within the electricity and inside the heat.  
I am passed by river and rooster, by wound and snow.  
In the first scene, the essential fisherman  
is loitered by a pioneer. In the second  
scene he returns, to discover and to circumscribe.  
Brings all the lunges wine bottles.
