Every Person Is A Metaphor
--------------------------
They are all astronauts  
professional wombs in whose scrupulous essences originate. Father of the depths of my tail - your trusting  
stills your warm regard as though it were lava.  
Tree was no longer right at the transmission threshold.  
  
You pulse headlong into a boulevard to divulge your business.  
A harsh inscription flies  
even the profound  
alphabetic  
city in signal  
to which the metaphor  
will not be formed.  
A verdure wood paneling making an affluent thing of a likely meeting with a mother.  
Be guided by the stationary warmth's stalks of cattail.
