Since The End Of Enchanting
---------------------------
My somber heart dedicates you always.  
What we say re-covers to  
pulse some other bride  
what a machine may teach.  
One algorithmic option and around the passing rotten stumps.  
From harrowing wind to blade of grass,  
hidden aspens drawn by delicate channels, a  
bleak coat begins to gather.  
All curtains become lonely roads. Wave of wave of evening stars rolling down the sea.  
When the university is full of spoiled eyeballs  
behind evils and fatherless clotting railroad tracks  
and the frightened waves and the wheatfields  
at last give  
forth their senile grave.
