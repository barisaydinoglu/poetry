The Computer Has Not Plagued The Promise
----------------------------------------
The iridescent mountaineer  
chirps in the careful morning.  
I blossom as if in front of a tremulous cleft.  
And you discover like a moon and an arcane wood paneling making a free thing of a impossible meeting with a mountaineer.  
One of them is smooth,  
the other knows synonyms.  
Where is everybody  
she exclaims, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
The sweetnes entertaining from my finger.  
I want you to transform on my eyeballs.  
Like the ironous aluminum of roots and meetings of guilt foot halfway.
