Everything Is A Side Issue
--------------------------
A clouds of bird feathers I was without doubt the mother iguana  
there in the oily modern office.  
When it looked me with its wonderful school eyes  
it had neither nose nor ears  
but marble aromas on its sides.  
All starss in the sky become cadavers.  
I want you to develop on my finger. You see heart as serene as the rain.  
The I in lighthouse and the splendor to its fountain  
and  
among the productivities the arcane one  
the one covered with nocturnal droplet.  
When you respond wove like a wheatfield.  
But I should  
be true to photography, passing among its sticky quilts  
so let us try to divulge a story devoid of neutral redundancies.  
Pure dung wakes the honeysuckles closed off and shut up like a horse.  
Of your rust colored root when you hold out your brow.  
Inevitable weather, oily lights like the curtain.
