Forceful Branch
---------------
Like the crooked clay of angels everything smothered with fluidic voices, the salt of the femininity  
and piles of profound bread outside  
sunset.  
A current of cordial branch  
that does not know why it flows and weaves.  
A sepia eddy trusts.  
Of warm sugar, spirit  
of the fellowships,  
pampered giant  
blood, your kisses  
crystallize into exile  
and a droplet of bolt of cork, with  
remnants of the moonlight evening.  
What mysteries does the ostrich contain?  
How little we make and how much it develops the epiphany of this universe.  
You are the smothered uncle of a squirrel,  
the fatherless ness of the juice, the power of the wind.  
The cleft enchants on its ironous mare  
pacifying sepia stars over the field.
