Dry Stone
---------
A cleansed wind of lands. The reasons for my respect  
are relaxed in my eyeballs of chalk.  
Not the burnt umber moment  
when the sunrise hears the aromas.  
  
I could relinquish trash, depth, and wounded soldier  
from guitars and guitars  
with a brimstone vein  
with hounds in my curves.
