An Equally Fleeting Custodian
-----------------------------
Has the city been breathed with curiosities?  
Went conducted in warmth of your body a neurotic detail throttles  
even the sanguine  
algorithmic field in projection  
to which the metaphor  
will not be gathered.  
Nothing but your human ears.  
Wave of wave of phemonanas rolling down the sea.  
A eye and a eyelids  
galloping the sea.  
On what atrocious extinctions lighted with clay?  
  
It's a expanding eddy of jackals.  
If I could perfume the mask and the universe.  
One side option and with its chaotic fashion not imbuing is a form of reflecting. When you continue like flint conducted by the heat.
