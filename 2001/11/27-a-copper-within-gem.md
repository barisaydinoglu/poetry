A Copper Within Gem
-------------------
Movie was no longer below the transmission threshold.  
Wave of wave of maternities rolling down the sea.  
The custodian smiles at the god  
but the person does not smile  
when he looks at the lobster mountaineer  
and the forceful ocean.  
But the map mixed the memory.  
Conversations of sun rises, the recitation  
of ripples we call domestic muscle.  
I do not strike in the vicinity of pale acid.  
  
And behind my hammock, during the day, I woke up naked  
and full of wonder.  
Neither landscape nor promise nor brimstone  
nor burnt umber but green.
