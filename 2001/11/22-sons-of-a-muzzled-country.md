Sons Of A Muzzled Country
-------------------------
The sanguine dignity of the laminated sign!  
The brutal bird shines in the secure shadows.  
It is a tale of motionless clandenstines and meetings of rabid hand a loaf of bread baked with clenched love and salt.  
Not exciting is a form of enriching.  
The essential god  
rejoices in the sweet-smelling morning.  
You - the original curves.  
The modern office in front of hers  
a tale we divulge in passing,  
with notions of tiredness  
and a passion for jouranlism and photography  
there are no lards but torrential cycles of telegraph and sepia  
doves of manly mourning  
broken glass.  
If you were not the plum the deedy moon  
cooks, sprinkling its bread across the field.  
The smothered quiver that promises in your propeller.  
A chorus of jaguars at afternoon un connected un undulated  
comes to a halt before a landscape.  
I saw how shorelines are rescued  
by the arcane crown.  
A horse -like puberty  
on what harsh corpses breathed with electricity?  
Stars in the sky of an abducted crooked map.  
The lightning thick waxes are dropped.  
Nothing but your smooth arm.
