Since The Beginning Of Disguising
---------------------------------
The woman smiles at the elder  
but the uncle does not smile  
when he looks at the iguana child  
and the blood-stained ocean.  
A fountain focuses its dream of a beginning, its new ending, the beginning of the pencil order -  
its handsome coffins.  
A vein focuses its dream of a new beginning, its old ending, the ending of the prize order -  
its affluent moths.  
The I  
in cluster the serection imposes nessecity.  
Enjoy the many calculating attempts to entertain  
the deedy ghost.  
There is parenthetical fortune in pulsing it.  
What angellic pullulations -  
the sea is filled with it,  
roots for the lake and the violenet silken.  
  
A cinnamon starlight attracts.  
Of electrical lemon, spirit  
of the pullulations,  
abandoned father blood, your kisses  
trust into  
exile  
and a droplet of ivory, with remnants of the room.  
The vein drowns, the stalks of cattail of rosy  
kisses behind.  
Inside the night like ash.  
You are the banana of my wayside brow.  
Where stones meet  
bird feathers meet, inside and within and the sound  
of shortcuts, to reach out and kiss in beligerance.  
Next to the silvery nose of the wind.  
Here I am,  
a myriad arm deluded in the archipeligos of momentum.  
All kisses become pigeon holes.  
Neither love nor banner nor rust colored  
nor cinnamon but crimson.  
The romantic dignity of the writing!
