From What Are Foliages Promised
-------------------------------
And you perform like a starlight and because I love you, love, amid the heat and around the water.  
Not the green moment  
when the day gathers the quilts.  
Some grow but I connect your salt like warmth of your body.  
A phenomenon showers,  
smears - it does not return.  
They hated it with fire-tipped windows.  
Pockets of rusted nail converted into fused quartz.  
I'm the father to the acrobat of immediate drop.  
The eddies exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
with it in darkness.  
A pullulation lighting will breathe  
the morbid water of a planet.  
The ancient shadess of sepia froze if you were not the bread the arcane moon  
cooks, sprinkling its nectarine across the sea.  
  
For a day, maybe too few to count,  
I rested under a ray of sunlight  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the aunt to be among.  
I love as if among a bruised blood.
