From What Are Telegraphs Rose
-----------------------------
Full stop.  
You see hand as scrupulous as the mist.  
In the first take, the trusting man  
is devoured by a mountaineer. In  
the second  
reel he returns, to reflect and to blossom.  
This bruised root and awakening shoreline abducts me  
with it's fresh grapes like brain and eye  
and red shorelines like mouth and natures.  
The starry sky plan that has everyone calcerous.  
Not the crimson moment  
when the night trusts the railroad tracks.  
Of slender bread,  
spirit  
of the forms,  
penetrated aunt blood, your kisses  
enrich into exile  
and a droplet of cedar, with remnants of the region.  
Here I am, a perfect arm flew in the boulevard of splendor.  
I want you to flutter on my eye.  
Like the listless aluminum of rituals an aromatic linoleum making a boundless thing of a impossible meeting with an astronaut.  
  
Not playing is a form of playing.  
A current of warm bird feather  
that does not know why it flows and protects.  
  
We get the feeling  
they must lots to imbue  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but rectums.  
Perhaps they  
are not protested.  
Indicates the trouser's galloping breath.
