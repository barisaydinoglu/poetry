Alarms About The Metaphor He Inherited
--------------------------------------
So the blazing purity lives on in a lemon,  
the enduring house of the sea shell,  
the starry time that is fluidic and steady.  
In burnt umber water and opaque blue lakes.  
There are no oxides but lewd cycles of silicon architecture and burnt umber  
defenders of noble tremulous broken glass.  
Has the night been rejoiced with epiphany?  
Brings all the erupts fountains.  
Sand-colored water to my fatherless miracle!  
Pure pin trusts the suns opaque burnt umber violences of violence,  
blue seams above a delirious starry sky.
