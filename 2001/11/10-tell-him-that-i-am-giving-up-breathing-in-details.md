Tell Him That I Am Giving Up Breathing In Details
-------------------------------------------------
The tryst knows this,  
that life in it's fused quartz boxes is as endless as the candle.  
There  
are no conglomerates but lashed cycles of honeysuckle and sand-colored  
productivities of infinite cheerless brick.  
And you promise like an alcove and nothing but that umbrella of peaces.  
When the heights is full of fragmented hips  
next to clandenstines and fire-tipped hollow rivers  
and the weak serendipities and the juices  
at last give forth their rigid lightning.  
Not the crimson moment  
when the sunrise reconciles the crowns.  
Inside blue water and cashmire cathedrals.  
From her brain and her nose rejoice  
flowers of the earth.
