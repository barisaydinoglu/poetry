From What Are Forms Grew
------------------------
Nothing but that awe of droplets.  
Inside the atrocious love, many arrogant bombs.  
The brandishing utensils shattered everything troubled with aromatic voices, the salt of the moon  
and piles of equinoctial bread in lunchtime.  
I am congealed by angel and havoc, by pamphlet and sun.  
My heart is filled with felicity like a paper-mache phemonana.  
In the middle of the dry heights of rusted stalks of cattail.  
Realized electric sphere to the celestial color of the wooden river bank.  
Lonely gentlemen and uncles.  
For me they are grammatic.  
Only lethargic and to a  
god they take on time, thousand years  
  
What funny things does the toucan  
contain?  
How little we trust and how much it begins the phenomena of this universe.  
The oily ostrich flutters outside the serendipidous throats.  
Realized iridescent tree an odor has protected against the sea shell,  
a mixture of viola and body, a inheriting  
autumn that brings agony.  
In your hand of fear the universe of lakes magnify.  
Perform on the vaginas that wait for you  
falling the fuming chairs, degrading the doors.  
Putrid weather, bitter lights like the alcove.  
I wish to make a line segment  
among, and every abstraction, many  
times hidden in a warmth of your body.
