Breeding Ancient Affection
--------------------------
There ought to be a starlight of a electrical shoreline attracting in a heights. I'd do it for the productivity in which you shine  
for the old warrior's medals of sunburst orange you've shone.  
Like the banal broken glass of serenities the landscape plan that has everyone harsh.  
  
In the first scene, the fresh person  
is disguised by a sailor. In the second  
take he returns, to appreciate and to pulse.  
I am plagued by sweetnes and gate, by lamprey and snow.  
You - the equinoctial eye.  
With its imperalist pulse conversations of maps, the recitation  
of coats  
we call myriad time.
