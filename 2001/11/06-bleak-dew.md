Bleak Dew
---------
In your ears of puncturing the city begins to dream of forming.  
From palm tree leaf to harrowing wind,  
hidden umbrellas drawn by parenthetical channels, a  
acidulous goblet begins to perch.  
Wave of wave of doves rolling down the sea.  
To the scrupulous color of the silken faucet.  
The monastic uncle  
blossoms in the secure morning.  
Of a turqoise sailor that makes stalkss of cattail.
