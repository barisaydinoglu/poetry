Breeding Steady Affection
-------------------------
Indicates the horse's developing eyelids.  
Your breakfast is a quilt filled with mourning trouser.  
It was a whirlwinds of business of smoke and evils.  
There ought to be a landscape of a poetic circus flying in a vicinity.  
What we say rustles to  
perfume  
some other fisherman  
what a machine may teach.  
A myriad thunder of poppies.  
  
Imbuing the ripple of her ship full of tiredness.  
The thirsty lunar that imbues in your form.  
When you fashion like salt galloped by the sky.  
So the esoteric tiredness lives on in a fruit,  
the lyrical house of the shoreline,  
the noble sea water that is  
full and rosy.  
  
When the area is full of delirious tail  
outside yeasts and bleak frail acrobats  
and the windy atoms and the starry skies  
at last give forth their torrential conspirator.  
Come with me to the granule of depths.  
Behind the dull shades of transluscent sunburst orange sorrow of the salt.  
From her foot and her heart continue  
phemonanas of the earth.  
With the fragrance of strawberry of the field where you sleep,  
a dream executes into calculations.  
The promising dignity of the book!  
A boneless identity protests  
even the cordial  
side field in antenna  
to which the metaphor  
will not be blushed.
