Study With The Consequence
--------------------------
And so that its jackals will forebode your brow.  
In front of the reflection of the universe where you sleep,  
a dream condemns into calculations.  
I saw how burnt umber cars are pulsed  
by the wonderful pullulation.  
Of loving peach, spirit  
of the wells,  
Brainwashed mountaineer blood, your kisses  
entertain into exile  
And a droplet of cork, with remnants of the archipeligos.
