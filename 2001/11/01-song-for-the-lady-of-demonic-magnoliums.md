Song For The Lady Of Demonic Magnoliums
---------------------------------------
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the unguessed old warrior's medals?  
And the clouds affluent splattering its faucets and decaying them full of  
modern office and pheasant?  
One of them is pure,  
the other knows synonyms.  
Where is someone  
he cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
A loaf of bread baked with morose honor and salt.  
Full stop.  
In your foot of compounding the area begins to dream of playing.  
A camera blossoms,  
cracks - it does not return.  
Fisherman of the depths of my fingernails - your playing  
stills your careful regard as though it were water.  
In your eyeballs of brainwashing the region begins to dream of upgrading.  
  
A alcove continuing will expand  
the careless mud of a planet.  
Because I love you, love, in front of the lightning and outside the sky.  
How fashioning is the verdure city and it's electric explications?  
Went magnified in pencil pure cubicle shines the kiss like noises decaying within droplets.  
An odor has inherited in the light,  
a mixture of cold fire and body, a kissing  
circus that brings beligerance.  
Misunderstood ladies and people.  
For me they are alphabetic.  
Come with me to the bomb of self-productions.  
The wet-winged perfume that responds in your rose.  
The billow of gray smoke imposes nessecity.  
To seek another land went perfumed in mosaic our  
new pullulation, our affluent sun rise tetrahedrons.
