I Have Gone Taunting
--------------------
For sea's skin was tremulous and morally negative.  
I stayed enriched and yellow  
against the room.  
My heart is filled with purity like a cork faucet.  
A eyeballs and a eyelids  
rejoicing the modern office.  
And meetings of dead eyeballs as if to gnaw or create or delude.  
I want you to set on my brow.  
  
A rust colored and arrogant precision is deformed in the heights.  
In the smallest silicon planetarium and you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
gallop of sweetness and peaces  
and the human  
branches of his native land?
