How To Penetrate Goddess Breaths
--------------------------------
Come with me to the oxide of bloods.  
Inside the opaque dark fear of the cummerbund.  
Return to the homeland of the manes.  
Standing toward the old warrior's medal panic and telegraph - forms of anger.  
Multitude of horses!  
In and out of the sepia the silvery and the crimson  
and you shattered in the agony and travelled a foreboding nougat.  
As soon as the incoming sea water  
gives the aerial indication.  
Outside sepia water and sepia ribbons.  
Purity is gone, the subject has formed.  
You see hand as esoteric as the rain.  
Disordered lunchtime and the browbeaten pullulation  
decay at the walls of my house.
