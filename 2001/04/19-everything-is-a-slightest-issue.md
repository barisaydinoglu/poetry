Everything Is A Slightest Issue
-------------------------------
One of them is changeless,  
the other knows antennae.  
Where is somebody  
she cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen? And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
magnify of wine bottles and books  
and the hopeful branches of his native land?  
Fractious whispers and frail probes.  
I want you to perform on my heart.
