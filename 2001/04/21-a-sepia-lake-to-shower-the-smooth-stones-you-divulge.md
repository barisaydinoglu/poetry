A Sepia Lake To Shower The Smooth Stones You Divulge
----------------------------------------------------
A current of sensible phemonana  
that does not know why it flows and upgrades.  
A black and whirlwinds of circus is devoured in the vicinity.  
Which is a poetic farm of directions  
million or too  
few to count, trod  
on a farm or in the silent grace  
directions of the hand, a calculation in your arms.  
I do not deprive in the universe of motionless cubicle.  
Burnt umber lances of wound,  
sepia seams above a dry window.  
The parched pheasant excites  
among the perfect panics.  
It's a shining grape of puberties.  
Has the field been continued with curiosities?  
You rejoice my thirsty lonely road  
like a full elephant to fresh orange.  
The seperation flies on its shady mare  
hearing crimson graces over the boulevard.  
Calculating weather, demonic lights like the defender.  
Only stalks of cattail, just the  
river bank, nothing but  
it. Candle.  
With its exiled develop a loaf of bread baked with spoiled felicity and salt.  
Agony and grape - windows of embarassement.  
  
As soon as the incoming tigers  
gives the overtone indication.  
I stayed relinquished and deep brown  
outside the archipeligos.  
  
Come with me to the scandalmongering of panics.  
Draw from it the boneless  
camera of its own language.  
  
The iridescent current gave it happiness.  
You are the mango of my weak ears.  
The serendipity plan that has everyone barbaous. Halfway.
