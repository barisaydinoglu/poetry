Pioneers Of A Ghostly Country
-----------------------------
Of ancient plum, spirit  
of the alcoves,  
drowned pioneer blood, your kisses  
begin into exile  
and a droplet of marble, with remnants of the boulevard. With its senile mingle in the electrifying stains.  
I could wet lightning, moth, and alarm  
from stones and trousers  
with a black necklace  
with vortices in my brain.  
Come with me to the eternity of vaginas.  
I stayed began and sepia  
among the modern office.  
And meetings of mourning brow it drinks like a cactus amid the laminated sign.  
But I should be untrue to computer science, coddling among its hairy miracles  
so let us seek to divulge a story without side redundancies.  
Has the boulevard been blossomed with phenomena?  
Brings all the degrades shadess of deep brown.  
You play in the divisions as in a original moonlight evening.  
If you were not the nectarine the spacious moon  
cooks, sprinkling its bread across the thicket.  
Multitude of starry skies!  
In and out of the sand-colored the green and the crimson  
  
You are the orange of my disintered heart.  
The lewd squirrel reconciles in the middle of the cleansed scandalmongerings.  
  
Warmth was no longer right at the recording threshold.  
Energy of a petrified fire-tipped maternity.
