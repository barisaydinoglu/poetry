It Pulsed With Serenities
-------------------------
Sorrow and flesh - schools of embarassement.  
I'd do it for the writing in which you dedicate  
for the hooves of transluscent transluscent crimson you've woke.  
Skeleton twilight and the furious fragrance of strawberry  
decay at the walls of my house.  
I could love smoke,  
imbroglio, and conspirator  
from roses and magnoliums  
with a dark stars in the sky  
with belts in my hand.
