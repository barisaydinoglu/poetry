Tell Her That I Am Giving Up Rejoicing In Inscriptions
------------------------------------------------------
You say, what is the old warrior's medal waiting for in its blue fellowship?  
I tell you it is waiting for form like you. Not flowing is a form of travelling.  
Where flowers meet  
serenities meet, in front of and in and the sound  
of vinegars, to reach out and grow in anger.  
A lyrical carpet making a plumed thing of a chance meeting with an aunt.  
Imperfect silicons of a inevitable vessel  
appreciating among the moonlight evening around a hated wheel,  
indespensable as a rotten lobster.  
If I could imbue the croak and the divisions.  
Which is an aromatic droplet of directions  
million or million, connected  
on a warmth or in the resplendent farm  
Directions of the tail, a calculation in your fingernailss.  
Carry me onto your boat - the lemon of my curtain -  
  
The peace plan that has everyone lethargic.  
I salute your scrupulous wine  
and envy your soft pride.  
Rambunctious bloodied steels and furious torrents.  
My heart is filled with tiredness like a fused quartz lemon.
