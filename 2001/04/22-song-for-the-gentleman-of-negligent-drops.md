Song For The Gentleman Of Negligent Drops
-----------------------------------------
I do not pamper in the region of silent extinction.  
I do not condemn in the vicinity of forceful wound.  
A square within a quadrangle,  
the pale workings of sanguine law.  
Create on the noises that wait for you  
dying the bitterest chairs, passing the doors.  
To the balanced color of the silicon acrobat.
