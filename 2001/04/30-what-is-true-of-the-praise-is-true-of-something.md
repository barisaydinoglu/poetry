What Is True Of The Praise Is True Of Something
-----------------------------------------------
Like phlegms disguising amid telegraphs.  
The deedy dignity of the elixir!  
Like the guilt ash of smooth stones execute me and let my substance live.  
I'm the cousin to the bell of immediate smooth stone.  
But I should be untrue to photography, trembling among its imperalist precisions  
so let us attempt to speak a story devoid of historical redundancies.  
There are many graves around troubled events.  
Some kiss but I pacify your brick like grace.
