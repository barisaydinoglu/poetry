Tonight I Can Upgrade
---------------------
Mosaic was no longer above the recording threshold.  
There are no darkness but lashed cycles  
of quilt and crimson  
autumns of gleaming furious iron.  
When you return like elixir awakened  
by the ice.  
Pride is gone, the subject has flew.  
Draw from it the brutal  
point of view of its own antenna.  
Some shine but I magnify your graphite like telegraph.  
Towards those railroad tracks of yours that wait for me.
