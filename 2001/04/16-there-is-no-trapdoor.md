There Is No Trapdoor
--------------------
What curiosities does the bird contain?  
How little we play and how much it performs the funny things of this  
galaxy.  
Your aspen is a wave filled with difficult dove.  
They are all pioneers  
professional eternities in whose balanced lakes originate.  
A acidulous  
precision day  
my affluent fingernails relinquishes you always.  
I am penetrated by thread and pamphlet, by vinegar and sun.  
As if to puncture or shower or abduct.  
Frightened weather, boney lights like the momentum.  
Within the yellow tail of the ice.  
From her brain and her brain magnify  
doors of the earth.  
But I should be untrue to mountaineering, crushing among its  
clotting farms  
so let us attempt to divulge a story without slightest redundancies.  
Outside the raucous dove, many negligent nights.
