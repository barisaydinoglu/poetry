The Thirsty Cousin
------------------
To the starry color of the bolt of cork wreath.  
This inevitable warmth and promising sphere disguises me  
with it's winged essences like mouth and eye  
and dark roses like eyelids and times.  
Giant of the depths of my foot - your mixing  
stills your decisive regard as though it were lightning.  
The essential sphere gave it pride.
