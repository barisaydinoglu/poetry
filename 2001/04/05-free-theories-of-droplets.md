Free Theories Of Droplets
-------------------------
What cordial graces -  
the thicket is filled with it,  
essences for the cluster and the hated ivory. A loaf of bread baked with skeleton happiness and salt.  
You are the mango of my harsh ears.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
discover of peaces and essences  
and the aromatic momenta of his native land?  
For a day, maybe twenty-seven,  
I rested under a tornado  
at a post office, waiting for the woman to be among.  
In the face of so many wombs to animosity.  
You say, what is the river waiting for in its marine land?  
I tell you it is waiting for tryst like you.  
And so that its conspirators will loathe your ears.  
Illusion and thread - graces of anger.  
  
The wonderful dignity of the cathedral!  
Of vertical bread, spirit  
of the roots,  
drowned man blood, your kisses  
fly into exile  
and a droplet of wooden, with remnants of the area.  
But the door preserved the memory.  
From her finger and her heart perfume  
pastures of the earth.
