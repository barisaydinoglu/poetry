Among Of Prize And Productivity
-------------------------------
Only book, just the  
drop, nothing but  
it. Maternity.  
You say, what is the key waiting for in its opaque deep brown energy?  
I tell you it is waiting for ribbon like you.  
In your finger of abandoning the room begins to dream of inheriting.  
Under the tear stained old warrior's medal, many molested violences.  
One of them is poetic,  
the other knows  
projections.  
Where is noone  
she cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?
