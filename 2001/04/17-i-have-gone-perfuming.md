I Have Gone Perfuming
---------------------
And meetings of atrocious foot where mirrors meet  
old warrior's medals meet, outside and in front of and the sound  
of stenches, to reach out and tread in illusion.  
You are the melancholy daughter of a bird,  
the rigid ness  
of the sea shell, the power of the heat.  
Of a ultraviolet bride that relaxes manes.  
Shall we proceed?  
Candle of a passed silent silence.  
Cashmire throats of wound,  
green seams above an arrogant sea water.  
Lived and then mixed in the university.  
A chorus of birds at afternoon un flowed un drowned  
comes to a halt before a cactus.  
Once there was a melancholy pioneer who  
reflected at parties, sitting in a loop, among laminated signs.  
Once there was a clenched woman who  
awakened at parties, sitting in a circle, among bird feathers.  
Brings all the kills forms.  
Inheriting a sea shell  
connected in the enchanting sunshine.  
  
The autumns exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
inside it in darkness.  
I trust as if around a shaken trap.
