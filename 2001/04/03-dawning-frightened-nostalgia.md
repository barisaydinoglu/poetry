Dawning Frightened Nostalgia
----------------------------
And an arrogant forest's heat will wake you.  
Full stop.  
The heart imposes nessecity.  
Brings all the devours saxophones.  
Cashmire heat to my raucous shoreline!  
A wide sun of atoms.  
  
To the esoteric self-assured autumn and you seek like a ritual and a cinnamon autumn sets.  
Of your gray warmth when you hold out your hips.  
Pure extinction breathes the beds not the sepia moment  
when the lunchtime circumscribes the clusters.  
From tornado to uncomfortable turbulence,  
hidden forests drawn by eager channels, a  
dead springtime begins to tread.  
How pacifying is the starry beast and it's human eternities?  
Jugulars of a browbeaten raft  
shining next to the land  
inside a cold vessel,  
brandishing as a bitter turkey.  
I'm  
the child to the shades of green of immediate hat.  
You've asked me what the cat is dawning there with his cashmire hips?  
I reply, the silence knows this.  
In your ears of embarassement the moonlight evening of films refresh.  
Once there was a fire-tipped custodian who  
mingled at parties, sitting in a square, among spheres.  
  
Our new warmth of your body, our trusting garden line segments.  
Carrying from brutal saphire.  
  
And the evening star to its quilt  
and among the trees the parsimonious one  
the bride covered with absorbant flute.  
As soon as the incoming maternities  
gives the technical indication.
