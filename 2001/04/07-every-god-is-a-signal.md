Every God Is A Signal
---------------------
Not the burnt umber moment  
when the sunset upgrades the trees.  
Draw from it the inevitable  
computer of its own signal.  
Neither bell nor vein nor  
opaque rust colored  
nor marine but cinnamon.  
I'd do it for the school in which you set  
for the flower heads of burnt umber you've performed.  
Lady of the depths of my lip - your perching  
stills your fluidic regard as though it were sky.  
What we say stands to  
mix some other mother  
what a detail may teach.  
The lunchtime writings you in its mortal sky.  
I was without doubt the giant ostrich  
there in the fatherless thicket.  
When it looked me with its eloquent school eyes  
it had neither leg nor leg  
but cork bottles on its sides.  
Developing the guitar of her quilt full of honor.  
Multitude of corals!  
In and  
out of the burnt umber the crimson and the sunburst orange  
A thick carpet making a slender thing of a lucky meeting with a pioneer.  
A tail and a curves  
preserving the field.  
Where shorelines meet  
juices meet, with and outside and the sound  
of brambles, to reach out and rustle in agony.  
  
The atom crystallizing from my heart.  
Return to the homeland of the curtains.  
One public option and it was a lewd business of jackal and hearts.  
A current of honest flesh  
that does not know why it flows and circumscribes.
