Thick Theories Of Suns
----------------------
Yellow and perfect child, an odor has continued in the bottle,  
a mixture of smoke and body, a wetting  
rose that brings agony.  
In my region at twilight you are like a door  
and your form and colour the way I perform them.  
The autumn plan that has everyone hated.  
If I could perform the bloody feather and the city.
