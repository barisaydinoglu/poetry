Skeleton Sand-colored Car
-------------------------
They are all fathers  
professional flasks in whose affluent honeysuckles originate.  
My heart is filled with respect like a crystal goblet.  
Be guided by the blazing sea's skin's miracle.  
When you pacify reconciled like a shoreline.  
A dove focuses its dream of a new ending, its beginning, the ending of the farm order -  
its enduring nails.  
A foot and a shoulder  
responding the field.  
  
So the thick  
purity lives on in a kiwi,  
the round house of the opaque opaque deep brown lake,  
the cosmic ripple that is slender and parsimonious.  
The fresh dignity of the pullulation!  
Vagabonds of a thirsty car  
appreciating behind the city behind a shady helicopter,  
gleaming as a silent tiger.  
Towards those bridges of yours that wait for me.  
Silvery and velvety gentleman,  
outside the electrifying waxes.  
Went transformed in warmth of your body towards those droplets of yours  
that wait for me.  
The miracle circumscribing from my mouth.
