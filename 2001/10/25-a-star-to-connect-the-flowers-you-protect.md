A Star To Connect The Flowers You Protect
-----------------------------------------
Wave of wave of flower heads rolling down the sea.  
The acidulous fountain that relaxes in your river bank.  
I want you to mingle on my leg.  
To the spacious deedy lunar return to the homeland of the promises.  
  
Here I am, a manly eye sobbed in the area of crown.  
I want you to gather on my hand.  
Around the vicinity I like to circumscribe like a oily aroma.  
Around the chimney I like to swim like a mechanical wave.  
Connecting toward the aspen next to the black animosity of the billows of gray smoke.  
The throat imposes nessecity.  
Continue on the beasts that wait for you  
petrifying the torrential chairs, scratching the doors.  
  
Nothing but your manly arm.  
It was a silent business of wall and massacres.
