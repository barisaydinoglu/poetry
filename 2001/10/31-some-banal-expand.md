Some Banal Expand
-----------------
In front of transluscent silvery water and sepia lights.  
Come with me to the cubicle of imbroglios.  
An odor has heard in the middle of the book,  
a mixture of bomb and body, a building  
garden that brings panic.  
A eye and a finger  
reconciling the vicinity.  
My heart moves from being ironous to being resplendent.  
Of a rust colored one that drinks forms.  
You, who is like a depth iguana among the blushing of many stranger.
