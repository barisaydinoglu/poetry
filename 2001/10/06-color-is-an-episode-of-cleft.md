Color Is An Episode Of Cleft
----------------------------
As if to brainwash or continue or sob.  
In front of the rejecting bloodied irons.  
It was a sterile business of wound and brambles.  
A synonym for machine is the lack thereof.  
I took on violenet essences.  
You rise slowly into a field to form your business.  
Conversations of writings, the recitation  
of threads we call mineral snow.  
Halfway.
