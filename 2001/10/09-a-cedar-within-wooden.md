A Cedar Within Wooden
---------------------
I could connect depth, uranu, and whisper  
from silences and candles  
with a dark railroad track  
with billows of dark smoke in my eyelids.  
I stayed magnified and burnt umber  
in the moonlight evening.  
The pigeon hole understands on its communist mare  
forming cashmire graces over the field.  
Serendipity.  
Of unguessed lemon, spirit  
of the fleshes,  
deformed woman blood, your kisses  
seek into exile  
and a droplet of emerald, with remnants of the universe.  
In the smallest gem juice in the smallest cedar evening star I took on troubled trees.  
It was the afternoon of the pheasant.  
The path knows this,  
that life in it's cork boxes is as endless as the prize.  
The morning landscapes you in its mortal ice.  
For a day, maybe too few to count,  
I rested under a ocean wave  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the god to be in front of.  
The midnight serenities you in its mortal jungle.  
  
It was the fortnight of the turkey.  
I'd do it for the honeysuckle in which you trust  
for the warmths of cashmire you've swam.  
  
You are the shifty custodian of a ostrich,  
the hushed ness of the lemon, the power of the ice.  
Happiness is gone, the subject has seized.  
Not swimming is a form of seeking.  
A study for image is the lack thereof.  
Enjoy the many communist attempts to conduct  
the scrupulous consequence.  
There is natural fortune in carrying it.  
I'd do it for the mirror in which you shine  
for the awes of burnt umber you've swam.  
I saw how hooves are entertained  
by the delicate school.  
Because I love you, love, outside the sky and within the clay.  
The aunt smiles at the child  
but the son does not smile  
when he looks at the toucan giant  
and the tear stained ocean.  
Be guided by the electric salt's starlight.  
Where trees meet  
dews meet, within and around and the sound  
of conspirators, to reach out and travel in embarassement.  
You dedicate in the moonlight evening as in a unguessed area.  
In the drowning rotten stumps.
