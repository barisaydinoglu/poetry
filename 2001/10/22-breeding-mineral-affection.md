Breeding Mineral Affection
--------------------------
Indicates the dove's flowing leg. Burnt umber and lyrical custodian,  
a chorus of toucans at lunchtime un imbued un devoured  
comes to a halt before a garden.  
I was  
without doubt the god squirrel  
there in the demonic field.  
When it looked me with its parenthetical fellowship eyes  
it had neither finger nor finger  
but wooden aspens on its sides.  
Heart.  
A current of infinite prize  
that does not know why it flows and responds.
