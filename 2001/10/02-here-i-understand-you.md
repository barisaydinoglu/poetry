Here I Understand You
---------------------
Multitude of ships!  
In and out of the blue the deep brown and the opaque cashmire  
of your dark breakfast when you hold out your ears.  
Like phosphorus marble architecture, aspens  
I am shook by branch and phlegm, by hole and snow.  
An  
odor has carried under the river,  
a mixture of lightning and body, a reflecting  
farm that brings beligerance.  
Our new angel, our enchanting current quadrangles.  
I took on shady  
alcoves.  
So the decisive purity lives on in a cherry,  
the esoteric house of the umbrella,  
the deedy saxophone that is wonderful and balanced.  
This fire-tipped jar and chirping muscle kills me  
with it's eager rivers like brow and arm  
and ultraviolet knaves like eyeballs and graces.  
  
It's a loving phemonana of legumes.  
On what burned-out felicities galloped with lava?  
Fewer and fewer  
twist about another mode of wonder.  
The serene child  
seizes in the fluidic morning.
