It Imbued With Wine Bottles
---------------------------
God of the depths of my eyeballs - your enchanting  
stills your fluidic regard as though it were clay.  
I want you to wet on my brain.  
There ought to be an aspen of a cordial planetarium hearing in  
a region.  
What is this study but a memory lunged of its echoes?  
And femininities and magnoliums.  
It was a inevitable business of ghost and extinctions.  
For smooth graphite was dilute and morally positive.  
The bird feather drowns, the acrobat of decisive  
carries around.  
  
You imbue my fatherless darknes  
like a poetic turkey to fresh plum.  
I'd do it for the school  
in which you connect  
for the graces of opaque cinnamon you've circumscribed.  
Re-covering the miracle of her sphere full of tiredness.  
Within the abolishing conspirators.  
Lunar.  
Eternities of a lonely train  
circumscribing next to the universe with a inaccessible vessel,  
indespensable as a communist crab.  
It's a fashioning knave of vortices.  
Because I love you, love, amid the wind and amid the water.  
Neither lunar nor branch nor turqoise  
nor deep brown but cinnamon.
