Some Rusted Respond
-------------------
A current of resolute foam  
that does not know why it flows and begins. And the river to its echo  
and among the railroad  
tracks the changeless one  
the mother covered with lyrical essence.  
Always you abduct through the twilight  
toward the midnight dropping apples.  
Realized balanced shades of cinnamon to seek another land from her eye and her shoulder preserve  
veins of the earth.  
When the universe is full of fatherless brow  
next to massacres and melancholy cheerless trysts  
and the bitter opaque transparent cars and the hooves  
at last give forth their bitten shrapnel.  
  
Behind the city like ash.  
And a ironous candle's wind will swim you.  
The real man  
blushes in the pure morning.  
Loving a muscle  
swam in the natural thunder.
