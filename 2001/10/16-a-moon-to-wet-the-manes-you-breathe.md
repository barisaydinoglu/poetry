A Moon To Wet The Manes You Breathe
-----------------------------------
Chirping toward the femininity a kiss swimming will re-cover  
the blood-stained ice of a planet.  
Return on the twisting lonely roads that wait for you  
entangling the imperalist chairs, puncturing the doors.  
Delirious custodians and sons.  
For me they are technical.  
Masks of a molested airplane  
rescuing behind the thicket in a disintered airplane,  
boundless as a chaotic toucan.  
A sand-colored elixir protects.  
Like tear stained miracle, love  
when the thicket is full of bruised tail  
amid masks and imperalist disordered affections  
and the exiled cactuss and the maps  
at last give forth their acidulous explication.  
Attack me and let my substance live.  
The lyrical dignity of the stalks  
of cattail!  
What secrets does the oyster contain?  
How little we refresh and how much it plays the epiphany of this computer simulation.  
Some relax but I return your iron  
like pencil.
