From What Are Awes Understood
-----------------------------
So the eager honor lives on in a orange,  
the sweet-smelling house of the film,  
the angellic warmth that  
is rosy and deedy.  
In my field at holiday you are like a bird feather  
and your form and colour the way I kiss them.  
Stranger of the depths of my hips - your beginning  
stills your loving regard as though it were lava.  
It is a tale of wounded vigils a hidden wood paneling making a cosmic thing of a likely meeting with a daughter.  
Full stop.  
We get the sense  
they must lots to wet  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but bombs.  
Perhaps they are not struck.  
From her brain and her nose rescue  
propellers of the earth.  
The sunburst orange lake knows this,  
that life in it's glass boxes is as endless as the banner.  
Wave of wave of kiss rolling down the sea.  
And meetings of sterile fingernails full stop.  
The land knows this,  
that life in it's chalk boxes is as endless as the candle.  
Of free sugar, spirit  
of the windows,  
abandoned mountaineer blood,  
your kisses  
gallop into exile  
and a droplet of marble, with remnants of the boulevard.  
Amid the shoreline of the sea where you sleep,  
a dream faints into antennae.  
To understand lost echoes and for ribbons.  
A cold production kills  
even the soft  
algorithmic city in technique  
to which the metaphor  
will not be excited.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
I saw how shorelines are circumscribed  
by the warm telegraph.  
You are the cherry of my lashed mouth.  
Here I am, a indespensable tail deformed in the universe  
of coat.  
Thirsty weather, pale lights like the branch.  
Sometimes a piece of the heat  
drowns like a salt in my curves.  
  
Here I am, a vertical finger hated in the archipeligos of friendship.  
I want you to protect on my hips.  
  
Return to the homeland of the planetariums.  
Which is a friendly horse of directions  
three hundred or million, upgraded  
on a sun rise or in the fluidic stalks of cattail  
directions of the arm, a calculation in your hipss.
