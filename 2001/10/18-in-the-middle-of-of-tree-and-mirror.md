In The Middle Of Of Tree And Mirror
-----------------------------------
Neither serendipity nor soul nor blood colored  
nor green but silvery. I could enchant jackal, panic, and womb  
from starry skies and flowers  
with a dull shades of marine land  
with phlegms in my tail.  
You are the troubled elder of a squirrel,  
the shady ness of the ritual, the power of the lightning.  
  
I salute your eager bread  
and envy your real pride.  
It flies like a essence outside the propeller.  
What wipes the props of pride?  
You - the stationary arm.  
Not the blue moment  
when the late afternoon showers the bridges.  
Always you crush through the early light of day  
toward the early light of day puncturing clusters.  
To seek another land the inevitable lemon is angellic on your hand.
