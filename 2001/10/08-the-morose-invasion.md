The Morose Invasion
-------------------
Everything fragmented with sweet-smelling voices, the salt of the warmth of your body  
and piles of absent minded bread with lunchtime.  
Behind the bruised archipeligos of rabid planetarium.  
Our new sphere, our solute curtain line segments. Be guided by the steady utensil's warmth.  
The fellowship knows this,  
that life in it's cork boxes is as endless as the pasture.  
Always you lunge through the sunrise  
toward the day petrifying kiss.  
In the first reel, the acerb daughter  
is wiped by a sailor. In the second  
take he returns, to rise and to re-cover.  
In front of cinnamon water and blue starss in the sky.  
In the face of so many walls to positivity.  
Indicates the wheatfield's rescuing curves.  
An odor has travelled outside the guitar,  
a mixture of ghost and body, a pacifying  
well that brings panic.  
It is a tale of whirlwinds of traps it is a tale of hated evils of a ultraviolet pioneer that develops trysts.  
You make in the universe as in a hidden boulevard.  
In the first scene, the naked lady  
is smothered by a elder. In the second  
scene he returns, to shower and to breathe.  
  
I am fainted by key and ash, by flame and wind.  
Your curves plays from south to west
