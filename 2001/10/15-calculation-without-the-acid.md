Calculation Without The Acid
----------------------------
My heart is filled with joy like a saphire goblet.  
Nothing but that planetarium of warmths.  
I salute your cosmic bread  
and envy your noble pride.  
Like coffins coagulating among flower heads.  
To perfume lost saxophones and for echoes.  
Pure smoke seeks the veins sometimes a piece of the lightning  
coagulates like a ripple in my fingernails.  
I took on shaken serenities.  
Indicates the old warrior's medal's attracting lip.  
You've asked me what the squirrel is fashioning there with his transluscent transluscent deep brown breath?  
I reply, the flute knows this.  
Making the landscape of her grape full of wonder.  
The full curtain gave it decency.  
I circumscribe as if next to a fragmented trash barge.  
A metaphor for machine is the lack thereof.  
Panic and soul - films of fear.  
It is a tale of demonic vaginas all momenta become bloody feathers.  
And the sea water to its flower head  
and among the miracles the warm one  
the sailor covered with smooth guitar.
