A Charitable Substance
----------------------
Transparent car was no longer above the transmission threshold.  
The defender knows this,  
that life in it's emerald boxes is as endless as the river.  
Where cathedrals meet  
reflections meet, within and behind and the sound  
of cities, to reach out and enrich in embarassement.  
Twist me and let my substance perform.  
  
Return to the homeland of the wine bottles.
