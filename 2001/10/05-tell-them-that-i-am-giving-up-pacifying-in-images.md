Tell Them That I Am Giving Up Pacifying In Images
-------------------------------------------------
I could drink howl, cold fire, and polyp  
from clusters and poppies  
with a red sea shell  
with vortices in my hand.  
An odor has reflected in the middle of the stone,  
a mixture of vagabond and body, a setting  
movie that brings embarassement.  
Pockets of steel converted into crystal.  
Like the cold rusted nail of wine bottles opaque marine electricity to my  
ghostly autumn!
