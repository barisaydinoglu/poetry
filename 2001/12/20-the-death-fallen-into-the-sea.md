The Death Fallen Into The Sea
-----------------------------
A language for language is the lack thereof.  
Shut out and shut up like a lighthouse.  
A chorus of ostriches  
at morning un created un condemned  
comes to a halt before a kis.  
Fragmented weather, shady lights like the flint.  
The crowns exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
within  
it in darkness.  
What funny things does the toucan  
contain?  
How little we reconcile and how much it makes the funny things of this universe.  
  
Fewer and fewer  
compound about another mode of purity.  
Among the apple of the universe where you sleep,  
a dream deforms into identities.
