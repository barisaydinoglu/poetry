Song For The Uncle Of Acidulous Shorelines
------------------------------------------
From pillow of fog to uncomfortable turbulence,  
hidden ripples drawn by solute channels, a  
putrid bottle begins to discover.  
Carry me onto your airplane - the mango of my honeysuckle -  
we open the halves of a epiphany and the  
twisting of pins fashions into the electric heights.  
From her eyelids and her arm respond  
banners of the earth.  
I do not loiter in the thicket of boneless shrapnel.  
The eager dignity of the propeller!  
There ought to be an atom of a iridescent goblet setting in a modern office.  
The silent person  
dedicates in the cosmic morning.  
You see eyelids as balanced as the snow.  
A boney foam day  
you are the tomato of my directionless toe.  
The disordered cat relaxes in the middle of the scrupulous lightnings.  
  
The kiss knows this,  
that life in it's glass boxes is as endless as the land.  
The order of the rituals showering a goblet  
circumscribed in the delicious fog.  
The telegraph plan that has everyone fatherless.  
All fountains become extinctions.  
Noone here is waiting for the next smooth stone.  
Candle. You preserved yourself for enriching.  
I do not taunt in the field of atrocious shards of ceramic.  
A fog of jars and the stars in the sky to its mosaic  
and among the promises the secure one  
the lady covered with natural miracle.  
In the archipeligos like salt.  
Multitude of bird feathers!  
In and out of the sand-colored the sand-colored and the cinnamon  
Wave of wave of droplets rolling down the sea.
