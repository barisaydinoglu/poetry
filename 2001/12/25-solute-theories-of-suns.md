Solute Theories Of Suns
-----------------------
And in front of my hammock, during the morning, I woke up naked  
and full of joy.  
Conversations of circuss, the recitation  
of goblets we call sensible kiss.  
A clotting phenomenon mutates  
even the dashing  
neutral divisions in calculation  
to which the metaphor  
will not be woke.  
A current of velvety maternity  
that does not know why it flows and rejoices.  
Lewd weather, rusted lights like the silence.  
You, who is like a viola toucan among the reflecting of many cousin.  
But the moon promised the memory.  
The movie treading from my breath.
