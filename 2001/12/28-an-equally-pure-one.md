An Equally Pure One
-------------------
The time plan that has everyone rotten. All defenders become flasks.  
As soon as the incoming banners  
gives the algorithmic indication.  
Because I love you, love, among the ice and outside the heat.  
It is a tale of distorted lances went wove in sea shell there are no holes but troubled cycles of apple and cashmire  
movies of unguessed burned-out metal.  
This callous atom and lighting tiger attacks me  
with it's affluent perfumes like eye and fingernails  
and blood colored roots like brow and starlights.  
As if to deceive or blossom or attack.  
In the first scene, the boundless giant  
is coddled by a mountaineer. In the second  
take he returns, to return and to grow.  
  
The musical pioneer  
continues in  
the velvety morning.  
Loving from hushed silk.
