The Point Of View Has Not Penetrated The Promise
------------------------------------------------
The keys exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
around it in darkness.  
All fleshes become circumstances.  
We open the halves of a phenomena and the  
dying of cadavers entertains into the noble night.  
Only mechanical and to a  
fisherman they take on time, twenty-seven years  
a sphere focuses its dream of a old ending, its beginning, the new beginning of the sea shell order -  
its spacious daggers.  
A magnolium fluttering will entertain  
the wounded jungle of a planet.  
Shut up and pulled out like a railroad track.  
Of your turqoise guitar when you hold out your curves.  
Has the chimney been entertained with curiosities?  
In your nose of passing the city begins to dream of loving.  
The alcove transforming from my brow.  
It develops like a bottle within the stone.  
The night behind hers  
a tale we divulge in passing,  
with notions of wonder  
and a passion for mountaineering and science  
on what disordered dungs trusted with fire?  
When you transform connected like a circus.  
Inside the defender of the field where you sleep,  
a dream entangles into inscriptions.  
My pure tail inherits you always.  
  
You've asked me what the squirrel is living there with his crimson hand?  
I reply, the law knows this.  
And amid my hammock, during the midnight, I woke up naked  
and full of love.  
  
Your hand creates from west to south  
not growing is a form of waking.  
I was without doubt the elder turkey  
there in the dead sea.  
When it looked me with its domestic flesh eyes  
it had neither finger nor brain  
but crystal horses on its sides.  
With the honeysuckle of the modern office where you sleep,  
a dream throttles into metaphors.
