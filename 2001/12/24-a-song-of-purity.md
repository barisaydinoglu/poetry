A Song Of Purity
----------------
Discovered and then seized in the land.  
Of a rust colored pioneer that imbues smooth stones.  
One of them is lyrical,  
the other knows calculations.  
Where is someone  
he cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
I could awaken conspirator, twisting lonely road, and extinction  
from kiss and laminated signs  
with a rust  
colored mane  
with lineages in my heart.  
Hearing toward the peace inside the disguising puberties.
