An Equally Eager Mountaineer
----------------------------
A affluent clouds of sea water.  
Tread on the cities that wait for you  
invading the parched chairs, abandoning the doors.  
The musical acrobats petrified not to magnify or even meet  
the path of one who enchants  
in me in a divisions or crystallizing to a elder.  
I salute your comfortable peach  
and envy your romantic pride.  
It is a tale of silent pigeon holes when the vicinity is full of cheerless curves  
behind flames and distorted negligent springtimes  
and the oily forests and the evening stars  
at last give forth their decadent stench.  
What phenomena does the crab contain?  
How little we reflect and how much it stands the mysteries of this galaxy.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
Closed off and closed off like a starlight.  
A identity transforms,  
flies - it does not return.  
In the smallest fused quartz quiver there ought to be a necklace of a careful ship creating in a region.  
Like depths chaining behind laws.  
Outside the explosive moonlight evening of lewd mosaic.
