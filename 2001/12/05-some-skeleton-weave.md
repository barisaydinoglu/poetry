Some Skeleton Weave
-------------------
On what dry seperations conducted with clay?  
A grace -like lonely road  
a vessel is not enough to wipe me and keep me  
from the boulevard of your friendly mysteries.  
The archipeligos around hers  
a story we tell in passing,  
with notions of sincerity  
and a passion for computer science and science  
went conducted in evening star so the somber felicity  
lives on in a lemon,  
the verdure house of the mist,  
the monastic kiss that is musical and stationary.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
Entertaining toward the mane you say, what is the jar waiting for in its opaque cashmire well?  
I tell you it is waiting for light like you.  
As if to shake or perch or degrade.  
In my room at lunchtime you are like a droplet  
and your form and colour the way I crystallize them.  
A computer continues,  
deforms - it does not return.  
A ultraviolet and sordid horse is loitered in the night.  
Only obscene and to a  
man they take on time, twenty-seven years  
neither mane nor autumn nor black  
nor sand-colored but sand-colored.  
Carry me onto your wheel - the grape of my lemon -
