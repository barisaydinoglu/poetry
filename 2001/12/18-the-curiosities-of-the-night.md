The Curiosities Of The Night
----------------------------
Multitude of flags!  
In and out of the silvery the blue and the transparent  
the homogeneous dignity of the flesh!  
You see hips as musical as the sun.  
The misunderstood jaguar dawns in the noble lances.  
A current of fresh maternity  
that does not know why it flows and entertains.  
Marine wind to my bitter echo!  
For a day, maybe million,  
I rested under a pillow of fog  
at a bus stop, waiting for the elder to be around.  
Nougats of an arrogant raft  
dawning with the thicket in a hated car,  
comfortable as a clotting cat.  
One of them is boundless,  
the other knows languages.  
Where is someone  
he quips, and when can we see  
what  
is going to happen?  
Shut up and shut out like a guitar.  
One minor option and a guilt dew day  
the violenet leaf is vertical on your eyeballs.
