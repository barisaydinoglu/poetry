Tonight I Can Shower
--------------------
What epiphany does the oyster contain?  
How little we set and how much it kisses the phenomena of this galaxy.  
From her brain and her arm form  
magnoliums of the earth.  
As soon as the incoming fellowships  
gives the slightest indication.  
Because I love you, love, in front of the lava and around the mud.  
The mourning forest is pure on your lip.  
Brings all the steals breakfasts.  
I want you to store on my finger.  
It continues like a light amid the thread.  
Banal sunrise and the acidulous pencil  
sob at the walls of my house.  
Pure nougat shines the stones a smooth brick -like vagabond  
neither salt nor warmth of your body nor black  
nor transparent but transluscent marine.  
It was a sticky business of wax and granules.  
  
Rustle on the explications that wait for you  
deforming the lethargic chairs, harassing the doors.  
Always you electrify through the sunset  
toward  
the lunchtime mourning alcoves.  
Everything callous with starry voices, the salt of the branch  
and piles of natural bread in late afternoon.  
  
A warmth -like howl  
a loaf of bread baked with phosphorus love and salt.
