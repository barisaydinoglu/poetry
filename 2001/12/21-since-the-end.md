Since The End
-------------
The chaotic tree is fresh on your shoulder.  
Which is an ancient sea's skin of directions  
twenty-seven or million, relaxed  
on a flag or in the hopeful heart  
directions of the ears, a calculation in your hipss.  
The poppies exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
among it in darkness.  
A phenomenon forms,  
drops - it does not return.  
How living is the hopeful bramble and it's great stalactites?  
How awakening is the sweet-smelling funeral and it's deedy bombs?  
  
From unrelenting rain to palm tree leaf,  
hidden dews drawn by human channels, a  
muzzled vein begins to wake.  
Disintered pioneers and aunts.  
For me they are technical.
