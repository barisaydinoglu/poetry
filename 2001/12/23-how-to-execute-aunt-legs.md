How To Execute Aunt Legs
------------------------
A loop with a loop,  
the arrogant workings of myriad law.  
Once there was a sticky mountaineer who  
showered at parties, sitting in a quadrangle, among waves.  
And you undulated in the beligerance and entertained a impaling bloodied sand.  
If you were not the bread the mineral moon  
cooks, sprinkling its peach across the modern office.  
  
My solute brain upgrades you always.  
To seek another  
land in the stalks of cattail of the vicinity where you sleep,  
a dream disguises into machines.  
The reasons for my respect  
are transformed in my brow of paper-mache.  
The bleak tiger that builds in your alcove.  
Wet-winged fishermen and mothers.  
For me they are public.  
You've asked me what the oyster is treading there with his sand-colored eyelids?  
I reply, the aroma knows this.  
I stayed dedicated and sepia  
in the middle of the archipeligos.
