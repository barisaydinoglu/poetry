The Detail Has Not Disguised The Promise
----------------------------------------
What is this synonym but a memory degraded of its angels? The vertical one  
entertains in the parsimonious morning.  
When the divisions is full of browbeaten brain  
next to bloods and morbid sterile trysts  
and the harsh starlights and the blue lakes  
at last give forth their decadent consequence.  
An odor has relaxed outside the vein,  
a mixture of alarm and body, a circumscribing  
planetarium that brings agony.  
A electric drizzle of promises.  
From her breath and her hips  
reflect  
Flowers of the earth.  
Pure vigil stores the kisses here I am, a moonlit nose deformed in the archipeligos of light.  
What phenomena does the bird contain?  
How little we pacify and how much it perfumes the phenomena of this computer simulation.  
Neither  
lighthouse nor branch nor brimstone  
nor opaque crimson but transluscent silvery.  
Like the fatherless sand of maps your sea water is a tryst filled with parched jar.  
The oily aroma that expands in your dew.  
In my divisions at day you are like a wave  
and your form and colour the way I connect them.  
  
A language for technique is the lack thereof.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the poetic defenders?  
And the mist parsimonious splattering its farms and pampering them full of  
sea and toucan?  
  
In the smallest silicon acrobat what mysteries does the tiger contain?  
How little we play and how much it discovers the curiosities of this galaxy.  
It's a performing old warrior's medal of extinctions.  
From blade of grass to harrowing wind,  
hidden praises drawn by boundless channels, a  
misunderstood faucet begins to mix.  
Around the forest of the jungle where you sleep,  
a dream deceives into studies.
