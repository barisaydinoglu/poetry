The Sifted Throat
-----------------
The order of the productivities you've asked me what the oyster is perfuming there with his cinnamon lip?  
I reply, the garden knows this.  
In the smallest saphire praise a square among a line,  
the neurotic workings of naked law.  
Carry me onto your bicycle - the cherry of my wreath -  
a current of steady film  
that does not know why it flows and connects.  
Animosity and atom - tigers of anger.
