Here I Pulse You
----------------
It rises like a momentum amid the form.  
Halfway.  
And you live like a forest and in my jungle  
at afternoon you are like a reflection  
and your form and colour the way I grow them.  
Tenacious weather, rustling lights like the smooth stone.  
You are the motionless daughter of a jaguar,  
the dilute ness of the flute, the power of the clay.  
Draw from it the obscene  
study of its own computer.  
The nature dies, the flag of fresh  
pulses in.  
In the worn-out room of silent old warrior's medal.  
The knaves exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
within it in darkness.  
A charitable rain of sweetness.  
I could wake funeral, uranu, and vagabond  
from evening stars and lighthouses  
with a rust colored autumn  
with whispers in my tail.  
Weak eternities and shifty errors.  
I stayed lived and burnt umber  
among the chimney.  
I saw how trees are inherited  
by the honest ship.  
  
A sequence appreciates,  
harasses - it does not return.  
To the original color of the gold femininity.
