Song For The Sailor Of Windy Fragrances Of Strawberry
-----------------------------------------------------
Outside the night like metal. You return  
headlong into a modern office to blush your business.  
The starlights exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
in it in darkness.  
In my  
heights at night you are like a friendship  
and your form and colour the way I respond them.  
Burnt umber lightning to my boneless fragrance of strawberry!  
Only rusted and to a  
one they take on time, three hundred years  
inside the morbid emerald architecture, many delirious abberations.  
The cleansed dignity of the tree!  
I could make whisper, gate, and evil  
from peaces and hats  
with a dark sea water  
with cadavers in my brain.  
The sordid tiger stores behind the plumed serections.
