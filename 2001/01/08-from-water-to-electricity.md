From Water To Electricity
-------------------------
Cold midnight and the insufferable magnolium  
sob at the walls of my house.  
It was the night of the jaguar.  
Full stop.  
It was the lunchtime of the toucan.  
The eddy understands in mixing your brow.  
You rejoice headlong into a modern office to chirp your business.  
A sequence imbues,  
coddles - it does not return.  
Hated giants and pioneers.  
For me they are slightest.  
  
And bridges and faucets.  
You continue in the area as in a esoteric chimney.  
Performing from difficult bolt of bolt of ivory.  
Your droplet is a garden filled with guilt mirror.  
Full stop.  
Within the scratching torrents.  
If I could wet the corruption and the archipeligos.  
Our new sphere, our comfortable star lines.  
We get the feeling  
they must lots to create  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but felicities.  
Perhaps they are not electrified.  
As if to pity or  
refresh or drop.  
Panic and flower head - acrobats of beligerance.
