A Plumed Substance
------------------
In my area at night you are like a vein  
and your form and colour the way I seek them.  
Which is a irreducable miracle of directions  
too few to count or too few to count, refreshed  
on an aroma or in the trusting banner  
directions of the fingernails, a calculation in your hipss.
