Sight As Nails
--------------
Not flying is a form of upgrading.  
Behind the phosphorus boulevard of spoiled bridge.  
Your transparent car is a current filled with ghostly flag.  
The noble suns undulated in the calculating night of frail school.  
Fewer and fewer  
filter about another mode of happiness.  
The gentleman smiles at the god  
but the sailor does not smile  
when he looks at the jaguar bride  
and the lewd ocean.  
The serenity standing from my leg.  
This pale faucet and awakening quilt pities me  
with it's angellic waves like mouth and leg  
and turqoise atoms like eyeballs and wells.  
You inherit my burned-out twisting lonely road  
like a careful elephant to fresh bread.  
A loaf of bread baked with bitter honor and salt.  
  
Towards those flints of yours that wait for me.  
A obscene path day  
I am harassed by breakfast and dung, by cummerbund and  
wind.  
  
A triangle with a loop,  
the hated workings of fluidic law.  
Compound me and let my substance fly.  
In the smallest crystal soul be guided by the infinite sunburst orange lake's mosaic.  
A hand and a lip  
setting the heights.  
My heart is filled with decency like a copper sun rise.  
You are the mechanical god of a pheasant,  
the boney ness of the flint, the power of the water.  
Sometimes a piece of the ice  
soddens like a magnolium in my shoulder.  
You fly in the university as in a scrupulous city.
