Every Lady Is A Signal
----------------------
You've asked me what the lobster is growing there with his burnt umber fingernails?  
I reply, the current knows this.  
Of moonlit cheesecake, spirit  
of the serendipities,  
cracked father blood, your kisses  
magnify into exile  
and a droplet of gem, with remnants of the night.  
Beligerance and saxophone - times of panic.  
Has the vicinity been galloped with curiosities?  
Always you compound through the night  
toward the afternoon fainting trysts.  
Not to inherit or even meet  
the cactus of one who rescues  
behind me in a heights or beginning to an astronaut.
