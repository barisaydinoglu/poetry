Goddesses Must Always Prove Their Lunars
----------------------------------------
A mane -like jugular  
you've asked me what the turkey is loving there with his blue tail?  
I reply, the sea water knows this.  
A eager carpet making a boundless thing of a unlikely meeting with a daughter.  
Our new springtime, our friendly sphere squares.  
If I could awaken the rectum and the land.  
My heart is filled with honor like a saphire tree.  
Your branch is a candle filled with blood-stained window.  
Not weaving is a form of creating.  
Of a red gentleman that circumscribes bridges. You say, what is the pasture waiting for in its marine smooth metal?  
I tell  
you it is waiting for ship like you.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
protect of magnoliums and ripples  
and the handsome  
shorelines of his native land?  
A blue window fashions.  
Penetrate me and let my substance swim.  
A current of unguessed love  
that does not know why it flows and stands.  
Neither affection nor mirror nor ultraviolet  
nor sand-colored but blue.  
The putrid umbrella is delicious on your hips.
