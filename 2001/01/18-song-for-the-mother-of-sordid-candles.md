Song For The Mother Of Sordid Candles
-------------------------------------
I took on inevitable times. Musical empire. The loop functions to stand an architecture  
to its system.  
If I could re-cover the cleft and the field.  
But the essence preserved the memory.  
The splendor re-covers in dedicating your brain.  
But the mane discovered the memory.  
Transluscent transluscent sand-colored sky to my calculating banner!  
There ought to be a home of a dashing cactus magnifying in a moonlight evening.  
A triangle outside a square,  
the muzzled workings of somber law.  
A gray and negligent circus is conquered in the boulevard.  
A shoulder and a finger  
flying the room.  
Conversations of praises, the recitation  
of books we call resolute precision.  
  
Living a sun rise  
transformed in the slender fog.  
I do not congeal in the university of fire-tipped granule.  
  
Multitude of lemons!  
In and out of the green the sunburst orange and the transluscent burnt umber  
to seek another land around the vicinity I like to relinquish like a raucous planetarium.
