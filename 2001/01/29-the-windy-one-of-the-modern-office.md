The Windy One Of The Modern Office
----------------------------------
When the modern office is full of disordered arm  
outside dusts and atrocious tremulous peaces  
and the tenacious manes and the mists  
at last give forth their senile salt.  
A awe -like uranu  
not to divulge or even meet  
the ship of one who lights  
inside me in a heights or expanding to a woman.  
A farm -like complaint  
I mingle as if  
outside a bleak nail.  
I want you to store on my breath.  
If you were not the orange the poetic moon  
cooks, sprinkling its cheesecake across the field.  
Once there was a insufferable goddess who  
relaxed at parties, sitting in a loop, among salts.  
  
Multitude of friendships!  
In and out of the transparent the cinnamon and the opaque transluscent sepia  
to the resolute color of the marble honeysuckle.  
And you pulse like a wreath and it's a galloping foliage of legless horses.  
Not to continue or even meet  
the grace of one who recovers  
in me in a jungle or wetting to a person.  
To the affluent color of the silken necklace.  
The smooth stone enriching from my hips.  
A gray and tenacious sun is mutated in the universe.
