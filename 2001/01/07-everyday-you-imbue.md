Everyday You Imbue
------------------
Fewer and fewer  
degrade about another mode of pride.  
Has the divisions been wove with phenomena?  
Absorbant empire. The triangle functions to tread a system  
to its system.  
Man of the depths of my eye - your seizing  
stills your stationary regard as though it were sky.  
Only sticky and to a  
cousin they take on time, three hundred years  
and the dove to its pullulation  
and among the warmths the aromatic one  
the gentleman covered with charitable bed.  
Outside the cashmire  
finger of the sky.  
A machine imbues,  
dies - it does not return.  
And pastures and utensils.  
The maternity knows this,  
that life in it's ivory boxes is  
as endless as the circus.  
We  
get the color  
they must lots to flutter  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but polyps.  
Perhaps they are not passed.  
I'm the stranger to the coral of immediate key.  
As if to puncture or perform or smear.  
This boney hat and treading bird feather abolishes me  
with it's honest kiss like nose and ears  
and ultraviolet echoes like leg and landscapes.  
Outside the map of the city where you sleep,  
a dream deludes into computers.
