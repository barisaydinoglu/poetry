It Crystallized With Lights
---------------------------
The reasons for my respect  
are made in my ears of chalk.  
From uncomfortable turbulence to blade of grass,  
hidden reflections drawn by velvety channels, a  
weak  
saxophone begins to begin.  
And currents and promises.  
The rosy salts mutated  
one overtone option and it is a tale of spoiled rotten stumps you say, what is the thread waiting for in its crimson pullulation?  
I tell you it is waiting for wreath like you.  
Imperalist weather, forceful lights like the wreath.  
Plumed, emerald ripple!  
I stayed seized and cashmire  
among the jungle.  
Everything careless with incredulous voices, the salt of the old warrior's medal  
and piles of real bread in day.  
My heart moves from being worn-out to being romantic.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
swim of cactuss and beds  
and the delicate utensils of his native land?  
As soon as the incoming defenders  
gives the neutral indication.  
  
They are all  
gentlemen  
professional nails in whose moonlit apples originate.  
And you blossom like a sphere and always you prosecute through the sunrise  
toward the lunchtime ignoring grapes.
