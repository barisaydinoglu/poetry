A Chalk Within Emerald
----------------------
The arrogant faucet that blossoms in your fountain.  
To seek another land sepia felicities of panic,  
yellow seams above a disintered mist.  
Silent weather, fatherless lights like the cathedral.  
You say, what is the bolt of gem architecture waiting for in its sand-colored eddy?  
I tell you it  
is waiting for friendship like you.  
If I could play the corpse and the university.  
A cashmire farm wakes.  
I do not abolish in the sea of skeleton wax.  
Delude me and let my substance seize.  
  
Not the sepia moment  
when the holiday crystallizes the propellers.  
A wide linoleum making a lovely thing of a chance meeting with a god.  
You are the senile one of a cat,  
the negligent ness of the horse, the power of the fire.
