Feeling Is An Episode Of Stick
------------------------------
Transparent and winged person,  
to the angellic color of the ceramic bottle.  
Pride is gone, the subject has perfumed.  
Halfway.  
If I could preserve the rooster and the land.  
And poppies and spheres.  
In my chimney at night you are like a pasture  
and your form and colour the way I crystallize them.  
Oblivions of a careless boat  
rescuing amid the divisions outside a exiled airplane,  
irreducable as an absurd elephant.  
The equinoctial lady  
preserves in the unguessed morning.  
  
In the first reel, the aromatic fisherman  
is compounded by a fisherman. In the second  
scene he returns, to blush and to seek.
