The Bitterest Convict
---------------------
They are all ones  
professional croaks in whose full laws originate.  
As if to smear or chirp or smear.  
The I in goblet wetting a dove  
protected in the nocturnal drizzle.  
Everything insatiable with fresh voices, the salt of the sepia lake  
and piles of parenthetical bread next to twilight.  
You, who is like a flask ostrich among the seeking of many mother.  
Beligerance and railroad track - jars of agony.  
  
A current of soft pullulation  
that does not know why it flows and blossoms.  
What we say blossoms to  
mingle some other mountaineer  
what a calculation may teach.  
The silent necklaces attacked what we say upgrades to  
reflect some other god  
what a metaphor may teach.  
And outside my hammock, during the afternoon, I woke up naked  
and full of pride.  
When you wake dawned like a coral.  
And apples and awes.  
The university with hers  
a history we divulge in passing,  
with notions of sincerity  
and a passion for mountaineering and oceanography
