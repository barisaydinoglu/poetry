Abstraction Is An Episode Of Ego
--------------------------------
With its shaken fly in front of the transparent eyelids of the fire. A line segment with a line,  
the distorted workings of brandishing law.  
My heart moves from being brutal to being hidden.  
I saw how trousers are continued  
by the real sun rise.  
So the lovely decency lives on in a fruit,  
the affluent house of the soul,  
the great echo that is aromatic and incredulous.  
Nothing but that diamond architecture of love.
