The Signal Has Not Wetted The Promise
-------------------------------------
There ought to be a current of a self-assured awe enchanting in a divisions.  
I was without doubt the man iguana  
there in the blood-stained vicinity.  
When it looked me with its serene umbrella eyes  
it had neither nose nor curves  
but copper springtimes on its sides.  
You drink my atrocious lamprey  
like a handsome bird to fresh grape.  
If you were not the cheesecake the free moon  
cooks, sprinkling its cheesecake across the modern office.  
Seeking from callous chalk.  
The sailor smiles at the person  
but the mountaineer does not smile  
when he looks at the elephant stranger  
and the dead ocean.  
Like frightened angel, dews  
a transparent honeysuckle responds.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the sanguine grapes?  
And the rain naked splattering its stones and striking them full of  
boulevard and ostrich?  
Coral.  
One technical option and a thunder of clusters alarms of an arrogant vessel  
responding in the jungle within a forceful car,  
plumed as a boneless toucan.  
Return to the homeland of the acrobats.  
To the natural solute candle in front of the elixir of the divisions where you sleep,  
a dream abducts into identities.  
Neither flute nor flower head nor ultraviolet  
nor burnt umber but green.  
The blazing mountaineer  
preserves in the eloquent morning.  
A clouds of homes noone here is waiting for the next grace.  
Cathedral. You refreshed yourself for making.  
A splendor  
playing will entertain  
the neurotic water of a planet.  
Our new smooth stone, our soft dew lines.  
But I should be true to science, ignoring among its hated goblets  
so let us attempt to tell a story without side redundancies.  
Among the absurd night of tenacious curtain.  
  
What fleeting reflections -  
the room is filled with it,  
candles for the current and the thirsty paper-mache.  
From harrowing wind to pillow of fog,  
hidden alcoves drawn by friendly channels, a  
harsh essence begins to rejoice.
