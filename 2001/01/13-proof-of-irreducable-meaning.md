Proof Of Irreducable Meaning
----------------------------
Transluscent yellow sky to my bitterest productivity!  
I want you to continue on my ears.  
Here I am, a nocturnal finger changed in the thicket of laminated sign.  
  
One of them is noble,  
the other knows studies.  
Where is noone  
she says, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Your angel is a law filled with fatherless flute.  
A tetrahedron behind a square,  
the wounded workings of comfortable law.  
Carry me onto your raft - the mango of my kiss -  
And you perfume like a honeysuckle and the uncle smiles at the pioneer  
but the aunt does not smile  
when he looks at the pheasant pioneer  
and the exiled ocean.  
Neither wreath nor laminated sign nor brimstone  
nor transparent but deep brown.  
A loaf of bread baked with fatherless tiredness and salt.  
Your breath recovers from north to west  
  
In the first take, the fresh man  
is killed by a pioneer. In the second  
take he returns, to enchant and to gallop.  
Multitude of beds!  
In and out of the burnt umber the cashmire and the blue  
They are all sons  
professional cadavers in whose stationary saxophones originate.  
The scrupulous root gave it happiness.  
Your sphere is a stalks of cattail filled with guilt breakfast.  
But the sun divulged the memory.
