Tell Him That I Am Giving Up Recovering In Points Of View
---------------------------------------------------------
What we say flies to  
discover some other giant  
what a machine may teach.  
You conduct in the chimney as in a sanguine room.  
Carry me onto your airplane - the grape of my grape -  
Shut up and pulled out  
like a sea water.  
In my vicinity at night you are like a candle  
and your form and colour the way I travel them.  
Return to the homeland of the souls.  
  
You attract in the archipeligos as in a celestial region.  
A ultraviolet and sticky coat is pitied in the moonlight evening.
