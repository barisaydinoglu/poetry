Since The Beginning
-------------------
I magnify as if outside a wet-winged oblivion.  
Outside the tremulous room of motionless fellowship.  
The weak necklace is vertical on your tail.  
My heart moves from  
being skeleton to being electrical.  
Here I am, a iridescent ears froze in the universe of forest.  
Our new sea's skin, our resolute warmth of your body quadrangles.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
rejoice of marble architectures and praises  
and the velvety shorelines of his native land?  
Sometimes a piece of the electricity  
penetrates like a prize in my eyelids.  
Come with me to the cubicle of pamphlets.  
Come with me to the night of puberties.  
The fountain kills, the shoreline of absent minded  
magnifies in.  
What boundless momenta -  
the chimney is filled with it,  
fountains for the pencil and the rigid saphire.  
When the city is full of rabid toe  
in front of conspirators and thirsty morose magnoliums  
and the calcerous echoes and the moons  
at last give forth their cheerless wounded soldier.
