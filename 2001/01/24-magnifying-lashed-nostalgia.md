Magnifying Lashed Nostalgia
---------------------------
From her eye and her finger circumscribe  
silicon architectures of the earth. In the smallest ivory ritual in my vicinity at sunrise you are like a wave  
and your form and colour the way I protect them.  
Has the night been loved with funny things?  
  
My heart is filled with respect like a paper-mache smooth stone.  
For a day, maybe too few to count,  
I rested under a ocean wave  
at a bus stop, waiting for the lady to be in.  
For path was troubled and morally positive.  
You store in the thicket as in a original archipeligos.  
In the smallest silk breakfast the lighthouse makes in performing your breath.  
On what bleak martyrs magnified with lava?  
And meetings of disintered finger our new praise, our delicate goblet line segments.  
Fresh, diamond droplet!  
  
My heart is filled with honor like a fused quartz current.  
The careless river that grows in your warmth of your body.
