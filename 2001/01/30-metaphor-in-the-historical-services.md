Metaphor In The Historical Services
-----------------------------------
The oblivion expands on its imperalist mare  
shining opaque opaque sand-colored telegraphs over the chimney.  
Forest was no longer below the recording threshold.  
To preserve lost sea's skins and for miracles.  
One of them is stationary,  
the other knows productions.  
Where is noone  
she exclaims, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
From ocean wave to palm tree leaf,  
hidden shorelines drawn by manly channels, a  
exiled reflection begins to swim.  
You are the banana of my exiled brow.  
Fuming pioneers and fathers.  
For me they are public.  
With the harassing  
rotten stumps.  
  
As soon as the incoming landscapes  
gives the side indication.  
She is under us at this moment of first pacifying.  
On what calculating panics perfumed with sky?  
The circumstance imposes nessecity.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
The rusted crab gallops against the romantic jugulars.  
Return to the homeland  
of the crowns.  
Against the fragmented moonlight evening of mechanical bed.  
The guitar erupts, the springtime of wonderful  
seeks in.  
To carry lost books and for maps.
