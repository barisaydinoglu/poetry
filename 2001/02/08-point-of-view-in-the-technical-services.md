Point Of View In The Technical Services
---------------------------------------
Conversations of awes, the recitation  
of starlights we call electric circus.  
The order of the hearts insatiable conspirators and shady throats.  
A quadrangle outside a triangle,  
the rigid workings of smooth law. Behind the lethargic universe of bleak angel.  
Pride is gone, the subject has promised.
