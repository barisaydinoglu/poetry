Since The Beginning Of Perching
-------------------------------
What is this inscription but a memory decayed of its yellow lakes?  
They are all ladies  
professional conspirators in whose nocturnal river banks originate.  
I saw how drops are continued  
by the parenthetical time.  
Noone here is waiting for the next lake.  
Dew. You carried yourself for exciting.  
Only pale and to a  
father they take on time, million years  
a green well gathers.  
  
Amid blue water and transluscent burnt umber threads.  
I saw how natures are swam  
by the balanced kiss.
