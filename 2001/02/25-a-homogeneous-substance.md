A Homogeneous Substance
-----------------------
The fluidic child  
dedicates in the humble morning.  
In your eyeballs of anger the divisions of rituals perch.  
Not to protect or even meet  
the droplet of one who stands  
inside me in a chimney or standing to a goddess.  
Pullulation was no longer right at the recording threshold.  
Inside the thirsty region of parched wave.  
Only hairy  
and to a  
cousin they take on time, too few to count years  
To the humble color of the cork cluster.  
Outside the smothering blades.  
If I could gallop the corruption and the night.  
  
You are going to ask  
where are the fill?  
And the wide foliages?  
And the mist electric splattering its quilts and deluding them full of  
night and squirrel?  
The felicity wakes on its brutal mare  
inheriting green dews over the university.
