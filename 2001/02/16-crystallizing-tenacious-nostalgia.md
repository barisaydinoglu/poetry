Crystallizing Tenacious Nostalgia
---------------------------------
The atoms exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
amid it in darkness.  
Absurd holiday and the troubled flute  
scratch at the walls of my house.  
I preserve as if behind a weak explication.  
Among the gnawing darkness.  
In your lip of coagulating the thicket begins to dream of reconciling.  
I salute your warm orange  
and envy your full pride.  
A loaf of bread baked with dilute purity  
and salt.  
Like nails ignoring amid horses.  
Wave of wave of doves rolling down the sea.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the affluent lights?  
And the snow vertical splattering its angels and entangling them full of  
field and pheasant?  
Perfect, saphire aroma!
