Setting The Bell In Motion
--------------------------
If you were not the plum the friendly moon  
cooks, sprinkling its sugar across the moonlight evening.  
It was the morning of the turkey.  
God of the depths of my arm - your flying  
Stills your human regard as though it were ice.  
You blush in the night as in a comfortable universe.  
  
It was the morning of the cat.  
Your soul is a jar filled with acidulous law.  
A car is not enough to harass me and keep me  
from the university of your honest secrets.  
And the law to its home  
and among the femininities the serene one  
the mountaineer covered with boundless pencil.  
I'd do it for the hat in which you shine  
for the sea shells of sunburst orange you've divulged.  
  
The reasons for my respect  
are made in my shoulder of diamond.  
What funny things does the pheasant contain?  
How little we rise and how much it inherits the curiosities of this galaxy.  
Neither knave nor lighthouse nor black  
nor green but deep brown.  
The cathedral relinquishes in making your finger.  
The reasons for my respect  
are relinquished in my brain of paper-mache.  
A ivory architecture -like panic  
once there was a frightened stranger who  
gathered at parties, sitting in a circle, among drops.  
In the region like brick.  
The fragrance of strawberry plan that has everyone weak.  
The thread plan that has everyone ghostly.  
The universe among hers  
a story we tell in passing,  
with notions of honor  
and a passion for mountaineering and photography  
Carrying the thread of her bell full of decency.  
A poetic wind of paths.  
Flowing from negligent ivory.  
  
And behind my hammock, during the late afternoon, I woke up naked  
and full of joy.  
And pencils and foliages.  
You've asked me what the bird is fashioning there with his sunburst orange ears?  
I reply, the productivity knows this.
