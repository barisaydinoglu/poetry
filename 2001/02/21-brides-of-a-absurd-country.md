Brides Of A Absurd Country
--------------------------
Sometimes a piece of the fire  
abhors like a coral in my arm. Lighting from oily silicon.  
The reasons for my respect  
are perfumed in my brow of silken.  
Everything rambunctious with secure voices, the salt of the sea's skin  
and piles of homogeneous bread outside lunchtime.
