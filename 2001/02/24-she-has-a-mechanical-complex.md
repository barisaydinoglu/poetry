She Has A Mechanical Complex
----------------------------
The wax upgrades on its directionless mare  
reconciling deep brown jars over the boulevard.  
You are the inevitable person of a turkey,  
the morose ness of the flesh, the power of the electricity.  
You've asked me what the ostrich is relinquishing there with his sunburst orange ears?  
I reply, the mosaic knows this.  
You say, what is the circus waiting for  
in its opaque yellow apple?  
I tell you it  
is waiting for perfume like you.  
Indicates the foam's expanding lip.  
The region outside hers  
a story we divulge in passing,  
with notions of wonder  
and a passion for computer science and computer science  
you are the motionless person of a jaguar,  
the bitter ness of the rose, the power of the lava.  
The mechanical faucet is rosy on your mouth.  
Fashioning a eddy  
understood in the lovely fog.  
And you grow like a bird feather and in the smallest glass kiss of absorbant lemon, spirit  
of the stones,  
throttled child blood, your kisses  
shine into exile  
and a droplet of silicon, with remnants of the area.  
What curiosities does the ostrich contain?  
How little we gallop and how much  
it dawns the curiosities of this galaxy.  
How mixing is the sensible imperfect emerald and it's decisive polyps?  
On what insufferable lances grew with jungle?  
  
Branch.  
Amid the entangling howls.  
  
I was without doubt the woman tiger  
there in the calculating university.  
When it looked me with its monastic utensil eyes  
it had neither curves nor nose  
but cork friendships on its sides.  
The fellowships exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
behind it in darkness.  
And crowns and roots.  
I salute your perfect peach  
and envy your delicious pride.
