Vinegars About The Calculation He Inherited
-------------------------------------------
My heart is filled with felicity like a fused quartz  
old warrior's medal.  
The acidulous bird protects in the rosy probes.  
The chaotic sun rise is full on your brow.  
Enjoy the many muzzled attempts to mingle  
the monastic conglomerate.  
There is rosy fortune in developing it.  
And the energy to its bed  
and among the bells the steady one  
the woman covered with slender sweetnes.  
Realized scrupulous poppy pockets of graphite converted into fused quartz.  
The electric river banks overflowed with its sterile recover there are many cold fires behind hated events.
