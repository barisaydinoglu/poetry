Some Wounded Attract
--------------------
Flowing toward the circus a identity understands,  
soddens - it does not return.  
I saw how cathedrals are mixed  
by the irreducable pencil.  
The order of the warmths of your body I could divulge shrapnel, acid, and utensil  
from schools and splendors  
with a black lake  
with yeasts in my ears.  
And you abducted in the embarassement and gathered a dying alarm.  
Dead people and custodians.  
For me they are public. To seek another land from her arm and her curves weave  
acrobats of the earth.  
And a inaccessible nature's fire will return you.  
Which is a free bird feather of directions  
too many to count or thousand, responded  
on a window or in the comfortable eddy  
directions of the nose, a calculation in your tails.  
Not reflecting is a form of attracting.  
Realized unguessed guitar multitude of precisions!  
In and out of the sand-colored the burnt umber and the sand-colored  
not trusting is a form of perfuming.  
And so that its pins will abhor your eyelids.
