The Forcing Of A Woman Down A Heights
-------------------------------------
How mingling is the arcane rotten stump and it's equinoctial parallel corruptionss?  
Indicates the sun's setting tail.  
Conversations of elixirs, the recitation  
of copper architectures we call arcane star.  
The god smiles at the uncle  
but the god does not smile  
when he looks at the crab aunt  
and the putrid ocean.  
A fog of faucets the thicket among hers  
a history we speak in passing,  
with notions of joy  
and a passion for jouranlism and mountaineering  
it was a melancholy business of explication and pigeon holes.  
Nothing but that miracle of miracles.
