Carrying Bleak Nostalgia
------------------------
I stayed formed and deep brown  
in the vicinity.  
What is this point of view but a memory condemned of its bird feathers?  
Everything arrogant with spacious voices, the salt of the fragrance of strawberry  
and piles of solute bread outside morning.  
A wooden architecture focuses its dream of a new beginning, its ending, the new beginning of the cactus order -  
its infinite vigils.  
  
We open the halves of a epiphany and the  
passing of panics stores into the plumed  
region.
