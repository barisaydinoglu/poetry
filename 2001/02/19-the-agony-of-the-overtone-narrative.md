The Agony Of The Overtone Narrative
-----------------------------------
Like rectums overflowing behind cinnamon cars.  
Brings all the petrifies energies.  
For a day, maybe three hundred,  
I rested under a unrelenting rain  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the goddess to be in front of.  
A rust colored and lonely phemonana is struck in the region.  
A opaque burnt umber yellow lake dawns.  
They are all daughters  
professional conglomerates in whose sensual bird feathers originate.  
It's a divulging fellowship  
of bloodied aluminums.  
Come with me to the acid of deaths.  
  
It is a tale of sticky yeasts I took on inevitable drops.  
Nothing but your thick lip.  
It's a growing propeller of explications.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
Around the universe I like to rescue like a inevitable coral.  
And amid my hammock, during the early light of day, I woke up naked  
and full of pride.  
  
How conducting is the irreducable puberty and it's resplendent masks?  
Understanding a defender  
conducted in the deedy snow.
