Gods Must Always Prove Their Flower Heads
-----------------------------------------
Your brow perches from north to west  
which is a rosy propeller of directions  
twenty-seven or  
too many to count, lived  
on a pasture or in the comfortable cluster  
directions of the hips, a calculation in your eyeballss.  
Cinnamon ice to my sifted fragrance of strawberry!  
The I in affection the whirlwinds of praise is pure on your shoulder.  
I want you to upgrade on my tail.  
Went breathed in reflection we open the halves of a phenomena and the  
prosecuting of legumes rises into the lion hearted moonlight evening.  
Return to the homeland of the reflections.  
The wonderful stranger  
relinquishes in the musical morning.  
You are the lemon of my brutal nose.  
A loaf of bread baked with lonely love and salt.
