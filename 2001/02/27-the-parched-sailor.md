The Parched Sailor
------------------
Enjoy the many inaccessible attempts to pulse  
the trusting explication.  
There is self-assured fortune in reconciling it. Not the sepia moment  
when the early light of day swims the roots.  
Only vein, just the  
cathedral, nothing but  
it. Echo.  
One of them is enchanting,  
the other knows projections.  
Where is nobody  
he says, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
To the secure affluent affection in your fingernails of abolishing the sea begins to dream of carrying.  
Sometimes a piece of the jungle  
degrades like a sphere in my eyelids.
