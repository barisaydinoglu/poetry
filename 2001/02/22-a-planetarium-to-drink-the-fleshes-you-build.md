A Planetarium To Drink The Fleshes You Build
--------------------------------------------
I do not throttle in the room of clotting salt.  
They are all gods  
professional eternities in whose smooth alcoves originate.  
What is this synonym but a memory fainted of its souls?  
Has the chimney been trod with curiosities?  
Browbeaten gods and fathers.  
For me they are aerial.  
Return to the homeland of the doves.  
  
Nothing but that fountain of droplets.  
I wet as if in a boneless city.  
Around the sunburst  
orange finger of the wind.  
As soon as the incoming doves  
gives the individual indication.  
Outside the freezing throats.  
Of electrical peach, spirit  
of the apples,  
disguised lady blood, your kisses  
pacify into exile  
and a droplet of silken, with remnants of the room.  
The cluster seeks in discovering your leg.  
Like the smothered sand of coats to gather lost books and for bottles.
