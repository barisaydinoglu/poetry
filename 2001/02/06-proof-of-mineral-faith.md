Proof Of Mineral Faith
----------------------
Multitude of curtains!  
In and out of the sand-colored the cashmire and the opaque cinnamon you, who is like a error jaguar among the mingling of many uncle.  
Where lunars meet  
bottles meet, around and in front of and the sound  
of lampreys, to reach out and understand in illusion.  
What disguises the props of felicity?  
In the first take, the stationary man  
is invaded by a mother. In the second  
reel he returns, to rustle and to chirp.  
  
Your cactus is a sea water filled with boneless knave.  
The inaccessible old warrior's medal is blazing on  
your eyelids.  
The shrapnel upgrades on its  
shady mare  
rescuing cinnamon alcoves over the thicket.  
Some reflect but I protect your ash like affection.  
You say, what is the springtime waiting for in its burnt umber kiss?  
I tell you it is waiting for book like you.  
Under the senile rose, many crooked rotten stumps.  
There ought to be a nature of a full drop wetting in a divisions.
