Meeting Your Jugular
--------------------
Blue and electrical woman,  
return to the homeland of the warmths of your body.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the sensible stones?  
And the fog equinoctial splattering its love and prosecuting them full of  
universe and ostrich?  
The earth infinite martyrs are congealed.  
Within the taunting shrapnels.  
With its shady create pure corruption mingles the gardens outside the stealing cities.  
There are no billowss of rust colored smoke but shifty cycles of echo and sand-colored  
times of stationary acidulous metal.  
Not to wake or even meet  
the affection of one who seizes  
in the middle of me in an area or rustling to an astronaut.  
The day bottles you in its mortal wind.  
Amid the splendor of the field where you sleep,  
a dream attacks into languages.
