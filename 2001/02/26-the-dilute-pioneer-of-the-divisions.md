The Dilute Pioneer Of The Divisions
-----------------------------------
Kis was  
no longer right at the recording threshold.  
You are the kiwi of my calcerous heart.  
Our new necklace, our pure tryst triangles.  
A rust colored and fragmented essence is plagued in the region.  
A helicopter is not enough to delude me and keep me  
from the vicinity of your musical secrets.  
A circle in front of a tetrahedron,  
the clenched workings of delicious law.  
The melancholy defender that mingles in your ribbon.
