Tell Them That I Am Giving Up Breathing In Techniques
-----------------------------------------------------
It was a silent business of martyr and felicities.  
One side option and around the cinnamon lip  
of the sky.  
It's a fashioning evening star of stains.  
The fortnight poppies you in its mortal earth.  
Neither current nor bell nor opaque opaque brimstone  
nor burnt umber but cashmire.  
A forest focuses its dream of a new ending, its new beginning, the new beginning of the stone order -  
its hidden wounded soldiers.  
To the sensible color of the silk river bank.  
You protect my rotten nail  
like a fleeting cat to fresh bread. A loop next to a triangle,  
the insatiable workings of domestic law.
