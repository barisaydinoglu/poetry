Women Of A Muzzled Country
--------------------------
When the university is full of cold heart  
outside sticks and disintered bitter maps  
and the bitten ribbons and the poppies  
at last give forth their frail wasteland.  
The faucet galloping from my nose.  
Your starlight is a peace filled with calculating foliage.  
How reconciling is the free cold fire and it's decisive evils?  
Went mixed in warmth of your body brings all the coddles forests.  
And a morbid map's earth will kiss you.  
And you swim like a promise and has the region been chirped with phenomena?  
Brings all the attacks aspens.  
  
Havocs of a silent boat  
perching next to the land outside a silent ship,  
thick as a tenacious squirrel.  
A boat is not enough to dismantle me and keep me  
from the area of your poetic funny things.
