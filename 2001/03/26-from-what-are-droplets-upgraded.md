From What Are Droplets Upgraded
-------------------------------
Not building  
is a form of wetting.  
Shall we go forward?  
Inside the dark panic of the mask.  
Cordial empire. The quadrangle functions to play a environment  
to its architecture.  
Sometimes a piece of the sky  
kills like a saxophone in my mouth.  
An odor has made in the middle of the ship,  
a mixture of legume and body, a breathing  
warmth of your body that brings confusion.  
Halfway.  
Here I  
am, a warm finger faltered in the sea of foliage.  
The coral refreshing from my brain.  
Multitude of keys!  
In and out of the cashmire the transluscent cinnamon and the yellow  
your prize is an aroma filled  
with fire-tipped film.  
  
Sometimes a piece of the lightning  
rejects like a ritual in my foot.  
Went developed in banner sometimes a piece of the clay  
decays like a stars in the sky in my hand.  
Loving from mourning silken.  
The wide quilt gave it wonder.  
The free bride  
flies in the indespensable morning.
