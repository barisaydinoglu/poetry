The Weak Legume
---------------
When the university is full of harsh eyeballs  
inside legumes and smothered mechanical foams  
and the arrogant paths and the paths  
at last give forth their rigid darknes.  
Closed off and closed off like a laminated sign.  
We get the meaning  
they must lots to circumscribe  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but traps.  
Perhaps they are not bristled.  
Walls of a ghostly wheel  
reconciling behind the heights in front of a dead train,  
somber as a sifted bird.  
Crimson bloods of uranu,  
sand-colored seams above a sordid movie.  
Not the burnt umber moment  
when the day rejoices the curtains.  
Come with me to the stench of cadavers.
