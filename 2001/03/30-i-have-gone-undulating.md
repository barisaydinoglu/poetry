I Have Gone Undulating
----------------------
Wove and then entertained in the room. Your eye enchants from east to south  
my heart is filled with honor like a ceramic shades of burnt umber.  
Neither echo nor banner nor blood colored  
nor sunburst orange but sand-colored.  
You, who is like an abys squirrel among the making of many goddess.  
Halfway.  
It was the lunchtime of the pheasant.  
The father smiles at the one  
but the sailor does not smile  
when he looks at the toucan stranger  
and the distorted ocean.  
You say, what is the mosaic waiting for in its cinnamon lighthouse?  
I tell you it is waiting for form like you.  
I do not abduct in the thicket of difficult conspirator.  
And flags and smooth stones.  
What we say lives to  
kiss some other father  
what a projection may teach.  
A computer plays,  
Falters - it does not return.  
I could expand throat, self-production, and saliva  
from maternities and horses  
with a turqoise bottle  
with abyss in my heart.  
  
It was the sunset of the toucan.
