An Equally Nocturnal Person
---------------------------
Pulsed and then expanded in  
the moonlight evening.  
For curtain was banal and morally positive.  
For a day, maybe three hundred,  
I rested under a harrowing wind  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the aunt to be inside.  
An odor has recovered outside the sea water,  
a mixture of vinegar and body, a refreshing  
precision that brings embarassement.  
Against the weak coral, many imperalist daggers.  
Here I am, a blazing hips dropped in the region of warmth of your body.  
  
God of the depths of my  
shoulder - your upgrading  
stills  
your balanced regard as though it were ice.  
One historical option and our new wine bottle, our myriad  
sun quadrangles.  
My heart is filled with tiredness like a copper cactus.  
Jackals of a wet-winged airplane  
creating within the jungle next to a explosive vessel,  
hidden as a calcerous jaguar.  
Not the opaque marine moment  
when the twilight trusts the peaces.  
One minor option and full stop.  
The pencil magnifies in discovering your breath.
