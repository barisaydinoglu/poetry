The Camera Of Minor Points
--------------------------
The mask imposes nessecity.  
Like salivas shaking outside drops.  
It magnifies like a tryst around the snow.  
Your foot magnifies from south to north  
here I am, a serene eyelids loitered in the heights of sphere.  
To the profound color of the copper mirror.  
Not the burnt umber moment  
when the sunset recovers the marine cars.  
I saw how rituals are connected  
by the equinoctial necklace.  
But the rose returned the memory.  
In front of crimson water and sand-colored planetariums.
