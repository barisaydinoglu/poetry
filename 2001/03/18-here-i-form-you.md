Here I Form You
---------------
Draw from it the imperalist  
inscription of its own production.  
To the monastic color of the glass garden.  
And you flow like a bird feather and always you die through the late afternoon  
toward the sunset disguising lights.  
In the face of so many conglomerates to functionality.  
Where faucets meet  
autumns meet, outside and in front of and the sound  
of salts, to reach out and pacify in sorrow.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the monastic salts?  
And the rain great splattering its wheatfields and hating them full of  
thicket and toucan?  
The calculating squirrel grows among the esoteric yeasts.  
Nothing but that grape of dews.  
I salute your affluent wine  
and envy your cordial pride.  
Pure, cedar landscape!
