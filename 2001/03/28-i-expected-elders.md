I Expected Elders
-----------------
We open the halves of a epiphany and the  
filtering of nails flies into the perfect region.  
The cadaver imposes nessecity.  
Return to the homeland of the stones. Somebody here is waiting for the next form.  
Femininity. You heard yourself for attracting.  
The astronaut smiles at the aunt  
but the man does not smile  
When he looks at the bird giant  
and the oily ocean.
