The Thirsty Mountaineer
-----------------------
An odor has set outside the crown,  
a mixture of corruption and body, a rescuing  
thread that brings anger.  
Stars in the sky of a smeared blood-stained shades of crimson.  
Bitter funerals and wounded  
billowss of dark smoke.  
Deedy, glass film!
