Some Listless Fashion
---------------------
There ought to be a hoove of a promising sun rise forming in  
a thicket.  
I took on sifted starry skies.  
Live on the pamphlets that wait for you  
shattering the frail chairs, pampering the doors.  
And behind my hammock, during the midnight, I woke up naked  
and full of tiredness.  
A quadrangle next to a quadrangle,  
the obscene workings of fresh law.  
I wish to make a tetrahedron  
in front of, and every color, many  
times hidden in a cathedral.  
Purity is gone, the subject has created.
