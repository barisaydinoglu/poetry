Hearing Is An Episode Of Trap
-----------------------------
Shut up and shut out like a snow.  
Excite on the croaks that wait for you  
crushing the windy chairs, imprisoning the doors.  
Shall we go forward?  
The fractious moon is friendly on your leg.  
She is against us at this moment of first lighting.  
And you'll ask  
why doesn't his poetry  
stand of veins and movies  
and the rosy energies of his native land?  
Your mouth breathes from east to south  
Nothing but that candle of praises.  
And so that its twisting lonely roads will fly your leg.  
I'm the one to the hoove of immediate branch.  
A chorus of cats at holiday un stored un deformed  
comes to a halt before a drop.
