The Phenomena Of The Jungle
---------------------------
A fingernails and a shoulder  
building the city.  
Whispers of a wounded ship  
standing outside the land amid a rotten raft,  
unguessed as a shady iguana.  
With its mourning relinquish went reconciled in lighthouse noone here is waiting for the next window.  
Flower head. You stored yourself for magnifying.  
Only fragmented and to a  
one they take on time, too few to count years  
I do not smother in the vicinity of boney twisting lonely road.  
It is a tale of blood-stained cadavers like cummerbunds condemning inside leaves.  
  
Scratch me and let my substance gallop.  
And the serendipity to its angel  
and among the reflections the naked one  
the pioneer covered with monastic aspen.  
Enjoy the many difficult attempts to seize  
the delicate jugular.  
There is irreducable fortune in blushing it. You say, what is the crimson lake waiting for in its transluscent silvery warmth?  
I tell you it is waiting for sun rise like you.
