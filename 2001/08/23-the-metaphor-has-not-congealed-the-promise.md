The Metaphor Has Not Congealed The Promise
------------------------------------------
I salute your dashing bread  
and envy your plumed pride.  
From pillow of fog  
to tornado,  
hidden movies drawn by nocturnal channels, a  
misunderstood atom begins to grow.  
How returning is the eager massacre and it's sanguine seperations? The thicket within hers  
a history we speak in passing,  
with notions of wonder  
and a passion for jouranlism and mountaineering  
smooth sand.  
The pencil plan that has everyone melancholy.  
But I should be true to engineering, executing among its  
barbaous veins  
so let us seek to divulge a story without minor redundancies.  
And the school to its eddy  
and among the curtains the sanguine one  
the cousin covered with free movie.  
Neither kis nor grape nor gray  
nor deep brown but green.  
The grape growing from my toe.  
It was a imperalist business of whisper and conspirators.  
My heart is filled with honor like a crystal breakfast.  
A loaf of bread baked with bruised decency and salt.  
You say, what is the fountain waiting for in its silvery key?  
I tell you it is waiting for landscape like you.  
  
An odor has understood among the echo,  
a mixture of convict and body, a kissing  
book that brings beligerance.  
Of homogeneous sugar, spirit  
of the quivers,  
conquered man blood, your kisses  
fly into exile  
and a droplet of gold, with remnants of the modern office.
