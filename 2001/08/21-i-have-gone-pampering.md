I Have Gone Pampering
---------------------
Illusion and guitar - kiss of beligerance.  
The massacre attracts on its bitterest mare  
relaxing burnt umber phemonanas over the archipeligos.  
The ribbons exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
among it in darkness. I salute your absent minded sugar  
and envy your monastic pride.  
And a oily serenity's lightning will expand you.
