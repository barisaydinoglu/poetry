Setting The Heart In Motion
---------------------------
In the face of so many brambles to functionality.  
Once there was a negligent pioneer who  
loved at parties, sitting in a circle, among lighthouses.  
Because I love you, love, next to the earth and outside the wind.  
Of a turqoise bride that recovers reflections.
