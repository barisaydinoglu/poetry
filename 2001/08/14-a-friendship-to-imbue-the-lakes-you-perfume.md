A Friendship To Imbue The Lakes You Perfume
-------------------------------------------
Amid the chaining violences.  
And within my hammock, during the sunrise, I woke up naked  
and full of decency.  
Lady of the depths of my fingernails - your performing  
stills your cosmic regard as though it were ice.  
What is this metaphor but a memory died of its essences?  
The order of the doves an odor has protected against the angel,  
a mixture of moth and body, a rustling  
utensil that brings animosity.
