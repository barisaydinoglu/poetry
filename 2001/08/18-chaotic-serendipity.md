Chaotic Serendipity
-------------------
Be guided by the solute defender  
's candle. The I in awe and a inevitable acrobat's ice will breathe you.  
Our new nature, our pure stone lines.  
And meetings of ghostly hips some shower but I grow your iron like planetarium.  
Went enchanted in circus you create in the city as in an angellic sea.
