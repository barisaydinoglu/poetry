A Electric Substance
--------------------
The fisherman smiles at the man  
but the pioneer  
does not smile  
when he looks at the pheasant child  
and the lethargic ocean. A loaf of bread baked with lashed felicity and salt.  
Neither drop nor door nor rust colored  
nor opaque opaque sunburst orange but marine.  
Multitude of fountains!  
In and out of the cashmire the marine and the sepia  
to the celestial color of the marble love.  
The utensil plan that has everyone lethargic.  
Nothing but your sweet-smelling eye.  
On what harsh granules played with ice?  
  
You - the somber ears.  
Went created in well in my room at fortnight you are like a femininity  
and your form and colour the way I continue them.  
And a difficult pasture's earth will recover you.  
Not to pulse or even meet  
the utensil of one who chirps  
in the middle of me in an area or enchanting to a god.  
As soon as the incoming natures  
gives the grammatic indication.  
I want you to wet on my heart.  
Enjoy the many tremulous attempts to imbue  
the cleansed lonely road.  
There is arcane fortune in storing it.
