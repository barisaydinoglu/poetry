I Have Gone Swimming
--------------------
We open the halves of a mysteries and the  
decaying of stenches appreciates into the slender city.  
Conversations of ripples, the recitation  
of railroad tracks we call incredulous miracle.  
My heart is filled with wonder like a chalk poppy.  
The lightning incredulous moths are lunged.  
Return to the homeland of the faucets.
