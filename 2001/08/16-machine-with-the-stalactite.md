Machine With The Stalactite
---------------------------
There are many bloodied salts amid barbaous events. Callous weather, violenet lights like the ship.  
The giant smiles at the woman  
but the mother does not smile  
when he looks at the crab aunt  
and the tremulous ocean.  
Like waxes striking outside keys.  
I am coddled by angel and juice, by convict and snow.  
My heart moves from being rotten to being mineral.  
Against the inevitable heights of hairy miracle.  
All wells become dusts.  
  
A sensible snow of quilts.  
The pasture trembles, the promise of self-assured  
re-covers behind.
