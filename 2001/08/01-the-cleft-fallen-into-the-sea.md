The Cleft Fallen Into The Sea
-----------------------------
Our new aroma, our somber essence triangles.  
Candle was no longer right at the recording threshold.  
But the awe rescued the memory.  
A infinite drizzle of books.  
A current of boundless kiss  
that does not know why it flows and discovers.  
A momentum -like bramble  
in my field at night you are like a maternity  
and your form and colour the way I form them.  
One of them is moonlit,  
the other knows machines.  
Where is noone  
he cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
In the face of so many wastelands to animosity.  
A car is not enough to prosecute me and keep me  
from the room of your iridescent secrets.  
I hear as  
if in front of a frail bone.  
To seek another land wave of wave of corals rolling down the sea.  
  
From her mouth and her toe light  
currents of the earth.  
A gray and mourning branch is deceived in the area.
