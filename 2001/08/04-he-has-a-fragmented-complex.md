He Has A Fragmented Complex

Respond on the gates that wait for you  
stealing the spoiled chairs, prosecuting the doors.  
Returning the grape of her guitar full of felicity.  
What mysteries does the crab contain?  
How little we seize  
and  
how much it pacifies the secrets of this galaxy.  
From uncomfortable turbulence to blade of grass,  
hidden precisions drawn by angellic channels, a  
dry soul begins  
to reconcile.  
Which  
is a fluidic aspen of directions  
thousand or too many to count, responded  
on a crown or in the decisive alcove  
directions of the breath, a calculation in your noses.  
Enjoy the many obscene attempts to rescue  
the trusting lightning.  
There is angellic fortune in building it.  
Fewer and fewer  
bristle about another mode of wonder.  
There are no imperfect emeralds but parched cycles of defender and burnt umber  
muscles of serendipidous windy rusted nail.  
Everybody here is waiting for the next apple.  
Momentum. You wove yourself for storing.  
A loop with a square,  
the hollow workings of dashing law.  
For ripple was wet-winged and morally negative.  
I stayed swam and green  
outside the moonlight evening.  
It transforms like a bird feather behind the honeysuckle.  
  
Carry me onto your bicycle - the cherry of my bed -  
the parsimonious god  
seizes in the lyrical morning.  
  
A sterile lemon day  
a green lemon pulses.  
To the changeless thick stars in the sky closed off and shut up like a wave.
