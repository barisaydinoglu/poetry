She Has A Mourning Complex
--------------------------
Rustling a cathedral  
blushed in the eager drizzle. A wet-winged aspen day  
the imperalist trouser is eager on your tail. It was the afternoon of the squirrel.  
Of your turqoise foam when you hold out your ears.  
The weak sweetnes that sets  
in your utensil.  
For a day, maybe three hundred,  
I rested under a tornado  
at a bus stop, waiting for the daughter to be among.  
Halfway.  
  
It was the early light of day of the oyster.  
A circle with a circle,  
the crooked workings of moonlit law.
