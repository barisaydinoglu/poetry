A Song Of Felicity
------------------
It was a disintered business of corruption and walls. There are no billows of dark smoke but tenacious cycles of smooth stone and silvery  
sepia lakes of friendly boney broken glass.  
Legumes of a neon vessel  
reconciling around the field outside a disordered wheel,  
myriad as a careless toucan.  
With the protesting stains.
