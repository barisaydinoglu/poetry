There Is No Corpse
------------------
From ocean wave to blade of grass,  
hidden wells drawn by parenthetical channels, a  
furious time begins to tread.  
Knave of a conquered dilute mosaic.  
Once there was a crooked elder who  
stood at parties, sitting in a square, among guitars.  
Nothing but that map of wine bottles.  
The serene dignity of the dove!  
Enjoy the many raucous attempts to dawn  
The esoteric bramble.  
There  
is iridescent fortune in playing it.
