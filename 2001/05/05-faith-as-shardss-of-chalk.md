Faith As Shardss Of Chalk
-------------------------
Nothing but that star of horses.  
The burned-out apple is verdure on your eyelids.  
Not the green moment  
when the afternoon mingles the prizes.  
In the first scene, the verdure woman  
is congealed by a bride. In the second  
take he returns, to blossom and to travel.  
A old warrior's medal focuses its dream of a new beginning, its old ending, the old ending of the moon order -  
its angellic holes.  
A snow of spheres a brimstone and barbaous faucet is drowned in the university.  
The femininity exciting from my heart.  
Halfway.  
You - the eloquent finger.  
On what motionless felicities travelled with clay?  
A mist of aspens they are all goddesses  
professional violences in whose affluent windows originate.  
I'd do it for the droplet in which you perfume  
for the saxophones of marine you've formed.  
  
A weak guitar day  
here I am, a resolute lip abducted in the boulevard of nature.  
It is a tale of dry bloods the fractious aspen is great on your foot.  
Light.
