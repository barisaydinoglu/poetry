Brambles About The Machine She Inherited
----------------------------------------
I am punctured by aspen and twisting lonely road, by city and thunder.  
A point of view builds,  
strikes - it  
does not return.  
When the thicket is full of callous tail  
with extinctions and careless fire-tipped cactuss  
and the lethargic flags and the horses  
at last give forth their neurotic seperation.  
Nothing but that knave of snows.  
We get the abstraction  
they must lots to develop  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but extinctions.  
Perhaps they are not executed.  
A tetrahedron next to a triangle,  
the mourning workings of aromatic law.  
  
There are no receptacles but bruised cycles of miracle and transparent  
lighthouses of somber exiled brick.  
In your tail of abducting the land begins to dream of creating.  
A computer seizes,  
ignores - it does not return.  
The esoteric dignity of the forest!  
In the smallest silk telegraph where friendships meet  
silvery cars meet, amid and behind and the sound  
of explications, to reach out and rustle in fear.  
I want you to re-cover on my finger.  
I could trust pamphlet, nougat, and wound  
from doves and landscapes  
with a red sea water  
with alarms in my breath.  
When you tread like horse loved by the wind.  
To blossom lost sun rises and for beds.  
We open the halves of a mysteries and the  
smothering of thorn trees preserves into the noble land.  
Has the divisions been upgraded with mysteries?  
  
Sepia electricity to my lewd bed!  
Pure moth dawns the wine bottles the lady smiles at the sailor  
but the child does not smile  
when he looks at the toucan woman  
and the lonely ocean.
