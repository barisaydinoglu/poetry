It Promised With Landscapes
---------------------------
I stayed upgraded and green  
behind the land.  
A spoiled leaf day  
a chorus of iguanas at morning un shone un undulated  
comes to a halt before a heart.  
A wheel is not enough to wipe me and keep me  
from the field of your stationary funny things.  
Sometimes a piece of the water  
protests like a stone in my ears.  
A clear snow of pencils.  
Morose weather, frightened lights like the serenity.  
Cashmire  
and  
great sailor,  
cities of a crooked train  
upgrading among the area among a decadent helicopter,  
domestic as a wounded tiger.  
And the warmth of your body to its garden  
and among the leaves the verdure one  
the sailor covered with solute stalks of cattail.  
The early light of day beds you in its mortal earth.  
The human daughter  
reflects in the esoteric morning.  
A current of profound saxophone  
that does not know why it flows and connects.  
Evening star.  
Against the whirlwinds of hat, many decadent traps.  
A propeller focuses its dream of a beginning, its new beginning, the ending of the sun rise order -  
its noble torrents.  
A eyelids and a eyelids  
entertaining the land.  
But the land continued the memory.  
  
And so that its funerals will lunge your shoulder.  
In the face of so many serections to functionality.
