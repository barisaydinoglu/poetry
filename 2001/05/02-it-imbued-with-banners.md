It Imbued With Banners
----------------------
One of them is scrupulous,  
the other knows metaphors.  
Where is somebody  
she says, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
In the smallest gem root if you were not the orange the real moon  
cooks, sprinkling its orange across the land.  
I am devoured by land and wounded soldier, by imbroglio and sunshine.  
Your leg hears from east to north  
like the tenacious aluminum of hats of your ultraviolet moon when you hold out your brain.  
In my university at fortnight you are like a reflection  
and your form and colour the way I begin them.  
The I in movie next to the passing ashes.  
How attracting is the celestial depth and it's decisive panics?  
Always you invade through the twilight  
toward the holiday attacking movies.  
  
A chorus of iguanas at  
late afternoon un  
protected un crushed  
comes to a halt before a foam.  
With its dead entertain when the jungle is full of rabid arm  
amid torrents and furious rotten starry skies  
and the insufferable books and the starry skies  
at last give forth their inevitable imbroglio.
