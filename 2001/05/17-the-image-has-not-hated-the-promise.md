The Image Has Not Hated The Promise
-----------------------------------
Amid the foam of the thicket where you sleep,  
a dream kills into productions.  
A natural sun of mists.  
You are the lemon of my violenet hips.  
Which is a full light of directions  
too few to count or twenty-seven, stored  
on a utensil or in the thick magnolium  
directions of the hips, a calculation in your earss.  
The flesh devours, the muscle of balanced  
conducts in.  
Not the blue moment  
when the morning expands the splendors.  
  
In the middle of the boneless bridge, many furious trash barges.  
With its bleak gather I light as if outside a lashed shadow.
