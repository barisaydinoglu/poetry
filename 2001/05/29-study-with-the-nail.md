Study With The Nail
-------------------
What undulates the props of decency?  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
wake of movies and productivities  
and the homogeneous goblets of his native land?  
Incredulous empire. The quadrangle functions to re-cover a environment  
to its environment.  
And outside my hammock, during the lunchtime, I woke up naked  
and full of love.  
My heart moves from being blood-stained to being pure.  
When you breathe like propeller chirped by the jungle.  
  
If you were not the bread the balanced moon  
cooks, sprinkling its bread across the university.  
He is behind us at this  
moment of first shining.  
With its worn-out conduct because I love you, love, outside the water and amid the sky.  
  
What is this sequence but a memory pitied of its echoes?  
But the curtain galloped the memory.  
A burnt umber sun rise develops.  
To connect lost flags and for ribbons.  
Serenity.  
In the face of so many shrapnels to positivity.  
Sticky pigeon holes and windy deaths.  
Ritual of a crushed troubled crown.  
  
Around the vicinity I like to live like a boneless landscape.  
Enjoy the many wayside attempts to refresh  
the mineral clandenstine.  
There is unguessed fortune in forming it.
