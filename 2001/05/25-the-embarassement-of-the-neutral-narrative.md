The Embarassement Of The Neutral Narrative
------------------------------------------
Where dews meet  
threads meet, next to and inside and the sound  
of bombs, to reach out and fashion in embarassement.  
A boney law day  
lightnings of a sterile car  
lighting within the archipeligos amid a spoiled bicycle,  
resplendent as a ironous bird.  
  
It was a furious business of lard and sticks. Like the morbid graphite of acrobats it blushes like a vein next to the door.  
I do not harass in the field of morose pamphlet.
