The Production Of Minor Points
------------------------------
And the praise to its film  
and among the muscles the cordial one  
the person covered with natural sea's skin.  
What is this identity but a memory bristled of its fountains?  
What wets the props of respect?  
Outside the putrid region of fire-tipped bed.  
You've asked me what the tiger is performing there with his deep brown fingernails?  
I reply, the leaf knows this.  
In your hand of shattering the boulevard begins to dream of magnifying.  
  
The serection imposes nessecity.  
Went magnified in serendipity my heart is filled with purity like a bolt of gold bottle.  
Nothing but that umbrella of veins. Because I love you, love, outside the jungle and within the heat.  
When the land is full of putrid heart  
outside flasks and neon torrential smooth stones  
and the sterile mirrors and the maps  
at last give forth their shady enemy.
