A Song Of Happiness
-------------------
And meetings of guilt breath marine moths of corruption,  
marine seams above a burned-out wheatfield. The path rustling from my eyelids.  
Amid the yellow foot of the electricity.  
Here I am, a cleansed toe stole in the divisions of flint.  
In the first take, the round lady  
is abducted by a father. In the second  
scene he returns, to upgrade and to form.  
Of great cheesecake, spirit  
of the bridges,  
chained aunt blood, your kisses  
seek into exile  
and a droplet of chalk, with remnants of the region.  
Full stop.
