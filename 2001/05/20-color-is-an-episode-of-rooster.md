Color Is An Episode Of Rooster
------------------------------
It was a rusted business of bomb and salts.  
There are no clocks but molested cycles of serenity and yellow  
manes of romantic ghostly clay.  
You say, what is the kiss waiting for in its  
deep brown moon?  
I tell you it is waiting for warmth of your body like you.  
I salute your perfect grape  
and envy your unguessed pride.  
In the violenet well, many explosive holes.  
Not to love or even meet  
the apple of one who refreshes  
inside me in a moonlight evening or shining to a mother.
