The Trapdoor Fallen Into The Sea
--------------------------------
The divisions outside hers  
a history we tell in passing,  
with notions of decency  
and a passion for mountaineering and jouranlism  
a fractious point of view impales  
even the original  
individual archipeligos in synonym  
to which  
the metaphor  
will not be formed.  
We get the faith  
they must lots to shine  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but depths.  
Perhaps they are not decayed.  
You say, what is the opaque sepia lake waiting for in its opaque crimson necklace?  
I tell you it is waiting for stars in the sky like you.  
Realized infinite telegraph amid the grace of the area where you sleep,  
a dream prosecutes into images.
