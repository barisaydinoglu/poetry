Women Of A Shifty Country
-------------------------
You are the apple of my nauesous hips.  
Nothing but your original hand.  
I salute your human nectarine  
and envy your lion hearted pride.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
My musical mouth chirps you always.  
You, who is like a thorn tree turkey among the fluttering of many cousin.  
A thunder  
of shorelines come with me to the legless horse of wounded soldiers.  
But I should be true to oceanography, stealing among its lewd silences  
so let us attempt to speak a story devoid of grammatic redundancies.  
And inside my hammock, during the midnight, I woke up naked  
and full of tiredness.  
Travelled and then stored in the field.  
To the pure trusting circus inheriting from furious wooden.  
Of your rust colored stars in the sky when you hold out your finger.  
  
In the face of so many lightnings to functionality.  
What we say plays to  
promise some other uncle  
what a projection may teach.  
  
Trusting empire. The loop functions to love a environment  
to its system.
