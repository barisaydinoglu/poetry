Your Hand Is Enough
-------------------
Putrid early light of day and the disintered perfume  
petrify at the walls of my house.  
Sincerity is gone, the subject has relinquished.  
Friendly empire. The triangle functions to re-cover an architecture  
to its environment.  
Living the cactus of her river full of respect.  
A loaf of bread baked with exiled honor and salt.  
In my city at night you are like a path  
and your form  
and colour the way I flow them.  
The disordered mist is hopeful on your hand.  
Here I am, a vertical nose forced in the divisions of splendor.  
  
The conspirator imposes nessecity.  
Drank and then perfumed in the universe.  
Towards those veins of yours that wait for me.  
Perch on the legless horses  
that wait for you  
deforming the hollow chairs, rejecting the doors.
