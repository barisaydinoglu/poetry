Tell Her That I Am Giving Up Rustling In Machines
-------------------------------------------------
Multitude of shorelines!  
In and out of the cinnamon the marine and the opaque deep brown  
So the acerb tiredness lives on in a fruit,  
the cleansed house of the salt,  
the self-assured circus that is wonderful and perfect.  
I stayed discovered and sand-colored  
in the land.  
Only old warrior's medal, just the  
ribbon, nothing but  
it. Peace.  
Pockets of metal converted into ceramic.  
Carry me onto your wheel - the lemon of my bed -  
I want you to refresh on my curves.  
And you replaced in the agony and travelled a depriving trash barge.  
The sea water attacks, the door of indespensable  
returns in.  
  
Around the region I like to wake like a disordered book.  
You are the fruit of my raucous  
eye.  
For sun rise was frightened and morally neutral.  
In the middle of the delirious field of boneless current.  
As if to fall or reconcile or brainwash.  
An odor has trod in the bed,  
a mixture of receptacle and body, a fluttering  
foliage that brings embarassement.  
Has the jungle been lighted with secrets?
