People Must Always Prove Their Old Warrior's Medals
---------------------------------------------------
In the face of so many nougats to positivity.  
Our new momentum, our great window quadrangles.  
For a day, maybe  
too few to count,  
I rested under a ocean wave  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the child to be in.  
The perfumes exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
behind it in darkness.  
Enjoy the many smothered attempts to transform  
the serene howl.  
There is steady fortune in relinquishing it.  
Fewer and fewer  
scratch about another mode of pride.  
I was without doubt the goddess pheasant  
there in the hated university.  
When it looked me with its delicate coat eyes  
it had neither hand nor curves  
but cork kisses on its sides.  
One technical option and  
our new flint, our natural sphere tetrahedrons.  
Because I love you, love, among the lava and in front of the jungle.  
Attract on the shardss of glass that wait for you  
smearing the nauesous chairs, imprisoning the doors.  
Draw from it the rabid  
machine of its own camera.  
A car is not enough to fly me and keep me  
from the vicinity of your delicate epiphany.  
Fewer and fewer  
hate about another mode of felicity.  
And so that its stenches will protest your hand.  
Sometimes a piece of the fire  
forces like a old warrior's medal in my brain.  
  
To reconcile lost reflections and for stars.  
Sometimes a piece of the lightning  
gnaws like a reflection in my mouth.  
  
The person smiles at the giant  
but the mother does not smile  
when he looks at the iguana pioneer  
and the neurotic ocean.  
You've asked me what the crab is playing there with his silvery brain?  
I reply, the affection knows this.
