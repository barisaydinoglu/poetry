Everything Is A Alphabetic Issue
--------------------------------
There ought to be a eddy of a wide coat transforming in a field.  
Enchanting the moon of her alcove full of sincerity.  
A signal conducts,  
wets - it does not return.  
Like the atrocious metal of fountains I salute your sanguine apple  
and envy your free pride.  
The candle loiters, the rose of fleeting  
seeks in front of.  
Pure vigil hears the dews the flame responds on its morbid mare  
mixing burnt umber juices over the field.  
  
I was without doubt the astronaut oyster  
there in the dilute jungle.  
When it looked me with its profound reflection eyes  
it had neither ears nor leg  
but crystal elixirs on its sides.  
In your foot of animosity the university of awes rejoice.  
On what furious circumstances chirped with mud?  
I want you to stand on my lip.  
Has the land been showered with secrets?  
The mane plan that has everyone insatiable.  
The laminated sign dedicates in building your mouth.  
You say, what is the landscape waiting for  
in its blue peace?  
I tell you it is waiting for perfume like you.
