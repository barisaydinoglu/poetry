An Equally Humble One
---------------------
Nothing but that elixir of flutes.  
Neither current nor lunar nor blood colored  
nor  
silvery but deep brown.  
It is a tale of directionless yeasts a machine for metaphor is the lack thereof.  
And the kiss to its alcove  
and among the moons the plumed one  
the one covered with irreducable land.  
Lethargic gods  
and custodians.  
For me they are aerial.  
But I should be untrue to mountaineering, taunting among its exiled smooth stones  
so let us attempt to speak a story devoid of neutral redundancies.  
  
Shining toward the springtime a current of myriad dew  
that does not know why it flows and transforms.  
Only curtain, just the  
sea's skin, nothing but  
it. Apple.
