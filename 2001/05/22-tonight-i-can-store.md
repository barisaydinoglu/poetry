Tonight I Can Store
-------------------
Nothing but that river bank of warmths of your body.  
A phenomenon for projection is the lack thereof.  
Some store but I fashion your metal like mist.  
To the hidden color of the copper lunar.  
Come with me to the explication of invasions.  
Hated astronauts and elders.  
For me they are slightest.  
The echo plan that has everyone phosphorus.  
And meetings of hated eyelids and umbrellas and doves.  
Nothing but your acerb breath.  
  
You, who is like a dominion tiger among the reflecting of many one.
