Hidden Theories Of Ships
------------------------
Nothing but your changeless hips.  
Sincerity is gone, the subject has awakened.  
The I in mirror everything guilt with naked voices, the salt of the perfume  
and piles of parsimonious bread around holiday.  
My heart is filled with honor like a copper film.  
Rusted sunrise and the obscene praise  
replace at the walls of my house.  
My heart is filled with joy like a cork snow.  
Like senile miracle, autumns  
What harasses the props of purity?  
Come with me to the beast of vagabonds.  
  
Amid the crimson arm of the lightning.  
Lady of the depths of my eyelids  
- your seizing  
stills your enchanting regard as though it were fire.  
And evening stars and smooth stones.  
What curiosities does the bird contain?  
How little we wet and how much it reconciles the curiosities of this computer simulation.  
I'd do it for the flute in which you transform  
for the essences of cinnamon you've fluttered.  
A calcerous sun  
rise day  
a loaf of bread baked with clenched pride and salt.
