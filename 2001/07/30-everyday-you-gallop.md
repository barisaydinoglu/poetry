Everyday You Gallop
-------------------
Fewer and fewer  
puncture about another mode of wonder.  
My heart moves from being torrential to being scrupulous.  
A cashmire well understands.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem  
so to another.  
An odor has relaxed outside the laminated sign,  
a mixture of complaint and body, a discovering  
leaf that brings agony.  
What petrifies the props of wonder?  
  
Treading a necklace  
fluttered in the warm rain.
