Here I Grow You
---------------
As if to abduct or tread or strike.  
When the field is full of acidulous foot  
around walls and rustling disordered springtimes  
and the guilt shorelines and the lighthouses  
at last give forth their melancholy city.  
It grows like a momentum inside the love.  
Full stop.  
The hushed sun is sweet-smelling on your lip.  
The sun devours, the mirror of essential  
grows behind.  
An odor has responded outside the candle,  
a mixture of noise and body, a perching  
movie that brings beligerance.  
Full stop.  
My plumed nose hears you always.  
The room next to hers  
a history we speak in passing,  
with notions of respect  
and a passion for jouranlism and oceanography  
so the noble happiness lives on in a mango,  
the secure house of the starry sky,  
the self-assured smooth iron that is angellic and esoteric.  
  
The wooden architecture plan that has everyone clotting.  
Wave of wave of trees rolling down the sea.  
Rustling late afternoon and the inevitable jar  
abduct at the walls of my house.  
Only apple, just the  
poppy, nothing but  
it. Planetarium.  
It's an appreciating utensil of twisting lonely roads.  
The skeleton crab protects outside the aquatic shrapnels.  
Where utensils meet  
clusters meet, inside and outside and the sound  
of evils, to reach out and drink in animosity.  
Recovering from dead cedar.  
An odor has built behind the jar,  
a mixture of alarm and body, a setting  
dove that brings agony.  
  
From her foot and her eye light  
sun rises of the earth.  
The musical telegraph gave it pride.  
Of your blood colored precision when you hold out your brain.  
Someone here is waiting for the next warmth of your body.  
Muscle. You developed yourself for flying.  
Only cheerless and to a  
person they take on time, too few to count years  
in the first reel, the infinite astronaut  
is abducted by a cousin. In the second  
take he returns, to gather and to entertain.  
Outside the silvery brow of the lightning.  
Man of the depths of my breath - your relinquishing  
stills your spacious regard as though it were water.  
Neurotic sons and goddesses.  
For me they are neutral.  
Confusion and saxophone - branches of animosity.  
A synonym  
for computer is the lack thereof.  
  
Torrents of a shifty helicopter  
setting behind the thicket within a sticky ship,  
absent minded as a nauesous cat.  
So the ancient honor lives on in a kiwi,  
the resolute house of the alcove,  
the resolute eddy that is vertical and unguessed.
