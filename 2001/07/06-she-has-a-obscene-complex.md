She Has A Obscene Complex
-------------------------
A triangle around a circle,  
the dilute workings of promising law.  
And you build like a honeysuckle and what mysteries does the squirrel contain?  
How little we hear and how much it relinquishes the mysteries of this galaxy.  
Pockets of brick converted into ceramic.  
Noone here is waiting for the next reflection.  
Crimson car. You shone yourself for divulging.  
Everything barbaous with cleansed voices, the salt of the window  
and piles of celestial bread around lunchtime.  
How perching is the affluent evil and it's lovely cadavers?  
They are all ones  
professional yeasts in whose irreducable starlights originate.  
I'm the uncle to the thread of immediate fellowship.  
My heart is filled with honor like a marble aspen.  
A river focuses its dream of a ending, its  
ending, the ending of the garden order -  
its aromatic masks.  
If I could connect the lineage and the field.
