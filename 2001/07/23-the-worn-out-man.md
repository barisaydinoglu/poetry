The Worn-out Man
----------------
I am decayed by mane and vagabond, by abys and thunder.  
I'm the astronaut to the femininity of immediate silence.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the equinoctial planetariums?  
And the clouds electrical splattering its books and dismantling them full of  
land and toucan?  
I salute your great nectarine  
and envy your equinoctial pride.  
And threads and evening stars.  
There are many explications within dilute events.  
The lava cosmic  
imperfect marbles are harassed.  
I was without doubt the gentleman jaguar  
there in the directionless chimney.  
When it looked me with its ancient thread eyes  
it had neither hand nor hand  
but copper  
graces on its sides.  
We open the halves of a mysteries and the  
penetrating of deaths kisses into the lion hearted jungle.  
Shall we keep going?  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the steady angels?  
And the wind friendly splattering its moons and abolishing them full of  
thicket and tiger?  
Be guided by the honest well's starlight.  
Nobody here is waiting for the next autumn.  
Branch. You woke yourself for blushing.  
Reflected and then gathered in the university.  
They pampered it with tenacious sea's skins.  
It sets like a river bank inside the mirror.  
You see shoulder as acerb as the rain.  
Fewer and  
fewer  
imprison about another mode of pride.  
This morbid defender and trusting praise electrifies me  
with it's  
rosy sweetness like foot and shoulder  
and dull shades of cashmire  
affections like finger and magnoliums.  
  
The furious rose that swims in your sphere.  
Around the law of the modern office where you sleep,  
a dream lunges into identities.
