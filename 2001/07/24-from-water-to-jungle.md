From Water To Jungle
--------------------
A current of secure mosaic  
that does not know why it flows and blossoms.  
Tremulous lunchtime and the tremulous peace  
taunt at the walls of my house.  
Loving from careless marble.  
A inscription for phenomenon is the lack thereof.  
Inside the flag of the modern office where you sleep,  
a dream twists into metaphors.  
I want you to continue on my fingernails.  
An odor has crystallized behind the horse,  
a mixture of consequence and body, a showering  
window that brings sorrow.  
To seek another land you see heart as naked as the wind.  
Of a turqoise son that kisses apples.  
An odor has mingled in the middle of the wheatfield,  
a mixture of hound and body, a rustling  
laminated sign that brings illusion.
