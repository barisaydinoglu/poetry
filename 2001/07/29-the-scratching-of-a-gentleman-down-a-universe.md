The Scratching Of A Gentleman Down A Universe
---------------------------------------------
Some swim but I shine your broken glass like quilt.  
As if to attack or entertain or condemn.  
Like cheerless snow, knaves  
a plumed wood paneling making a sensible thing of a chance meeting with a woman.  
So the human pride lives on in a mango,  
the sensible house of the railroad track,  
the eager ship that is romantic and starry.  
And meetings of pale ears not the blue moment  
when the sunrise shines the times. Nobody here is waiting for the next ritual.  
Old warrior's medal. You grew yourself for showering.
