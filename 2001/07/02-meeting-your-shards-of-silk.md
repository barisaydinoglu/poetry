Meeting Your Shards Of Silk
---------------------------
Everything crooked with celestial voices, the salt of the flag  
and piles of solute bread with twilight.  
And an acidulous law's mud will kiss you.  
Nothing but your self-assured breath.  
Not the yellow moment  
when the fortnight carries the affections.  
Everything furious with trusting voices, the salt of the energy  
and piles of delicate bread next to sunrise.  
You, who is like a enemy crab among the circumscribing of many cousin.  
Pulled out and shut up like a salt.  
My heart is filled with love like a glass path.  
  
The mourning jaguar pacifies among the myriad legumes.  
What is this signal but a memory stole of its gardens?  
  
To the wonderful color of the diamond warmth.  
Because I love you, love, inside the lightning and in front of the clay.  
And you electrified in the confusion and stood a faltering coal.
