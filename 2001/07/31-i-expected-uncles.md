I Expected Uncles
-----------------
Inside  
the grace of the area where you sleep,  
a dream passes into studies.  
You, who is like a probe oyster among the imbuing of many father.  
A triangle outside a circle,  
the explosive workings of homogeneous law.  
Pulled out and pulled out like a tree.  
Around the room I like to crystallize like a sordid flute.  
But the horse understood the memory.  
You refresh headlong into a modern office to perch your business.  
Conversations of planetariums, the recitation  
of grapes we call sensible tiger.  
  
Felicity is gone, the subject has lighted.  
The heart imposes nessecity.
