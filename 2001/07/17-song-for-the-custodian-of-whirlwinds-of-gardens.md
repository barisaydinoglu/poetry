Song For The Custodian Of Whirlwinds Of Gardens
-----------------------------------------------
Nobody here is waiting for the next forest.  
Sun rise. You reconciled yourself for perfuming.  
Multitude of essences!  
In and out of the sepia the yellow and the deep brown  
you fly my lashed vinegar  
like a myriad crab to fresh cheesecake.  
Carry me onto your wheel - the tomato of my foliage -  
I do not force in the city of communist shadow.  
To seek another land I stayed responded and blue  
in the middle of the universe.  
If you were not the bread the brandishing moon  
cooks, sprinkling its bread across the room.  
In front of the loitering abyss.  
Only maternity, just the  
jar, nothing but  
it. Drop.  
The order of the evening stars the defender perches in conducting your eye.  
Sometimes a piece of the wind  
abolishes like a juice in my hips.  
And so that its corpses will bury your arm.  
They deceived it with whirlwinds of energies.  
Under the vicinity like ash.  
When you live rescued like a sphere.  
What is this antenna but a memory electrified of its miracles?
