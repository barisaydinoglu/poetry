Every Pioneer Is A Calculation
------------------------------
Scrupulous, silken  
umbrella!  
A window relinquishing will crystallize  
the fragmented electricity of a planet.  
Under the thicket like ash.  
You love my parched night  
like an affluent ostrich to fresh apple.  
Outside transluscent crimson water and cashmire flower heads. Only crown,  
just the  
lighthouse, nothing but  
it. Shades of burnt umber.  
Pockets of steel converted into paper-mache.  
One neutral option and towards those utensils of yours that wait for me.  
So the cleansed felicity lives on in a tomato,  
the unguessed house of the shades of sand-colored,  
the slender ritual that is domestic and starry.  
Understanding a miracle  
recovered in the indespensable thunder.  
With the kiss of the field where you sleep,  
a dream conquers into synonyms.  
Somebody here is waiting for the next sweetnes.  
Jar. You developed yourself for dawning.
