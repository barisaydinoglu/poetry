Faith As Dusts
--------------
But the lighthouse lived the memory.  
Like sordid cluster, jars  
they are all people  
professional pigeon holes in whose enchanting forests originate.  
In the frightened defender, many  
rotten vaginas.  
Shut out and shut out like an awe.  
There are many gates within morose events.  
What phenomena does the squirrel contain?  
How little we return and how much it lights the funny things of this galaxy.  
We open the halves of a curiosities and the  
harassing of wombs swims into the delicious moonlight evening.  
Wave of wave of currents rolling down the sea.  
The late afternoon hearts you in its mortal  
wind.  
The handsome starry sky gave it respect.  
As if to puncture or blush or smear.  
  
It is a tale of absurd moldy bananas a blue laminated sign rejoices.  
Wake on  
the extinctions that wait for you  
entangling the banal chairs, scratching the doors.  
The region around hers  
a story we divulge in passing,  
with notions of purity  
and a passion for oceanography and science  
to the sweet-smelling vertical awe you are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the cosmic snows?  
And the wind cleansed splattering its forms and devouring them full of  
heights and iguana?  
This frail propeller and making elixir condemns me  
with it's cleansed defenders like brain and ears  
and brimstone aromas like heart and pastures.  
Opaque blue nougats of error,  
transluscent cinnamon seams above a insufferable essence.  
A flute -like lard  
and a smothered grace's wind will awaken you.  
Among burnt  
umber water and transluscent transparent lakes.  
The tear stained form that dawns in your movie.  
A root focuses its dream of a beginning, its new ending, the new ending of the leaf order -  
its irreducable moldy bananas.
