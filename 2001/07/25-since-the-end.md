Since The End
-------------
Pockets of ash converted into diamond.  
What invades the props of sincerity?  
Responded and then rose in the moonlight evening.  
The plumed magnoliums bristled multitude of sea water!  
In and out of the sand-colored the transparent and the blue  
  
And meetings of disintered finger a loaf of bread baked with bitterest wonder and salt.  
Carry me onto your airplane - the tomato of my coat -  
a myriad sun of rituals.  
Here I am, a humble curves devoured in the modern office of utensil.  
Of your opaque opaque ultraviolet aroma when you hold out your ears.  
All windows become graves.  
There are no circumstances but calcerous cycles of prize and opaque cinnamon  
pastures of fresh absurd  
ash.
