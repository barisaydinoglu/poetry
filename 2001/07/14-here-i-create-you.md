Here I Create You
-----------------
A sordid mane day  
I took on ghostly starlights. And meetings of fractious brow I want you to understand on my foot.  
I wish to make a loop  
among, and every abstraction, many  
times hidden in a heart.  
What we say re-covers to  
gallop some other woman  
what a camera may teach.  
With its boneless recover only fellowship, just the  
movie, nothing but  
it. Telegraph.  
Lovely, silicon mirror!  
There ought to be a sweetnes  
of a lion hearted flag storing in a room.  
Some mingle but I carry your metal like praise.  
Inside yellow water and transluscent yellow lemons.
