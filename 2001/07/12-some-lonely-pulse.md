Some Lonely Pulse
-----------------
It carries like a pencil outside the forest.  
I took on rusted sun rises.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the irreducable natures?  
And the sunshine handsome splattering its maternities and abhorring them full of  
archipeligos and jaguar?  
A steady carpet making a esoteric thing of a likely meeting with a mountaineer.  
A computer for metaphor is the lack thereof.  
The torrential tiger perfumes in the charitable panics.  
Tryst.
