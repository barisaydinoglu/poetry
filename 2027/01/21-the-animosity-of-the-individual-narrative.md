The Animosity Of The Individual Narrative
-----------------------------------------
Putrid weather, sifted lights like the dew.  
Return to the homeland of the phemonanas.  
And the lemon to its dew  
and among the sea water the dashing one  
the mother covered with hopeful branch.  
A calculating camera chains  
even the loving  
historical field in study  
to which the metaphor  
will not be enchanted.  
The arcane dignity of the breakfast!  
Not the transparent moment  
when the morning crystallizes the momenta.  
  
Someone here is waiting for the next lighthouse.  
Planetarium. You trod yourself for making.  
Only insatiable and to a  
child they take on time, three hundred years  
the splendor  
rising from my hips.  
The railroad track rescuing from my ears.  
Blossoming a key  
enriched in the secure snow.  
It was the midnight of the turkey.  
They congealed it with fuming droplets.  
I was without doubt the lady turkey  
there in the shady area.  
When it looked me with its hopeful miracle eyes  
it had neither hand nor hips  
but ceramic trees on its sides.  
  
It was the fortnight of the pheasant.  
A current of great aroma  
that does not know  
why it flows and begins.
