Proof Of Angellic Hearing
-------------------------
A loaf of bread baked with guilt sincerity and salt. Of electrical wine, spirit  
of the elixirs,  
congealed one blood, your kisses  
refresh into exile  
and a droplet of silicon, with remnants of the moonlight evening.  
Torrents of a lashed boat  
seeking amid the archipeligos in a dry ship,  
mineral as a rotten pheasant.  
I wish to make a line  
next to, and every hearing, many  
times hidden in a starry sky.
