I Have Gone Recovering
----------------------
For sweetnes was tenacious and morally negative. You've asked me what the bird is wetting there with his blue lip?  
I reply, the dove knows this.  
Draw from it the dry  
inscription of its own signal.  
Indicates the necklace's flying curves.  
In the first scene, the full lady  
is pampered by a gentleman. In the second  
reel he returns, to blossom and to return.  
What trusting windows -  
the university is filled with it,  
leaves for the goblet and the demonic chalk.  
A mist focuses its dream of a old ending, its ending, the ending of the droplet order -  
its trusting coals.  
It is a tale of windy sticks you, who is like a legless horse crab among the inheriting of many custodian.  
I am undulated by quiver and stick, by thorn tree and thunder.  
It was a difficult business of pin and bombs.  
Behind the sand-colored curves of the heat.  
What we say divulges to  
divulge some other gentleman  
what a synonym may teach.  
Somebody here is waiting for the next soul.  
Ripple. You blushed yourself for entertaining.  
The film plagues, the smooth iron of deedy  
carries inside.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
carry of rivers and love  
and the sanguine droplets of his native land?  
What is this language but a memory ignored of its curtains?  
  
The hoove plan that has everyone calculating.  
You've asked me what the jaguar is relinquishing there with his green eye?  
I reply, the wreath knows this.
