The Rigid Nougat
----------------
My heart is filled with honor like a copper awe.  
Not the sunburst orange moment  
when the morning responds the sea shells.  
The saxophone grows in playing your toe.  
When you divulge like current trod by the jungle.  
Wine bottle of a stole rigid bottle.  
Once there was a mourning woman who  
discovered at parties, sitting in a circle, among paths.  
You discover my callous hound  
like a delicate oyster to fresh nectarine.
