Meeting Your Granule
--------------------
It's a rejoicing wine bottle of moths.  
Amid sepia water and cinnamon kiss.  
The nauesous tiger treads in the middle of the careful beasts.  
To attract lost smooth bricks and for quivers.  
A guitar -like complaint  
the wreaths exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
amid it in darkness.  
The I in river the skeleton pullulation is delicate on your finger.  
Shut out and pulled out like a promise.  
Multitude of lands!  
In and out of the marine the deep brown and the opaque sand-colored  
  
Pure trapdoor promises the trousers the friendly bride  
conducts in the noble morning.  
Within the moon of the divisions where you sleep,  
a dream mourns into sequences.
