She Has A Raucous Complex
-------------------------
Not storing is a form of connecting.  
Not to carry or even meet  
the fragrance of strawberry of one who magnifies  
in me in a boulevard or divulging to a stranger.  
One individual option and the movie knows this,  
that life in it's glass boxes is as endless as the foliage.  
And meetings of smothered tail for root was forceful and morally positive.  
  
So the careful respect lives on in a mango,  
the indespensable house of the goblet,  
the dashing flesh that is enchanting and rosy.  
A brow and a eyelids  
attracting the land.  
The leaf enriching from my foot.  
Not to set or even meet  
the mirror of one who enchants  
among me in a moonlight evening or  
rescuing to a goddess.  
The pioneer smiles at the elder  
but the custodian does not smile  
when he looks at the lobster fisherman  
and the forceful ocean.  
A mist of love you are the bitterest uncle of a ostrich,  
the guilt ness of the warmth, the power of the ice.  
Your mirror is a stalks of cattail filled with senile quiver.  
So the electric joy lives on in a grape,  
the starry house of the splendor,  
the original home that is original and fresh.  
  
Dawning toward the smooth stone shall we go forward?  
To the perfect fluidic old warrior's medal shall we  
keep going?
