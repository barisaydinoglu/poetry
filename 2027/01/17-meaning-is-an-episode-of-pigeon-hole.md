Meaning Is An Episode Of Pigeon Hole
------------------------------------
Fewer and fewer  
hate about another mode of decency.  
They smothered it with callous shadess of deep brown.  
Draw from it the sterile  
inscription of its own antenna.  
We open the halves of a epiphany and the  
imprisoning of deaths carries into the comfortable archipeligos.  
She is behind us at this moment of first connecting.  
A line outside a line,  
the clotting workings of wide law.
