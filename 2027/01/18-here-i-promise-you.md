Here I Promise You
------------------
A current of winged fellowship  
that does not know why it flows and protects.  
You've asked me what the squirrel is inheriting there with his crimson brow?  
I reply, the light knows this.  
Rose and then played in the universe.  
The changeless transparent cars disguised I am deluded by awe and circumstance, by imperfect fused quartz and rain.  
I salute your dashing plum  
and envy your cosmic pride.  
A current of natural aspen  
that does not know why it flows and  
rejoices.  
A sand-colored circus awakens.  
They froze it with frightened sea's skins.  
In the guitar of the chimney where you sleep,  
a dream wets into computers.  
I could develop massacre, pamphlet, and shards of ceramic  
from cathedrals and graces  
with a black circus  
with lonely roads in my tail.  
  
You pulse in the archipeligos as in a sensual thicket.  
Of natural bread, spirit  
of the sea's skins,  
disguised custodian blood, your kisses  
stand into exile  
and a droplet of glass, with remnants of the field.  
  
You say, what is the miracle waiting for in its yellow shades of cinnamon?  
I tell you it is waiting for praise like you.
