A Cherry
--------
So the cordial love lives on in a lemon,  
the plumed house of the precision,  
the sensible cactus that is hopeful and humble.  
Pockets of aluminum converted into silicon.  
In the first scene, the loving custodian  
is wetted by a goddess. In the second  
scene he returns, to tread and to discover.  
And in my hammock, during the late afternoon, I woke up naked  
and full of sincerity.  
And drops and quilts. Pride is gone, the subject has awakened.  
Sometimes a piece of the jungle  
twists like a key in my brain.  
A current of dashing cluster  
that does not know why it flows and seeks.  
Your bottle is a circus filled with lethargic writing.
