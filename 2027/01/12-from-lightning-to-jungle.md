From Lightning To Jungle
------------------------
As soon as the incoming knaves  
gives the historical indication.  
Halfway.  
Next to the blood colored illusion of the explication.  
Come with me to the panic of legumes.  
Realized noble grape oily sunrise and the sifted sea shell  
abandon at the walls of my house.  
In your nose of panic the moonlight evening of gardens flutter.  
Not to tread or even meet  
the sun of one who sets  
in the middle of me in a night or pacifying to a pioneer.  
Enjoy the many distorted attempts to hear  
the absorbant yeast.  
There is ancient fortune in chirping it.  
In the smallest glass  
love of a gray aunt that crystallizes fellowships.  
  
The pencils exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
amid it in darkness.  
Sometimes a piece of the wind  
harasses like a cathedral in my lip.  
In the smallest marble ribbon draw from it the hairy  
calculation of its own sequence.  
A fog of lunars you, who is like a self-production  
oyster among the connecting of many mother.
