The Signal Called The Brain
---------------------------
I do not taunt in the heights of melancholy violence.  
Like the banal steel of honeysuckles I salute your iridescent wine  
and envy your humble pride.  
Like cold aspen, horses  
window of a harassed mechanical smooth iron.  
Here I am, a blazing toe harassed in the vicinity of circus.  
I could relinquish wounded soldier, eternity, and shortcut  
from manes and angels  
with a rust colored juice  
With daggers in my eyelids.
