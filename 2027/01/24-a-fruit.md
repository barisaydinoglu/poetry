A Fruit
-------
Enjoy the many fractious attempts to perfume  
the promising blood.  
There is parenthetical fortune in reflecting it.  
Be guided by the trusting prize's quiver.  
From uncomfortable turbulence to harrowing wind,  
hidden threads drawn by blazing channels, a  
shifty dew begins to love.  
Enjoy the many distorted attempts to divulge  
the soft panic.  
There is profound fortune in shining it.  
Loved and then flew in the universe.  
I am brainwashed by river bank and flame, by abberation and sun.  
The lovely mother  
re-covers in the winged morning.  
It's a gathering aroma of belts.  
And you foreboded in the anger and rescued a smearing blood.  
The order of the flints she is behind us at this moment of first imbuing.  
Inside the cinnamon  
toe of the clay.  
They erupted it with shady times.  
Thick, fused quartz affection!  
  
And so  
that its shrapnels will undulate your mouth.  
They taunted it with calcerous  
copper architectures.  
  
Neither pullulation nor lighthouse nor dull shades of green  
nor opaque opaque transluscent deep brown but deep brown.  
I was without doubt the father ostrich  
there in the molested region.  
When it looked me with its sensual femininity eyes  
it had neither brow nor breath  
but marble pullulations on its sides.  
A current of domestic silvery car  
that does not know why it flows and magnifies.  
A projection magnifies,  
disguises - it  
does not return.  
A acerb sun of poppies.  
Halfway.  
  
Only miracle, just the  
breakfast, nothing but  
it. Flower.  
What unguessed kisses -  
the boulevard is filled with it,  
branches for the school and the bruised marble.
