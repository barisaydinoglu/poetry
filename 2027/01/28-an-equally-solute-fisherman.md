An Equally Solute Fisherman
---------------------------
Not the blue moment  
when the early light of day continues the farms.  
Be guided by the boundless kiss's root.  
Our new fountain, our starry serendipity loops.  
Nauesous weather, difficult lights like the foam.  
Disordered fishermen and elders.  
For me they are historical.  
Enchant on the deaths that wait for you  
twisting the furious chairs, faltering the doors.  
Where wheatfields meet  
doors meet, behind and outside and the sound  
of throats, to reach out and grow in sorrow.  
Nothing but your wonderful hand.  
The hole treads on its rotten mare  
chirping green quivers over the divisions.  
But the planetarium dedicated the memory.
