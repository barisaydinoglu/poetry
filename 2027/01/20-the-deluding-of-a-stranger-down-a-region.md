The Deluding Of A Stranger Down A Region
----------------------------------------
Outside the rigid city of calculating energy. As if to kill or mix or deform.  
You gallop slowly into an archipeligos to hear your business.  
You stand my cold rotten stump  
like a loving jaguar to fresh wine.
