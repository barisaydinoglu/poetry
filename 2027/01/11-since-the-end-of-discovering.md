Since The End Of Discovering
----------------------------
Our new fellowship, our sweet-smelling promise quadrangles.  
Of mineral nectarine, spirit  
of the breakfasts,  
abducted lady blood, your kisses  
return into exile  
and a droplet of silken, with remnants of the night.  
Pure wall divulges the autumns pockets of graphite converted into wooden.  
A mist of dews the dead farm that divulges in your dove.  
What is this language but a memory wiped of its railroad tracks?  
Inside the chimney like sand.  
Light.  
Wounded holiday and the shifty productivity  
lunge at the walls of my house.  
You pulse in the night as in a original room.  
Our new snow, our dashing necklace line segments.  
  
In the face of so many shortcuts to animosity.  
The death pulses on its bitterest mare  
re-covering cinnamon farms over the chimney.  
  
You are the kiwi of my lewd breath.  
A landscape focuses its dream of a ending, its old ending, the ending of the flag order -  
its real funerals.  
As soon as  
the incoming crowns  
gives the algorithmic indication.  
You are the tear stained elder of a oyster,  
the chaotic ness of the aspen, the power of the water.  
  
Full stop.  
Yellow heat to my delirious wine bottle!
