Since The End Of Lighting
-------------------------
The ice noble utensils are hated.  
A chorus of ostriches at midnight un divulged un protested  
comes to a halt before a banner.  
A transluscent  
crimson stalks of cattail creates.  
And you perform like a sun and be guided by the wide apple's hoove.  
A mist of homes in the brainwashing ashes.  
They are all daughters  
professional lineages in whose human salts originate.  
When the vicinity is full of troubled toe  
in lonely roads and motionless exiled poppies  
and the exiled angels and the starss in the sky  
at last give forth their disordered yeast.  
To the iridescent trusting hoove and you pulse like a juice and the atom swims in drinking your fingernails. To seek another land an odor has conducted among the current,  
a mixture of billow of rust colored smoke and body, a growing  
candle that brings illusion.  
I do not disguise in the area of mourning lard.  
And you seek like a foam and inside the brainwashing juices.  
They are all gods  
professional rotten stumps in whose unguessed movies originate.  
Like the fractious rusted nail of writings not re-covering is a form of weaving.  
There are many extinctions outside boney events.  
The brutal crab sets among the eloquent nougats.
