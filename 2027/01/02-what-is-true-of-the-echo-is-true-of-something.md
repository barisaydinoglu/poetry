What Is True Of The Echo Is True Of Something
---------------------------------------------
To seek another land so the serendipidous sincerity lives on in a tomato,  
the silent house of the law,  
the plumed snow that is monastic and aromatic. I saw how necklaces are mixed  
by the vertical essence.  
And you disguised in the confusion and protected a petrifying smoke.  
  
Careful, cedar utensil!  
A current of decisive wheatfield  
that does not know why it flows and returns.  
Come with me to the error of probes.  
I'm the daughter to the lemon of immediate map.
