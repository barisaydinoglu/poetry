Dedicating Morose Nostalgia
---------------------------
Nothing but your musical fingernails.  
Of parenthetical peach, spirit  
of the clusters,  
shook pioneer blood, your kisses  
excite into exile  
and a droplet of ceramic, with remnants of the modern office.  
Transparent moths of dung,  
cinnamon seams above a thirsty fountain.  
Continuing the maternity of her grace full of decency.  
I pacify as if in front of a rabid cold fire.  
To seek another land she is in us at this moment of first weaving.  
The reasons for my respect  
are pulsed in my tail of gold.  
And meetings of decadent fingernails  
a brow and a mouth  
pacifying the boulevard.  
Cousin of the depths of my tail - your preserving  
stills your deedy regard as though it were clay.  
Noone here is waiting for the next knave.  
Glass architecture. You perched yourself for promising.  
  
Full stop.  
To the absent minded friendly ripple the sifted film that gathers in  
your wave.
