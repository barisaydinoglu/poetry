A Wave To Blossom The Sun Rises You Live
----------------------------------------
There are no seperations but fragmented cycles of bed and sand-colored  
apples of loving lewd brick.  
Not enchanting is a form of perching.  
As if to faint or live or plague.  
Exciting  
the wine bottle of her juice full of honor.  
Pure shrapnel connects the juices I wish to make a triangle  
among, and every faith, many  
times hidden in a tiger.  
Return to the homeland of the angels.  
Sepia and verdure elder,  
a sensible linoleum making a wonderful thing of a likely meeting with an aunt.
