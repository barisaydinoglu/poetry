The Sequence Of Overtone Points
-------------------------------
I salute your trusting wine  
and envy your winged pride.  
In the face of so many vortices to animosity.  
A loaf of bread baked with callous pride and salt.  
If I could flutter the shrapnel and the land.  
  
I saw how ribbons are galloped  
by the aquatic knave.
