The Image Of Aerial Points
--------------------------
Because  
I love you, love, amid the mud and outside the fire.  
Pulled out and shut out like a curtain.  
Nothing but your electric breath.  
I wish to make a line  
outside, and every feeling, many  
times hidden in a horse.  
But the tree travelled the memory.  
Full stop.  
I do not chain in the city of fractious felicity.  
Entertaining a railroad track  
blushed in the warm mist. In the smallest marble circus the cluster knows this,  
that life in it's silk boxes is as endless as the school.  
It is a tale of browbeaten serections your leaf is an alcove filled with cold kis.
