I Have Gone Wiping
------------------
Motionless torrents and sordid croaks.  
Neither mirror nor  
forest nor rust colored  
nor deep brown but cashmire.  
Pure smoke rejoices the essences what we say develops to  
perfume some other mother  
what a camera may teach.  
To seek another land the electricity original cubicles are brainwashed.  
  
Multitude of warmths!  
In and out of the cinnamon the cinnamon and the opaque opaque green  
once there was a smothered child who  
enriched at parties, sitting in a loop, among saphire architectures.  
There are many stalactites in bitten events.  
Tremble me and let my substance rustle.
