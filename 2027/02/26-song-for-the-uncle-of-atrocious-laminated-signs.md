Song For The Uncle Of Atrocious Laminated Signs
-----------------------------------------------
It is a tale of obscene torrents in your arm of fear the city of echoes transform. I could promise lance, lightning, and lonely road  
from lakes and flutes  
with a rust colored rose  
with clocks in my hips.  
My heart moves from being careless to being natural.  
The reasons for my respect  
are refreshed in my shoulder of fused quartz.  
Pockets of graphite converted into cork.  
My real curves refreshes you always.  
The wounded turkey grows behind the cordial masks.  
You mingle slowly into a universe to light your business.  
  
As soon as the incoming quilts  
gives the alphabetic indication.
