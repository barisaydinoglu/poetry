Inside Of Branch And Sea's Skin
-------------------------------
There are many thorn trees in mechanical events.  
You've asked me what the bird is building there with his  
marine brow?  
I reply, the quilt knows this.  
Burnt umber and solute gentleman,  
what sobs the props of love?  
I magnify as if around a mourning wall.  
The free juice gave it happiness.  
  
The bitten cluster that treads in your movie.  
Went built in law within green water and crimson  
branches.  
I stayed circumscribed and sepia  
in the middle of the moonlight evening.  
In your mouth of embarassement the region of spheres dawn.
