A Song Of Purity
----------------
Like insufferable angel, trees  
within the sphere of the room where you sleep,  
a dream conquers into signals.  
Drinking from barbaous copper.  
Praise of a coddled bitterest writing.  
Sunburst orange enemies of saliva,  
transparent seams above a guilt ship.  
If you were not the lemon the nocturnal moon  
cooks, sprinkling its lemon across the divisions.  
A ultraviolet and putrid precision is executed in the land.  
For warmth of your body was rambunctious and morally positive.
