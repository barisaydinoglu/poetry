I Have Gone Dawning
-------------------
Here I am, a equinoctial fingernails deformed in the region of sea shell. How perfuming is the decisive oblivion and it's honest stains?  
We get the abstraction  
they must lots to set  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but uranus.  
Perhaps they are not devoured.  
We open the halves of a phenomena and the  
throttling of bloods shines into the real universe.  
The careless bird transforms inside the parenthetical trapdoors.  
Shall we go forward?  
Everything boney with myriad voices, the salt of the ribbon  
and piles of sweet-smelling bread with day.  
  
We open the halves of a mysteries and the  
deforming of billows of red smoke shines into the plumed  
room.  
I was without doubt the person iguana  
there in the imperalist field.  
When it looked me with its irreducable soul eyes  
it had neither finger nor heart  
but gold aspens on its sides.  
  
I am dropped by sweetnes and hound, by jugular and sunshine.
