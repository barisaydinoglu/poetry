The Bomb Fallen Into The Sea
----------------------------
In your shoulder of sorrow the moonlight evening of shorelines swim.  
As soon as the incoming hooves  
gives the side indication.  
Once there was a dead cousin who  
carried at parties, sitting in a circle, among fleshes.  
What we say rises to  
enchant some other gentleman  
what a image may teach.  
A machine divulges,  
replaces - it does not return. Behind the blood-stained flower head, many difficult ghosts.  
Cashmire and full elder,  
neither reflection nor elixir nor turqoise  
nor green but transluscent blue.  
Key of an abducted exiled sun.  
A bed blushing will transform  
the silent wind of a planet.  
The forest plan that has everyone frightened.  
Conversations of lights, the recitation  
of ivory architectures we call great school.  
Shall we move on?  
I was without doubt the bride iguana  
there in the demonic region.  
When it looked me with its naked sphere eyes  
it had neither tail nor ears  
but emerald films on its sides.  
My heart is  
filled with joy like a chalk horse.  
I salute your somber orange  
and envy your profound pride.  
  
A chorus of ostriches at morning  
un reflected un deformed  
comes to a halt before a nature.  
I took on disordered fellowships.
