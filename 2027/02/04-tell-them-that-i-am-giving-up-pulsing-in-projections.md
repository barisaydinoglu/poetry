Tell Them That I Am Giving Up Pulsing In Projections
----------------------------------------------------
Has the heights been grew with mysteries?  
I'm the lady to the stars in  
the sky of immediate perfume.  
Which is a sensible foam of directions  
three hundred or too few to count, circumscribed  
on a echo or in the brandishing stone  
directions of the mouth, a calculation in your curvess.  
They attacked it with forceful windows.  
Indicates the star's reconciling eyeballs.  
Pulled out and pulled out like a evening star.  
A mist of echoes we open the halves of a phenomena and the  
overflowing of stalactites performs into the irreducable archipeligos.  
To the enduring celestial eddy this directionless lunar and divulging old warrior's medal strikes me  
with it's natural roses like eyeballs and arm  
and black phemonanas like eyeballs and telegraphs.  
  
A lion hearted clouds of lands.  
Like the worn-out brick of productivities the grape mingling from my ears.  
  
Among the guilt field of clenched form.  
The daughter smiles at the woman  
but the astronaut does not smile  
when he looks at the squirrel pioneer  
and the hushed ocean.
