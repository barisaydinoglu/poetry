From Jungle To Lightning
------------------------
I want you to make on my finger.  
And meetings of atrocious curves always  
you forebode through the midnight  
toward the sunset shattering sea water.  
The gleaming one  
weaves in the cleansed morning.  
In my  
divisions at fortnight you are like a ribbon  
and your form and colour the way I wet them.  
Nothing but that dove of maps.  
Propeller.  
Sometimes a piece of the fire  
smears like a pencil in my breath.
