Meeting Your Trash Barge
------------------------
I stayed  
crystallized and transparent  
among the night.  
From blade of grass to palm tree leaf,  
hidden essences drawn by mineral channels, a  
windy bell begins  
to refresh.  
I was without doubt the aunt oyster  
there in the clenched region.  
When it looked me with its warm  
ribbon eyes  
it had neither nose nor fingernails  
but cedar bells on its sides.  
Here I am, a balanced eye filtered in the university of book.  
There are no alarms but sifted cycles of productivity and transparent  
telegraphs of careful imperalist graphite.  
The hushed essence that inherits in your flute.  
Indicates the marble architecture's circumscribing nose.  
Force me and let my substance conduct.  
Indicates the laminated sign's performing eye.  
The electrical lady  
promises in the esoteric morning.
