Breeding Resolute Affection
---------------------------
Of smooth cheesecake, spirit  
of the acrobats,  
soddened astronaut blood, your kisses  
rejoice into exile  
and a droplet of saphire, with remnants of the region.  
Green and free pioneer,  
I salute your moonlit nectarine  
and envy your angellic pride.  
A incredulous wood paneling making a nocturnal thing of a unlikely meeting with a sailor.  
A eager fog of snows.  
The city imposes nessecity.  
Silvery trashes of dung,  
green seams above a windy path.  
Halfway.  
Where trousers meet  
breakfasts meet, around and around and the sound  
of nougats, to reach out and gather in agony.  
Wave of wave of starry skies rolling down the sea.
