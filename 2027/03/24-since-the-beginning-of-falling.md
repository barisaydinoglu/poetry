Since The Beginning Of Falling
------------------------------
What loathes the props of wonder?  
The flute plan that has everyone rustling.  
You are the tear stained gentleman of a bird,  
the burned-out ness of the crown, the power of the electricity.  
A quadrangle outside a loop,  
the nauesous workings of moonlit law.  
There ought to be a echo of a natural foliage returning in an area.  
I wish to make a square  
inside, and every color, many  
times hidden in a droplet.  
  
The corpse loves on its melancholy mare  
building silvery poppies over the sea.  
And so that  
its violences will electrify your mouth.  
Behind the form of the universe where you sleep,  
a dream abhors into studies.  
Pockets of clay converted into gold.
