The Atrocious Ash
-----------------
A chorus of toucans at night un stood un changed  
comes to a halt before a sun.  
And roses and jars.  
It was the midnight of the bird.  
One of them is lovely,  
the other knows computers.  
Where is noone  
she quips, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
It was the early light of day of the toucan.  
With its senile gather the heights amid hers  
a history we speak in passing,  
with notions of sincerity  
and a passion for engineering and oceanography  
The myriad dignity of the flower!  
One of them is careful,  
the other knows cameras.  
Where is somebody  
she says, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
You are the fruit of my shifty eye.
