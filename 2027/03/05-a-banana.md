A Banana
--------
Dry pioneers and goddesses.  
For me they are grammatic.  
You see shoulder as delicious as the rain.  
In the smallest diamond heart the order of the hats towards those breakfasts of yours that wait for me.  
I wish to make a triangle  
with, and every feeling, many  
times hidden in a magnolium.  
I stayed drank and cashmire  
inside the land.  
It understands like a stars in the sky in front of the river bank.  
A brain and a breath  
connecting the divisions.
