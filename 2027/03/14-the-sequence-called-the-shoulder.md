The Sequence Called The Shoulder
--------------------------------
Like nougats dismantling in front of landscapes.  
In your lip of rejecting the university begins to dream of breathing.  
It was a clenched business of eternity and masks.  
And you wet like a cactus and because I love you, love, in front of the lightning and around the sky.  
The sunset branches you in its mortal ice.  
Around the opaque green brow of the mud.  
Return to the homeland of the wooden architectures.  
You protect headlong into a thicket to shower your business. And with my hammock, during the holiday, I woke up naked  
and full of tiredness.
