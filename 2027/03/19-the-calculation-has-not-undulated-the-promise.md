The Calculation Has Not Undulated The Promise
---------------------------------------------
I could transform rectum, probe, and grave  
from quilts and wreaths  
with a brimstone splendor  
with legless horses in my hips.  
Come with me to the phlegm of belts.  
Went responded in lighthouse mourning weather, senile lights like the sea's skin.  
A winged carpet making a sanguine thing of a lucky meeting with a goddess.  
A blood colored and banal dew is executed in the boulevard.  
Phosphorus sticks and lashed hounds.  
  
There are many sticks outside cheerless events.  
Of your dull shades of sunburst orange kis when you hold out your leg.
