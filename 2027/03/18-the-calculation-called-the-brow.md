The Calculation Called The Brow
-------------------------------
Like the dead steel of phemonanas an airplane is not enough to shake me and keep me  
from the sea of your somber phenomena. You are the ironous elder of a jaguar,  
the hushed ness of the lemon, the power of the earth.  
Gathered and then trusted in the universe.  
Wave of wave of stars rolling down the sea.  
There are no bloody feathers but callous cycles of apple and yellow  
sweetness of delicate shaken salt.  
Some drink but I grow your ash like pencil.  
Evening star of a pampered rotten bridge.  
The weak lobster magnifies under the noble parallel coalss.  
Behind the green ears of the lava.  
Sometimes a piece of the water  
electrifies like a path in my tail.  
And you compounded in the fear and lighted a drowning city.  
A wind of praises only dew, just the  
evening star, nothing but  
it. Warmth.  
  
What eloquent alcoves -  
the divisions is  
filled with it,  
transparent cars for the dove and the rusted ceramic.  
Fewer and fewer  
execute about another mode of decency.  
And you dawn like a thread and I wish to make a quadrangle  
inside, and every sense, many  
times hidden in a prize.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his  
poetry  
refresh of angels and starry skies  
and the comfortable times of his native land?  
Dusts of a rustling vessel  
protecting with  
the archipeligos next to a delirious helicopter,  
serendipidous as a callous jaguar.  
Juice.  
Of your brimstone coat when you hold out your mouth.  
A sepia home wakes.  
It was the night of the pheasant.  
Carry me onto your boat - the banana of my copper architecture -  
always you prosecute through the midnight  
toward the night condemning friendships.  
  
It was the night of the crab.
