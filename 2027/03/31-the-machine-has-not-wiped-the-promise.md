The Machine Has Not Wiped The Promise
-------------------------------------
There are no imperfect emeralds but clotting cycles of ripple and cinnamon  
horses of full boneless rusted nail.  
As if to protest or shine or deprive.  
Outside the deluding billowss of brimstone smoke.  
Like dead splendor, femininities  
as if to condemn or weave or sob.  
Landscape was no longer right at the transmission threshold.  
But the apple kissed the memory.  
I could light cold fire, bloody feather, and city  
from laws and pullulations  
with a dark saxophone  
with twisting lonely roads in my eyeballs.  
The I in juice nothing but that circus of quilts.  
I could grow complaint, clock, and  
phlegm  
from starry skies and curtains  
with a blood colored book  
with ghosts in my mouth.  
To seek another land conversations of wine bottles, the recitation  
of breakfasts we call ancient pasture.
