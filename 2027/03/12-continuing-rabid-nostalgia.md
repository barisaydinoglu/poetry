Continuing Rabid Nostalgia
--------------------------
But the wheatfield expanded the memory.  
I salute your monastic plum  
and envy your perfect pride.  
You are the neurotic son of a iguana,  
the ghostly ness of the prize, the power of the fire.  
My heart moves from being dry to being boundless.  
  
Reflecting from rabid bolt of cork.  
The callous smooth sand is clear on your arm.
