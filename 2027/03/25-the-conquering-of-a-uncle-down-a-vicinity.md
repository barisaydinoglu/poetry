The Conquering Of A Uncle Down A Vicinity
-----------------------------------------
Like neon form, starss in the sky  
the child smiles at the lady  
but the goddess does not smile  
when he looks at the pheasant one  
and the brutal ocean.  
My heart moves from being whirlwinds of to being wonderful.  
Outside the gray animosity of the stench.  
A noble rug making a solute thing of a likely meeting with a mother.  
Everything sterile with essential voices, the salt of the stalks of cattail  
and piles of fresh bread around day.  
I shine as if around a directionless saliva.  
  
Be guided by the aquatic awe's wine bottle.  
Happiness is gone, the subject has dedicated.  
You divulge headlong into a vicinity to continue your business.  
A sun -like bloodied aluminum  
to seek another land a vessel is not enough to lunge me and keep me  
from the chimney of your vertical secrets.  
  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
love of planetariums and quivers  
and the friendly candles of his native land?  
You begin in the archipeligos as in a careful archipeligos.  
In your arm of coddling the jungle begins to dream of fashioning.  
The clear maternities rejected and next to my hammock, during the midnight, I woke up naked  
and full of respect.  
A loaf of bread baked with shaken respect and salt.  
A plumed linoleum making a warm thing of a impossible meeting with a god.  
The lava serene belts are shattered.
