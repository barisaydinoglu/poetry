Some Sifted Create
------------------
A bottle focuses its  
dream of a old ending, its old ending, the old ending of the writing order -  
its real consequences.  
Draw from it the demonic  
image of its own antenna.  
I stayed imbued and transluscent sunburst orange  
under the sea.  
And you faltered in the fear and rose a plaguing shrapnel.  
There are many shrapnels outside frightened events.  
A tail and a hand  
upgrading the moonlight evening.  
Mutate me and let my substance entertain.
