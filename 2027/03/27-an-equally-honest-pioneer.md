An Equally Honest Pioneer
-------------------------
Neither door nor poppy nor opaque dark  
nor cashmire but sepia.  
Green and lovely lady,  
a current of dashing crown  
that does not know why it flows and blossoms.  
The snows exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
within it in darkness.
