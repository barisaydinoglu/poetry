Song For The Sailor Of Furious Gardens
--------------------------------------
Enjoy the many motionless attempts to imbue  
the wonderful death.  
There is nocturnal fortune in continuing it.  
You say, what is the friendship waiting for in its transluscent opaque cashmire necklace?  
I tell you it is waiting for sea water like you.  
You see brow as careful as the fog.  
Essence was no longer below the recording threshold.  
Among the frail maternity, many thirsty deaths. Behind the opaque burnt umber brow of the lava.  
Only goblet, just the  
mirror, nothing but  
it. Affection.
