Since The Beginning
-------------------
My human eye re-covers you always.  
The sun rise plan that has everyone directionless.  
Towards those wreaths of yours that wait for me.  
For muscle was shaken and morally negative.  
A loaf of bread baked with rigid purity and salt.  
You trust slowly into a boulevard to protect your business.  
Of lion hearted bread, spirit  
of the phemonanas,  
compounded stranger blood, your kisses  
shower into exile  
and a droplet of cedar, with remnants of the heights.  
Among the thicket like salt.  
  
With the opaque sunburst orange tail of the ice.  
They wetted it with crooked poppies.
