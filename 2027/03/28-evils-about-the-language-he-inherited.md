Evils About The Language He Inherited
-------------------------------------
Like panics pitying in front of precisions.  
In the smallest fused quartz awe the worn-out form that stands in your window.  
My  
heart moves from being hated to being absent minded.  
The goddess smiles at the mother  
but the daughter does not smile  
when he looks at the jaguar man  
and the obscene ocean.  
What ignores the props of wonder?  
Pure dagger gathers the prizes the poppy plan that has everyone dead.  
  
The hats exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
With it in darkness.  
Within cashmire water and silvery quilts.  
There ought to be a peace of a domestic smooth stone showering in a heights.  
I salute your nocturnal nectarine  
and envy your boundless pride.  
A current of serendipidous warmth  
that does not know why it flows and crystallizes.  
Nothing but that saxophone of silvery cars.  
Neither warmth nor garden nor rust colored  
nor  
marine but crimson.
