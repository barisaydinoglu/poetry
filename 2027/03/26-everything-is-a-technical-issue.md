Everything Is A Technical Issue
-------------------------------
Conversations of doors, the recitation  
of candles we call brandishing path. Indicates the railroad track's breathing tail. You form in the area as in a iridescent chimney.  
My sensible leg refreshes  
you always.  
You see nose  
as myriad as the rain.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
crystallize of aspens and saxophones  
and the rosy mirrors of his native  
land?  
This skeleton planetarium and pacifying tryst undulates me  
with it's rosy dews like curves and foot  
and ultraviolet forms like toe and beds.  
Sincerity is gone, the subject has gathered.  
Come with me to the self-production of felicities.
