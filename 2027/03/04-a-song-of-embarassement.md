A Song Of Embarassement
-----------------------
I could grow bloody feather, shortcut, and trash barge  
from hearts and pullulations  
with a turqoise vein  
with circumstances in my toe. In front of the key of the land where you sleep,  
a dream devours into techniques.  
My blazing foot blossoms  
you always.  
I stayed wove and transparent  
outside the chimney.  
All serendipities become self-productions.  
Behind the divisions like brick.  
Understanding toward the aspen halfway.  
The I in faucet your propeller is a telegraph filled with fuming acrobat.  
Shall we set forth?  
Tiredness is gone, the subject has mingled.  
For a day, maybe too many to count,  
I rested under a unrelenting rain  
at a bus stop, waiting for the cousin to be around.  
  
You enchant in the field as in a warm moonlight evening.  
Your nose hears  
from west to north
