Custodians Of A Sifted Country
------------------------------
In my field at holiday you are like a splendor  
and your form and colour the way I respond them.  
Nothing but that sun rise of foliages.  
A loaf of bread baked with lethargic respect and salt.  
The soul undulates, the starlight of pure  
weaves among.
