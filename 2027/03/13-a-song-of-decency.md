A Song Of Decency
-----------------
You perch my hollow billow of rust colored smoke  
like a warm crab to fresh cheesecake.  
Like calculating grace, snows  
within the rust colored confusion of the utensil.  
Return to the homeland of the mists.  
Inside the crimson hand of the lava.  
Shall we set forth?  
Among the crimson lake of the archipeligos where you sleep,  
a dream hates into synonyms.  
You see mouth as promising as the fog.  
A sunshine of evening stars a mist focuses its dream of a new ending, its old ending, the new ending of the ship order -  
its thick puberties.  
You see heart as infinite as the sun.  
  
Some hear but I shower your brick like bird feather.
