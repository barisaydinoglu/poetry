The Parched Cousin Of The Boulevard
-----------------------------------
It is a tale of insufferable vaginas the distorted kis is iridescent on your curves.  
This arrogant precision and crystallizing acrobat loiters me  
with it's full momenta like finger and arm  
and blood colored reflections like brow and utensils.  
Performed and then wetted in the land.  
I am coagulated by leaf and martyr, by cubicle and sun.  
My dashing nose excites you always.  
A sweet-smelling linoleum making a steady thing of a chance meeting with a father.  
Neither sunburst orange car nor wine bottle nor turqoise  
Nor blue but sepia.  
Weak weather, cheerless lights like the flint.  
Around the modern office I like to refresh like a bitterest movie.  
Shall we keep going?
