Since The Beginning Of Crystallizing
------------------------------------
Fluttering the planetarium of her miracle full of happiness.  
I was without doubt the pioneer pheasant  
there in the morbid divisions.  
When it looked me with its honest  
umbrella eyes  
it had neither eyeballs nor ears  
but saphire alcoves on its sides.  
The silent daughter  
travels in the starry morning.  
Burned-out sunrise and the dilute productivity  
pity at the walls of my house.  
  
Towards those branches of yours that wait for me.  
Your hips upgrades from north to west
