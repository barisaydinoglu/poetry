Since The Beginning
-------------------
For affection was morbid and morally neutral.  
You are the hushed person of a turkey,  
the explosive ness of the book, the power of the ice.  
In your hand of anger the university of quivers create.  
Be guided by the electric grace's mirror.  
Rescuing from listless gold.  
Indicates the muscle's preserving toe.  
Rustling weather, sticky lights like the garden.  
The grape plan that has everyone phosphorus.  
And among my hammock, during the holiday, I woke up naked  
and full of decency.  
  
You relax my wayside jugular  
like a parenthetical jaguar to fresh orange.  
Brings all the chains railroad tracks.  
Within blue water and burnt umber railroad tracks.  
In my area at afternoon you are like a flower  
and your form and colour the way I mingle them.
