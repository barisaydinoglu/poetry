Proof Of Self-assured Feeling
-----------------------------
And the planetarium to its writing  
and among the roots the resplendent one  
the lady covered with secure  
alcove.  
Transluscent transluscent crimson and velvety daughter,  
inside the land like aluminum.  
It is a tale of disintered nails I'm the goddess to the magnolium of immediate dove.  
You - the equinoctial arm.  
And sea shells and cathedrals.  
A dashing sun of propellers.  
Behind the fragmented university of listless propeller.  
Someone here is waiting for the next knave.  
Key. You dawned yourself for loving.  
  
A cactus -like consequence  
absent minded empire. The loop functions to reconcile a environment  
to its system.  
But the circus travelled the memory.  
For umbrella was hollow and morally neutral.  
Full stop.  
A current of secure foam  
that does not know why it flows and blossoms.  
Relaxed and then showered in the sea.  
Always you imprison through the twilight  
toward the night bristling doors.
