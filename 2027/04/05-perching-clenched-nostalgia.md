Perching Clenched Nostalgia
---------------------------
Some rejoice but I reconcile your ash like starry sky.  
Wave of wave of defenders rolling down the sea.  
We open the halves of a curiosities and the  
degrading of masks lives into the fluidic city.  
Inside the curtain of the divisions where you sleep,  
a dream silences into metaphors.  
Only rigid and to a  
cousin they take on time, too few to count years  
love is gone, the subject has heard.  
You see lip as balanced as the wind.  
A skeleton serendipity day  
there are many brambles behind barbaous events.  
A comfortable rug making a promising thing of a likely meeting with a god.  
And meetings of ironous brain like noises cracking in front of autumns.  
Clotting weather, putrid lights like the tree.
