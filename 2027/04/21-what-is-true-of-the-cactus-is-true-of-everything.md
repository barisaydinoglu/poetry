What Is True Of The Cactus Is True Of Everything
------------------------------------------------
In the face of so many gates to positivity.  
The goddess smiles at the goddess  
but the child does not smile  
when he looks at the bird custodian  
and the ghostly ocean.  
The son smiles at the mother  
but the fisherman does not smile  
when he looks at the toucan father  
and the arrogant ocean.  
What serene defenders -  
The room is  
filled with it,  
wells for the dove and the calcerous paper-mache.  
They are all daughters  
professional moths in whose changeless curtains originate.  
In your brain of drowning the sea begins to dream of crystallizing.  
A quadrangle behind a loop,  
the mechanical workings of affluent law.  
Outside the archipeligos like sand. The electric mist gave it happiness.  
Wet-winged weather, whirlwinds of lights like the faucet.
