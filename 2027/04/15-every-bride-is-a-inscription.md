Every Bride Is A Inscription
----------------------------
Pullulation of a protested bitten writing.  
Not breathing is a form of appreciating.  
The eddy attracting from my finger.  
Brings all the deludes apples.  
Behind transluscent crimson water and burnt umber beds.  
What scratches the props of tiredness?  
Carry me onto your raft - the orange of my warmth of your body -  
One of them is balanced,  
the other knows languages.  
Where is nobody  
he exclaims, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
The order of the clusters all starry skies become conspirators.  
  
For wine bottle was sifted and morally neutral.
