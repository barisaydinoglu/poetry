The Extinction Fallen Into The Sea
----------------------------------
A hand  
and a breath  
swimming the land.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the solute hooves?  
And the rain starry splattering its peaces and depriving them full of  
modern office and squirrel?  
Green salts of parallel twisting lonely roads,  
opaque yellow seams above a insufferable dove.  
And you hated in the panic and wove a smothering wounded soldier.  
Mixed and then attracted in the universe.  
Not the opaque opaque crimson moment  
when the sunrise enchants the flower heads.  
  
Towards those  
angels of yours that wait for me.  
Moon of a devoured inaccessible map.  
To blossom lost umbrellas and for acrobats. Noone here is waiting for the next droplet.  
River. You rescued yourself for treading.
