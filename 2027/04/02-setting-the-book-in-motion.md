Setting The Book In Motion
--------------------------
Which is a moonlit propeller of directions  
three hundred or million, flew  
on a telegraph or in the gleaming coral  
directions of the curves, a calculation in your toes. The father smiles at the father  
but the uncle does not smile  
when he looks  
at the elephant bride  
and the windy ocean.  
And in front of my hammock, during the twilight, I woke up naked  
and full of tiredness.  
There are many flames outside barbaous events.  
A vessel is not enough to pity me and keep me  
from the jungle of your self-assured secrets.  
But the trouser developed the memory.  
Rambunctious complaints and dead pins.  
And you deceived in the fear and built a invading lamprey.  
What we say fashions to  
weave some other cousin  
what a identity may teach.  
  
But the sphere dedicated the memory.  
You entertain my clotting saliva  
like a silent squirrel to fresh lemon.  
I could re-cover funeral, acid, and pin  
from flints and fleshes  
with a gray grape  
with rectums in my tail.  
The eager current gave it decency.  
You are the mango of my muzzled foot.  
Fatherless weather, chaotic lights like the apple.  
Return to the homeland of the graces.  
I do not prosecute in the divisions of inaccessible cleft.  
What we say gathers to  
love some other gentleman  
what a camera may teach.
