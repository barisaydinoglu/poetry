Lighting Bitterest Nostalgia
----------------------------
And you chained in the panic and stored a deceiving invasion.  
I stayed relinquished and deep brown  
in  
the middle of the modern office.  
Enjoy the many bitterest attempts to continue  
the profound flask.  
There is  
arcane fortune in carrying it.  
And meetings of brutal  
mouth a loaf of bread baked with acidulous decency and salt.  
A rust colored and raucous light  
is congealed in the university.  
You - the delicate finger.  
  
Be guided by the starry root's telegraph.  
As if to replace or form or chain.  
But I should be untrue to oceanography, silencing among its wet-winged eddies  
so let us try to speak a story without individual redundancies.  
The real dignity of the lake!  
The trap magnifies on its neurotic mare  
appreciating green lakes over the field.
