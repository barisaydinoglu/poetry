Rosy Theories Of Mosaics
------------------------
I took on  
dead flutes.  
When you wake rejoiced like a trouser.  
Once there was a lashed mountaineer who  
trusted at parties, sitting in a line, among fellowships.  
Blossoming toward the wave nobody here is waiting for the next coat.  
Cactus. You magnified yourself for dedicating.  
The irreducable dew gave  
it wonder.  
A clouds of reflections what we say reflects to  
rejoice some other astronaut  
what a technique may teach.  
Lashed early light of day and the morose mist  
pass at the walls of my house.  
The reflection coagulates, the energy of verdure  
gallops in front of.  
  
In the first take, the domestic sailor  
is struck by a child. In the second  
scene he returns, to crystallize and to relax.  
So the domestic wonder lives on in a banana,  
the absent minded house of the silence,  
the naked farm that is lion hearted and infinite.  
Nothing but that ribbon of roses.  
To the cleansed color of the gem silence.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
protect of paths and films  
and the velvety hats of his native land?  
How seeking is the careful stick and it's incredulous corpses?  
In my vicinity at lunchtime you are like a mirror  
and your form and colour the way I drink them.  
Realized angellic dove behind the vicinity like salt.
