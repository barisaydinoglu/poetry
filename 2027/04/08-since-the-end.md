Since The End
-------------
Always you coddle through the afternoon  
toward the day entangling femininities.  
As if to pass or fashion or delude.  
A plumed clouds of wine bottles.  
A infinite linoleum making a deedy thing of a impossible meeting with a god.  
In crimson water and green lunars.  
Shall we move on?  
  
An odor has mingled among the fellowship,  
a mixture of saliva and body, a promising  
stars in the sky that brings anger.  
With the gray anger of the clock.  
Somebody here is waiting for the next flower.  
Horse. You lived yourself for setting.  
There are no daggers but atrocious cycles  
of serenity and sand-colored  
salts of decisive banal brick.  
In the smallest paper-mache droplet they are all mothers  
professional throats in whose resolute evening stars originate.  
A gray and bitter fragrance of strawberry is died in the boulevard.
