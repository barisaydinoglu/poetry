The Ghost Fallen Into The Sea
-----------------------------
And a misunderstood laminated sign's lava will fly you. If you were not the wine the handsome moon  
cooks, sprinkling its apple across the divisions.  
I'm the sailor to the precision of immediate stone.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the full sweetness?  
And the drizzle blazing splattering its doors and conquering them full of  
moonlight evening and bird?  
Noone here is waiting for the next eddy.  
Mosaic. You perfumed yourself for responding.  
Carry me onto  
your bicycle - the lemon of my salt -  
where momenta meet  
wheatfields meet, outside and outside and the sound  
of bones, to reach out and form in fear.  
To seek another land the martyr imposes nessecity.  
Some perfume but I rescue your sand like sepia lake.
