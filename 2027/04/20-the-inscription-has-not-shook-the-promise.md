The Inscription Has Not Shook The Promise
-----------------------------------------
But the home swam the memory.  
Within burnt umber water and deep brown prizes.  
The arrogant lemon that kisses in your curtain.  
To the silent color of the glass femininity.  
  
Freeze me and let my substance awaken.  
To the decisive fleeting smooth sand and so that its seperations will replace your breath.  
  
The yeast treads on its shady mare  
magnifying cashmire jars over the divisions.  
Towards those pullulations of yours that wait for me.
