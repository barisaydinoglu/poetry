Song For The Gentleman Of Ghostly Landscapes
--------------------------------------------
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the full tigers?  
And the rain hopeful splattering its crowns and wiping them full of  
sea and pheasant?  
Where crowns meet  
pullulations meet, around and in front of and the sound  
of waxes, to reach out and drink in panic.  
The silence makes in trusting your heart.  
Realized fleeting ritual flowing a silence  
attracted in the ancient mist.  
Pacifying from dead marble.  
Door was no longer below the recording threshold.  
Nothing but that sun of wheatfields.  
Next to cashmire water and yellow waves.  
Blue clay to my fatherless cactus!  
I could excite self-production, vigil, and stalactite  
from beds and knaves  
with a blood colored trouser  
with trashes in my eyelids.  
I saw how stones are kissed  
by the electric autumn.  
Towards those propellers of yours that wait for me.  
To the absent minded color of the chalk forest.  
Neither book nor atom nor black  
nor yellow but crimson.  
Against the forceful field of torrential acrobat.  
Has the land been flew with funny things?  
Nothing but that film of fleshes.  
Around the dark sorrow of the wounded soldier.  
What we say reflects to  
fashion some other man  
what a inscription may teach.  
A self-assured mist of elixirs.  
The thirsty coat is romantic on your breath.
