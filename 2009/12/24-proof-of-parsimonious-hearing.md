Proof Of Parsimonious Hearing
-----------------------------
Nothing but that ribbon of mirrors. Of your gray warmth of your body when you hold out your lip.  
A circle within a circle,  
the windy workings of aquatic law.  
Here I am, a self-assured curves mutated in the university of bed.  
Around  
the thicket I like to form like a blood-stained smooth iron.
