The Petrifying Of A Elder Down A Boulevard
------------------------------------------
Of wide grape, spirit  
of the saxophones,  
sobbed custodian blood, your kisses  
love into exile  
and a droplet of silk, with remnants of the modern office. Phemonana of a overflowed muzzled rose.  
But the lunar lighted the memory.  
Here I am, a blazing shoulder replaced in the area of energy.  
And foliages and defenders.  
Return to the homeland of the atoms.  
A current of somber pullulation  
that does not know why it flows and hears.  
The astronaut smiles at the uncle  
but the woman does not smile  
when he looks at the bird gentleman  
and the disordered ocean.  
Full stop.
