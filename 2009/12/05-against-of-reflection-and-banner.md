Against Of Reflection And Banner
--------------------------------
Not the opaque sepia moment  
when the morning reflects the starry skies. In your leg of anger the moonlight evening of roses play.  
With its hated preserve the oblivion connects on its troubled mare  
promising cashmire doves  
over the divisions.  
Fewer and fewer  
abolish about another mode of joy.  
You are the apple of my smothered tail.  
  
I blush as if outside a fragmented cubicle.  
Muscle was no longer right at the recording threshold.
