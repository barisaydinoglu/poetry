Uncles Of A Bitter Country
--------------------------
Fewer and fewer  
Wipe about another mode of joy.  
Crimson ice to my morbid tree!  
Always you undulate through the early light of day  
toward the midnight petrifying utensils.  
Fatherless weather, delirious lights like the drop.  
What loathes the props of joy?  
They died it with hated foams.  
In your eyelids of mourning the boulevard begins to dream of playing.  
Where roots meet  
stones meet, within and outside and the sound  
of cities, to reach out and continue in illusion.  
This neurotic pullulation and enriching kiss twists me  
with it's deedy drops like fingernails and shoulder  
and rust colored writings like arm and grapes.  
The wind cordial acids are bristled.
