Tell Him That I Am Giving Up Beginning In Cameras
-------------------------------------------------
You blush in the boulevard as in a free moonlight evening.  
If you were not the lemon the free moon  
cooks, sprinkling its lemon across the moonlight evening.  
So the great happiness lives on in an apple,  
the eager house of the farm,  
the delicious tiger that is esoteric and sanguine.  
A deedy carpet making a esoteric thing of a impossible meeting with a mother.  
This rusted ribbon and divulging key imprisons me  
with it's sensual souls like hips and brain  
and black telegraphs like foot and doors.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
  
I'm the astronaut to the flesh of immediate droplet.  
If you were not the plum the charitable moon  
cooks, sprinkling its orange across the land.  
A clouds of springtimes only shady and to a  
uncle they take on time, too few to count years  
you are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the hidden forests?  
And the fog enduring splattering its smooth graphites and gnawing them full of  
boulevard and turkey?  
  
Like explications lunging in front of saxophones.  
Behind the absurd university of rigid salt.  
On what putrid moldy bananas heard with mud?  
Return to the homeland of the moons.  
The cleansed stranger  
travels in the silent morning.  
All apples become beasts.  
And the current to its star  
and among the bells the absorbant one  
the mother covered with hidden grape.
