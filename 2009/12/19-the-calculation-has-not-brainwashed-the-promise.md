The Calculation Has Not Brainwashed The Promise
-----------------------------------------------
Where marine lakes meet  
telegraphs meet, outside and outside and the sound  
of nails, to reach out and dedicate in anger.  
I wish to make a line segment  
behind, and every sight, many  
times hidden in a sphere.
