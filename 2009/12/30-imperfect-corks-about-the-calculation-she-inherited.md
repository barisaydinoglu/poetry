Imperfect Corks About The Calculation She Inherited
---------------------------------------------------
A circle in a line segment,  
the negligent workings of homogeneous law.  
A landscape relinquishing will store  
the lethargic wind of a planet.  
Nothing but your poetic mouth.  
You've asked me what the turkey is gathering there with his deep brown fingernails?  
I reply, the crystal architecture knows this.  
You say, what is the bridge waiting for in its sepia bottle?  
I tell you it is waiting for phemonana like you.  
Sticky lunchtime and the delirious femininity  
impale at the walls of my house.  
Realized parsimonious old warrior's medal to the eloquent moonlit starlight a poetic rug making an ancient thing of a impossible meeting with a mountaineer.  
The reasons for my respect  
are enchanted in my arm of ceramic.  
  
If you were not the orange the delicate moon  
cooks, sprinkling its peach across the modern office.  
A hips and a nose  
standing the field.
