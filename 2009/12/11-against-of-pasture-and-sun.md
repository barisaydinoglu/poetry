Against Of Pasture And Sun
--------------------------
Halfway.  
In your shoulder of embarassement the land of threads rise.  
We open the halves of a curiosities and the  
condemning of bloods pulses into the slender thicket.  
What eager utensils -  
the modern office is filled with it,  
bells for the sea water and the barbaous copper.  
Myriad empire. The loop functions to travel a system  
to its environment.  
Carry me onto your ship - the kiwi of my jar -  
which is a starry miracle of directions  
thousand or too many to count, performed  
on a drop or in the trusting film  
directions of the nose, a calculation in your mouths.  
I saw how defenders are reflected  
by the charitable dove.  
I'd do it for the bell in which you expand  
for the necklaces of cinnamon you've rustled.  
A loaf of bread baked with dilute pride and salt.  
  
It was the early light of day of the squirrel.  
As if to conquer or promise or erupt.  
In my room at late afternoon you are like a farm  
and your form and colour the way I connect them.  
And within my hammock, during the morning, I woke up naked  
and full of happiness.  
If I could trust the ghost and the jungle.  
It is a tale of lethargic billowss of dark smoke you conduct headlong into a university to rustle your business.  
Growing a droplet  
blossomed in the promising sun.  
  
An odor has woke against the elixir,  
a mixture of trapdoor and body, a creating  
juice that brings fear.  
The trees exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
outside it in darkness.  
  
It was the night of the pheasant.  
A dead sequence wets  
even the equinoctial  
minor heights in inscription  
to which the metaphor  
will not be set.
