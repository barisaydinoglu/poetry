Inside Of Silence And Awe
-------------------------
Around  
the moonlight evening I like to create like a boneless shades of sunburst orange. A violenet detail mutates  
even the musical  
technical room in inscription  
to which the metaphor  
will  
not be continued.  
Sunburst orange wombs of thorn tree,  
blue seams above a decadent law.  
A handsome carpet making a slender thing of a unlikely meeting with a mother.  
There are many  
violas behind sordid events.
