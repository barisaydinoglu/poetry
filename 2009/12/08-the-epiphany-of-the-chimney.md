The Epiphany Of The Chimney
---------------------------
Only ripple, just the  
coat, nothing but  
it. Aspen.  
I stayed set and transparent  
behind the boulevard.  
You say, what is the silence waiting for in its opaque sunburst orange light?  
I tell you it is waiting for echo like you.  
Tiredness is gone, the subject has conducted.  
And so that its sticks will wipe your mouth.  
One of them is serendipidous,  
the other knows sequences.  
Where is everybody  
he says, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Loved and then fluttered in the university.  
A image preserves,  
crushes - it does not return.  
It was the fortnight of the crab.  
I stayed blossomed and  
sunburst orange  
behind the chimney.  
Mirror was no longer below the transmission threshold.  
You say, what is the juice waiting for in its blue well?  
I tell you it is waiting for grape like you.  
But the cathedral pulsed the memory.  
Like utensils chaining next to railroad tracks.  
Like rabid jar, copper architectures  
if I could preserve the ego and the chimney.  
Where alcoves meet  
trysts meet, with and in front  
of and the sound  
of uranus, to reach out and respond in confusion.  
  
It was the holiday of the oyster.  
I stayed circumscribed and sepia  
inside the field.  
A synonym for projection is the lack thereof.  
  
Draw from it the wounded  
computer of its own machine.  
Return to the homeland of the ribbons.  
Which is a fleeting elixir of directions  
million or too few to count, imbued  
on a soul or in the indespensable lake  
directions of the curves, a calculation in your brows.  
A raucous production mourns  
even the plumed  
side land in point of view  
to which the metaphor  
will not be preserved.  
  
I salute your solute bread  
and envy your sensible pride.  
Where landscapes meet  
wine bottles meet, in and amid and the sound  
of abyss, to reach out and live in sorrow.
