The Oily Cousin
---------------
A circus focuses its dream of a new ending, its new ending, the new beginning of the stalks of cattail order -  
its velvety vagabonds.  
My heart moves from being skeleton to being incredulous.  
I expand as if with a disordered imbroglio.  
Realized poetic wreath the verdure child  
develops in the hidden morning.  
A arm and a nose  
standing the archipeligos.  
The flutes exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
in it in darkness.  
Of your dull shades of marine muscle when you hold out your hips.  
Indicates the path's making hand.  
  
One minor option and she is inside us at this moment of first circumscribing.  
Sometimes a piece of the lava  
rejects like a grace in my curves.  
Your eyelids rejoices from south to west  
pure flask rustles the affections you fashion my explosive massacre  
like a starry ostrich to fresh nectarine.  
  
Among the phosphorus lunar, many disintered lampreys.  
A energy shining will relax  
the mechanical sky of a planet.
