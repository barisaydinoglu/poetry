Lonely Angel
------------
  
Seek on the noises that wait for you  
faltering the sterile chairs, conquering the doors.  
In your hips of agony the city of shorelines create.  
Of your opaque blood colored warmth of your body when you hold out your ears. Which is a poetic landscape of directions  
three hundred or million, excited  
on a flower or in the nocturnal film  
directions of the finger, a calculation in your hipss.  
Fear  
and stars in the sky - juices of agony.
