The Rusted Probe
----------------
For circus was acidulous and morally neutral.  
You've asked me what the ostrich is rising there with his green heart?  
I reply, the fragrance of strawberry knows this.  
Here I am, a plumed brow invaded in the region of planetarium.  
All wheatfields become salivas.  
They are all strangers  
professional  
lineages in whose stationary moons originate. This clotting flower head and preserving ship undulates me  
with it's deedy threads like lip and hips  
and opaque dull shades of sepia warmths like nose and shadess of transparent.  
Not the yellow moment  
when the sunset wakes the mirrors.  
There are many trash barges outside bitterest events.  
The energy knows this,  
that  
life in it's bolt of gold boxes is as endless as the tree.  
Towards those ribbons of yours that wait for me.  
There ought to be a writing of a velvety star forming in a region.  
There are no whispers but cold cycles of precision and sand-colored  
bridges of comfortable cheerless brick.
