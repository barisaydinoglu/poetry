A Lion Hearted Substance
------------------------
It entertains like a muscle behind the sea water.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
chirp of trysts and quilts  
and the equinoctial smooth stones of his native land?  
Wave of wave of essences rolling down the sea.  
I do not hate in the vicinity of callous howl.  
Went seized in lemon a chorus of toucans at late afternoon un lighted un pitied  
comes to a halt before a magnolium.  
Within the blood colored anger of the corpse.  
The motionless fellowship that understands in your flesh.  
Nothing but your natural arm.  
I salute your indespensable grape  
and envy your parsimonious pride.  
  
I create as if inside a rambunctious darknes.
