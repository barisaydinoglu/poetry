The Signal Of Neutral Points
----------------------------
  
Live on the trash barges that wait for you  
decaying the motionless chairs, disguising the doors.  
A signal for identity is the lack thereof.  
The order of the homes I saw how writings are protected  
by the full soul.  
Some reconcile but I dedicate your metal like flag.  
If I could rise the legless horse and the room.  
In your hand of panic the archipeligos of smooth broken glasses gather.  
What deceives the props of decency?  
The umbrella plan that has everyone directionless.  
Bed of a punctured callous grace.  
Only silent and to a  
mountaineer they take on time, too few to count years  
as if to drop or reconcile or execute.
