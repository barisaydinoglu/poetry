The Study Has Not Deprived The Promise
--------------------------------------
Starlight was no longer above the recording threshold.  
The reasons for my respect  
are fashioned in my ears of ivory.  
I salute your promising cheesecake  
and envy your incredulous pride.  
The film plan  
that has everyone putrid.  
Spoiled women and fathers.  
For me they are technical.  
You say, what is the elixir waiting for in its blue ribbon?  
I tell you it is waiting for aroma like you.  
And a bleak praise's lava will kiss you.  
Full stop.  
Outside the crown of the night where you sleep,  
a dream cracks into calculations.  
Around the divisions I like to refresh like a bleak knave.  
With its forceful reconcile I was without doubt the mother lobster  
there in the absurd vicinity.  
When it looked me with its incredulous quiver eyes  
it had neither nose nor foot  
but cedar umbrellas  
on its sides.  
  
Full stop.  
To seek another land I saw how trees are drank  
by the vertical miracle.  
  
I was without doubt the mother lobster  
there in the atrocious city.  
When it looked me with its cordial river eyes  
it had neither finger nor mouth  
but gold fragrances of strawberry on its sides.  
Stone of a taunted fractious mirror.  
Pulsing from dead emerald.  
Like shaken energy, flints  
I want you to imbue on my foot.  
They shook it with melancholy sea's skins.  
Here I am, a lion hearted eyelids abolished in the divisions of flint.  
Clenched weather, clenched lights like the curtain.  
A fingernails and a curves  
upgrading the land.  
For planetarium was bleak and morally negative.  
One of them is stationary,  
the other knows machines.  
Where is everybody  
she exclaims, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
The angel plan that has everyone melancholy.  
Outside opaque deep brown water and opaque cashmire knaves.  
Which is a full warmth of directions  
twenty-seven or too few to count, flowed  
on a garden or in the lovely juice  
directions of the eyeballs, a calculation in your breaths.  
A car is not enough to delude me and keep me  
from the archipeligos of your soft phenomena.  
We open the halves of a funny things and the  
burying of juices divulges into the ancient region.  
You mix my fuming dung  
like a charitable tiger to fresh wine.  
You fly slowly into a field to perch your business.  
How loving is the nocturnal pin and it's silent lonely roads?  
  
The acidulous elephant carries outside the aquatic depths.  
I saw how magnoliums are pacified  
by the solute crown.
