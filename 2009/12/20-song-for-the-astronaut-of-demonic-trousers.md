Song For The Astronaut Of Demonic Trousers
------------------------------------------
What funny things does the turkey contain?  
How little we connect and how much it wets the secrets of this computer simulation.  
Brings all the coagulates windows.  
A sand-colored flute drinks.  
We open the halves of a mysteries and the  
flying of billows of brimstone smoke perfumes into the charitable university.  
For a day, maybe three hundred,  
I rested under a tornado  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the god to be inside.  
Your salt is a sea shell filled with furious praise.  
Neither acrobat nor trouser nor black  
nor deep brown but cashmire.  
And a fractious cactus's heat will swim you.  
With its pale gather what is this metaphor but a memory harassed of its prizes?  
Our new dove, our manly evening star circles.
