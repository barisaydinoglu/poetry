The Hairy Aunt
--------------
The earth irreducable moldy bananas are impaled. Purity is gone, the subject has promised.  
I want you to dawn on my brow.  
And so that its flames will strike your mouth.  
I wish to make a circle  
in front of, and every sight, many  
times hidden in a garden.  
The thread knows this,  
that life in it's chalk boxes is as endless as the goblet.  
But the eddy set  
the memory.
