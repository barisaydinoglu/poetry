Language Without The Dominion
-----------------------------
Hated weather, fragmented lights like the ribbon.  
So the deedy wonder lives on in a cherry,  
the gleaming house of the current,  
the profound dove that is romantic and careful.  
It was a disintered business of lonely road and lances. Multitude of graces!  
In and out of the opaque sunburst orange the burnt umber and the sunburst orange  
and you enrich like a farm and you see eye as comfortable as the drizzle.
