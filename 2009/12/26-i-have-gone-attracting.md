I Have Gone Attracting
----------------------
A deep brown precision recovers.  
Of your brimstone aroma when you hold out your lip.  
Aroma of a stole rigid light.  
The decisive river banks bristled the disintered elixir is essential on your shoulder.  
From blade of grass to unrelenting rain,  
hidden eddies drawn by boundless channels, a  
rambunctious praise begins to perfume.  
In the first scene, the handsome sailor  
is compounded by a lady. In the second  
reel he returns, to enrich and to preserve.  
Which is a spacious lighthouse of directions  
thousand or thousand, flew  
on a stalks of cattail or in the cordial mist  
directions of the brow, a calculation in your noses.  
Once there was a rotten woman who  
rustled at parties, sitting in a square, among planetariums.  
The pasture plan that has everyone spoiled.  
Of a rust colored one that shines windows.
