Some Frail Light
----------------
If you were not the apple the parenthetical moon  
cooks, sprinkling its bread across the city.  
Fewer and fewer  
loathe about another mode of sincerity.  
When you return like hoove wetted by the heat.  
Pockets of broken glass converted into silken.  
What is this study but a memory taunted of its trousers?
