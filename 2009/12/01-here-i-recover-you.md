Here I Recover You
------------------
Brings all the lunges old warrior's medals. Relinquishing the light of her splendor full of felicity.  
But the coat blossomed the memory.  
Inside the starlight of the divisions where you sleep,  
a dream deforms into synonyms.  
You are the dry man of a bird,  
the sifted ness of the bed, the power of the lightning.  
He is outside us at this moment of first loving.  
Come with me to the nail of havocs.  
  
Like the lewd clay of doors full stop.  
In the middle of the furious curtain, many furious throats.  
  
To seek another land nothing but that mosaic of horses.
