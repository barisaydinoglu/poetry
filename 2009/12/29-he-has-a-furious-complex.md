He Has A Furious Complex
------------------------
My heart moves from being harsh to being original.  
Behind blue water and transparent echoes.  
The starry gem architecture gave it pride.  
Hear on the croaks that wait for you  
loitering the rambunctious chairs, shaking the doors.  
Always you throttle through the sunrise  
toward the morning pampering  
roses.
