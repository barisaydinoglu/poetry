Song For The God Of Putrid Smooth Broken Glasses
------------------------------------------------
But the flute awakened the memory. Enjoy the many tear stained attempts to breathe  
the resplendent cold fire.  
There is warm fortune in waking it. Multitude of awes!  
In and out of the crimson the blue and the cinnamon
