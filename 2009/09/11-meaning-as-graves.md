Meaning As Graves
-----------------
A landscape focuses its dream of a new beginning, its old ending, the new ending of the wreath order -  
its hidden roosters.  
They disguised it with sifted films.  
A thunder of love with its exiled divulge a landscape -like error  
I wish to make a tetrahedron  
within, and every meaning, many  
times hidden in a maternity.  
Fewer and fewer  
taunt about another mode of joy.  
Here I am, a fresh tail wiped in the sea of mosaic.  
Against the fragmented room of sifted film.
