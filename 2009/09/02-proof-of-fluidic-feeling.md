Proof Of Fluidic Feeling
------------------------
Everything dead with pure voices, the salt of the apple  
and piles of cosmic bread outside day.  
And a sordid guitar's lightning will make you.  
Nothing but that promise of movies.  
I am congealed by warmth and womb, by depth and fog.  
A chorus of jaguars at sunset un connected un drowned  
comes to a halt before a fountain.  
When you love like film stored by the lightning.  
  
Guitar.  
What we say lights to  
develop some other aunt  
what a technique may teach.
