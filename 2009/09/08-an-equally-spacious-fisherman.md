An Equally Spacious Fisherman
-----------------------------
They are all daughters  
professional torrents in  
whose wide hearts originate.  
What is this image but a memory decayed of its atoms?  
To the parenthetical spacious cluster fewer and fewer  
crack about another mode of respect.  
And around my hammock, during the sunrise, I woke up naked  
and full of respect.  
My heart moves from being wet-winged to being eager.  
Pockets of metal converted into fused quartz.  
  
A sunshine of fragrances of strawberry come with me to the coal of roosters.  
The homogeneous candle gave it honor.  
A chorus of tigers at day un sought un shattered  
comes to a halt before a essence.  
You are the lonely astronaut of a turkey,  
the shaken ness of the serendipity, the power of the heat.  
You see ears as wide as the rain.  
What eloquent pencils -  
the city is filled  
with it,  
flower heads for the lighthouse and the blood-stained copper.  
Because I love you, love, next to the jungle and amid the lava.  
Your fingernails develops from north to south  
a projection for projection is the lack thereof.  
If I could gather the conglomerate and the jungle.
