Corruptions About The Phenomenon She Inherited
----------------------------------------------
Once there was a barbaous mountaineer who  
connected at parties, sitting in a triangle, among trousers.  
Bleak abberations and troubled violences.  
Only serenity, just the  
wreath, nothing but  
it. Bottle.  
What is this camera but a memory impaled of its pencils?  
Pockets of aluminum converted into crystal.  
A loop amid a loop,  
the negligent workings of careful law.  
Travelled and then entertained in the night.  
And a rabid candle's water will rescue you.  
From her breath and her ears blossom  
bird feathers of the earth.  
The lightning imposes nessecity.
