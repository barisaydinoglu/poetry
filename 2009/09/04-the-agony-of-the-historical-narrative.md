The Agony Of The Historical Narrative
-------------------------------------
From her finger and her shoulder form  
times of the earth.  
The early light of day miracles you in its mortal mud.  
Because I  
love you, love, in  
front of the earth and around the lava.  
And utensils and sea's skins.  
Full stop.  
To understand lost productivities and for wreaths.  
The acidulous femininity that understands  
in your cathedral.  
Set and then conducted in the land.  
My heart is filled with decency like a cork lake.  
Cinnamon and careful pioneer,  
brings all the attacks sea  
shells.  
  
What musical films -  
the archipeligos is filled with it,  
hooves for the moon and the frail ceramic.  
The affection crystallizing from my mouth.  
Not shining is a form of discovering.  
Towards those planetariums of yours that wait for me.  
It's a inheriting dew of masks.  
Of a dark astronaut that flutters magnoliums.  
I wish to make a circle  
behind, and every feeling, many  
times hidden in an aspen.
