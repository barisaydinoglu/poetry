The Fear Of The Algorithmic Narrative
-------------------------------------
Of lovely lemon, spirit  
of the cactuss,  
abandoned god blood, your kisses  
form into exile  
and a droplet of glass, with remnants of the divisions. In the pampering depths.  
Pure seperation forms the energies when you perform like mist transformed by the heat.  
  
Land was no longer right at the transmission threshold.
