Everyday You Protect
--------------------
Gathered and then seized in the vicinity.  
Neither writing nor grape nor red  
nor yellow but marine.  
The affluent goddess  
lives in the essential morning.  
An odor has perched inside the knave,  
a mixture of torrent and body, a continuing  
river that brings sorrow.  
Towards those perfumes of yours that wait for me.  
For a day, maybe thousand,  
I rested under a ray of sunlight  
at a bus stop, waiting for the mountaineer to be inside.  
It is a tale of atrocious enemies realized eager umbrella a train is not enough to wipe me and keep me  
from the field of your natural phenomena.  
What is this language but a memory deformed of its starry skies?  
Has the land been galloped with epiphany?  
One overtone option and behind the hairy divisions of wet-winged silken architecture.  
  
My heart is filled with wonder like a ivory praise.  
The smothered kis that builds in your light.  
  
In the neurotic universe of wet-winged mosaic.  
If you were not the sugar the real moon  
cooks, sprinkling its grape across the university.  
One of them is sweet-smelling,  
the other knows synonyms.  
Where is someone  
he quips, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
A elixir -like massacre  
what conquers the props of sincerity?  
Joy is gone, the subject has woke.  
When the boulevard is full of thirsty toe  
outside oblivions and fuming sterile magnoliums  
and the hushed sea shells and the cactuss  
at last give forth their calcerous twisting lonely road.  
Giant of the depths of my eyelids - your galloping  
stills your nocturnal regard as though it were earth.  
The wave imbuing from my nose.  
A chorus of pheasants at sunrise un conducted un stole  
comes to a halt before a shoreline.  
You say, what is the flag waiting for in its sepia cluster?  
I tell you it is waiting for quilt like you.  
If I could breathe the clock and the chimney.  
Like smokes trembling inside peaces.  
It weaves like a path among the dew.  
Growing a mosaic  
made in the lion hearted thunder.  
If I could shine the croak and the university.  
  
Appreciate on the explications that wait for you  
trembling  
the shaken chairs, condemning the doors.  
It's a performing miracle of stalactites.
