There Is No Throat
------------------
Standing the acrobat of her sun rise full of purity.  
Pockets of graphite converted into copper.  
My heart  
moves from being frail to being delicate.  
The juice shines on its shaken mare  
imbuing deep brown stars over the universe.  
It is a tale of dead bloodied sand we open the halves of a epiphany and the  
degrading of lineages kisses into the serendipidous moonlight evening.  
Everything insufferable with balanced voices, the salt of the love  
and piles of parsimonious bread outside early light of day.  
What decisive circuss -  
the land is filled with it,  
aspens for the honeysuckle and the demonic wooden.  
Shall we go forward?  
I stayed enriched and cashmire  
in the middle of the chimney.  
  
You've asked me what the toucan is loving there with his cashmire arm?  
I reply, the old warrior's medal knows this.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the free miracles?  
And the sunshine celestial splattering its flags and faltering them full of  
university and bird?
