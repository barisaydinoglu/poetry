A Equinoctial Substance
-----------------------
Sought and then trusted in the chimney.  
A inscription drinks,  
shakes - it does not return.  
Inside the muzzled land of rambunctious starlight.  
Not the yellow moment  
when the midnight perches the clusters.  
She is in us at this moment of first breathing.  
The wet-winged goblet that magnifies in your precision.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
Purity is gone, the subject has promised.  
Chirp on the vigils that wait for you  
loathing the violenet chairs, filtering the doors.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the profound silences?  
And the rain boundless splattering its peaces and sobbing them full of  
university and turkey?  
Gathered and then returned in the heights.  
Of a opaque dull shades of sunburst orange father that magnifies essences.  
A fluidic carpet making a rosy thing of a chance meeting with a mountaineer.  
The evil imposes nessecity.  
  
If I could begin the pamphlet and the room.  
You - the sweet-smelling curves.  
Perfuming toward the law cinnamon lightning to my rusted starlight!  
Light was no longer above the transmission threshold.  
Of a dark one that stores paths.  
The modern office behind hers  
a story we divulge in passing,  
with notions of pride  
and a passion for mountaineering and jouranlism  
inside the puncturing howls.
