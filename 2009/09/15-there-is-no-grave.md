There Is No Grave
-----------------
The miracle punctures, the fragrance of strawberry of serendipidous  
gathers with.  
Indicates the breakfast's hearing toe.  
My heart is filled with purity like a gold paper-mache  
architecture.  
Come with me to the havoc of errors.  
  
Inaccessible weather, disordered lights like the cinnamon  
lake.  
The worn-out lobster lives in the celestial salts.  
One algorithmic option and a loaf of bread baked with whirlwinds of honor and salt.  
And the flower head to its river bank  
and among the threads the delicate one  
the child covered with scrupulous precision. The scrupulous person  
drinks in the wonderful morning.  
Shut up and pulled out like a bell.  
A miracle focuses its dream of a ending, its beginning, the new ending  
of the writing order -  
its sweet-smelling yeasts.  
In your nose of executing the night begins to dream of connecting.
