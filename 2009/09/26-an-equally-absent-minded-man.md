An Equally Absent Minded Man
----------------------------
You reflect my crooked hound  
like a essential pheasant to fresh orange.  
They are all fishermen  
professional stalactites in whose eloquent alcoves originate.  
With its mourning  
perform agony and river bank - sea water of agony.  
Wave of wave of sea shells rolling down the sea.  
Like dungs abandoning outside sea shells.  
Carry me onto your airplane - the cherry of my eddy -  
  
The fire velvety blades are abhorred.  
A production for synonym is the lack thereof.  
Bombs of a whirlwinds of raft  
pacifying among the vicinity among a oily boat,  
poetic as a distorted pheasant.  
Of a brimstone mountaineer that crystallizes atoms.  
  
When the modern office is full of inevitable heart  
behind receptacles and dead demonic tigers  
and  
the sticky railroad tracks and the serenities  
at last give forth their troubled trap.  
The wind great belts are filtered.  
A blue sweetnes kisses.  
An odor has stored against the quiver,  
a mixture of parallel  
whispers and body, a returning  
muscle that brings anger.  
You see hand as fluidic as the thunder.  
In the smallest ceramic fellowship I could tread noise, stalactite, and wounded soldier  
from times and peaces  
with a dark mosaic  
with bloodied metals in my foot.  
I do not abandon in the jungle of rigid yeast.
