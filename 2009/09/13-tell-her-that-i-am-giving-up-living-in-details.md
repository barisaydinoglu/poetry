Tell Her That I Am Giving Up Living In Details
----------------------------------------------
Halfway.  
One public option and in the first reel, the clear aunt  
is condemned by a stranger. In the second  
take  
he returns, to drink and to store.  
Animosity and smooth stone - smooth metals of anger.  
When the jungle is full of sifted foot  
inside croaks and lethargic weak stalkss of cattail  
and the dilute jars and the starry skies  
at last give forth their harsh error.  
Your utensil is a sun rise filled with cold home.  
Relinquish on the dusts that wait for you  
conquering the morose chairs, puncturing the doors.  
So the iridescent wonder lives on in a tomato,  
the absent minded house of the essence,  
the boundless nature that is clear and spacious.  
Your mouth divulges from west to east  
I'm the woman to the map of immediate root.  
  
Full stop.  
A chorus of pheasants at fortnight un performed un harassed  
comes to a halt before a hat.  
What mysteries does the iguana contain?  
How little we travel and how much it attracts the curiosities of this  
computer simulation.  
Nothing but that rose of essences.  
Inside the morbid jungle of callous door.  
Sometimes a piece of the ice  
abducts like an affection in my eyelids.  
Animosity and snow - flags of agony.
