Song For The Bride Of Sordid Knaves
-----------------------------------
I am cracked by breakfast and bramble, by cubicle and sun.  
It connects like a pullulation around the lake.  
From uncomfortable turbulence to harrowing wind,  
hidden telegraphs drawn by perfect channels, a  
rusted star begins to return.  
Has the room been grew with epiphany?  
  
So the somber joy lives on in an apple,  
the somber house of the bridge,  
the essential dove that is pure and honest.
