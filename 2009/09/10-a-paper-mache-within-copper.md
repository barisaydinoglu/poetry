A Paper-mache Within Copper
---------------------------
Multitude of necklaces!  
In and out of the yellow the transparent and the marine  
a vessel is not enough to crush me and keep me  
from the university of your delicate phenomena.  
Outside the faltering croaks.  
The modern office in front of hers  
a tale we divulge in passing,  
with notions of purity  
and a passion for jouranlism and mountaineering  
and you blossom like a flower head and but I should  
be true to photography, shattering among its acidulous sunburst orange lakes  
so let us begin to tell a story devoid of slightest redundancies.  
Your leg imbues from west to north  
  
Come with me to the dung of masks.  
There are many dusts inside hairy events.
