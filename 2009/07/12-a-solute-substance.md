A Solute Substance
------------------
My profound toe pulses you always.  
Like parallel vorticess dropping  
outside curtains.  
All currents become waxes.  
My heart moves from being hated to being friendly.  
Opaque opaque sand-colored oblivions of howl,  
blue seams  
above a tremulous droplet.  
Cashmire belts of lamprey,  
yellow seams above a rigid bird feather.  
So the real love lives on in an apple,  
the full house of the echo,  
the sweet-smelling perfume that is  
velvety and self-assured.  
Amid the dropping probes.  
Your brain continues from east to south  
A mist of books everything silent with enduring voices, the salt of the smooth graphite  
and piles of vertical bread within early light of day.
