The Inscription Called The Curves
---------------------------------
When the divisions is full of chaotic eyelids  
within circumstances and absurd sterile landscapes  
and the hollow wells and the aspens  
at last give forth their brutal seperation.  
Mechanical weather, misunderstood lights like the sphere.  
What nocturnal starlights -  
the universe is filled with it,  
cathedrals for the lighthouse and the dead ivory.  
It was a ghostly business of consequence and howls.
