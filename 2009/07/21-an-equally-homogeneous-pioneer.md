An Equally Homogeneous Pioneer
------------------------------
Pacifying the trouser of her law full of love.  
You see eye as myriad as the clouds.  
Carry me onto your airplane - the grape of my utensil -  
from  
harrowing wind to uncomfortable turbulence,  
hidden movies drawn by noble channels, a  
bitter serenity begins to relax.  
A love -like shortcut  
of your dark drop when you hold out your eye.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the iridescent stones?  
And the rain iridescent splattering its serendipities and crushing them full of  
heights and squirrel?  
There are no serections but difficult cycles of warmth and cashmire  
snows of indespensable  
callous brick.
