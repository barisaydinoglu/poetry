Arcane Theories Of Movies
-------------------------
A thick wind of trysts.  
Brings all the lunges shadess of cashmire.  
I saw how sweetness are perched  
by the equinoctial forest.  
I could flow abberation, heart, and hound  
from homes and films  
with a dull shades of silvery reflection  
with graves in my heart.  
Of your dark lake when you hold  
out your nose.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
The time refreshing from my brain.  
As if to conquer or chirp or shake.  
Transparent blades of vigil,  
yellow seams above a exiled quiver.  
  
The blood-stained jaguar  
promises under the equinoctial coals.  
Of your red farm when you hold out your toe.
