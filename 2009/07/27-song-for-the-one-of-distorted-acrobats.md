Song For The One Of Distorted Acrobats
--------------------------------------
I want you to enrich on my eyeballs.  
Fewer and fewer  
tremble about another mode of felicity.  
I was without doubt the elder jaguar  
there in the skeleton land.  
When it looked me with its noble magnolium eyes  
it had neither heart nor lip  
but saphire veins on its sides.  
Not to inherit or even meet  
the mist of one who dawns  
under me in a thicket or enchanting to a god.
