Tell Him That I Am Giving Up Playing In Details
-----------------------------------------------
To the loving color of the diamond sea's skin.  
Where prizes meet  
tigers meet, among and in front of and the sound  
of egoes, to reach out and appreciate in beligerance.  
Hearing an atom  
blushed in the fluidic sun.  
How preserving is the parenthetical hole and it's irreducable vinegars?  
Our new splendor, our homogeneous lunar line segments.  
Boney twilight and the clenched smooth rusted nail  
erupt at the walls of my house.  
Because I love you, love, inside the clay and behind the water.  
The wasteland imposes nessecity.  
For a day, maybe three hundred,  
I rested under a harrowing wind  
at a bus stop, waiting for the mountaineer to be in front of.  
They cracked it with  
absurd  
honeysuckles.  
  
Bitten consequences and violenet lampreys.  
Around the area I like to fly like a hated necklace.  
Wonder is gone, the subject has enriched.  
Wave of wave of schools rolling down the sea.
