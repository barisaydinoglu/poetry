Everyday You Breathe
--------------------
Clotting gates and insatiable wounds.  
From her lip and her breath divulge  
necklaces of the earth.  
On what boney coals blushed with ice? Some reflect but I shower your rusted nail like stalks of cattail.  
There are no circumstances but demonic cycles of ship and silvery  
silences of incredulous rigid iron.
