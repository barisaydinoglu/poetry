The Thorn Tree Fallen Into The Sea
----------------------------------
Sometimes a piece of the ice  
lunges like a light in my shoulder.  
A magnolium weaving will seize  
the wet-winged mud of a planet.  
For awe was absurd and morally neutral.  
Pulled out and pulled out like a smooth stone.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the careful burnt umber cars?  
And the mist serendipidous splattering its flags and loathing them full of  
heights and bird?  
I could form wounded soldier, throat, and croak  
from  
sea shells and fragrances of strawberry  
with a brimstone law  
with coffins in my brow.  
  
In the shoreline of the region where you sleep,  
a dream taunts into productions.  
How mixing is the absent minded alarm and it's spacious shadows?  
It travels like a tryst behind the splendor.  
Against the absurd room of boney coral.  
A projection for point of view is the lack thereof.  
I salute your aquatic peach  
and envy your musical pride.  
Realized boundless starlight indicates the utensil's flying curves.
