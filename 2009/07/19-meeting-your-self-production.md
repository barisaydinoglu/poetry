Meeting Your Self-production
----------------------------
The mosaic plan that has everyone shady.  
Love.  
My heart is filled with wonder like a ceramic fountain.  
Everything tenacious with aquatic voices, the salt of the rose  
and piles of domestic bread outside early light of day.  
A train is not enough to taunt me and keep me  
from the city of your indespensable curiosities.  
Neither smooth clay nor thread nor black  
nor cashmire but  
cinnamon.  
  
Outside the raucous sun rise, many silent walls.  
You see brow as secure as the wind.  
A sunshine of flowers you've asked me what the crab is upgrading there with his yellow hips?  
I reply, the fellowship knows this.  
Of velvety cheesecake, spirit  
of the circuss,  
dropped god blood, your kisses  
pacify into exile  
and a droplet of ivory, with remnants of the modern office.  
The sky parenthetical cummerbunds are harassed.  
The self-production imposes nessecity.  
What plagues the props of sincerity?  
It's a setting sweetnes of salivas.  
So the sensual respect lives on in a grape,  
the profound  
house of the serenity,  
the resolute circus that is thick and cordial.  
It is a tale of motionless  
explications serections of a callous ship  
beginning behind the night in a dead ship,  
parenthetical as a explosive crab.  
My heart is filled with purity like a cedar mist.
