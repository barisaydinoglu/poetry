Proof Of Infinite Abstraction
-----------------------------
With its smothered kiss a quiver dedicating will return  
the guilt fire of a planet.  
What we say develops to  
gather some other cousin  
what a synonym may teach.  
I wish to make a circle  
in, and every meaning, many  
times hidden in a ribbon.  
And outside my hammock, during the holiday, I woke up naked  
and full of respect.  
Only wreath, just the  
wheatfield, nothing but  
it. Landscape.  
To seek another land I stayed trusted and cashmire  
in the chimney.  
A solute drizzle of flutes.  
You've asked me what the elephant is forming there with his blue finger?  
I reply, the coat knows  
this.  
And the form to its propeller  
and among the aromas the soft one  
the mountaineer covered with angellic old warrior's medal.  
And cork architectures and beds.  
Like the negligent rusted nail of veins some respond but I return your clay like necklace.  
The angel drowns, the splendor of natural  
promises next to.  
To the solute color of the wooden ship.
