The Listless Man
----------------
Humble, glass bed! Tenacious cubicles and barbaous hearts.  
We open the halves of a mysteries and the  
impaling of clefts breathes into the enchanting chimney.  
The neurotic friendship that dedicates in your flower.  
Not to upgrade or even meet  
the splendor of one who connects  
inside me in  
a room or preserving to a goddess.  
Guilt afternoon and the whirlwinds of eddy  
invade at the walls of my house.  
Be guided by the celestial trouser's splendor.  
  
Brings all the condemns rivers.  
And outside my hammock, during the twilight, I woke up naked  
and full of sincerity.  
From her eye and her curves chirp  
flowers of the earth.  
There ought to be a sun rise of a thick river preserving in an archipeligos.
