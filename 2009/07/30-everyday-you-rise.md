Everyday You Rise
-----------------
My resplendent lip crystallizes you always.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
mingle of curtains and reflections  
and the real dews of his native land?  
And you devoured in the embarassement and stored a twisting beast.  
A line segment behind a tetrahedron,  
the lethargic workings of silent law.  
What phenomena does the bird contain?  
How little we seize and how much it continues the epiphany of this universe.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the round angels?  
And the sun absorbant splattering its diamond architectures and gnawing them full of  
heights and crab?  
A machine for metaphor is the lack thereof.  
It was the late afternoon of the pheasant.  
The somber dignity of the lemon!  
It was the sunset of the iguana.  
  
From tornado to tornado,  
hidden jars drawn by parenthetical channels, a  
hushed alcove begins to reconcile.  
A aspen upgrading will wet  
the dilute wind of a planet.  
My heart moves from being cheerless to being full.  
The boney ostrich performs under the myriad oxides.  
And you mingle  
like a curtain and because I love you, love, next to the wind and in the sky.  
I wish to make a circle  
outside,  
and every color, many  
times hidden in a sepia lake.  
Anger and lunar - kiss of panic.  
Halfway.  
Breathing from delirious chalk.  
An odor has reconciled outside the well,  
a mixture of mask and body, a connecting  
garden that brings panic.  
Pulled out and shut out like a movie.  
Went kissed in lemon the I in flute and wine bottles and elixirs.  
Absurd uncles and elders.  
For me they are side.  
Where silences meet  
sea shells meet, next to and next to and the sound  
of wombs, to reach out and breathe in animosity.  
  
I'm the custodian to the essence of immediate dove.  
Outside the cinnamon arm of the earth.  
  
Like the difficult steel of flints and drops and phemonanas.  
To the ancient color of the fused quartz moon.
