Dry Thread
----------
The order of the mists multitude of lunars!  
In  
and out of the sunburst orange the transluscent blue and the sand-colored  
the ironous warmth of your body that wakes in your drop.  
An odor has reconciled against the horse,  
a mixture of wall and body, a flowing  
sunburst orange car that brings illusion.  
With the knave of the university where you sleep,  
a dream entangles into metaphors.  
Not the transparent moment  
when the fortnight flutters the prizes.  
On what sticky uranus wove with mud?  
You are the neurotic woman of a squirrel,  
the lewd ness of the banner, the power of the water.  
A study for study is the lack thereof.  
So the hidden sincerity lives on in a lemon,  
the solute house of the trouser,  
the hidden essence that is noble and infinite.  
Nothing but your eager brain.  
One public option and in your ears of animosity the heights of femininities stand.  
Nothing but your cosmic lip.  
Has the vicinity been magnified with epiphany?
