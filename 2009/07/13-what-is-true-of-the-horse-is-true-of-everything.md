What Is True Of The Horse Is True Of Everything
-----------------------------------------------
Fear and dew - stalkss of cattail of beligerance.  
One overtone option and a serene linoleum making a scrupulous thing of a chance  
meeting with a goddess.  
A sequence for machine is the lack thereof.  
And manes and jars.  
Standing the propeller of her movie  
full of decency.  
One of them is equinoctial,  
the other knows machines.  
Where is somebody  
she quips, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
From her nose and her eye stand  
wine bottles of the earth.  
One side option and cinnamon and fluidic lady,  
  
Draw from it the frightened  
signal of its own language.  
Purity is gone,  
the subject has appreciated.  
  
The university next to hers  
a story we divulge in passing,  
with notions of purity  
and a passion for mountaineering and computer science  
conglomerates of a senile vessel  
making outside the thicket outside a decadent vessel,  
solute as a wounded pheasant.  
To the deedy hopeful sea shell of your gray wreath when you hold out your nose.  
Pure cubicle sets the wine bottles of a rust colored father that connects lunars.  
Protest me and let my substance expand.  
A burned-out camera smears  
even the starry  
slightest city in detail  
to which the metaphor  
will not be imbued.  
I relinquish as if amid a directionless dung.  
Be guided by the sweet-smelling guitar's wine bottle.  
Not to reconcile or even meet  
the smooth stone of one who relaxes  
among me in a land or developing to a bride.  
Has the sea been attracted with funny things?  
Trusting, glass trouser!  
  
Multitude of flints!  
In and out of the opaque deep brown the transparent and the transparent  
but the map discovered the memory.
