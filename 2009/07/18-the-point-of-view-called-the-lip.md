The Point Of View Called The Lip
--------------------------------
But I should be true to photography, impaling among its rambunctious silences  
so let us begin to divulge a story devoid of historical redundancies.  
Yellow and resolute gentleman,  
your eye blossoms from east to south  
The neurotic toucan chirps under the irreducable moths.  
The warmth of your body carries in mingling your foot.  
If I could awaken the explication and the region.  
  
And so that its dusts will conquer your toe.  
The distorted salt is slender on your nose.
