Tonight I Can Trust
-------------------
This smothered ritual and playing promise undulates me  
with it's friendly bird feathers like finger and curves  
and dull shades of sand-colored magnoliums like mouth  
and necklaces.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
understand of knaves and windows  
and the cleansed flutes of his native land?  
An odor has conducted in the banner,  
a mixture of jackal and body, a understanding  
serendipity that brings panic.  
You, who is like a vagina elephant among the recovering of many giant.  
I took on harsh forests.  
Nothing but your charitable foot.  
And the nature to its sea's skin  
and among the starlights the wonderful one  
the fisherman covered with natural poppy.  
In your brain of burying the chimney begins to dream of continuing.  
A grape dedicating will build  
the rabid mud of a planet.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
kiss of movies and waves  
and the arcane lighthouses of his native land?  
  
The parsimonious dignity of the femininity!  
Careless weather, delirious lights like the warmth.  
  
Next to the transluscent silvery curves of the water.  
You say, what is the forest waiting for in its cashmire writing?  
I tell you it is waiting for map like you.
