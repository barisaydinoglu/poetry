Some Parched Rustle
-------------------
Sometimes a piece of the jungle  
pampers like a promise in my mouth.  
The silent bird continues among the full trash barges.  
Child of the depths of my mouth - your treading  
stills your handsome regard as though it were lightning.  
You say, what is the atom waiting for in its sand-colored sphere?  
I tell you it is waiting for guitar like you.  
In your hand of beligerance the university of splendors mix.  
The round dignity of the sea's skin!  
For a day, maybe too many to count,  
I rested under a pillow of fog  
at a post office, waiting for the fisherman to be behind.  
Brings all the filters sweetness.  
Wave of wave of love rolling down the sea.  
The uncle smiles at the daughter  
but the child does not smile  
when he looks at the pheasant man  
and the silent ocean.
