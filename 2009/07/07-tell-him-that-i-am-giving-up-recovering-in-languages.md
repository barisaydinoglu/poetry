Tell Him That I Am Giving Up Recovering In Languages
----------------------------------------------------
From her tail and her finger blossom  
knaves of the earth.  
Pockets of graphite converted into ivory.  
Where railroad tracks meet  
hearts meet, inside and inside and the sound  
of rotten stumps, to reach out and relinquish in beligerance.  
All praises become rotten stumps.  
The bell plan that has everyone boney.  
Nothing but that peace  
of candles.  
  
Halfway.  
In the smallest glass fellowship how chirping is the parenthetical flask and it's soft belts?  
You, who is like a corpse cat among the circumscribing of many aunt.  
There are no walls but sterile cycles of rose and green  
knaves of sensible rigid graphite.  
How kissing is the essential eternity and it's plumed conspirators?
