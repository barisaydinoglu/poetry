Point Of View In The Historical Services
----------------------------------------
The order of the souls like noises coagulating among faucets.  
Inside the deep brown ears of the wind.  
The mud self-assured eternities are punctured. I saw how sun rises are transformed  
by the real  
springtime.  
Shut out and pulled out like a honeysuckle.  
Nothing but your round foot.  
And the river bank to its aspen  
and among the fountains the boundless one  
the one covered with perfect current.
