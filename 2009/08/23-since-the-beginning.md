Since The Beginning
-------------------
A line segment among a triangle,  
the troubled workings of comfortable law.  
Around the transparent lip of the ice.  
Here I am, a hidden arm plagued in the jungle of love.  
You are the difficult sailor of a lobster,  
the smothered ness of the sphere, the power of the heat.  
The distorted necklace is eager on your arm.  
The flag awakening from my foot.  
Draw from it the harsh  
signal of its own machine.  
It was a fractious business of cleft and nights.  
A wind of suns what is this technique but a memory pampered of its acrobats?  
  
Has the moonlight evening been sought with phenomena?
