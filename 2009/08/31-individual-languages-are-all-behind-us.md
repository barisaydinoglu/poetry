Individual Languages Are All Behind Us

Realized starry transparent lake evening star.  
A neon tree day  
a helicopter is not enough to wipe me and keep me  
from the university of your electric epiphany.  
I'm the elder to the snow of immediate dew.  
The universe outside hers  
a tale we speak in passing,  
with notions of happiness  
and a passion for engineering and science  
Full stop.  
A chorus of tigers at late afternoon un performed un soddened  
comes to a halt before a mirror.  
Waxes of a lewd ship  
rising within the universe outside a shaken raft,  
lovely as a rusted elephant.  
The clear leaf gave it tiredness.  
Pure dust plays the shadess of silvery it showers like a snow amid the silken architecture.  
Amid the dull shades of sunburst orange animosity of the thorn tree.  
I'm the custodian to the forest of immediate affection.  
And you disguised in the fear and shone a decaying shadow.  
Like fractious phemonana, corals  
I do not penetrate in the heights of melancholy wax.
