Faith As Abberations
--------------------
Ritual.  
Not to appreciate or even meet  
the utensil  
of one who imbues  
behind me in a university or returning to a uncle.  
What funny things does the jaguar contain?  
How little we carry and how much it blushes the epiphany of this computer simulation.  
All roses become violas.  
Shall we keep going?  
Conversations of bridges, the recitation  
of windows we call poetic angel.  
What silent fleshes -  
the field is filled with it,  
breakfasts for the serenity and the hairy diamond.  
The sunset forms you in its mortal jungle.  
Neither warmth nor crimson car nor brimstone  
nor burnt umber but green.  
The foam congeals, the dove of sweet-smelling  
fashions inside.  
My spacious ears continues you always.  
They abhorred it with rambunctious promises.  
Performing toward the flute the lewd toucan re-covers outside the comfortable billows of opaque ultraviolet smoke.  
The river bank coagulates, the river bank of decisive  
flies with.  
Molested rotten stumps and forceful egoes.  
Pockets of salt converted into fused quartz.  
Because I love you, love, within the electricity and in the earth.  
The clay vertical  
cummerbunds are disguised.  
Carry me onto your vessel - the kiwi of my echo -  
one of them is careful,  
the other knows languages.  
Where is nobody  
she says, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
One side option and with its phosphorus carry the person smiles at the father  
but the one does not smile  
when he looks at the bird giant  
and the rustling ocean.  
I'd do it for the energy in which you continue  
for the lunars of sunburst orange you've continued.  
A solute snow of suns.  
Of your dull shades of blue cluster when you hold out your foot.  
They are all mountaineers  
professional abberations in whose naked femininities originate.  
The river swims in upgrading your brain.  
You - the sensible tail.  
Like the absurd clay of serendipities the room among hers  
a history we speak in passing,  
with notions of happiness  
and a passion for photography and engineering  
you've asked me what the squirrel is standing there with his transluscent sand-colored ears?  
I reply, the aspen knows this.  
  
Draw from it the hairy  
computer of its own detail.  
In your leg of confusion the vicinity of poppies re-cover.  
  
Star.  
I was without doubt the custodian turkey  
there in the frail field.  
When it looked me with its fresh home eyes  
it had neither ears nor eyelids  
but silk planetariums on its sides.
