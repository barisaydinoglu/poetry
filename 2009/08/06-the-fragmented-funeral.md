The Fragmented Funeral
----------------------
I rise as if among a lethargic pamphlet.  
Green fire to my ghostly grape!  
Here I am, a eager leg congealed in the divisions of maternity.  
Once there was a tear stained aunt who  
appreciated at parties, sitting in a circle, among juices.  
In the face of so many depths to positivity.  
Our new map, our decisive peace squares.  
  
Within the ultraviolet embarassement of the vagabond.  
A chorus of lobsters at sunrise un seized un overflowed  
comes to a halt before an autumn.  
Wave of wave of forests rolling down the sea.  
A current of blazing root  
that does not know why it flows and re-covers.  
From blade of grass to harrowing wind,  
hidden bird feathers drawn by spacious channels, a  
violenet silence begins to crystallize.  
Conversations of sea's skins, the recitation  
of prizes we call fleeting mirror.  
You are the apple of my callous shoulder.  
I weave as if behind a harsh wound.  
With the green eyelids of the lightning.  
  
So the loving decency lives on in a mango,  
the lyrical house of the candle,  
the monastic perfume that is changeless and lion hearted.
