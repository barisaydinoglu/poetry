Appreciating Disordered Nostalgia
---------------------------------
The aroma knows this,  
that life in it's marble boxes is as endless as the wheatfield.  
A helicopter is not enough to brainwash me and keep me  
from the moonlight evening of your original epiphany.  
I saw how reflections are chirped  
by the celestial flower.  
A heart and a hips  
rustling the vicinity.  
  
Wave of wave of salts rolling down the sea.  
We open the halves of a funny things and the  
ignoring of martyrs circumscribes into the noble jungle.
