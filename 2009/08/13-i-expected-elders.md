I Expected Elders
-----------------
One of them is incredulous,  
the other knows points of view.  
Where is noone  
she exclaims, and when can we see what  
is going to happen? You - the nocturnal eye.  
Only bitter and to a  
mountaineer they take on time, three hundred years  
  
I want you to crystallize on my curves.  
A point of view rustles,  
shatters - it does not return.
