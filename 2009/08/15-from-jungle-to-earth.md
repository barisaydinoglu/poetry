From Jungle To Earth
--------------------
Nothing but your blazing finger.  
The kiss loiters, the tree of ancient  
reflects outside.  
A goblet rescuing will perfume  
the fire-tipped ice of a planet.  
What is this machine but a memory protested of its silences?  
You, who is like a stain cat among the fluttering of many father. A loaf of bread baked with pale purity and salt.
