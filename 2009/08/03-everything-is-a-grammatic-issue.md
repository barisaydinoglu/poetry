Everything Is A Grammatic Issue
-------------------------------
Return to the homeland of the fleshes.  
You say, what is the foliage waiting for in its yellow foliage?  
I tell you it is waiting for ritual like you.  
Next to the deforming clocks.  
It is a tale of whirlwinds of howls when you store dedicated like a pasture.  
Only acidulous and to a  
sailor they take on time, million years  
the order of the snows your heart upgrades from north to west  
this thirsty muscle and chirping dew dies me  
with it's fluidic perfumes like heart and mouth  
and opaque red lights like eye and stalkss of cattail.  
Because I love you, love, with the electricity and outside the water.  
  
He is in us at this moment of first connecting.  
All dews become holes.
