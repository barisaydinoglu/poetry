Expanding Putrid Nostalgia
--------------------------
Not chirping is a form of galloping.  
I stayed stored and marine  
against the moonlight evening.  
Deep  
brown trash  
barges of moth,  
blue seams above a difficult bridge. And outside my hammock, during the early light of day, I woke up naked  
and full of sincerity.  
You, who is like a trap ostrich among the trusting of many woman.  
Once there was a fragmented man who  
crystallized at parties, sitting in a circle, among quivers.  
The wound imposes nessecity.  
The iridescent flint gave it felicity.  
How  
gathering is the perfect wounded soldier and it's aquatic circumstances?  
  
The heart knows this,  
that life in it's fused quartz boxes is as endless as the river bank.  
From pillow of fog to uncomfortable turbulence,  
hidden forms drawn by fleeting channels, a  
sifted momentum begins to weave.
