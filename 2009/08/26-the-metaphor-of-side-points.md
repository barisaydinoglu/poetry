The Metaphor Of Side Points
---------------------------
I was without doubt the father iguana  
there in the directionless modern office.  
When it looked me with its cosmic lake eyes  
it had neither arm nor eyelids  
but emerald candles on its sides.  
I could entertain violence, circumstance, and explication  
from ripples and homes  
with a dark circus  
with daggers in my arm.  
She is outside us at this moment of first crystallizing.  
Multitude of waves!  
In and out of the green the transluscent deep brown and the opaque sand-colored  
I protect as if with a cheerless pin.  
A brain and a breath  
mixing the modern office.  
One alphabetic option and a loop inside a square,  
the pale workings of soft law.  
Nothing but your free brain.  
Sepia and stationary one,  
  
The charitable aunt  
chirps in the delicate morning.
