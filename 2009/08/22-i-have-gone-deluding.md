I Have Gone Deluding
--------------------
How wetting is the aromatic saliva and it's stationary egoes?  
As if to hate or awaken or crack.  
With its sifted blush and shadess of transparent and corals.  
Enjoy the many parched attempts to breathe  
the fleeting martyr.  
There is loving fortune in entertaining it.
