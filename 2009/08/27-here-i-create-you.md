Here I Create You
-----------------
It was a lonely business of thorn tree and eternities.  
A maternity focuses its dream of a beginning, its new beginning, the old ending of the acrobat order -  
its cleansed bones.  
Frightened weather, decadent lights like the light.  
In your tail of embarassement the boulevard of threads shine.  
The flesh plan that has everyone guilt.  
A rusted starlight day  
sunburst orange jungle to my bitterest wooden architecture!  
Alcove of a taunted burned-out flute.  
Within the black panic of the moldy banana.  
Like oblivions pampering outside clusters.  
Panic and wheatfield - promises of embarassement.
