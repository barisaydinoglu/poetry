The Camera Of Alphabetic Points
-------------------------------
  
Rejoice on the blades that wait for you  
mourning the arrogant chairs, overflowing the doors. My heart is filled with pride like a gem opaque cinnamon car.  
Of your blood colored serendipity when you hold out your foot.  
It was a wounded business of moth and billows of blood colored smoke.  
You are the exiled gentleman of a elephant,  
the shady ness of the coral, the power of the jungle.  
The elder smiles at the lady  
but the custodian does not smile  
when he looks at the elephant goddess  
and the inaccessible ocean.  
For a day, maybe too many to count,  
I rested under a ocean wave  
at a post office, waiting for the one to be behind.
