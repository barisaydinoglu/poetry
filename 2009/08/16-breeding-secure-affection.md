Breeding Secure Affection
-------------------------
As soon as the incoming spheres  
gives the historical indication.  
Always you tremble through the midnight  
toward the midnight ignoring mists.  
The hidden dignity of the saxophone!  
In your shoulder of beligerance the land of breakfasts mix.  
The muscle knows this,  
that life in  
it's silken boxes is as endless as the bird feather.  
A atrocious identity invades  
even the noble  
slightest sea in projection  
to which the metaphor  
will not be transformed.  
This dilute grace and returning mane deceives me  
with it's romantic hearts like foot and hand  
and blood colored friendships like ears and lights.  
The heart appreciates on its communist mare  
protecting burnt umber crowns over the night.  
Of a blood colored elder that refreshes umbrellas.  
I could grow lance, acid, and jackal  
from roses and bottles  
with a rust colored current  
with nougats in my lip.  
  
It inherits like a splendor outside the star.  
Not performing is a form of wetting.  
  
Only flower, just the  
elixir, nothing but  
it. Precision.
