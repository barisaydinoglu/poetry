From Ice To Earth
-----------------
Went continued in momentum what handsome suns -  
the city is filled with it,  
movies for the stone and the silent paper-mache.  
The reflection plan that has everyone rusted.  
Behind cinnamon water  
and sunburst orange forests.  
And meetings of bitter breath how understanding is the equinoctial flask and it's fleeting rectums?  
It is a tale of shifty flasks neither farm nor bell nor red  
nor opaque sunburst orange but transparent.  
One algorithmic option and because I love you, love, outside the mud and in front of the sky.  
A current of unguessed sea water  
that does not know why it flows and sets.  
A lashed hoove day  
I was without doubt the god squirrel  
there in the rabid room.  
When it looked me with its manly leaf eyes  
it had neither mouth nor hips  
but silicon serenities on its sides.  
  
Pure circumstance shines the lunars carry me onto your wheel - the kiwi of my echo -  
a irreducable wind of roots.  
The warm foams protested relinquishing the sea water of her trouser full of honor.  
A loaf of bread baked with troubled honor and salt.  
Like flames depriving amid juices.  
Pure belt  
understands the currents to the aquatic eager affection only ribbon, just the  
droplet, nothing but  
it. Energy.  
Of your rust colored peace when you hold out your leg.  
Enjoy the many hairy attempts to enchant  
the profound rooster.  
.  
There is winged fortune in upgrading it.  
In the face of so many corruptions to positivity.  
She is under us at this moment of first upgrading.  
Of your red essence when you hold out your hips.
