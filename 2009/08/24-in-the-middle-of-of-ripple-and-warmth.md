In The Middle Of Of Ripple And Warmth
-------------------------------------
It's a flying grace of extinctions. Enjoy the many inevitable attempts to create  
the sensible smoke.  
There is affluent fortune in continuing it.  
Because I love you, love, next to the water and among the ice.  
My heart is filled with sincerity like a marble tree.
