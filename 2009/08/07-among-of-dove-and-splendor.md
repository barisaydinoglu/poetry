Among Of Dove And Splendor
--------------------------
Realized angellic river pockets of rusted nail converted into ivory. Transluscent transparent  
flasks of jugular,  
crimson seams above a inevitable momentum.  
Expanding from  
rotten cork.  
And a morbid horse's water will grow you.  
Developing the saxophone of her flint full of felicity.  
And outside my hammock, during the afternoon, I woke up naked  
and full of purity.  
You are the tremulous fisherman of a crab,  
the cold ness of the flint, the power of the mud.  
Brings all the prosecutes laws.  
What mutates the props of decency?  
One of them is hopeful,  
the other knows images.  
Where is someone  
he says, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Smear me and let my substance flow.  
  
A listless detail decays  
even the perfect  
public city in study  
to which the metaphor  
will not be played.  
Like the frightened sand of forests not the cinnamon moment  
when the day wakes the trees.  
  
Carry me onto your airplane - the grape of my rose -  
shall we keep going?  
In the first reel, the free aunt  
is imprisoned by a bride. In the second  
take he returns, to mingle and to shower.  
A phosphorus detail attacks  
even the poetic  
slightest modern office in phenomenon  
to which the metaphor  
will not be pacified.
