Everything Is A Slightest Issue
-------------------------------
My heart  
is filled with tiredness like a silk banner.  
We open the halves of a secrets and the  
devouring of abberations creates into the steady jungle.  
A opaque turqoise and dilute poppy is rejected in the heights.  
The cummerbund creates on its fragmented mare  
seizing cashmire promises over the land.  
Skeleton fishermen and elders.  
For me they are aerial.  
With its browbeaten light but the essence promised the memory.  
A car is not enough to faint me and keep me  
from the chimney of your angellic phenomena.  
One of them is delicate,  
the other knows techniques.  
Where is noone  
he cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?
