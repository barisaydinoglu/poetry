The Protesting Of A Man Down A Heights
--------------------------------------
I do not condemn in the city of windy bramble.  
When you wet enchanted like a nature.  
Come with me to the throat of nails.  
To pulse lost coats and for doors.  
The umbrella knows this,  
that life in it's ivory boxes is as endless as the magnolium.  
With its calculating light my heart is filled with sincerity like a silken wheatfield.  
  
Not the green moment  
when the afternoon re-covers the acrobats.  
Be guided by the resplendent saxophone's school.  
From her eye and her eye mingle  
reflections of the earth.  
In your eyeballs of fear the vicinity of trees rescue.  
Marine jungle to my motionless propeller!  
Nothing but that lemon of veins.  
They are all fishermen  
professional stains in whose enchanting femininities originate.  
This calcerous splendor and pulsing starlight coagulates me  
with it's plumed schools like eye and eyeballs  
and ultraviolet natures like tail and hats.  
Transluscent cinnamon cities of vortex,  
sand-colored seams above a bitterest umbrella.  
Realized promising muscle the beast imposes nessecity.  
  
But I should be true to engineering, harassing among its silent souls  
so let us begin to divulge a story without technical redundancies.  
Brings all the executes flutes.  
You are the sterile stranger of a elephant,  
the putrid ness of the essence, the power of the fire.  
A serenity focuses its dream of a new beginning, its new beginning, the beginning of the sweetnes order -  
its spacious jackals.  
The propeller kissing from my  
hand.  
Here I am, a handsome brain erupted in the sea of splendor.
