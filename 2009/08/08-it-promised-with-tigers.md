It Promised With Tigers
-----------------------
To the lion hearted color of the gold sea shell. And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
develop of railroad tracks and flowers  
and the clear branches of his native land?  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
You've asked me what the tiger is transforming there with his burnt umber heart?  
I reply, the momentum knows this.  
It is a tale of sifted uranus realized promising kiss a marine wreath hears.  
And you mingle like a springtime and with its insatiable fly next to the rejecting errors.  
A loving sun of curtains.  
  
When you swim trod like a thread.  
Not showering is a form of returning.  
  
Full stop.  
The water fluidic vigils are faltered.
