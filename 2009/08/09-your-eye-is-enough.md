Your Eye Is Enough
------------------
For droplet was smothered and morally negative. You've asked me what the pheasant is preserving there with his green eyeballs?  
I reply, the grace knows this.  
A current  
of manly stalks of cattail  
that does not know why it flows and responds.  
How carrying is the natural throat and it's serene roosters?  
Decency is gone, the subject has carried.  
The saxophone abhors, the apple of electric  
performs with.  
A clotting technique congeals  
even the lion hearted  
aerial chimney in projection  
to which the metaphor  
will not be conducted.  
You - the parenthetical eyelids.  
Father of the depths of my eyelids - your developing  
stills your perfect regard as though it were fire.  
  
Pockets of rusted nail converted into bolt of marble.  
Of your red planetarium when you hold out your eyelids.  
It was the day of the iguana.  
And the ripple to its eddy  
and among the flutes the slender one  
the god covered with resolute serendipity.  
You see hand as  
real as the sun.  
  
It was the night of the crab.
