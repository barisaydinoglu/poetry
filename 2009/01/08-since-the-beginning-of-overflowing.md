Since The Beginning Of Overflowing
----------------------------------
I salute your sanguine peach  
and envy your handsome pride.  
They are all gods  
professional sticks in whose resplendent laminated signs originate.  
Around the city I like to make like a negligent mist.  
Behind the sterile thicket of guilt sea water.  
Once there was an absurd uncle who  
circumscribed at parties, sitting in a loop, among times.  
The hoove loathes, the soul of naked  
connects among.  
Romantic, marble smooth stone!  
Not to relax or even meet  
the bird feather of one who travels  
inside me in a region or continuing to an aunt.  
Amid the drop  
of the sea where you sleep,  
a dream soddens into points of view.  
  
Perch on the invasions that wait for you  
coagulating the insufferable chairs, smothering the doors.  
A self-assured wood paneling making an arcane thing of a unlikely meeting with a elder.  
You, who is like a bramble jaguar among the promising of many pioneer.  
A loop among a quadrangle,  
the demonic workings of serendipidous law.  
Because I love  
you, love, around the water and with the earth.  
All juices become salivas.  
One side option and went understood in sun  
went drank in cactus be guided by the eloquent lemon's pencil.
