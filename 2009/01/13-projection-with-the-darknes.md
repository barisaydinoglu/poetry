Projection With The Darknes
---------------------------
Deceive me and let my substance shower.  
From her curves and her foot blush  
phemonanas of the earth.  
Pulsing a pullulation  
reconciled in the perfect sun. The boneless elixir that weaves in your wreath.  
Blood-stained weather, cold lights like the form.  
And the old warrior's medal to its love  
and among the sea water the lion  
hearted one  
the elder covered with wonderful  
crown.  
Carry me onto your helicopter - the grape of my cactus -
