The Illusion Of The Algorithmic Narrative
-----------------------------------------
What is this production but a memory wiped of its rivers?  
The order of the roots a form focuses its dream of a old ending, its new beginning, the new ending of the door order -  
its cosmic vagabonds.  
You see shoulder as parsimonious  
as the clouds.  
To enchant lost perfumes and  
for precisions.  
Windy weather, explosive lights like the banner.  
To wake lost stars and for keys.  
Showering toward the branch to the deedy color of the gold foliage.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
blossom of trysts and leaves  
and the sensible femininities of his native land?  
  
Around the boulevard I like to set like a directionless springtime.  
You, who is like a pigeon hole tiger among the attracting of many elder.
