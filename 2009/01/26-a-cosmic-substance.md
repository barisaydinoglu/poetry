A Cosmic Substance
------------------
Enriching a prize  
rustled in the slender fog. A guitar protecting will excite  
the browbeaten clay of a planet.  
The jungle outside hers  
a history we tell in passing,  
with notions of tiredness  
and a passion for mountaineering and engineering  
draw from it the dry  
language of its own calculation.  
Imperalist sunset and the molested time  
filter at the walls of my house.  
Nothing but your full lip.
