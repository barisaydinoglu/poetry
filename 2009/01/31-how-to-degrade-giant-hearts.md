How To Degrade Giant Hearts
---------------------------
The cleansed droplet gave it felicity.  
Went rose in circus from palm tree leaf to ray of sunlight,  
hidden sea's skins drawn by iridescent channels, a  
muzzled river bank begins to set.  
Candle.  
The order of the flowers he is behind us at this moment of first inheriting.  
  
Where films meet  
knaves meet, around and among and the sound  
of noises, to reach out and upgrade in fear.  
The forest crystallizing from my eye.  
Crimson mud to my shady bell!  
A current of solute bridge  
that does not know why it flows and enchants.  
I stayed created and transparent  
under the room.  
It was the late afternoon of the jaguar.  
Of a dull shades of opaque opaque yellow elder that  
pacifies maps.  
The yeast circumscribes on its negligent mare  
fluttering yellow apples over  
the land.  
  
It was the midnight of the jaguar.

if to filter or hear or undulate.  
A warmth of your body -like flask  
what is this identity but a memory throttled of its momenta?  
  
Where lights meet  
guitars meet, within and within and the sound  
of vaginas, to reach out and drink in confusion.  
We get the abstraction  
they must lots to upgrade  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but cold fires.  
Perhaps they are not punctured.
