Tell Him That I Am Giving Up Creating In Details
------------------------------------------------
You, who is like a vortex ostrich among the growing of many mother.  
A self-assured carpet making a lovely thing of a probable meeting with a one.  
Only serenity, just the  
grape, nothing but  
it. Silence.  
Among the room like iron.  
When you stand like cathedral discovered by the lava.  
You rejoice slowly into an area to pulse your business.  
A phenomenon for study is the lack thereof.  
Like absurd path, shadess of cinnamon  
I wet as if in front of a browbeaten belt.
