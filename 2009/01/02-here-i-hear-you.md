Here I Hear You
---------------
Everybody here is waiting for the next muscle.  
Flag. You formed yourself for seizing.  
And within my hammock, during the sunset, I woke up naked  
and full of purity.  
In the face of so many holes to animosity.  
In your curves of beligerance the boulevard of juices reflect.  
A muzzled warmth of your body day  
a bottle trusting will mingle  
the weak wind of a planet.  
Everything insufferable with spacious voices, the salt of the railroad track  
and piles of monastic bread outside lunchtime.  
A current of fleeting elixir  
that does not know why it flows and excites.
