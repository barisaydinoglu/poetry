How To Devour Woman Eyes
------------------------
There ought to be a mist of an angellic echo fluttering in a universe.  
The round kiss wetted it's a connecting sea water of graves.  
In the smallest chalk utensil a door crystallizing will store  
the distorted fire of a planet.  
Outside the communist room of disordered serenity.  
  
Behind the banal grace, many chaotic bloody feathers.  
Enjoy the many barbaous attempts to pulse  
the enduring clandenstine.  
There is vertical fortune in appreciating it.  
When the field is full of calcerous hand  
around circumstances and decadent fuming suns  
and the rabid ships and the stalkss of cattail  
at last give forth their boneless convict.  
Not the sand-colored moment  
when the midnight lives the wells.  
Saxophone of a harassed hairy forest.  
Grace of a brainwashed distorted stone.  
There ought to be a circus of a smooth peace swimming in a room.
