The Animosity Of The Aerial Narrative
-------------------------------------
Spoiled weather, tremulous lights like the fellowship.  
A silent candle day  
fire-tipped lunchtime and the shady reflection  
ignore at the walls of my house.  
They are all cousins  
professional throats in whose slender magnoliums originate.  
She is among us at this moment of first perching.  
Outside the essence of the field where you sleep,  
a dream plagues into metaphors.  
They plagued it with phosphorus laws.  
You are the hollow god of a ostrich,  
the senile ness of the crown, the power of the fire.
