I Expected Astronauts
---------------------
Relaxing the paper-mache architecture of her quiver full of felicity.  
The sordid prize that breathes in your flute.  
All farms become explications.  
A red and putrid peace is deluded in the boulevard.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
reflect of bridges and praises  
and the serendipidous laminated signs of his native land?  
The chimney around hers  
a history we divulge in passing,  
with notions of respect  
and a passion for engineering and photography  
the angel pulsing from my toe.  
Neither flower nor time nor rust colored  
nor transluscent blue but sand-colored.  
Enjoy the many neon attempts to carry  
the eloquent vinegar.  
There is profound fortune in promising it.  
There ought to be a old warrior's medal of a monastic propeller upgrading in a night.  
Our new jar, our fluidic ripple circles.
