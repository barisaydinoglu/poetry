I Have Gone Reflecting
----------------------
Silent empire. The square functions to gather an architecture  
to its environment.  
Burnt umber fire to my hushed wine bottle!  
A sensual mist of trysts.  
A skeleton machine impales  
even the deedy  
overtone field in production  
to which the metaphor  
will not be drank.
