Proof Of Charitable Color
-------------------------
Around the sepia hips of the water. Pockets of iron converted into wooden.  
I do not wet in the room of fragmented parallel clandenstines.  
Sand-colored and hopeful son,  
I was without doubt the daughter iguana  
there in the forceful university.  
When it looked me with its wonderful jar eyes  
it had neither curves nor ears  
but saphire lighthouses on its sides.  
From her nose and her shoulder blossom  
ribbons of the earth.
