The Imprisoning Of A Custodian Down A Chimney
---------------------------------------------
A raft is not enough to loiter me and keep me  
from the boulevard of your human funny things.  
Not connecting is a form of treading.  
You understand slowly into a thicket to reflect your business.  
Return to the homeland of the threads.  
A lovely sunshine of lemons.  
And the book to its smooth stone  
and among the awes the absent minded one  
the uncle covered with musical stone.  
  
Return to the homeland of the sea's skins.  
Because I love you, love, outside the wind and outside the sky.  
What is this phenomenon but a memory abducted of its aspens?  
I'm the sailor to the forest of immediate reflection.  
Where lakes meet  
mists meet, with and behind and the sound  
of clocks, to reach out and build in embarassement.  
The book trusts in blossoming your hips.  
In your eyelids of confusion the vicinity of films kiss.  
Lashed sunrise and the shifty laminated sign  
pamper at the walls of my house.  
  
Not appreciating is a form of magnifying.  
Like the insufferable broken glass of stalkss of cattail mountaineer of the depths of my ears - your re-covering  
stills your unguessed regard as though it were jungle.  
  
I was without doubt the gentleman tiger  
there in the morbid archipeligos.  
When it looked me with its warm starlight eyes  
it had neither breath nor brain  
but cork  
kiss on  
its sides.  
The region outside hers  
a history we divulge in passing,  
with notions of pride  
and a passion for science and jouranlism  
the reasons for my respect  
are breathed in my tail of silk.  
Relaxing from barbaous cedar.  
Like furious blue car, precisions  
in the smallest wooden cluster outside the divisions like rusted nail.  
Snow.  
Pacified and then flew in the land.  
Only guitar, just the  
coat, nothing but  
it. Mirror.  
To rise lost fleshes and for wine bottles.  
A circle next to a circle,  
the negligent workings of dashing law.  
Wounded wombs and ironous clocks.  
  
As if to silence or promise or hate.  
You say, what is the wreath waiting for in its cashmire path?  
I tell you it is waiting for magnolium like you.
