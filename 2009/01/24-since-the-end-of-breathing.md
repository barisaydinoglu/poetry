Since The End Of Breathing
--------------------------
My heart moves from being blood-stained to being honest.  
You pulse my parched lance  
like a domestic cat to fresh apple.  
Pockets of clay converted into silk.  
Melancholy fortnight and the motionless juice  
wipe at the walls of my house.  
Always you protest through the lunchtime  
toward the midnight filtering salts.  
The rabid reflection is lovely on your brain.  
  
Went mingled in tryst with its mechanical form  
outside the lashed vicinity of wounded banner.
