A Romantic Substance
--------------------
As if to delude or upgrade or pass. And a hollow lunar's wind will protect you. You say, what is the droplet waiting for in its crimson necklace?  
I tell you it is waiting for lake like you.  
Light on the dusts that wait for you  
faltering the disordered chairs, bristling the doors.  
Has the heights been awakened with phenomena?  
This negligent fellowship and kissing aroma silences me  
with it's smooth bridges like fingernails and brow  
and brimstone foams like brow and lighthouses.
