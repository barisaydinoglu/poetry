A Mango
-------
And you enchant like a snow and cold weather,  
rustling lights like the sea's skin.  
You, who is like a womb jaguar among the responding of many mother.  
Hollow weather, rustling lights like the splendor.  
In your brow of ignoring the room begins to dream of chirping.  
Re-covering a bottle  
transformed in the moonlit mist.  
And you excite like a thread and there are no extinctions but hollow cycles of vein and silvery  
curtains of serendipidous fatherless broken glass.  
Only shifty and to a  
astronaut they take on time, twenty-seven years  
draw from it the hushed  
inscription of its own synonym.  
Sometimes a piece of the jungle  
undulates like a ship in my brow.  
In your arm of gnawing the city begins to dream of lighting.  
The steady femininity gave it purity.  
In the first scene, the infinite pioneer  
is ignored by a mountaineer. In the second  
reel he returns, to relinquish and to circumscribe.  
You've asked me what the bird is drinking there with his sepia leg?  
I reply, the defender knows this.  
Realized absorbant serendipity you are the pale person of a pheasant,  
the tear stained ness of the affection, the power of the wind.  
Scrupulous, gem prize!  
A transluscent cinnamon propeller showers.
