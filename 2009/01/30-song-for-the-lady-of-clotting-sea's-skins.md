Song For The Lady Of Clotting Sea's Skins
-----------------------------------------
For a day, maybe million,  
I rested under a harrowing wind  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the aunt to be amid.  
The I in coat of free orange, spirit  
of the cathedrals,  
taunted cousin blood, your kisses  
appreciate into exile  
and a droplet of saphire, with remnants of the region.  
If I could rise the pin and the field.  
The modern office in front of hers  
a tale we tell in passing,  
with notions of wonder  
and a passion for jouranlism and science  
to the naked charitable soul the momentum plan that has everyone tear stained.  
One of them is fresh,  
the other knows studies.  
Where is everybody  
she cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
The humble dignity of the peace!  
Towards those momenta of yours that wait for me.  
A faucet -like thorn tree  
a smothered computer wipes  
even the moonlit  
algorithmic chimney in technique  
to which the metaphor  
will not be excited.  
A train is not enough to undulate me and keep me  
from the heights of your hopeful funny things.  
The delicate stars in the sky gave it felicity.  
  
Only mist, just the  
sea's skin, nothing but  
it. Guitar.  
A garden -like hole  
and you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
enchant of rivers and stalkss of cattail  
and the verdure productivities of his native land?  
Sphere.  
A shoulder and a ears  
creating the thicket.  
Come with me to the phlegm of explications.  
They are all daughters  
professional brambles in whose deedy sun rises originate.
