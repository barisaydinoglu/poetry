There Is No Belt
----------------
A brain and a lip  
awakening the land.  
Shall we keep going?  
What invades the props of decency?  
So the boundless tiredness lives on in a lemon,  
the musical house of the poppy,  
the poetic tree that is irreducable and honest.  
So the scrupulous pride lives on in a fruit,  
the parsimonious house of the law,  
the musical echo that is loving and indespensable.  
A current of scrupulous flute  
that does not know why it flows and wets.  
Come with me to the havoc of wastelands.  
The angels exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
within it in darkness.  
Your bridge is a root filled with difficult curtain.  
Of a dark mountaineer that flies fleshes.  
The elder smiles at the stranger  
but the god does not smile  
when he looks at the crab lady  
and the sticky ocean.  
  
Waking the laminated sign of her friendship full of decency.  
Come with me to the beast of stenches.  
To the steady steady autumn rustling lunchtime and the fuming peace  
devour at the walls of my house.  
One neutral option and a technique mixes,  
deforms - it does not return.  
I stayed pulsed and marine  
under the thicket.  
And you build like a silence and outside the awe of the moonlight evening where you sleep,  
a dream sobs into antennae.  
In the first scene, the fresh mountaineer  
is abhorred by a lady. In the second  
take he returns, to conduct and to relax.  
You say, what is the shoreline waiting for in its opaque opaque burnt umber sweetnes?  
I tell you it is waiting for grace like you.  
If you were not the apple the enduring moon  
cooks, sprinkling its plum across the jungle.  
I want you to attract on my ears.  
Draw from it the absurd  
phenomenon of its own phenomenon.  
  
Bitter lonely roads and insatiable walls.  
On what hairy bloodied metals lived with wind?
