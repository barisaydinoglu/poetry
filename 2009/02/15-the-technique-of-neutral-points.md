The Technique Of Neutral Points
-------------------------------
You see curves as soft as the clouds.  
The imperalist bird performs among the deedy lards.  
It is a tale of windy ashes for  
flint was motionless and morally negative.  
A momentum focuses its dream of a old ending, its ending, the beginning of the banner order -  
its pure self-productions.  
Once there was a rusted custodian who  
drank at parties, sitting in a line, among momenta.  
Carry me onto your train - the cherry of my flesh -  
be guided by the serendipidous foliage's miracle.  
Brings all the scratches corals.  
In your fingernails of changing the heights begins to dream of setting.  
What smears the props of felicity?  
But the starlight seized the memory.  
  
In your mouth of sorrow the field of trees divulge.  
Shall we move on?
