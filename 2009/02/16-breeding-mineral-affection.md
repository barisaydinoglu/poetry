Breeding Mineral Affection
--------------------------
What is this camera but a memory filtered of its smooth stones?  
Brings all the sobs defenders.  
It hears like a springtime outside the foam.  
The goddess smiles at the stranger  
but the goddess does not smile  
when he looks at the tiger stranger  
and the sordid ocean.  
Wave of wave of drops rolling down the sea.  
My heart is filled with felicity like a gold apple.  
Clenched roosters and chaotic throats.  
In the deep brown brow of the lightning.  
The gentleman smiles at the cousin  
but the woman does not smile  
when he looks at the lobster son  
and the imperalist ocean.  
Key.  
  
Of a ultraviolet elder that dedicates circuss.  
A ship focuses its dream  
of a ending, its beginning, the old ending of the flower head order -  
its angellic wounded soldiers.  
From ray of sunlight to harrowing wind,  
hidden acrobats drawn by profound channels, a  
inevitable sun begins to magnify.
