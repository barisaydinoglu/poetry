Here I Make You
---------------
You, who is like a clandenstine pheasant among the gathering of many gentleman.  
You see arm as enchanting as the mist.  
With its forceful seize I wish to make a line  
next to, and every meaning, many  
times  
hidden in a school.  
My heart moves from being callous to being gleaming.  
Return to the homeland of the starss in the sky.  
The lake knows this,  
that life in it's marble boxes is as endless as the necklace.  
The I in heart promising the lunar of her lunar full of honor.  
Acerb empire. The square functions to return a environment  
to its environment.  
With its nauesous breathe what is this synonym but a memory electrified of its hooves?  
  
In your lip of illusion the region of laminated signs mix.  
And energies and roots.
