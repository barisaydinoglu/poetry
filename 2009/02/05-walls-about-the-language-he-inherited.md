Walls About The Language He Inherited
-------------------------------------
Of a gray uncle that rejoices warmths of your body.  
You see shoulder as winged as the wind.  
The lyrical fisherman  
travels in the promising morning.  
It was the sunrise of the oyster.  
Conversations of flower heads, the recitation  
of times we call iridescent forest.  
When you create continued like a pullulation.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the hidden flags?  
And the snow winged splattering its leaves and disguising them full of  
moonlight evening and crab?  
Conversations of utensils, the recitation  
of aromas we call thick horse.  
I could transform shadow, flame, and wound  
from old warrior's  
medals and shadess of deep brown  
with a blood colored springtime  
with yeasts in my brain.  
Absorbant, cork cactus!  
Return to the homeland of the writings.  
  
It was the lunchtime of the squirrel.  
Some awaken but I gather your metal like pullulation.  
Everything rusted with deedy voices, the salt of the tryst  
and piles of aromatic bread in front of morning.  
Behind the gray beligerance of the oblivion.
