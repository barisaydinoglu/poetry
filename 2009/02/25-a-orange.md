A Orange
--------
All flower heads  
become cadavers. You've asked me what the squirrel is returning there with his burnt umber toe?  
I reply, the heart knows this.  
Fire-tipped lards and muzzled scandalmongerings.  
Once there was a bitterest custodian who  
mixed at parties, sitting in a line segment, among planetariums.  
A sensual wood paneling making a boundless thing of a probable meeting with a child.
