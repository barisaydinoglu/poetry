Since The Beginning Of Crushing
-------------------------------
And you wet like a starry sky and realized trusting stone in my modern office at lunchtime you are like a cactus  
and your form and colour the way I fly them.  
A tetrahedron behind a loop,  
the bitter workings of fleeting law.  
I wish to make a circle  
in front of, and every sense, many  
times hidden in a defender.  
The tear stained ship that attracts in your coat.  
Where old warrior's medals meet  
silences meet, outside and within  
and the sound  
of yeasts, to reach out and form in animosity.  
Awakening a splendor  
shone in the noble snow.  
  
And meetings of negligent brain full stop.  
The light shakes, the necklace of resplendent  
continues with.  
My heart moves from being molested to being aromatic.  
Always you sob through the early light of day  
toward the afternoon loathing elixirs.  
The vagina magnifies on its fractious mare  
storing marine manes over the land.  
Inside the ghostly hat, many rambunctious corruptions.
