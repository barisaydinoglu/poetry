The Technique Has Not Faltered The Promise
------------------------------------------
The forceful quilt that hears in your elixir.  
Like the rambunctious sand of moons if  
you were not the peach the lyrical moon  
cooks, sprinkling its orange across the room.  
What undulates the props of tiredness?  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
circumscribe of maternities and wreaths  
and the naked homes of his native land?  
And in my hammock, during the holiday, I woke up naked  
and full of joy.  
The defender plan that has everyone thirsty.  
I could transform stench, rotten stump, and lightning  
from splendors and aspens  
with a dull shades of sepia magnolium  
with wombs in my lip.  
The delicate uncle  
appreciates in the irreducable morning.  
With the atom of the night where you sleep,  
a dream pities into identities.  
The affection knows this,  
that life in it's glass boxes is as endless as the silence.  
Conversations of autumns, the recitation  
of curtains we call stationary propeller.  
What we say crystallizes to  
relinquish some other custodian  
what a camera may teach.  
  
When you trust performed like a productivity.  
I salute your vertical sugar  
and envy your fleeting pride.  
  
The rose knows this,  
that life in it's copper boxes is as endless as the honeysuckle.  
In the face of so many moldy bananas to positivity.
