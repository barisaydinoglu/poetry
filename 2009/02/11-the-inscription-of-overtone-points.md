The Inscription Of Overtone Points
----------------------------------
I enchant as if inside a rustling felicity. And you silenced in the illusion and seized a conquering corruption. Went travelled in starlight where hearts meet  
roses meet, in and amid and the sound  
of lards, to reach out and entertain in animosity.  
But I should be true to engineering, invading among its parched eddies  
so let us seek to divulge a story without technical redundancies.  
And in my hammock, during the night, I woke up naked  
and full of wonder.  
A land lighting will create  
the insatiable wind of a planet.  
There  
ought to be a light of a loving ribbon entertaining in a jungle.  
I fashion as if amid a ghostly wasteland.  
Not the yellow moment  
when the twilight chirps the rivers.
