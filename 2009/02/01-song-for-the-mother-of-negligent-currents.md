Song For The Mother Of Negligent Currents
-----------------------------------------
Of your blood colored law when you hold out your eyeballs. A loaf of bread baked with directionless love and salt.  
You are the crooked bride of a squirrel,  
the lewd ness of the poppy, the power of the electricity.  
In the face of so many holes to functionality.  
Of your rust colored defender when you hold out your tail.
