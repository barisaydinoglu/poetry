What Is True Of The Propeller Is True Of Everything
---------------------------------------------------
When you pulse like landscape dawned by the water.  
It was the midnight of the cat.  
I am silenced by branch and utensil, by lightning and fog.  
As soon as the incoming sea shells  
gives the grammatic indication.  
You refresh in the archipeligos as in  
a eager sea.  
Enrich on the bombs  
that wait for you  
conquering the calcerous chairs, invading the doors.  
A clouds of necklaces only path, just the  
farm, nothing but  
it. Starlight.  
It is a tale of demonic stalactites a mosaic focuses its dream of a new ending, its new ending, the beginning of the river order -  
its serene coals.  
To seek another land the juice knows this,  
that life in it's chalk boxes is as endless as the angel.  
  
It was the morning of the cat.  
Because I love you, love, within the wind and amid the clay. Drop me and let my substance perform.
