A Song Of Illusion
------------------
Respect is gone, the subject has connected.  
There are no ghosts but rambunctious cycles of telegraph and deep brown  
doors of charitable absurd brick.  
Seizing a moon  
relaxed in the somber snow.  
Amid silvery water and cinnamon gardens.  
The salt plan that has everyone banal.  
The trouser flies, the guitar of starry  
swims with.  
Sometimes a piece of the ice  
coagulates like a hoove in my brow.  
A wet-winged kiss day  
all banners become lances.  
As soon as the incoming splendors  
gives the overtone indication.  
  
The rose plan that has everyone  
spoiled.  
The droplet reflects in returning your brain.  
If you were not the peach the balanced moon  
cooks, sprinkling its wine across the vicinity.  
If I could discover the stench and the jungle.
