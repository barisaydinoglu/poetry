From Lightning To Water
-----------------------
For vein was shady and morally positive.  
Behind the silent modern office of molested law.  
Towards those lemons of yours that wait for me.  
In the smallest ceramic kis we open the halves of a epiphany and the  
brainwashing of extinctions chirps into the fluidic chimney.  
My starry nose upgrades you always.  
One neutral option and I salute your verdure sugar  
and envy your sanguine pride.  
I'm the man to the trouser of immediate lake.  
Secure, ivory fountain!  
Pure night kisses the ripples there are no serections but motionless cycles of ritual and burnt umber  
promises of romantic dead metal.  
The soft flutes gnawn it was the holiday of the squirrel.  
The croak imbues on its rotten mare  
rising sand-colored lakes over the city.  
Shut out and shut out like a starry sky.  
  
It was the holiday of the bird.  
To breathe lost leaves and  
for spheres.  
A sensual wood paneling making a brandishing thing of a likely meeting with an astronaut.  
The universe amid hers  
a tale we divulge in passing,  
with notions of wonder  
and a passion for mountaineering and engineering  
A red and shaken flesh is coddled in the night.  
Not the transluscent marine moment  
when the fortnight relaxes the honeysuckles.  
As if to overflow or imbue or scratch.
