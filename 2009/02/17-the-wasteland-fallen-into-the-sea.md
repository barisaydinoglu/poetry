The Wasteland Fallen Into The Sea
---------------------------------
If I could live the massacre and the night.  
I do not abolish in the divisions of forceful granule.  
Around the sea I like to dawn like a pale sea's skin.  
It was a sterile business of shadow and torrents.  
To seek another land around the area I like to travel like a ghostly sea's skin.  
Pamphlets of a bruised helicopter  
standing outside the land with a wounded helicopter,  
hidden as a skeleton ostrich.  
My heart is filled with sincerity like a cork garden.  
Amid the yellow mouth of the sky.  
For book was arrogant and morally negative.  
The mask imposes nessecity.  
Return to the homeland of the essences.  
  
The wasteland swims on its burned-out mare  
carrying burnt umber echoes over the boulevard.  
To the naked color of the gem sweetnes.
