An Equally Wide Elder
---------------------
There are many depths with ironous events.  
Neither love nor form nor ultraviolet  
nor yellow but sand-colored.  
I was without doubt the pioneer elephant  
There in the crooked jungle.  
When it looked me with its soft railroad track eyes  
it had neither fingernails nor curves  
but glass drops on its sides.  
From her toe and her finger relinquish  
atoms of the earth.
