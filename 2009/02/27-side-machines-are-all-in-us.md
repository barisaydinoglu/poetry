Side Machines Are All In Us
---------------------------
Of a dark father that enchants graces.  
The order of the warmths of your body in the smallest fused quartz salt and you stand like a silence and with its hairy preserve in the face of so many flames to positivity.  
A boat is not enough to pity me and keep me  
from the universe of your moonlit curiosities.  
With  
its lewd perfume a loaf of bread baked with disintered joy and salt.
