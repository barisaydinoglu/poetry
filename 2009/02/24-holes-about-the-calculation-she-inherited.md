Holes About The Calculation She Inherited
-----------------------------------------
The reasons for my respect  
are fluttered in my eyeballs of cork.  
One of them is resplendent,  
the other  
knows machines.  
Where is noone  
she quips, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
And so that its funerals will shatter your eye.  
An odor has continued in the middle of the moon,  
a mixture of parallel legumes and body, a galloping  
sea's skin that brings illusion.  
Not reconciling is a form of promising.  
Only neon and to a  
elder they take on time, too many to count years  
brings all the forces wheatfields.
