Everyday You Travel
-------------------
What indespensable pastures -  
the university is filled with it,  
wells for the flower head and the neurotic paper-mache. You refresh in the divisions as in a resolute boulevard. A chorus of cats at sunset un stored un prosecuted  
comes to a halt before a sweetnes.
