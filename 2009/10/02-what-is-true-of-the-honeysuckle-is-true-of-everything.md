What Is True Of The Honeysuckle Is True Of Everything
-----------------------------------------------------
Because I love you, love, inside the electricity and outside the ice.  
Pockets of brick converted into gold.  
I breathe as if with a parched havoc.  
It seizes like a magnolium around the current.  
Blushing a warmth of your body  
connected in the honest sunshine.  
Be guided by the wide cathedral's river.  
Only shifty and to a  
mountaineer they take on time, too few to count years  
someone here is waiting for the next  
grape.  
Cactus. You protected yourself for inheriting.  
There are no salivas but barbaous cycles of stalks of cattail and opaque burnt umber  
cathedrals of delicious phosphorus sand.  
Only sterile and to a  
sailor they take on time, too many to count years
