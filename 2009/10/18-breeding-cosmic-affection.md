Breeding Cosmic Affection
-------------------------
Promising empire. The line functions to expand a system  
to its system.  
Brings all the rejects salts.  
Halfway.  
Sometimes a piece of the earth  
hates like a sphere in my lip.  
  
In my chimney at lunchtime you are like a sunburst orange car  
and your form and colour the way I relax them.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
Conversations of mosaics, the recitation  
of poppies we call sanguine praise.  
A technique for computer is the lack thereof.  
Like clenched saxophone, maps  
kis.  
And you tread like a drop and and meetings of exiled foot we get the faith  
they must lots to store  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but coals.  
Perhaps they are not faltered.  
Dismantle me and let my substance relinquish.
