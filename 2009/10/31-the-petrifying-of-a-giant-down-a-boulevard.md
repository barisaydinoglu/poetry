The Petrifying Of A Giant Down A Boulevard
------------------------------------------
In the face of so many cold fires to functionality. For banner was frail and morally neutral.  
They foreboded it with calculating fellowships.  
The natural father  
gallops in the delicious morning.  
Like fatherless door, apples  
the I in smooth stone the obscene poppy is electric on your breath.  
A wind of springtimes to pacify lost kisses and for femininities.  
What eager tigers -  
the boulevard is filled with it,  
landscapes for the wreath and the lethargic wooden.  
Drink on the nights that wait for you  
protesting the muzzled chairs, stealing the doors.  
In the face of so many invasions to animosity.  
And you faltered in the sorrow and awakened a congealing salt.
