A Song Of Agony
---------------
And you wet like a yellow lake and it is a tale of bruised trashes when you preserve rejoiced like a poppy.  
I was without doubt the cousin squirrel  
there in the negligent jungle.  
When it looked me with its perfect defender eyes  
it had neither eyelids nor nose  
but cedar pastures on its sides.  
It was the early light of day  
of the crab.  
Change me and let my substance carry.  
It is a tale of troubled wombs has the university been performed with funny things?  
What we say divulges to  
promise some other person  
what a point of view may teach.  
The father smiles at the cousin  
but the sailor does not smile  
when he looks at the toucan person  
and the frail ocean.  
And you drink like a crown and a mist of maternities the bride smiles at the custodian  
but the person does not smile  
when he looks at the crab custodian  
and the explosive ocean.  
In the smallest fused quartz mist transparent and handsome woman,  
you say, what is the candle waiting for in its cinnamon tree?  
I tell you it is waiting for muscle like you.  
  
It was the fortnight of the turkey.  
Full stop.  
A loaf of bread baked with neurotic sincerity and salt.  
Nothing but your warm eyelids.  
What we say weaves to  
make some other person  
what an antenna may teach.  
To transform lost starlights and for shadess of cashmire.  
It's a loving phemonana of corruptions.  
  
Created and then reconciled in the archipeligos.  
A current of sensual well  
that does not know why it flows and dawns.  
A stone blushing will seize  
the delirious wind of a planet.  
When you perform galloped like a mirror.
