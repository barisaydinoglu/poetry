I Have Gone Chirping
--------------------
Garden was no longer right at the recording threshold.  
Where affections meet  
drops meet, next to and inside and the sound  
of lampreys, to reach out and shower in sorrow.  
In the smallest wooden school congeal me and let my substance weave.  
Conversations of circuss, the recitation  
of banners we call homogeneous fountain.  
With its smothered love I was without doubt the man turkey  
there in the morbid heights.  
When it looked me  
with its moonlit snow eyes  
it had neither curves nor brain  
but gem quilts on its sides.  
To the absent minded color of the ivory door.  
Sometimes a piece of the lava  
dies like a perfume in my eye.
