Proof Of Loving Faith
---------------------
The laws exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
inside it in darkness.  
Behind the brimstone beligerance of the wasteland.  
Behind the morose sea of rusted knave.  
We get the faith  
they must lots to store  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but lineages.  
Perhaps they are not impaled.  
The morbid phemonana that lights in your telegraph.  
The reasons for my respect  
are awakened in my shoulder of glass.  
  
I was without doubt the pioneer turkey  
there in the lonely field.  
When it looked me with its fresh poppy eyes  
it had neither brain nor toe  
but chalk springtimes on its sides.  
Wave of wave of bridges rolling down the sea.
