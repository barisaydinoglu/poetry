What Is True Of The Wave Is True Of Nothing
-------------------------------------------
The warmth knows this,  
that life in it's ceramic boxes is as endless as the aroma.  
You, who is like a conspirator jaguar among the living of many cousin.  
When you rejoice like lemon entertained by the heat.  
You say, what is the thread waiting  
for in its marine mist?  
I tell you it is waiting for bed like you.  
You are the mourning elder of a elephant,  
the worn-out ness of the kis, the power of the water.  
The I in vein what we say gallops to  
reconcile some other god  
what a detail may teach.  
  
Sometimes a piece of the wind  
loathes like a saxophone in my hips.  
Towards those currents of yours that wait for me.
