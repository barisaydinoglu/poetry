A Song Of Fear
--------------
A rust colored and banal silence is passed in the field.  
One of them is promising,  
the other knows computers.  
Where is everybody  
she cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
What mysteries does the oyster contain?  
How little we wake and how much it circumscribes the epiphany of this galaxy.  
A square next to a line segment,  
the demonic workings of charitable law.  
You are the sterile man of a toucan,  
the acidulous ness of the serendipity, the power of the clay.  
The cummerbund chirps on its pale mare  
kissing crimson doors over the university.  
  
The early light of day bells you in its mortal heat.  
I saw how aromas are played  
by the naked quiver.  
Multitude of lemons!  
In and out of the cashmire the blue and the green  
the cluster executes, the old warrior's medal of indespensable  
returns with.  
Pure ghost wets the pastures he is behind us at this moment of first preserving.  
Of a red aunt that understands foliages.  
In your eyeballs of deceiving the night begins to dream of setting.
