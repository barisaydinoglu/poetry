An Equally Poetic Astronaut
---------------------------
Conversations of cathedrals, the recitation  
of essences we call blazing stalks of cattail.  
If I could enrich the moldy banana and the night.  
Behind the blood colored panic of the enemy.  
Here I am, a winged tail scratched in the land of apple.  
The burned-out elephant makes outside the acerb walls.  
One of them is equinoctial,  
the other knows antennae.  
Where is someone  
he exclaims, and when can we  
see what  
is going to happen?  
Blue shrapnels of bramble,  
cashmire seams above a melancholy friendship.  
You've asked me what the pheasant is rising there with his transparent hand?  
I  
reply, the honeysuckle knows this.  
The sunrise wells you in its mortal sky.  
So the sanguine respect lives on in a orange,  
the human house of the writing,  
the nocturnal snow that is secure and secure.
