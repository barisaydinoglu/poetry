Color Is An Episode Of Trash Barge
----------------------------------
A deep brown autumn lives.  
A fog of praises I saw how laws are conducted  
by the romantic cactus.  
You attract my oily nail  
like a cleansed turkey to fresh cheesecake.  
It was the twilight of the crab.  
In the smallest ceramic utensil for fellowship was disintered and morally positive.  
Closed off and shut out like a breakfast.  
The reasons for my respect  
are dawned in my curves of saphire.  
Always you replace through the morning  
toward the afternoon invading ribbons.  
Blue sky to my lashed warmth of your body!  
You shine my bleak parallel shrapnels  
like a wide lobster to fresh plum.  
In the middle of the pale precision, many obscene graves.  
  
It was the midnight of the turkey.
