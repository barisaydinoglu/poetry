The Epiphany Of The Field
-------------------------
I saw how roses are attracted  
by the real stars in the sky.  
To the absent minded color of the emerald tree.  
You imbue in the city as in a solute chimney.  
Of fluidic plum, spirit  
of the foliages,  
compounded uncle blood, your kisses  
shine into exile  
and a droplet of glass, with remnants of the land.  
A triangle outside a tetrahedron,  
the guilt workings of serene law.  
The midnight drops you in its mortal earth.  
What chains the props of joy?
