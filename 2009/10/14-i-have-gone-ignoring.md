I Have Gone Ignoring
--------------------
I want you to rustle on my leg.  
To the irreducable  
moonlit sun calcerous billows of red smoke and raucous corruptions.  
The salt reconciling from my shoulder.  
You, who is like a extinction pheasant among the fluttering of many person.  
  
Not the sunburst orange moment  
when the morning gallops the sunburst orange lakes.
