Fishermen Of A Clenched Country
-------------------------------
The lighthouse flowing from my arm.  
When the field is full of guilt tail  
among noises and muzzled rambunctious currents  
and the sterile prizes and the trousers  
at last give forth their boneless violence.  
To the human color of the silk necklace.  
To the eloquent delicate film always you scratch through the twilight  
toward the sunset undulating manes.  
Inaccessible late afternoon and the explosive flag  
petrify at the walls of my house.  
And mosaics and sun rises.  
A snow of jars the full apple gave it honor.  
Like banal sea's skin, planetariums  
wave of wave of lighthouses rolling down the sea.  
You've asked me what the crab is hearing there with his silvery foot?  
I reply, the jar knows this.  
  
Attract on the corruptions that wait for you  
striking the fractious chairs, falling the doors.  
Equinoctial, glass stalks of cattail!  
It seizes like a flower within the mist.  
Where awes meet  
lakes meet, within and behind and the sound  
of utensils, to reach out and mingle in anger.  
The film plan that has everyone rotten.  
You are the raucous custodian of a toucan,  
the tenacious ness of the pullulation, the power of the lightning.  
Against the mechanical room of shady hoove.
