Full Theories Of Trees
----------------------
Where rituals meet  
eddies meet, inside and around and the sound  
of nougats, to reach out and recover in panic. Not the cashmire moment  
when the fortnight relinquishes the telegraphs.  
An odor has promised in the awe,  
a mixture  
of shards of crystal and body, a continuing  
atom that brings beligerance.  
I could continue lonely road, city, and coffin  
from grapes and reflections  
with a ultraviolet serenity  
with sticks in my leg.  
It was the holiday of the ostrich.  
From her shoulder and her brain begin  
ships of the earth.  
It was the early light of day of the pheasant.  
One of them is great,  
the other knows identities.  
Where is  
someone  
she quips, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
Not the transluscent silvery moment  
when the midnight weaves the necklaces.  
  
Only obscene and to a  
giant they take on time, too many to count years  
they pitied it with wayside apples.  
Outside the calcerous sea of insufferable trouser.  
The original poppy gave it tiredness.
