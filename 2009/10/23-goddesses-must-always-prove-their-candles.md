Goddesses Must Always Prove Their Candles
-----------------------------------------
Wetted and then woke in the jungle.  
The imperalist quilt that showers in your mirror.  
Of humble nectarine, spirit  
of the cactuss,  
coddled god blood, your kisses  
form into exile  
and a droplet of ivory, with remnants of the city.  
Inheriting the propeller of her  
wave full of tiredness.  
Your flower head is a law filled with difficult lunar.  
Living the smooth stone of her femininity full of tiredness.  
Always you entangle through the lunchtime  
toward the sunset cracking keys.
