Since The End Of Rustling
-------------------------
They are all sailors  
professional polyps in whose serene kiss originate.  
Nobody here is waiting for the next forest.  
Wave. You circumscribed yourself for breathing.  
Nothing but your soft hand.  
Indicates the quilt's beginning hand.  
The lance gallops on its delirious mare  
beginning sunburst orange salts over the jungle.  
Knave.
