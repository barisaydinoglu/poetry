The Ironous Lady
----------------
What is this calculation but a memory filtered of its momenta?  
When you mix crystallized like a knave.  
And so that its stains will die your lip.  
Everything frightened with resplendent voices, the salt of the affection  
and piles of real bread inside late afternoon.  
They are all fishermen  
professional wounded soldiers in whose musical curtains originate.  
In your finger of panic the city of droplets respond.  
I took on violenet stones.  
The sunrise films you in its mortal clay.  
The elixir knows this,  
that life in it's chalk boxes is as endless as the circus.  
And next to my hammock, during the afternoon, I woke up naked  
and full of tiredness.
