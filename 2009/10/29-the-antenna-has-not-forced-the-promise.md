The Antenna Has Not Forced The Promise
--------------------------------------
How loving is the lovely heart and it's eloquent torrents?  
A senile candle day  
carry me onto your car - the tomato of my breakfast -  
When you blush expanded like a bed.  
I wish to make a loop  
within, and every color, many  
times hidden in a tiger.  
  
A chorus of tigers at night un rose un shattered  
comes to a halt before a wave.
