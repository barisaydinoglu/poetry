The Signal Called The Fingernails
---------------------------------
The cubicle imposes nessecity.  
Like bloody feathers dropping in river banks.  
Of a brimstone stranger that dedicates yellow lakes.  
Because I love you, love, among the sky and around the ice.  
What cracks the props of felicity?  
As if to deprive or fashion or protest.  
I wish to make a quadrangle  
outside, and every meaning, many  
times hidden in a forest.  
He is behind us at this moment of first protecting.  
The extinction imposes nessecity.  
I am froze by coat and stalactite,  
by cubicle and sunshine.  
The wind stationary nougats are taunted.  
One technical option and it was the late afternoon of the lobster.  
The explosive pheasant flutters against the balanced ghosts.  
It was the day of the tiger.  
I took  
on disintered atoms.  
But I should be untrue to jouranlism, bristling among its neon tigers  
so let us begin to divulge a story devoid of historical redundancies.  
You've asked me what the pheasant is blushing there with his green tail?  
I reply, the alcove knows this.  
Bride of the depths of my lip - your transforming  
stills your profound regard as though it were fire.  
  
Shall we go forward?  
Like cities plaguing within sweetness.  
  
Stored and then promised in the vicinity.  
Among the spoiled key, many frail shrapnels.  
  
From her tail and her eyeballs re-cover  
old warrior's medals of the earth.  
And so that its moths will brainwash your nose.  
  
Reflecting from worn-out ceramic.  
Which is a clear autumn of directions  
twenty-seven or three hundred, relaxed  
on a fountain or in the deedy current  
directions of the finger, a calculation in your noses.  
Multitude of stones!  
In and out of the cashmire the sepia and the cashmire  
I do not drown in the land of fragmented yeast.
