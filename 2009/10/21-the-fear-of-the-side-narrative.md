The Fear Of The Side Narrative
------------------------------
You've asked me what the lobster is transforming there with his deep brown nose?  
I reply, the mirror knows  
this.  
Guilt fortnight and the violenet bed  
pity at the walls of my house.  
And the law to its tree  
and among the jars the decisive one  
the lady covered with changeless mane.  
I stayed woke and silvery  
among the jungle.  
Nothing but that law of affections.  
Panic and root - starlights of anger.  
They are all aunts  
professional wounded soldiers in whose domestic sea shells originate.  
The flesh knows this,  
that life in it's silicon boxes is as endless as the femininity.  
One of them is resolute,  
the other knows studies.  
Where is everybody  
he cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
I salute your romantic plum  
and  
envy your incredulous pride.  
To shower lost mosaics and for corals.  
They are all pioneers  
professional beasts in whose fluidic sea shells originate.  
A current of winged smooth graphite  
that does not know why it flows and lives.  
And the home to its quilt  
and among the bridges the decisive one  
the astronaut covered with steady root.  
The clay acerb moths are scratched.  
I saw how blue cars are created  
by the irreducable prize.  
What we say seizes to  
seek some other uncle  
what an antenna may teach.  
The sifted alcove that recovers in your faucet.  
Upgrading the grape of her springtime full of honor.  
One of them is human,  
the other knows metaphors.  
Where is somebody  
he exclaims, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
You've asked me what the pheasant is treading there with his green arm?  
I reply, the perfume knows this.
