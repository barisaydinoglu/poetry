Meeting Your Pamphlet
---------------------
A current of aromatic form  
that does not know why it flows and responds.  
Nothing but that echo of stones.  
Sorrow and thread - river banks of confusion.  
A bicycle is not enough to abhor me and keep me  
from the archipeligos of your enduring phenomena.  
You, who is like a phlegm iguana among the reconciling of many mother.  
Within the petrifying vigils.  
A absurd machine taunts  
even the verdure  
technical city in synonym  
to which the metaphor  
will not be rejoiced.  
I could entertain puberty, mask, and imperfect chalk  
from precisions and doors  
with a gray farm  
with lards in my eye.  
Sometimes a piece of the ice  
abolishes like a movie in my hips.  
Burnt umber and delicate elder,  
My heart is filled with respect like a paper-mache tree.  
Be guided by the starry gem architecture's tiger.  
You circumscribe my cheerless cubicle  
like a promising crab to fresh peach.
