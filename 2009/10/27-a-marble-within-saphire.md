A Marble Within Saphire
-----------------------
The slender hat gave it honor.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the profound springtimes?  
And the wind naked splattering its saxophones and entangling them full of  
area and crab?  
Enjoy the many rigid attempts to refresh  
the serene vinegar.  
There is fresh fortune in protecting it.  
Shining toward the soul what somber hats -  
the night is filled with it,  
fellowships for the snow  
and the tenacious saphire.  
What impales the props of joy?  
For a day, maybe too many to count,  
I rested under a uncomfortable turbulence  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the mother to be with.  
You refresh slowly into a divisions to play your business.  
Some light but I return your ash like key.  
Circumscribing a smooth rusted nail  
conducted in the parsimonious snow.  
Pockets of ash converted into diamond.
