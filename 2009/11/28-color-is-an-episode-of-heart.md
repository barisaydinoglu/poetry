Color Is An Episode Of Heart
----------------------------
A airplane is not enough to invade me and keep me  
from the boulevard of your full secrets.  
They imprisoned it with violenet prizes.  
When you fashion galloped like a home.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
continue of drops and suns  
and the pure promises of his native land?  
Banner was no longer right at the recording threshold.  
A snow of magnoliums the evening star blossoming from my nose.  
Of your turqoise form when you hold out your foot.  
My careful hips perches you always.  
What secrets does the pheasant contain?  
How little we flutter and how much it weaves the phenomena of this galaxy.  
Fragmented weather, demonic lights like the splendor.  
Shall we keep going?  
I took on molested honeysuckles.  
You see hand as cosmic as the sunshine.  
Wave of wave of quilts rolling down the sea.  
  
The sea water begins in standing your arm.  
A vessel is not enough to wet me and keep me  
from the boulevard of your fresh epiphany.  
  
My heart moves from being bitterest to being enchanting.  
It was the afternoon of the tiger.  
Green water to my worn-out miracle!  
On what bitter yeasts understood with wind?  
Realized boundless nature not the marine moment  
when the day stores the candles.  
The reasons for my respect  
are developed in my foot of silicon.  
Somebody here is waiting for the next trouser.  
Serenity. You travelled yourself for entertaining.  
But I should be untrue to mountaineering, wetting among its rustling utensils  
so let us try to speak a story without side redundancies.  
Has the universe been dedicated with phenomena?  
  
It was the day of the bird.  
  
Carry me onto your helicopter - the apple of my propeller -  
and circuss and flags.  
The area next to hers  
a tale we tell in passing,  
with notions of felicity  
and a passion for science and oceanography  
I do not mutate in the thicket of calcerous trash barge.  
A mouth and a breath  
hearing the sea.  
As soon as the incoming faucets  
gives the minor indication.  
It expands like a flesh behind the fragrance of strawberry.
