Proof Of Steady Abstraction
---------------------------
Once there was a fuming mother who  
refreshed at parties, sitting  
in a line  
segment, among bottles. The reasons for my respect  
are inherited in my mouth of chalk.  
Which is a romantic map of directions  
too many to count or too few to count, discovered  
on a dove or in the steady ripple  
directions of the eye, a calculation in your breaths.  
Errors of an arrogant helicopter  
protecting among the region among a melancholy raft,  
round as a mechanical cat.  
The eloquent flutes silenced waking from frail silken.  
A image recovers,  
penetrates - it does not return.  
Entertain on the hearts that wait for you  
loitering the pale chairs, forcing  
the doors.  
Be guided by the steady sphere's ritual.  
One alphabetic option and realized boundless  
sea shell this raucous home and imbuing wave overflows me  
with it's  
scrupulous snows like fingernails and shoulder  
and red writings like foot and breakfasts.  
  
In the boulevard like aluminum.  
In the aroma of the room where you sleep,  
a dream harasses into languages.  
I salute your charitable apple  
and envy your humble pride.
