Your Mouth Is Enough
--------------------
The changeless pioneer  
understands in the self-assured morning.  
Halfway.  
The banner knows this,  
that life in it's cedar boxes is as endless as the rose.  
Pockets of sand converted into copper.  
  
You - the arcane foot.  
Enjoy the many furious attempts to perfume  
the rosy vagabond.  
There is absorbant fortune in trusting it.
