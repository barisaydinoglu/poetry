What Is True Of The Star Is True Of Everything
----------------------------------------------
Pure trapdoor pacifies the hearts but the root played the memory.  
What hates the props of sincerity?  
But I should be untrue to jouranlism, impaling among its muzzled keys  
so let us begin to tell a story devoid of aerial redundancies.  
I am pampered by coral and nougat, by moth and wind.  
Pockets of aluminum converted into chalk.  
This bleak wheatfield and rejoicing leaf passes me  
with it's sensible productivities like brain and nose  
and brimstone sun rises like toe and glass architectures.  
Understand on the lonely roads that wait for you  
shattering the mourning chairs, attacking the doors.
