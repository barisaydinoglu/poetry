The Wounded Person Of The City
------------------------------
A dew -like probe  
Rise on  
the massacres that wait for you  
mourning the fractious chairs, abhorring the doors.  
What epiphany does the squirrel contain?  
How little we rejoice and how much it rises the epiphany of this universe.  
They are all cousins  
professional convicts in whose vertical forests originate.  
And old warrior's medals and serenities.  
And you flutter like a bridge and and you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
respond of atoms and shadess of marine  
and the electric leaves of his native land?  
I salute your solute peach  
and envy your solute pride.  
To the boundless color of the fused quartz warmth of your body.  
To the nocturnal color of the silicon pullulation.  
The earth comfortable traps are petrified.  
Outside the field like brick.  
Drop me and let my substance carry.  
Green and spacious gentleman,  
The mother smiles at the man  
but the one does not smile  
when he looks at the cat goddess  
and the mourning ocean.  
A key focuses its dream of a beginning, its old ending, the new beginning of the defender order -  
its electrical clocks.  
And so that its massacres will smother your brow.  
As if to mourn or rise or gnaw.  
So the somber happiness lives on in an apple,  
the infinite house of the cluster,  
the winged perfume that  
is absorbant and stationary.  
  
A disintered sphere day  
my heart is filled with pride like a silicon sun.  
You see eyelids as balanced as the drizzle.
