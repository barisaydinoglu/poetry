Children Must Always Prove Their Laws
-------------------------------------
The morbid pullulation that lives in your propeller.  
To seek another land you - the eager shoulder.  
The order of the roots pure  
lightning re-covers the sea shells it was the late afternoon of the crab.  
For warmth of your body was ghostly and morally negative.  
It was the fortnight of the tiger. For nature was arrogant and morally negative.  
River bank.  
And in front of my hammock, during the twilight, I woke  
up naked  
and full of happiness.  
Of your rust colored heart when you hold out your shoulder.
