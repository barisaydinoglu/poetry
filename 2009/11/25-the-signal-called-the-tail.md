The Signal Called The Tail
--------------------------
This pale precision and connecting shades of cashmire congeals me  
with it's electrical jars like leg and lip  
and dark farms like hand and trysts.  
You are the brutal custodian of a crab,  
the browbeaten ness of the well, the power of the electricity.  
You say, what is the warmth waiting for in its deep brown energy?  
I tell you it is waiting for pencil like you.  
Come with me to the imperfect diamond of deaths.  
The incredulous starss in the sky abducted shut out and shut out like a map.  
The cold ostrich sets in the dashing parallel dustss.  
And meetings of shaken arm what seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
She is among us at this moment of first mixing.  
Decay me and let my substance inherit.  
You reconcile in the vicinity as in a unguessed heights.  
The changeless lighthouses coagulated a chorus of toucans at midnight un inherited un hated  
comes to a halt before a starlight.
