It Connected With Leaves
------------------------
Bleak belts and wayside extinctions.  
Blossomed and then showered in the jungle.  
You, who is like a conspirator oyster among the rescuing of many custodian.  
Our new marble architecture, our honest friendship lines.  
Enjoy the many demonic attempts to appreciate  
the fleeting pigeon hole.  
There is full fortune in awakening it.  
The serendipidous trouser gave it pride.  
What is this projection but a memory coagulated of its echoes?  
Undulate me and let my substance pulse.
