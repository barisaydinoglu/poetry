A Mango
-------
Of your blood colored mirror when you hold out your shoulder.  
Only morose and to a  
one they take on time, thousand years  
And you breathe like a sea's skin and a planetarium -like death  
a soft carpet making an absent minded thing of a impossible meeting with a sailor.  
We get the sight  
they must lots to respond  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but dusts.  
Perhaps they are not devoured.  
But the path protected the memory.  
To pacify lost friendships and for cathedrals.  
What phenomena does the elephant contain?  
How little we awaken and how much it protects the phenomena of this galaxy.  
On what browbeaten wounds made with mud?
