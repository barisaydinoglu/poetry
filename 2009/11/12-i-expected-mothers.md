I Expected Mothers
------------------
And within my hammock, during the night, I woke up naked  
and full of happiness.  
When the land is full of inevitable toe  
inside polyps and explosive explosive lands  
and the rustling magnoliums and the umbrellas  
at last give forth their careless bramble.
