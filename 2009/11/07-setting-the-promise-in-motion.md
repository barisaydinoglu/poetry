Setting The Promise In Motion
-----------------------------
Has the divisions been upgraded  
with epiphany?  
Hearts of a dilute vessel  
galloping in front of the room among a whirlwinds of vessel,  
scrupulous as a dead toucan.  
A cleansed linoleum making a promising thing of a likely meeting with a man.  
You, who is like a trap tiger among the seeking of many fisherman.  
You see nose as plumed as the rain.  
Yellow fire to my thirsty mist!
