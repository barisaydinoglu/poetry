It Upgraded With Magnoliums
---------------------------
Not drinking is a form of waking. Multitude of serenities!  
In and out of the sand-colored the blue and the opaque cashmire  
so the clear joy lives on in an apple,  
the domestic house of the energy,  
the mineral garden that is resplendent and boundless.  
  
Neither cactus nor fellowship nor red  
nor transparent but cashmire.
