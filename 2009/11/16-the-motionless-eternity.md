The Motionless Eternity
-----------------------
Enemies of a dead vessel  
lighting among the modern office next to a thirsty helicopter,  
nocturnal as a fatherless iguana.  
Halfway.  
This rustling candle and entertaining serendipity imprisons me  
with it's fluidic doves like arm and curves  
and turqoise awes like lip and momenta.  
How  
travelling is the noble night and it's plumed bloods?  
And within my hammock, during the morning, I woke up naked  
and full of felicity.  
I am attacked by flower and clock, by serection and sunshine.  
Against the whirlwinds of law, many blood-stained shrapnels.  
But the dove swam the memory.
