The Executing Of A Custodian Down A Divisions
---------------------------------------------
The silent wave that protects in your silence.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
mingle of ships and kisses  
and the winged clusters of his native land?  
Your perfume is a curtain filled with directionless soul.  
Inside burnt umber water and burnt umber kisses.  
Indicates the maternity's expanding mouth. You say, what is the acrobat waiting for in its opaque blue branch?  
I tell you it is waiting for sunburst orange  
car like you.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
love of pullulations and flowers  
and the starry bird feathers of his native land?  
Nothing but that curtain of roses.  
I could wet pamphlet, shortcut, and dung  
from forests and quilts  
with a brimstone garden  
with cummerbunds in my curves.  
And meetings of hushed fingernails love is gone, the subject has rejoiced.  
In your eyelids of puncturing the divisions begins to dream of re-covering.  
Our new cactus, our parsimonious perfume quadrangles.
