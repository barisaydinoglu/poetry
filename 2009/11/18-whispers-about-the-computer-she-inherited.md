Whispers About The Computer She Inherited
-----------------------------------------
I saw how alcoves are rustled  
by the delicious laminated sign.  
Dry late afternoon and the wayside magnolium  
falter at the walls of my house.  
Return to the homeland of the silences.  
Only melancholy and to a  
sailor they take on time, too many to count years  
and amid my hammock, during the sunset, I woke up naked  
and full of tiredness.  
Always you conquer through the afternoon  
toward the sunrise chaining roots.  
I could connect pigeon hole, circumstance, and ash  
from graces  
and branches  
with a opaque dark hoove  
with salts in my arm.  
In your hips of electrifying the universe begins to dream of carrying.  
  
Like granules dismantling among doors.  
Our new river, our lovely pasture circles.
