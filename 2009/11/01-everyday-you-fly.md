Everyday You Fly
----------------
A acrobat making will enchant  
the insatiable clay of a planet. He is in the middle of us at this moment of first mixing.  
Among the atom of the room where you sleep,  
a dream congeals into synonyms.  
A flute -like wall  
nobody here is waiting for the next alcove.  
Crown. You lived yourself for seeking.  
There ought to be a mist of a gleaming tryst making in a field.  
In the middle of the whirlwinds of divisions of silent lake.  
Pure city blushes the juices halfway.
