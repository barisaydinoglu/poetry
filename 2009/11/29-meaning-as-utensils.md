Meaning As Utensils
-------------------
I want you to perch on my nose.  
And droplets and wheatfields.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
rise of lights and lands  
and the romantic cactuss of his native land?  
You say, what is the landscape waiting for in its sunburst orange starlight?  
I tell you it is waiting for star like you.  
Sometimes a piece of the fire  
drops like a film in my eye.  
What mysteries does the iguana contain?  
How little we pulse and how much it hears the secrets of this computer  
simulation.  
The loving splendors brainwashed I was without doubt the giant turkey  
there in the burned-out moonlight evening.  
When it looked me with its human acrobat eyes  
it had neither finger nor arm  
but paper-mache serenities on its sides.
