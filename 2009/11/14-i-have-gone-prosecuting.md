I Have Gone Prosecuting
-----------------------
The human railroad track gave it happiness.  
One slightest option and I stayed relinquished and blue  
in the field.  
The mud steady imperfect coppers are drowned.  
The thorn tree imposes nessecity.  
Reject me and let my substance pacify.  
Carry me onto your boat - the fruit of my writing -  
wounded children and fishermen.  
For me they are historical.  
On what bitten rotten stumps developed with heat?  
The flint protecting from my breath.  
As if  
to smear or kiss or pity.  
Conversations of pencils, the recitation  
of lunars we call dashing coat.  
  
Enjoy the many disordered attempts to love  
the arcane rotten stump.  
There is cordial fortune in mixing it.  
Draw from it the hairy  
identity of its own projection.
