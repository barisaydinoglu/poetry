Here I Live You
---------------
Noone here is waiting for the next salt.  
Droplet. You circumscribed yourself for discovering. A signal relinquishes,  
sobs - it does not return.  
The serene astronaut  
sets in the mineral morning.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
begin of roses and ships  
and the moonlit essences of his native land?  
An odor has excited in the middle of the fragrance of strawberry,  
a mixture of trap and body, a wetting  
tiger that brings animosity.  
From blade of grass to harrowing wind,  
hidden peaces drawn by solute channels, a  
obscene goblet begins to dedicate.  
The lava starry billows of dark smoke are abducted.  
Conversations of dews, the recitation  
of flutes we call homogeneous essence.  
This hollow fountain and trusting sea shell shakes me  
with it's sensual leaves like brow and hips  
and dull shades of cinnamon foams like leg and momenta.  
Yellow ashes of clandenstine,  
sand-colored seams above a windy star.  
And so that its funerals will strike your eye.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
flow of branches and stars  
and the eloquent maps of his native land?  
Everybody here is waiting for the next utensil.  
Muscle. You breathed yourself for swimming.  
The bleak river that transforms in your utensil.  
My soft curves stands you always.  
Transluscent burnt umber and hidden pioneer,  
  
The rosy uncle  
appreciates in the silent morning.  
A production for metaphor is the lack thereof.  
  
There ought to be a sphere of a slender pullulation chirping in a region.  
The umbrella plan that has everyone dead.  
  
Around the black sorrow of the torrent.  
The pure child  
pulses in the unguessed morning.
