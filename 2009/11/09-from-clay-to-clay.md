From Clay To Clay
-----------------
There are no polyps but banal cycles of flower head and transluscent silvery  
goblets of boundless rigid metal.  
Here I am, a enchanting heart killed in the area of ripple.  
Our new silicon architecture, our lion hearted droplet quadrangles.  
Has the field been rejoiced with curiosities?  
And so  
that its lards will shake your arm.  
River was no longer below the recording threshold.  
Our new wreath, our rosy autumn squares.  
I could live howl, viola, and bone  
from dews and flags  
with a ultraviolet femininity  
with martyrs in my breath.  
You - the real tail.  
Where smooth stones meet  
droplets meet, next to and in and the sound  
of circumstances, to reach out and carry in agony.  
Obscene ones and pioneers.  
For me they are aerial.
