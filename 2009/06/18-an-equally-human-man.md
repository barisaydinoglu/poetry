An Equally Human Man
--------------------
What is this calculation but a memory mutated of its necklaces?  
Like corpses puncturing with propellers.  
Of your gray door when you hold out your tail.  
A calculating lunar day  
with the sand-colored eye of the mud.  
And precisions and kiss.  
Only friendship, just the  
promise, nothing but  
it. Tryst.  
Explosive twilight and the rusted ribbon  
shake at the walls of my house.  
There are no bones but whirlwinds of cycles of bed and marine  
cactuss of soft guilt rusted nail.  
Rotten strangers and women.  
For me they are algorithmic.
