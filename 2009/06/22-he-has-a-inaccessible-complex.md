He Has A Inaccessible Complex
-----------------------------
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the monastic keys?  
And the wind affluent splattering its paths and abducting them full of  
divisions and cat?  
You see hand as poetic as the sun.  
Halfway.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so  
to another.  
I took on explosive starlights.  
You form in the city as in a musical archipeligos.  
Of natural lemon, spirit  
of the ripples,  
smothered lady blood, your kisses  
mix into exile  
and a droplet of crystal, with remnants of the archipeligos.  
For heart was smothered and morally negative.  
Multitude of eddies!  
In and out of the sand-colored the sand-colored and  
the blue  
a calculation for signal is the lack thereof.  
A snow of sea shells  
once there was a wet-winged cousin who  
lighted at parties, sitting  
in a quadrangle, among sea's skins.
