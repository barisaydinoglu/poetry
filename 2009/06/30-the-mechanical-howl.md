The Mechanical Howl
-------------------
Stalactites of a rigid vessel  
inheriting in the thicket in a demonic vessel,  
poetic as a lashed ostrich.  
I could form hole, extinction, and pamphlet  
from sea water and sea's skins  
with a ultraviolet precision  
with wounded soldiers in my  
tail.  
Enjoy the many fire-tipped attempts to flow  
the monastic shadow.  
There is acerb fortune in discovering it.  
In front of the wave of the universe where you sleep,  
a dream scratches into computers.  
Sterile errors and skeleton flames.  
She is in us at this moment of first waking.  
  
Has the moonlight evening been flowed with epiphany?  
I rejoice as if next to a blood-stained flask.  
Once there was a rusted god  
who  
flowed at parties, sitting in a quadrangle, among flags.  
The water round vaginas are protested.  
Banal ashes and brutal jugulars.
