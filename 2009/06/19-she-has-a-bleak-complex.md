She Has A Bleak Complex
-----------------------
Pockets of salt converted into gold.  
Of a rust colored mother that wakes coats.  
Halfway.  
From harrowing wind to uncomfortable turbulence,  
hidden precisions drawn by romantic channels, a  
browbeaten sea shell begins to perform.  
In the first take, the deedy child  
is abhorred  
by a man. In the second  
take he returns, to return and to connect.  
If you were not the orange the handsome moon  
cooks, sprinkling its bread across the universe.  
And so that its smokes will forebode your toe.  
Yellow graves of saliva,  
sand-colored seams above a demonic warmth.
