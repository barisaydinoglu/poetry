Breeding Hopeful Affection
--------------------------
One of them is enchanting,  
the other knows studies.  
Where is everybody  
she cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
The parenthetical lemons loitered crown.  
Mist was no longer below the recording threshold.  
I'd do it for the silence in which you fly  
for the flints of cinnamon you've appreciated.  
And meetings of tear stained brow the somber trousers shook with its blood-stained set of warm peach, spirit  
of the gardens,  
deformed goddess blood, your kisses  
reflect into exile  
and a droplet of saphire, with remnants of the archipeligos.  
You've asked me what the ostrich is fluttering there with his transluscent transparent toe?  
I reply, the path knows this.  
  
A fractious book day  
everything melancholy with brandishing voices, the salt of the silence  
and piles of great bread in front of sunrise.  
You are the tomato of my inevitable finger.  
When you kiss carried like a evening star.  
From her ears and her foot light  
lights of the earth.  
Of a dark gentleman that divulges miracles.
