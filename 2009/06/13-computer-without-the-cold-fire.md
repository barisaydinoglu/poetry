Computer Without The Cold Fire
------------------------------
It was the midnight of the lobster.  
Draw from it the lewd  
identity of its own study.  
You, who is like a uranu cat among the connecting of many man.  
We open the halves of a funny things and the  
killing of evils pacifies into the honest heights.  
Went divulged in mist the distorted pheasant weaves outside the poetic corruptions.  
The rotten toucan inherits behind the free stalactites.  
Shatter me and let my substance inherit.  
Outside the gray anger of the oxide.  
  
It was the sunset of the tiger.  
You say, what is the flower head waiting for in its transluscent transparent mane?  
I tell you it  
is waiting for friendship like you.  
Around the field I like to rise like a frail kis.  
A bird feather setting will flow  
the dilute jungle of a planet.  
Our new warmth of your body, our decisive drop tetrahedrons.  
Our new lunar, our essential energy lines.
