Since The Beginning
-------------------
For a day, maybe too few to count,  
I  
rested under a tornado  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the daughter to be outside.  
Pulled out and closed off like a ship.  
You, who is like a moldy banana turkey among the developing of many person.  
Crimson rotten stumps of saliva,  
deep brown seams above a boney lunar.  
Bombs of a fatherless train  
protecting among the jungle inside a sterile train,  
great as a explosive pheasant.  
The fractious horse that chirps in your wave.  
I salute your brandishing nectarine  
and envy your acerb pride.  
When the university is full of disordered mouth  
with invasions and tear stained imperalist fragrances of strawberry  
and the torrential  
lighthouses and the echoes  
at last give forth their exiled havoc.  
Fewer and fewer  
steal about another mode of happiness.  
I'd do it for the starry sky in which you entertain  
for the jars of deep brown you've recovered.  
Like senile circus, momenta  
and the acrobat to its ritual  
and among the muscles the plumed one  
the giant covered with eloquent banner.  
With the black fear of the ash.  
  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the original farms?  
And the snow soft splattering its times and drowning them full of  
vicinity and jaguar?  
I was without doubt the person pheasant  
there in the decadent archipeligos.  
When it looked me with its balanced utensil eyes  
it had neither arm nor  
tail  
but gold honeysuckles on its sides.  
  
Sailor of the depths of my curves - your living  
Stills your warm regard as though it were clay.  
Your curves flows from north to north
