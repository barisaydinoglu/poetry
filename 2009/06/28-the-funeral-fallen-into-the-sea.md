The Funeral Fallen Into The Sea
-------------------------------
Behind crimson water and  
crimson warmths.  
Where corals meet  
serendipities meet, outside and in and the sound  
of oxides, to reach out and build in panic.  
What coddles the props of pride?  
I return as if in front of a skeleton shortcut.  
The sun rise galloping from my shoulder.  
Once there was a frail stranger who  
promised at parties, sitting in a line, among elixirs.  
Pockets of aluminum converted into silken.  
A car is not enough to fly me and keep me  
from the night of your solute secrets. When you hear like writing reflected by the earth.  
The sunset old warrior's medals you in its mortal jungle.
