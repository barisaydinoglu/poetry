Song For The Person Of Dilute Sea's Skins
-----------------------------------------
I want you to build on my heart. What musical reflections -  
the thicket is filled with it,  
love for the nature and the smothered fused quartz.  
Purity is gone, the subject has enriched.  
  
Transluscent transluscent sand-colored electricity to my bitten kis!  
What is this phenomenon but a memory erupted of its rivers?  
I salute your equinoctial peach  
and envy your lovely pride.  
Some stand but I stand your ash like star.  
Of a gray mother that responds love.  
Under the boney moonlight evening of disintered fragrance of strawberry.  
  
A loaf of bread baked with rambunctious honor and salt.  
Full stop.
