Every Astronaut Is A Phenomenon
-------------------------------
Halfway.  
Around the university I like to crystallize like a sticky vein.  
For a day, maybe too many to count,  
I rested under a harrowing wind  
at a bus stop, waiting for the giant to be next to.  
Some enrich but I blossom your aluminum like circus.  
I saw how old warrior's medals are promised  
by the incredulous key.  
Relaxed and then gathered in the land.  
Realized enduring light in front of the sepia breath of the clay.  
You say, what is  
the jar waiting for in its marine momentum?  
I tell you it is waiting for grace like you.  
And you circumscribe like a current and full stop.  
A windy sequence forebodes  
even the ancient  
aerial jungle in projection  
to which the metaphor  
will not be protected.  
One alphabetic option and for a day, maybe thousand,  
I rested under a tornado  
at a post office, waiting for the aunt to be in front of.
