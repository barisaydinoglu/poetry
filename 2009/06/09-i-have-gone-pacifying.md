I Have Gone Pacifying
---------------------
Agony and honeysuckle - crowns of sorrow.  
One of them is eloquent,  
the other knows machines.  
Where is somebody  
she quips,  
and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
You are the fruit of my spoiled curves.  
Inevitable roosters and troubled lampreys.  
  
A aquatic thunder of windows.  
If you were not the nectarine the esoteric moon  
cooks, sprinkling its orange across the thicket.
