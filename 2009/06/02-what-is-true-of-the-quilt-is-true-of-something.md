What Is True Of The Quilt Is True Of Something
----------------------------------------------
A triangle in a triangle,  
the hated workings of clear law.  
The region in front of hers  
a story we divulge in passing,  
with notions of joy  
and a passion for computer science and engineering  
You say, what is  
the farm  
waiting for in its sepia ribbon?  
I tell you it is waiting for lake like you. I want you to tread on my brain.  
Behind the soddening acids.  
Carry me onto your car - the banana of my cedar architecture -  
neither pencil nor pasture nor opaque dull shades of sepia  
nor transluscent crimson but green.  
They invaded it with muzzled telegraphs.  
Not to tread or even meet  
the ritual of one who shines  
outside me in a night or circumscribing to a cousin.  
To chirp lost quilts and for paths.
