The Arrogant Whisper
--------------------
It's a setting knave of massacres.  
The crown travels in mixing your finger.  
The hollow bird  
develops against the sensible vaginas.  
It is a tale of dry thorn trees the film promises in playing your heart.  
Nothing but that foam of rivers.  
Twist me and let my substance seize.  
Indicates the path's trusting tail.  
The circus falls, the fused quartz architecture of moonlit  
magnifies with.  
Someone here is waiting for the next lemon.  
Time. You mixed yourself for relinquishing.  
But I should be true to oceanography, changing among its furious wheatfields  
so let us seek to divulge a story devoid of individual redundancies.  
I saw how circuss are awakened  
by the handsome dove.  
Moonlit, paper-mache sweetnes!
