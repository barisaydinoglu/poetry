Here I Flutter You
------------------
Be guided by the wide silence's evening star.  
This barbaous flag and inheriting kiss silences me  
with it's decisive coats like arm and shoulder  
and brimstone salts like mouth and flints.  
This delirious praise and rejoicing poppy deprives me  
with it's profound utensils like fingernails and finger  
and black lemons like eyeballs and trousers.  
And the light to its bell  
and among the drops the slender one  
the sailor covered with solute thread.  
And a putrid breakfast's lava will tread you.  
How mingling is the ancient city and it's homogeneous evils?  
  
You divulge my sticky nougat  
like a enchanting ostrich to fresh sugar.  
Like the absurd brick of muscles only flute, just the  
wine bottle, nothing but  
it. Dove.
