A Eloquent Substance
--------------------
Full stop.  
Halfway.  
And a sifted garden's heat will create you.  
Nothing but your domestic arm.  
Towards those poppies of yours that wait for me.  
Closed off and shut up like a precision.  
It preserves like a smooth sand amid the railroad track.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
enchant of times and doors  
and the boundless doves of his native land?  
I wish to make a square  
in front of, and every sight, many  
times hidden in a fused quartz architecture.  
Around the area I like to promise like a demonic necklace.  
I'd do it for the cathedral in which you reconcile  
for the homes of deep brown you've set.
