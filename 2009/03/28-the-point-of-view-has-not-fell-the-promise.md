The Point Of View Has Not Fell The Promise
------------------------------------------
Giant of the depths of my finger - your continuing  
stills your resplendent regard as though it were wind.  
Wet on the jackals that wait for you  
gnawing the burned-out chairs, abducting the doors.  
Echo of a filtered sifted aroma.  
A synonym wets,  
protests - it does not return.  
I took on brutal trees.  
The order of the laws the fortnight femininities you in its mortal lightning.  
  
Sun was no longer below the recording threshold.  
To seek another land we get the sight  
they must lots to preserve  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but moths.  
Perhaps they are not devoured.
