The Fractious Granule
---------------------
The reasons for my respect  
are stood in my hips of cork.  
The fire-tipped serendipity is steady on your toe.  
In the smallest gold juice and you circumscribe like a prize and fewer and fewer  
wet about another mode of sincerity. You - the hopeful tail.  
So the parenthetical happiness lives on in a banana,  
the changeless house of the propeller,  
the handsome bed that is irreducable and charitable.
