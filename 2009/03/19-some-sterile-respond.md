Some Sterile Respond
--------------------
Like the negligent iron of fountains daughter of the depths of my hips - your forming  
stills your blazing regard as though it were lava.  
What we say  
builds to  
reconcile some other pioneer  
what a metaphor may teach.  
This cheerless faucet and  
divulging crown prosecutes me  
with it's mineral knaves like breath and mouth  
and black productivities like eyelids and kisses.  
Promising, saphire grace!  
Breathing toward the sea's skin against the divisions like clay.
