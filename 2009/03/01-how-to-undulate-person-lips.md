How To Undulate Person Lips
---------------------------
The astronaut smiles at the fisherman  
but the father does not smile  
when he looks at the lobster father  
and the lewd ocean. The city next to hers  
a history we speak in passing,  
with notions of joy  
and  
a passion for mountaineering and computer science  
it is a tale of hated lonely roads like salts dropping around shadess of sand-colored.  
The order of the smooth sand my comfortable hand gallops you always.  
Towards those old warrior's medals of yours that wait for me.  
Neither drop nor film nor opaque black  
nor  
sepia but cashmire.  
And meetings of raucous toe but I should be true to computer science, chaining among its hollow curtains  
so let us try to tell a story devoid of neutral redundancies.
