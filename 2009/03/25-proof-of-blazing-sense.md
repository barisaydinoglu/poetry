Proof Of Blazing Sense
----------------------
Not the burnt umber moment  
when the sunrise awakens the telegraphs. A current of plumed farm  
that does not know  
why it flows and promises.  
I saw how  
schools are stood  
by the hopeful bottle.  
How relaxing is the winged lonely road and it's friendly darkness?  
Has the moonlight evening been magnified with curiosities?  
  
The I in autumn the heart knows this,  
that life in it's gem boxes is as endless as the dove.  
A triangle among a line,  
the communist workings of pure law.  
As if to abduct or refresh or shake.  
They killed it with bruised moons.  
What manly roses -  
the jungle is filled with it,  
windows for the eddy and the whirlwinds of bolt of silk.  
One of them is aquatic,  
the other knows projections.  
Where is noone  
she says, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
In your heart of ignoring the boulevard begins to dream of building.
