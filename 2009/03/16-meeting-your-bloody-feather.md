Meeting Your Bloody Feather
---------------------------
I'd do it for the kiss in which you enchant  
for the friendships of yellow you've refreshed. Neither phemonana nor sea shell nor dark  
nor  
transparent but sepia.  
Under the divisions like metal.  
I was without doubt the mountaineer turkey  
there in the communist chimney.  
When it looked me with its iridescent acrobat eyes  
it had neither leg nor fingernails  
but paper-mache perfumes on its sides.
