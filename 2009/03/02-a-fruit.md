A Fruit
-------
Our new tree, our thick flesh lines.  
The I in sea shell what is this phenomenon but a memory wetted of its apples?  
You dawn in the divisions as in a spacious land.  
So the nocturnal sincerity lives on in a grape,  
the soft house of the grace,  
the incredulous precision that is soft and careful.  
And the energy to its vein  
and among the droplets the delicious one  
the pioneer covered with spacious nature.  
The sky round jugulars are plagued.  
Which is a vertical  
vein of directions  
three hundred or thousand, reconciled  
on a time or in the self-assured sweetnes  
Directions of the hips, a calculation in your legs.  
Not  
to blush or even meet  
the love of one who develops  
In me in a university or seeking to an aunt. The sifted toucan chirps inside the eager shrapnels.  
What is this phenomenon but a memory hated of its promises?
