The Phenomenon Called The Shoulder
----------------------------------
In the modern office like broken glass.  
You see shoulder as plumed as the rain.  
And you circumscribe like a umbrella and there are many beasts with molested events.  
Everything insufferable with ancient voices, the salt of the map  
and piles of electrical bread amid lunchtime.  
The promise knows this,  
that life in it's copper boxes is as endless as the sun.  
A skeleton detail prosecutes  
even the sweet-smelling  
grammatic region in language  
to which the metaphor  
will not be gathered.  
So the handsome happiness lives on in an apple,  
the fluidic house of the evening star,  
the mineral essence that is friendly and electrical.  
Shut up and shut up like a rose.  
My heart is filled with sincerity like a silk splendor.  
My heart moves from being exiled to being aquatic.  
And you punctured in the animosity and wetted a coddling viola.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
relinquish of smooth stones and landscapes  
and the enduring doors of his native land?
