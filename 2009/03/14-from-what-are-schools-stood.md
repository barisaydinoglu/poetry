From What Are Schools Stood
---------------------------
A current of resplendent acrobat  
that does  
not know why it flows and enriches.  
Exciting the dove of her sea's skin full of happiness.  
All sun rises become consequences.  
You - the indespensable hand.  
Among opaque blue water and crimson poppies.  
Son of the depths of my fingernails - your fashioning  
stills your cordial regard as though  
it were clay.  
Sand-colored and brandishing bride,  
A loop with a line,  
the ironous workings of loving law.  
Closed off and closed off like a candle.  
Cinnamon heat to my hollow circus!  
A chorus of turkeys at lunchtime un woke un deprived  
comes to a halt before a bird feather.  
The reasons for my respect  
are understood in my finger of paper-mache.  
The stick imposes nessecity.  
Sometimes a piece of the jungle  
brainwashes like a mirror in my foot.  
He is in the middle of us at this moment of first seeking.  
Nothing but your musical shoulder.
