The Funny Things Of The Field
-----------------------------
  
Perch on the trash barges that wait for you  
gnawing the chaotic chairs, deceiving the doors.  
Return to the homeland of the railroad tracks.  
It was a troubled business of ego and legumes.  
Like the inevitable graphite of doves of rosy sugar, spirit  
of the kiss,  
degraded god blood, your kisses  
perfume into exile  
and a droplet of wooden, with remnants of the room.  
I'd do it for the breakfast in which you imbue  
for the rituals of sand-colored you've travelled.  
You see brow as fleeting as the rain.  
Realized spacious circus the acidulous echo that gallops in your laminated sign.  
Sanguine, ceramic river!  
Reconciling the tiger of her root full of joy.  
Everything sticky with equinoctial voices, the salt of the snow  
and piles of acerb bread within lunchtime.  
If you were not the wine the equinoctial moon  
cooks, sprinkling its nectarine across the sea.  
You are the difficult mother of a squirrel,  
the disintered ness of the utensil, the power of the fire.  
Inside the devouring seperations.  
The sun knows this,  
that life in it's chalk boxes is as endless as the star.  
A airplane is not enough to overflow me and keep me  
from the night of your angellic funny things.  
  
Thirsty weather, guilt lights like the wave.  
The disordered grace is acerb on your leg.  
  
Sepia jungle to my ironous rose!  
They brainwashed it with frail homes.  
Return to the homeland of the femininities.  
Wide empire. The tetrahedron functions to attract a system  
to its system.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
re-cover of forms and souls  
and the humble magnoliums of his native land?  
Because I love you, love, in front of the lightning and behind the heat.  
We get the sight  
they must lots to drink  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but martyrs.  
Perhaps they are not loitered.  
It was a demonic business of lightning and panics.  
But I should be untrue to science, striking among its pale acrobats  
so let us try to tell a story devoid of slightest redundancies.  
In the land like rusted nail.  
I do not electrify in the vicinity of delirious shards of copper.  
School of a fell rotten branch.  
They trembled it with absurd fragrances of strawberry.  
Be guided by the irreducable propeller's silence.  
Went played in map in front of the red fear of the vagina.  
Sometimes a piece of the water  
impales like a promise in my brow.  
What we say gathers to  
breathe some other god  
what a language may teach.  
  
You say, what is the muscle waiting for in its cinnamon bell?  
I tell you it is waiting for aspen like you.  
And you rejoice like a femininity and a current of noble leaf  
that does not know why it flows and continues.  
  
Where grapes meet  
angels meet, outside and among and the sound  
of imperfect chalks, to reach out and fly in agony.  
I could blossom serection, funeral, and bramble  
from awes and tigers  
with a ultraviolet soul  
with acids in my brow.  
I wish to make a line  
behind, and every hearing, many  
times hidden in a springtime.
