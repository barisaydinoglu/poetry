Technical Metaphors Are All Behind Us

It was a obscene business of trash and convicts.  
The I in promise there are no juices but boney cycles of faucet and silvery  
starry skies of parenthetical rusted ash.  
There are many juices outside clenched events.  
In the night like iron.  
The lighthouse recovering from my eyelids.  
And the path to its smooth stone  
and among the femininities the infinite one  
the lady covered with delicious acrobat.  
Of a rust colored custodian  
that wakes  
old warrior's medals.  
You seek headlong into an area to mingle  
your business.  
This lashed book and reconciling hoove deludes me  
with it's arcane sweetness like eyeballs and curves  
and dark elixirs like hips and lighthouses.  
  
I crystallize as if amid a lethargic nougat.
