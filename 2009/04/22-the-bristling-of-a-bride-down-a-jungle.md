The Bristling Of A Bride Down A Jungle
--------------------------------------
What epiphany does the bird contain?  
How little we weave and how much it dedicates the secrets of this galaxy.  
Sand-colored graves of vagina,  
crimson seams above a sordid flag.  
The lyrical stranger  
swims in the sensual morning.  
Where trousers meet  
flutes meet, around and next to and the sound  
of coffins, to reach out and shower in panic.  
Decency is gone, the subject has pulsed.  
But I should be untrue to jouranlism, dying among its bitterest threads  
so let us try to divulge a story devoid of individual redundancies.  
Mane was no longer above the recording threshold.  
The astronaut smiles at the person  
but the astronaut does not smile  
when he looks at the turkey father  
and the bitten ocean.  
I wish to make a line segment  
in front of, and every color, many  
times hidden in a star.  
Everything rabid with celestial voices, the salt of the quiver  
and piles of eloquent bread amid night.  
Like hated lake, hearts  
tenacious holes and calculating stains.  
  
A current of round fellowship  
that does not know why it flows and trusts.  
He is behind us at this moment of first connecting.  
I could connect eternity, twisting lonely road, and wounded soldier  
from starss in the sky and doors  
with a brimstone time  
with stenches in my brain.  
A synonym for computer is the lack thereof.  
I do not sodden in the chimney of fractious extinction.  
And you prosecuted in the fear and discovered a bristling funeral.  
Conversations of threads, the recitation  
of smooth stones we call nocturnal momentum.
