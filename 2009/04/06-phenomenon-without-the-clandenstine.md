Phenomenon Without The Clandenstine
-----------------------------------
Your lip rejoices from west to west  
when the modern office is full of bleak eyelids  
among dusts and inaccessible crooked quivers  
and the torrential warmths and the films  
at last give forth their cheerless trapdoor.
