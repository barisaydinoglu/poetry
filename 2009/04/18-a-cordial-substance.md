A Cordial Substance
-------------------
A infinite mist of jars.  
Forceful sunrise and the sterile crown  
loathe at the walls of my house.  
You see shoulder as velvety as the drizzle.  
My heart is filled with respect like a ceramic pasture.  
The enchanting poppy gave it respect.  
We get the color  
they must lots to recover  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but stalactites.  
Perhaps they are not smeared.  
Free, marble form!  
A rusted calculation loiters  
even the aromatic  
slightest field in camera  
to which the metaphor  
will not be drank.  
What erupts the props of sincerity?  
The ancient dignity of the current!  
Inside the gray confusion  
of the thorn tree.  
  
I salute your celestial orange  
and envy your humble pride.  
Conversations of corals, the recitation  
of veins we call soft flint.  
Behind the room like metal.  
Among transluscent sunburst orange water and crimson crowns.  
As soon as the incoming  
bird feathers  
gives the public indication.  
Yellow havocs of complaint,  
transparent seams above a ghostly faucet.  
  
Esoteric empire. The tetrahedron functions to dawn an architecture  
to its system.  
The cousin smiles at the pioneer  
but the stranger does not smile  
when he looks at the jaguar sailor  
and the rotten ocean.  
Closed off and shut out like a praise.  
Like dry acrobat, landscapes  
the map knows this,  
that life in it's wooden boxes is as endless as the echo.
