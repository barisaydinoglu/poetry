A Kiwi
------
You love slowly into a field to crystallize your business.  
In my moonlight evening at sunrise you are like a fellowship  
and your form and colour the way I promise them.  
Harass me and let  
my substance carry.  
I salute your smooth cheesecake  
and envy your naked pride.  
Inside the boney key, many lonely beasts.  
Of a blood colored elder that imbues magnoliums.  
  
A transluscent marine jar enchants.  
Went conducted in kiss to chirp lost smooth graphites and for windows.
