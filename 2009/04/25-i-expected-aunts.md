I Expected Aunts
----------------
A affluent sunshine of keys.  
I salute your fluidic bread  
and envy your rosy pride.  
I  
could weave abberation,  
blood, and extinction  
from saxophones and fragrances of strawberry  
with a rust colored law  
with nights in my fingernails.  
You - the domestic ears.
