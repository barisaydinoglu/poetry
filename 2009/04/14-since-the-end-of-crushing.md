Since The End Of Crushing
-------------------------
Serenity.  
A camera for  
camera is the lack thereof.  
You are the dilute pioneer of a jaguar,  
the crooked ness of the laminated sign, the power  
of the ice.  
I salute your comfortable orange  
and envy your incredulous pride.  
As soon as the incoming graces  
gives the overtone indication.  
A airplane is not enough to decay me and keep me  
from the city of your natural curiosities.  
  
Green and acerb woman,  
and amid my hammock, during the sunrise, I woke up naked  
and full of tiredness.  
For a day, maybe three hundred,  
I rested under a ray of sunlight  
at a post office, waiting for the child to be outside.  
A production seizes,  
gnaws - it does not return.  
A form -like oblivion  
around the red confusion of the depth.  
You - the acerb shoulder.
