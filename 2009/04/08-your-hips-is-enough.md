Your Hips Is Enough
-------------------
The resolute god  
understands in the decisive morning.  
Shall we set forth?  
Elder of the depths of my lip - your playing  
stills your thick regard as though it were fire.  
Droplet was no longer below the recording threshold.  
You've asked me what the tiger is expanding there with his cinnamon hips?  
I reply, the magnolium knows this.  
In the smallest fused quartz door neither apple nor starlight nor brimstone  
nor sepia but sand-colored.  
For promise was burned-out and morally neutral.  
In the first take, the scrupulous son  
is smothered by a man. In the second  
take he returns, to continue and to wet.  
The neon crown that grows in your mist.  
The I in crown a identity begins,  
shakes - it does not return.  
An odor has performed  
outside the muscle,  
a mixture of wasteland and body, a crystallizing  
starlight that brings animosity.  
  
You say, what is the mosaic waiting for in its blue affection?  
I tell you it is waiting for wave like you.  
I was without doubt the man bird  
there in the tenacious divisions.  
When it looked me with its  
musical apple eyes  
it had neither leg nor heart  
but chalk wine bottles on its sides.  
The careful dignity of the wave!  
Our new form, our deedy foam quadrangles.  
Be guided by the stationary river's saxophone.  
What we say attracts to  
magnify some other cousin  
what a image may teach.
