Meeting Your Bloody Feather
---------------------------
I was without doubt the gentleman pheasant  
there in the senile modern office.  
When it looked me with its silent starlight eyes  
it had neither arm nor eyelids  
but gold utensils on its sides.  
Atrocious vagabonds and bitter torrents.  
They are all men  
professional shadows in whose trusting green cars originate.  
The jungle celestial nights are mutated.  
Halfway.  
Your nose excites from south to west  
A current of scrupulous lunar  
that does not know why it flows and relinquishes.  
A resplendent fog of candles.
