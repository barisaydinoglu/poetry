A Song Of Honor
---------------
A quiver swimming will grow  
the negligent earth of a planet.  
Only burned-out and to a  
father they take on time, too few to count years  
Brings all the shatters coats.  
Because I love you, love, next to the clay and in the lightning.  
Fear and saxophone - reflections of confusion.  
In the first take, the solute gentleman  
is conquered by an aunt. In the second  
scene he returns, to blossom and to flow.  
  
To reconcile lost serendipities and for kiss.  
A transluscent crimson drop enriches.
