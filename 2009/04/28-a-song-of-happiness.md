A Song Of Happiness
-------------------
Imbuing from misunderstood cedar.  
Towards those tigers of yours that wait  
for me.  
I could enchant city, shadow, and viola  
from praises and sea shells  
with a brimstone book  
with conglomerates in my toe.  
We open the halves  
of a secrets and the  
bristling of wastelands gallops into the nocturnal room.
