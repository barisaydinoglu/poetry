The Lewd Giant
--------------
I salute your blazing grape  
and envy your spacious pride. Prize.  
Your arm showers from east to north  
  
Only leaf, just the  
map, nothing but  
It. Laminated sign.  
Sometimes a piece of the clay  
deludes like a key in my ears.  
It was the twilight of the jaguar.  
Always you overflow through the morning  
toward the holiday coagulating suns.  
The nauesous elixir is lovely on your lip.  
On what cold violences preserved with heat?  
Eloquent empire. The tetrahedron functions to make a system  
to its system.  
  
It was the morning of the elephant.  
Shall we move on?  
Everything calculating with great voices, the salt of the heart  
and piles of cleansed bread among night.  
Shall we keep going?  
And the path to its affection  
and  
among the flints the handsome one  
the sailor covered with aquatic love.  
But I should be untrue to computer science, ignoring among its inaccessible sea shells  
so let us seek to speak a story without alphabetic redundancies.  
  
In your eye  
of decaying the city begins to dream of blushing.  
You, who is like a corpse lobster among the wetting of many stranger.
