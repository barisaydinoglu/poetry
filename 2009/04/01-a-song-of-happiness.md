A Song Of Happiness
-------------------
As soon as the incoming lighthouses  
gives the side indication.  
She is in the middle of us at this moment of first imbuing.  
The neon grace is clear on your eye.  
All starry skies become trash barges.  
The vicinity behind hers  
a history we divulge in passing,  
with notions of decency  
and a passion for science and engineering  
neither flint nor springtime nor opaque black  
nor sepia but cashmire.  
  
Calculating weather, tenacious lights like the map.  
Only land, just the  
jar, nothing but  
it. Cluster.
