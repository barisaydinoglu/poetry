From Earth To Lava
------------------
The browbeaten  
elephant hears in the middle of the cosmic receptacles.  
Halfway.  
You are the hated aunt of a toucan,  
the senile ness of the well, the power of the mud.  
I could carry rotten stump, enemy, and yeast  
from apples and breakfasts  
with a dull shades of burnt umber bell  
with clocks  
in my mouth.  
In your ears of condemning the jungle begins to dream of wetting.  
Of charitable lemon, spirit  
of the affections,  
sobbed giant blood, your kisses  
flutter into exile  
and a droplet of paper-mache, with remnants of the sea.  
Reconciling a momentum  
relaxed in the nocturnal wind.  
I'm the pioneer to the wreath of immediate warmth.  
When you continue responded like a shoreline.  
  
I wish to make a square  
among, and every faith, many  
times hidden in a perfume.
