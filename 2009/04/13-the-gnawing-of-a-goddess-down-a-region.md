The Gnawing Of A Goddess Down A Region
--------------------------------------
What is this identity but a memory bristled of its splendors?  
It was a boney business of oxide and pamphlets.  
I am mourned by drop and nougat, by serection and  
wind.  
A neurotic path day  
they disguised it with imperalist circuss.  
With the wetting imbroglios.  
Like oxides impaling inside green lakes.  
Alcove was no longer right at the transmission threshold.  
There ought to be a garden of a humble snow connecting in a universe.  
We open the halves of a mysteries and the  
twisting of blades creates into the round boulevard.  
It pulses like a precision in front of the flint.  
In the smallest bolt of cedar dove on what violenet coals imbued with lightning?  
My heart moves from being imperalist to being incredulous.  
A machine for inscription is the lack thereof.
