Every Woman Is A Synonym
------------------------
Draw from it the bitten  
signal of its own antenna.  
And  
meetings of parched curves around the land I like to tread like a phosphorus silence.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
seize of lakes and smooth metals  
and the thick flowers of his native land?  
Sea shell was no longer right at the recording threshold.  
Like the ghostly salt of ripples the reasons for my respect  
are played in my leg of chalk.  
Joy is gone, the subject has galloped.  
From her curves and her foot dedicate  
mosaics of the earth.
