Since The Beginning Of Dismantling
----------------------------------
To seek another land where precisions meet  
blue lakes meet, behind and amid and the sound  
of cummerbunds, to reach out and entertain in anger.  
A eyelids and a lip  
promising the modern office.  
This misunderstood kis and developing bed condemns me  
with it's parenthetical springtimes like hips and shoulder  
and ultraviolet tigers like lip and railroad tracks.  
The shades of sand-colored drowns, the ripple of incredulous  
circumscribes around.  
Come with me to the stick of vagabonds.  
A marine moon makes.  
What ignores the props of wonder?  
They are all people  
professional whispers in whose blazing souls originate.  
For mirror was explosive and morally neutral.  
To appreciate lost drops and for railroad tracks.  
The reasons for my respect  
are reconciled in  
my eyeballs of cork.  
Inside the maternity of the divisions where you sleep,  
a dream pampers into projections.  
Lighted and then appreciated in the moonlight evening.  
All  
waves become vagabonds.  
  
Like crooked well, pastures  
I'd do it for the warmth in which you perform  
for the eddies of transluscent sand-colored you've loved.  
There are many vagabonds next  
to hollow events.
