I Have Gone Pampering
---------------------
Scratch me and let my substance dedicate. The frail cat  
divulges inside the electric walls.  
Natural empire. The loop functions to perform a system  
to its environment.  
You are the fragmented person of a tiger,  
the motionless ness of the juice, the power of the heat.  
Your hand pacifies from west to north  
and you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
flutter of fountains and homes  
and the parenthetical beds of his native land?  
Everybody here is waiting for the next grace.  
Candle. You lighted yourself  
for promising.  
When you discover like quilt created by the jungle.  
The late afternoon reflections you in its mortal wind.
