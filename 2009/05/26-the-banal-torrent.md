The Banal Torrent
-----------------
Towards those guitars of yours that wait for me.  
But I should be true to jouranlism, gnawing among its difficult grapes  
so let us attempt to speak  
a story without overtone redundancies.  
From her curves and her heart kiss  
pullulations of the earth.  
My real arm perfumes you always.
