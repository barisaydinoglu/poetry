The Technique Of Individual Points
----------------------------------
Carry me onto your bicycle - the orange of my door -  
I wish to make a loop  
around, and every color, many  
times hidden in a lunar.  
How conducting is the pure martyr and it's celestial coals?  
Boneless weather, listless lights like the fellowship.  
Our new sweetnes, our solute serendipity quadrangles.
