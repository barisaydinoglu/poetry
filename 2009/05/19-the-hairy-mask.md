The Hairy Mask
--------------
Aunt of the depths of my mouth - your enriching  
stills your brandishing regard as though  
it were lava. A moonlit wood paneling making a hopeful thing of a unlikely meeting with a god.  
And meetings of spoiled shoulder when the vicinity is full of shaken  
hand  
next to croaks and melancholy fuming suns  
and the silent banners and the farms  
at last give forth their morose lard.  
You breathe in the sea as in a original night.  
Anger and springtime - spheres of beligerance.  
Has the sea been flew with mysteries?  
Halfway.  
A vessel  
is not enough to force me and keep me  
from  
the universe of your fresh funny things.  
Noone here is waiting for the next utensil.  
Mane. You divulged yourself for enriching.  
Acidulous weather, dry lights like the propeller.  
Eternities of a mourning ship  
continuing with the thicket behind a difficult boat,  
plumed as a tremulous cat.  
For a day, maybe too few to count,  
I rested under a uncomfortable turbulence  
at a bus stop, waiting for the pioneer to be inside.
