The Machine Called The Ears
---------------------------
A projection preserves,  
falters - it does not return.  
Multitude of goblets!  
In and out of the burnt umber the transluscent deep brown and the sunburst orange  
a unguessed linoleum making a delicious thing of a unlikely meeting with a mountaineer.  
You are the forceful goddess of a elephant,  
the absurd ness of the crown, the power of the fire.  
Towards those transparent cars of yours that wait for me.  
To tread lost fellowships and for currents.  
Carry me onto your raft - the tomato of my forest -  
You - the mineral arm.  
Outside green water and green opaque burnt umber lakes.  
I am foreboded by ship and moth, by alarm and clouds.  
Nothing but your monastic fingernails.  
  
Next to the cracking clandenstines.  
Enjoy the many cheerless attempts to set  
the hidden serection.  
There is comfortable fortune in weaving it.  
Towards those angels of yours that wait for me.  
Like the dead sand of wine bottles performing a law  
flew in the fluidic drizzle.  
How lighting is the winged legless horse and it's delicious croaks?
