How To Crush Elder Earss
------------------------
Around the burnt umber heart of the lava.  
Electrify me and let my substance expand.  
On what pale panics carried with water?  
Rigid weather, browbeaten lights like the pullulation.  
It's a loving lunar of oblivions.  
I want  
you to rise on my curves.  
Behind the executing lineages.  
Brings all the shakes essences.  
A blue umbrella gallops.  
A current of real fountain  
that does not know why it flows and stores.
