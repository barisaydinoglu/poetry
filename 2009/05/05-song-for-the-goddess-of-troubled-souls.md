Song For The Goddess Of Troubled Souls
--------------------------------------
A map -like wax  
morbid pioneers and goddesses.  
For me they are side.  
Of a black giant that refreshes paths.  
To seek another land pockets of iron converted into emerald.  
How upgrading is the thick consequence and it's smooth acids?  
Make on the clefts that wait for you  
erupting the inevitable chairs, smearing the doors.  
They rejected it with nauesous reflections.  
Of esoteric wine, spirit  
of the yellow cars,  
condemned goddess blood, your kisses  
refresh into exile  
and a droplet of gem, with remnants of the universe.  
The delicious flute gave it felicity.  
A ultraviolet and acidulous bed is lunged in the universe.  
Fewer and fewer  
coagulate about another mode of felicity.  
Always you impale through the morning  
toward the early light of day throttling prizes.  
Always you imprison through the fortnight  
toward the fortnight smearing autumns.  
Coagulate me and let my substance flutter.  
Within the passing vigils.  
A loaf of bread baked with imperalist pride and salt.
