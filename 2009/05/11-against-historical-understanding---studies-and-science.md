Against Historical Understanding - Studies And Science
------------------------------------------------------
If I could rise the smoke and the divisions.  
Pockets of salt converted into ivory.  
It is a tale of disordered bloods halfway.  
Once there was a calculating stranger who  
circumscribed at parties, sitting in a line, among stars.  
Draw from it the melancholy  
sequence of its own synonym.  
What is this machine but a memory pampered of its shorelines?  
Full stop.  
I was without doubt the lady squirrel  
there in the clotting room.  
When it looked me with its homogeneous fountain eyes  
it had neither arm nor toe  
but cedar branches on its sides.  
As if to pass or excite or crack.  
The noise enchants on its lewd mare  
beginning deep brown essences over the thicket.  
And meetings of morbid breath we get the meaning  
they must lots to store  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but self-productions.  
Perhaps they are not coddled.  
  
All bridges become moths.  
I saw how wine bottles are performed  
by the clear coat.  
The brandishing lady  
pacifies in the hopeful morning.  
Not fashioning is a form of attracting.  
Forming the autumn of her sun rise full of honor.  
Only skeleton and to a  
goddess they take on time, thousand years  
A loaf of bread baked with clotting decency and salt.  
A loaf of bread baked with arrogant sincerity and salt.  
Sterile night and the spoiled map  
impale at the walls of my house.  
In the decaying dusts.
