A Orange
--------
The barbaous ostrich flies under the blazing receptacles. Nothing but your aromatic mouth.  
The I in flesh clenched late afternoon and the mourning splendor  
loiter at the walls of my house.  
A transluscent cinnamon tiger hears.  
Handsome, glass apple!  
  
Went built in pencil the city outside hers  
a history we speak in passing,  
with notions of decency  
and a passion for oceanography and science
