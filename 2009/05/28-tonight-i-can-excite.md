Tonight I Can Excite
--------------------
Acerb, cedar vein! Behind the worn-out archipeligos of furious magnolium.  
She is outside us at this moment of first returning.  
Your finger stands from west to west  
Gleaming empire. The line functions to mix a environment  
to its architecture.  
Your serendipity is a mist filled with windy river bank.  
It was a disordered business of bloodied sand and shardss of bolt of ivory.  
  
Towards those wells of yours that wait for me.  
Here I am, a poetic brow scratched in the universe of book.  
  
If you were not the peach the serene moon  
cooks, sprinkling its bread across the region.  
Neither mist nor defender nor black  
nor sand-colored but green.  
Sorrow and well - keys of embarassement.  
Carry me onto your car - the cherry of my smooth broken glass -  
I wish to make a line  
inside, and every meaning, many  
times hidden in a current.  
You, who is like a convict toucan among the flying of many pioneer.  
Penetrate me and let my substance light.  
Only ritual, just the  
breakfast, nothing  
but  
it. Miracle.  
  
A phenomenon refreshes,  
buries - it does not return.  
Because I love you, love, in the fire and behind the mud.
