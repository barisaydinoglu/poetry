Since The Beginning Of Mingling
-------------------------------
What sobs the props of tiredness?  
In your hand of beligerance the area of warmths of your body stand.  
And you abhorred in the anger and lighted a crushing coffin.  
Conversations of rivers, the recitation  
of veins we call natural bell.
