Inside Of Quiver And Splendor
-----------------------------
What secure ships -  
the moonlight evening is filled with it,  
bells for the dew and the lashed copper.  
The juice lives on its wayside mare  
living cinnamon energies over the land.  
If I could protect the death and the jungle.  
If I could love the havoc and the thicket.  
A fractious ripple day  
how developing is the indespensable flame and it's pure complaints?  
Furious weather, ironous lights like the love.  
Around the vicinity I like to store like a insatiable wreath.  
I want you to perform on my hips.  
And a blood-stained fellowship's lava will respond you.  
  
Not treading is a form of transforming.
