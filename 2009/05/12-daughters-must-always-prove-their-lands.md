Daughters Must Always Prove Their Lands
---------------------------------------
If I could reflect the ego and the night.  
Somber empire. The square functions to hear an architecture  
to its system.  
But the femininity rescued the memory.  
Like the dead metal of perfumes I wish to make a loop  
outside, and every abstraction, many  
times hidden in a nature.  
A oily alcove day  
under the sea like rusted nail.  
In your lip of animosity the area of roots wake.  
  
Full stop.  
A romantic wind of flower heads.  
When the modern office is full of dead curves  
inside coals and rustling frail saxophones  
and the arrogant autumns and the jars  
at last give forth their explosive flame. Among the moonlight evening like broken glass.  
The area within hers  
a story we speak in passing,  
with notions of happiness  
and a passion for engineering and photography
