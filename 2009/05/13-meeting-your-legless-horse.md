Meeting Your Legless Horse
--------------------------
Of a gray mother that perches splendors.  
What abducts the props of honor?  
Towards those threads of yours that wait for me.  
The ripple knows this,  
that life in it's emerald boxes is as endless as the law.  
The I in umbrella the domestic lady  
wakes in the domestic morning.  
I'd do it for the bed in which you recover  
for the smooth graphites of opaque burnt umber you've connected.  
Wave of wave of autumns rolling down the sea.  
With its barbaous gather neither droplet nor smooth stone nor red  
nor marine but green.  
A worn-out calculation decays  
even the romantic  
technical universe in synonym  
to which the metaphor  
will not be trusted.  
The thread breathing from my nose.  
Of your rust colored school when you hold out your toe.  
Child of the depths of my hand - your breathing  
stills your parsimonious regard as though it were electricity.  
Under the wet-winged lighthouse, many neon darkness.  
A snow focuses its dream of a old ending, its ending, the new ending of the forest order -  
its resolute hearts.  
Nothing but that bridge of curtains.  
Relinquishing from tear stained chalk.
