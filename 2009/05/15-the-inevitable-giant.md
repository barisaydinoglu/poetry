The Inevitable Giant
--------------------
Listless weather, harsh lights like the film.  
Forming from phosphorus copper.  
Conversations of coats, the recitation  
of lakes we call moonlit rose.  
Of ancient sugar, spirit  
of the sun rises,  
compounded aunt blood, your kisses  
flow into exile  
and a droplet of copper, with remnants of the night.  
Felicity is gone, the subject has loved.  
The ghostly flower head that awakens in your mosaic.  
My indespensable leg appreciates you always.  
Of your red foliage when you hold out your hand.  
We open the halves of a secrets and the  
overflowing of wounds shines into the parsimonious divisions.  
I wish to make a triangle  
next to, and every meaning,  
many  
times hidden in a mirror.  
Of your dull shades of crimson pasture when you hold out your leg.
