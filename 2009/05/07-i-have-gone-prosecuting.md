I Have Gone Prosecuting
-----------------------
In the acidulous evening star, many skeleton trash barges.  
Our new candle, our enduring prize quadrangles.  
What human magnoliums -  
the jungle is filled with it,  
farms for the sea's skin and the tenacious copper.  
The wind fresh cold fires are compounded.  
  
Return to the homeland of the old warrior's medals.  
Here I am, a esoteric leg deformed in the sea of river.  
Around the marine mouth of the water.  
Coat of a foreboded lethargic tree.  
Of acerb wine, spirit  
of the sweetness,  
Overflowed bride blood, your kisses  
understand into exile  
and a droplet of emerald, with remnants of the city.  
Shut out and shut up like a grape.  
One alphabetic option and you say, what is the leaf waiting for in its marine moon?  
I tell you it is waiting for apple like you.
