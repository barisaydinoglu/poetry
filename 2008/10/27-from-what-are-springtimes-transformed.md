From What Are Springtimes Transformed
-------------------------------------
Conversations of horses, the recitation  
of laws we call blazing foliage. Illusion and stars in the sky - warmths of your body of anger.  
It's a divulging defender of eternities.  
  
Fewer and fewer  
brainwash about another mode of joy.  
Calculating walls and insatiable corruptions.  
Outside the land like sand.  
Railroad track of a soddened lonely promise.
