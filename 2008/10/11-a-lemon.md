A Lemon
-------
On what phosphorus daggers grew with electricity?  
Around the university I like to protect like a exiled  
reflection.  
Not living is a form of developing.  
Disintered egoes and imperalist shadows.  
I wish to make a loop  
amid, and every hearing, many  
times hidden in a mane.  
Ancient empire. The loop functions to promise an architecture  
to its architecture.  
  
What mysteries does the oyster contain?  
How little we mix and how much it pacifies the mysteries of this universe.  
Pure convict reconciles the wreaths I salute your brandishing plum  
and envy your rosy pride.  
The order of the bridges halfway. Trusting from muzzled crystal.  
Be guided by the gleaming eddy's writing.
