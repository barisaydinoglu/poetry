Proof Of Scrupulous Abstraction
-------------------------------
In the first scene, the lion hearted custodian  
is rejected by a lady. In the second  
scene he returns, to perch and to flutter. Of your dull shades of cinnamon home when you hold out your hand.  
Once there was a tear stained mother who  
awakened at parties, sitting in a loop, among femininities.  
  
Always you kill through the late afternoon  
toward the night lunging perfumes.  
To seek another land conversations of muscles, the recitation  
of smooth clays we call velvety love.
