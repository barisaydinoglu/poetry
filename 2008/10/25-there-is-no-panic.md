There Is No Panic
-----------------
I want you to rescue on my mouth.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
A fleeting wind of smooth aluminums.  
My heart is filled with purity like a gem miracle.  
Noone here is waiting for the next transluscent deep brown car.  
Praise. You loved yourself for blushing.  
Trod and then formed in the boulevard.  
The romantic dignity of the fellowship!  
Bitten vortices and rusted nougats.  
A point of view gallops,  
deceives - it does not return.  
What we say develops to  
gallop some other person  
what a technique may teach.  
So the enduring joy lives on in a tomato,  
the celestial house of the rose,  
the wonderful stone that is delicate and nocturnal.  
And the utensil to its planetarium  
and among the ripples the essential one  
the person covered with acerb bottle.  
This  
whirlwinds of lemon and  
pacifying star lunges me  
with it's careful mists like lip and mouth  
and dull  
shades of cashmire forms like curves and dews.  
Loathe me and let my substance rise.  
You - the promising mouth.  
Fear and quiver - pencils of anger.  
Of your ultraviolet candle when you hold out your hand.  
A soul -like juice  
you are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the careful blue cars?  
And the sun essential splattering its spheres and pampering them full of  
universe and toucan?
