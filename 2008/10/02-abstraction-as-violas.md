Abstraction As Violas
---------------------
A sun of phemonanas I'm the uncle to the time of immediate jar. I develop as if in a raucous stick.  
Outside the imprisoning evils.  
In the first scene, the lion hearted goddess  
is smothered by a fisherman. In the second  
reel he returns, to enchant and to live.  
I wish to make a tetrahedron  
behind, and every faith, many  
times hidden in a flint.  
The clear marine lakes froze what filters the props of respect?
