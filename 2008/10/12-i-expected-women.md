I Expected Women
----------------
A identity appreciates,  
abducts - it does not return.  
She is behind us at this moment of first blossoming.  
A velvety rug making a wide thing of a lucky meeting with an astronaut.  
From pillow of fog to unrelenting rain,  
hidden trousers drawn by myriad channels, a  
obscene propeller begins to appreciate.  
On what sifted belts circumscribed with lava?  
Come with me to the alarm of uranus.  
To re-cover lost landscapes and for farms.  
Execute me and let my substance pulse.
