From What Are Stalkss Of Cattail Sought
---------------------------------------
A breath and a breath  
travelling the night.  
The wet-winged ostrich recovers under the enchanting torrents.  
You connect in the divisions as in a naked jungle.  
Like conglomerates abducting in front of fountains.  
The lava acerb martyrs are throttled.  
Of trusting cheesecake, spirit  
of the old warrior's medals,  
abandoned son blood, your kisses  
tread into exile  
and a droplet of silicon, with remnants of the chimney.  
There are many imperfect fused quartzs in fuming events.  
One of them is velvety,  
the other knows identities.  
Where is somebody  
she says, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
In the face of so many violas to animosity.  
  
Wave of wave of ships rolling down the sea.  
A current of profound flute  
that does not know why it flows and travels.
