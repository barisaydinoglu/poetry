Song For The Giant Of Brutal Foams
----------------------------------
Change me and let my substance weave.  
I took on lashed praises.  
It discovers like a precision in front of the bird feather.  
You are the grape of my acidulous eyeballs.  
I was without  
doubt the cousin jaguar  
there in the insatiable room.  
When it looked me with its fresh momentum eyes  
it had neither leg nor hips  
but crystal maps on its sides.  
To the original steady door but I should be untrue to oceanography, compounding among its lashed serendipities  
so let us seek to tell a story without public redundancies.  
Some transform but I rise your broken glass like stone.
