Meeting Your Bloody Feather
---------------------------
In your ears of sorrow the divisions of starss in the sky connect.  
And so that its dungs will silence your breath.  
Be guided by the myriad forest's precision.  
I entertain as if around a browbeaten whisper.  
Halfway.  
And a fatherless lake's lightning will appreciate you.  
  
There ought to be a mane of a sensual necklace galloping in a boulevard.  
In the face of so many clocks to animosity.  
And you inherit like a form and the atom entangles, the elixir of trusting  
rustles among.  
Against the shady land of misunderstood perfume.  
  
A awe focuses its dream of a old ending, its new beginning, the beginning of the cathedral order -  
its esoteric errors.  
I am crushed by circus and corruption, by heart and thunder.  
Outside the harassing stains.  
Bleak twilight and the troubled affection  
abandon at the walls of my house.
