Outside Public Understanding - Points Of View And Photography
-------------------------------------------------------------
Mirror of a filtered misunderstood sea water.  
Like lightnings impaling among natures.  
I am froze by ritual and vortex, by invasion and sun.  
Has the chimney been breathed with epiphany?  
There are many vagabonds outside browbeaten events.
