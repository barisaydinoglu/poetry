A Chalk Within Glass
--------------------
To seek lost candles and for drops.  
Your lemon is a ritual filled with rusted mosaic.  
I'd do it  
for the drop in which you awaken  
for the faucets of transluscent marine you've  
galloped.  
There are many utensils behind spoiled events.  
What promising wells -  
the land is filled with it,  
honeysuckles for the atom and the chaotic cork.  
It's a blossoming shades of crimson of whispers.  
You recover slowly into an area to breathe your business.  
He is inside us at this moment of first travelling.  
Realized absent minded film difficult night and the fractious honeysuckle  
petrify at the walls of my house.  
You, who is like a rotten stump crab among the weaving of many bride.
