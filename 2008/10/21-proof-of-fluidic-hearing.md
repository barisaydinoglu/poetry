Proof Of Fluidic Hearing
------------------------
Full stop.  
A production re-covers,  
imprisons  
- it does not return.  
From her foot and her eye conduct  
homes of the earth.  
You - the natural breath.  
A identity for computer is the lack thereof.  
A neurotic bed day  
your tail swims from west to west  
a green home hears.  
Not to set or even meet  
the pencil of one who chirps  
outside me in a chimney or trusting to a daughter.  
And the droplet to its dove  
and among the bird feathers the sensible one  
the bride covered with human stalks of cattail.  
The abberation performs on its demonic mare  
beginning marine springtimes over the jungle.  
A chorus of turkeys at sunrise un  
continued un forced  
comes to a halt before a knave.  
  
The soul transforms in beginning your lip.  
Conversations of eddies, the recitation  
of schools we call scrupulous flower head.  
They are all astronauts  
professional graves in whose brandishing doors originate.  
It was  
a obscene business of viola and nights.  
In the first scene, the indespensable aunt  
is fainted by a custodian. In the second  
reel he returns, to kiss and to crystallize.  
My indespensable tail drinks you always.  
  
You say, what is the promise waiting for in its sand-colored autumn?  
I tell you it is waiting for cactus like you.  
Towards those miracles of yours that wait for me.
