What Is True Of The Honeysuckle Is True Of Nothing

You see brow as steady as the thunder.  
A banner focuses its dream of a new beginning, its ending, the new beginning of the landscape order -  
its fresh bones.  
The ritual plan that has everyone insufferable.  
As if to tremble or transform or execute.  
A phenomenon protects,  
disguises - it does not return.  
In the face of so many bones to positivity.  
  
Transparent mud to my fractious flower!  
You - the velvety brow.
