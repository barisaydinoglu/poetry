A Grape
-------
Morose brides and men.  
For me they are individual.  
I am entangled by ship and wound, by moldy banana and thunder.  
Fewer and fewer  
impale about another mode of decency.  
Which is a equinoctial faucet of directions  
too few to count or too many to count, imbued  
on a mosaic or in the enchanting snow  
directions of the ears, a calculation in your eyes.  
  
The wide man  
refreshes in the infinite morning.  
Mingle on the trashes that wait for you  
deforming the boneless chairs, mourning the doors.
