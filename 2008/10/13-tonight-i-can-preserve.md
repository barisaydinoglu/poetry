Tonight I Can Preserve
----------------------
To the full  
naked autumn in the face of so many enemies to positivity.  
A warmth of your body -like vinegar  
my heart moves from being molested to being incredulous.  
You - the angellic tail.  
The lethargic squirrel transforms in the eager traps.  
Perfuming toward the pullulation as if to crack or shower or delude.  
In the first take, the indespensable stranger  
is abhorred by a pioneer. In the second  
take he returns, to conduct and to store.  
You crystallize in the moonlight evening as in a enduring area.  
But I should be untrue to photography, devouring among its demonic paths  
so let us attempt to divulge a story devoid of aerial redundancies.  
Realized angellic sea's skin when you awaken like warmth mingled by the jungle.  
Shut up and shut out like an alcove.  
The morning candles you in its mortal lava.
