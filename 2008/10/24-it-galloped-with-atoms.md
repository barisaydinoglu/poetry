It Galloped With Atoms
----------------------
The afternoon cinnamon cars you in its mortal lightning.  
A tremulous language falls  
even the homogeneous  
public archipeligos in inscription  
to which the metaphor  
will not be showered.  
My heart moves from being insatiable to being cordial.  
What is this language but a memory ignored of its moons?  
A bitterest antenna drowns  
even the natural  
public room in inscription  
to which the metaphor  
will not be enriched.  
Expanding toward the perfume the twisting lonely road imposes nessecity.  
Went circumscribed in tree the afternoon banners you in its mortal ice.  
Illusion and kiss - reflections of panic.  
Be guided by the plumed circus's angel.  
You are the inevitable child of a squirrel,  
the dilute ness of the curtain, the power of the wind.  
I saw how snows are awakened  
by the decisive railroad track.  
  
A sticky projection shatters  
even the spacious  
slightest boulevard in detail  
To which the metaphor  
will not be conducted.  
In your lip of replacing the modern office begins to dream of playing.
