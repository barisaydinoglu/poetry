Detail In The Side Services
---------------------------
The reasons for my respect  
are mingled in my mouth  
of ceramic. A loaf of bread baked with boney pride and salt.  
Went connected in school conversations of reflections, the recitation  
of sea shells we call acerb flower head.  
  
The giant smiles at the custodian  
but the person does not smile  
when he looks at the toucan daughter  
and the lonely ocean.  
For sun rise was difficult and morally neutral.  
Ghostly conspirators and lashed deaths.  
You wake my distorted convict  
like a homogeneous toucan to fresh wine.  
All fellowships become wounds.  
The motionless light that stores in your shades of marine.  
Realized friendly sun full stop.
