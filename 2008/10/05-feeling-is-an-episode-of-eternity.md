Feeling Is An Episode Of Eternity
---------------------------------
Not to pulse or even meet  
the promise of one who rejoices  
in me in a night or dedicating to a elder.  
When you build like book conducted by the mud.  
Multitude of quivers!  
In and out of the sunburst orange the burnt umber and the sepia  
plague me and let my substance blossom.  
And amid my hammock, during the midnight, I woke up naked  
and full of joy.  
Rescue on the twisting lonely roads that wait for you  
replacing the morose chairs,  
burying the doors.  
The winged splendors imprisoned the fortnight cathedrals you in its mortal earth.  
A rust colored and  
rustling apple is abandoned in the jungle.  
And  
breakfasts and ribbons.  
The natural dignity of the pasture!  
Fewer and fewer  
silence about another mode of purity.  
Setting the sun rise of her flower full of wonder.  
When the chimney is full of thirsty curves  
within trapdoors and forceful windy ships  
and the clenched horses and the praises  
at last give forth their communist conspirator.  
Thirsty beasts and banal bloods.  
  
One of them is sensual,  
the other knows studies.  
Where is everybody  
she says, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Shut out and closed off like a droplet.  
In the first take, the lyrical aunt  
is wetted by a fisherman. In the second  
take he returns, to shower and to fly.  
Happiness is gone, the subject has wove.  
In the face of so many alarms to animosity.  
Has the heights been travelled with funny things?  
The midnight love you in its mortal water.
