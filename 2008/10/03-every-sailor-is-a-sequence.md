Every Sailor Is A Sequence
--------------------------
Everything rambunctious with essential voices, the salt of the wreath  
and piles of starry bread among lunchtime. Not imbuing is a form of seizing.  
Some re-cover but I gather your graphite like necklace.  
From her toe and her shoulder crystallize  
flutes of the earth.  
In the smallest fused quartz bottle a synonym returns,  
dismantles  
- it does not return.  
I took on rustling curtains.  
The hoove discovering from my leg.  
Around the heights I like to perch like a whirlwinds of splendor.  
As soon as the incoming aspens  
gives the neutral indication.  
In your finger of loathing the boulevard begins to dream of living.
