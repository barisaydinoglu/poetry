What Is True Of The Warmth Is True Of Nothing
---------------------------------------------
Only whirlwinds of and to a  
mother they take on time, million years  
the electricity aromatic sticks are abolished.  
Brings all the loiters wheatfields.  
The child smiles at the son  
but the son does not smile  
when he looks at the oyster giant  
and the bitterest ocean.  
A loaf of bread baked with tremulous purity and salt.  
If I could stand the throat and the land.  
And the love to its soul  
and among the farms the dashing one  
the custodian covered with profound mirror.
