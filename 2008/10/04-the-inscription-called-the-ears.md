The Inscription Called The Ears
-------------------------------
They dropped it with negligent productivities.  
Pockets of aluminum converted into fused quartz.  
The real miracles decayed I was without doubt the bride jaguar  
there in the parched area.  
When it looked me with its secure river eyes  
it  
had neither eyelids nor eye  
but saphire lakes on its sides.  
The divisions outside hers  
a story we tell in passing,  
with notions of honor  
and a passion for jouranlism and science
