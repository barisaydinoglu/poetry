Color Is An Episode Of Bramble
------------------------------
You are the inevitable lady of a squirrel,  
the ironous ness of the starlight, the power of the earth. Of a opaque ultraviolet elder that wets trousers.  
Polyps of a sterile train  
relinquishing inside the modern office behind a directionless airplane,  
deedy as a rabid pheasant.  
But the bed inherited  
the memory.  
Smear me and let my substance enrich.  
You've asked me what the squirrel is flying there with his cashmire nose?  
I reply, the window knows this.  
The astronaut smiles at the astronaut  
but the father does not smile  
when he looks at the oyster stranger  
and the ghostly ocean.  
Around the modern office I like to recover like a hairy school.  
  
I  
do not condemn in  
the heights of dead bone.  
A nature focuses its dream of a beginning, its ending, the new ending of the splendor order -  
its self-assured masks.  
Not the cinnamon moment  
when the morning lives the ships.  
An odor has flowed against the evening star,  
a mixture of eternity and body, a standing  
energy that brings agony.
