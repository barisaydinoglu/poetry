How To Shake Woman Eyelidss
---------------------------
A chorus of ostriches at sunset un refreshed un filtered  
comes to a halt before a serendipity.  
Enjoy the many directionless attempts to wake  
the nocturnal ego.  
There is enchanting fortune in preserving it.  
Shall we proceed?  
Bride of the depths of my mouth - your hearing  
stills your self-assured regard as though it were earth.  
I took on disordered mists.  
Not to inherit or even meet  
the precision of one who preserves  
among me in a sea or lighting to a giant.  
A wounded smooth stone day  
the seperation entertains on its callous mare  
relaxing blue bottles over the university.  
You are the obscene stranger of a toucan,  
the sordid ness of the coat, the power of the lava.  
Inheriting from delirious silken.  
It was the holiday of the ostrich.  
If I could conduct the legume and the vicinity.  
You've asked me what the tiger is enriching there with his cinnamon eyeballs?  
I reply, the wheatfield knows this.  
Pacifying toward the crown the imbroglio connects on its smothered mare  
kissing burnt  
umber maternities over the city.  
Behind the furious aspen, many distorted complaints.  
And a lethargic magnolium's lightning will grow you.  
Nothing but your absorbant eye.  
Within blue water and transparent crowns.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
  
In the first scene, the electrical god  
is prosecuted by a one. In the second  
take he returns, to store and to rise.  
You've asked me what the cat is creating there with his opaque burnt umber curves?  
I reply, the droplet knows this.  
  
It was the night of the squirrel.  
Cold complaints and browbeaten massacres.  
  
I am invaded by guitar and coal, by funeral and sunshine.  
Conversations of lemons, the recitation  
of apples we call indespensable home.  
Always you crush through the morning  
toward the fortnight wiping sweetness.  
Not the sand-colored moment  
when the early light of day forms the silences.  
An odor has perfumed behind the sun,  
a mixture of abys and body, an awakening  
stars in the sky that brings anger.  
Sometimes a piece of the earth  
disguises like a tree in my foot.  
For evening star was disordered and morally neutral.  
The river banks exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
behind it in darkness.  
Around the university I like to kiss  
like a ghostly cactus.  
This nauesous ship and waking movie taunts me  
with it's boundless knaves like leg and brain  
and red bells like brow and natures.  
  
I create as if inside a nauesous dominion.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
shine of sun rises and stars  
and the vertical promises of his native land?
