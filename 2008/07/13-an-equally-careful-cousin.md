An Equally Careful Cousin
-------------------------
Ironous weather, frightened lights like the telegraph.  
Of your red fountain when you hold out your fingernails.  
The magnolium blossoming from my nose.  
In the face of so many stains to animosity.  
Nothing but your slender hips.  
Like rigid magnolium, trousers  
there  
are no shardss of fused quartz but burned-out cycles of flower and burnt umber  
railroad tracks of parenthetical forceful clay.  
A sunburst orange ribbon enchants.  
There ought to be a wreath of a delicious echo mingling in a field.  
As if to deform or kiss or loathe.  
  
Fashion on the self-productions that wait for you  
forcing the inaccessible chairs, prosecuting the doors.  
There are many legumes inside calcerous events.  
A circus focuses  
its dream of a new ending, its new beginning, the old ending of the path order -  
its enchanting bones.
