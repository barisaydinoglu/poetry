I Expected Sailors
------------------
Nothing but that reflection of magnoliums.  
The clear serendipities fainted the person smiles at the person  
but the goddess does not smile  
when he looks at the iguana uncle  
and the negligent ocean.  
Only railroad track, just the  
key, nothing but  
it. Well. A car is not enough to pity me and keep me  
from the heights of your hidden mysteries.  
Your essence is a stalks of cattail filled with mourning sun rise.  
Among the coddling serections.  
Wave of wave of foliages rolling down the sea.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the human moons?  
And the clouds parenthetical splattering its river banks and overflowing them full of  
region and elephant?  
So the lion hearted purity lives on in a cherry,  
the enchanting house of the leaf,  
the free cashmire car that is dashing and sensible.  
The clear lakes scratched if you were not the wine the somber moon  
cooks, sprinkling its nectarine across the city.
