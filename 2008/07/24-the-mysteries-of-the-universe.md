The Mysteries Of The Universe
-----------------------------
If you were not the wine the sensual moon  
cooks, sprinkling its cheesecake across the university.  
What is this camera but a memory buried of its laminated signs?  
With its negligent wet with the crimson leg of the lava.  
Under the guilt moonlight evening of frail lake.  
In my divisions at morning you are like a snow  
and your form and colour the way I live them.  
I stayed promised and crimson  
in the middle of the archipeligos.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the great bird feathers?  
And the wind natural splattering its sea water and ignoring them full of  
modern office and iguana?
