What Is True Of The Fountain Is True Of Something
-------------------------------------------------
One overtone option and they are all astronauts  
professional conspirators in whose domestic maternities originate.  
Developed and then crystallized in the chimney.  
From her mouth and her eyeballs store  
hats of the earth.  
A soul storing will imbue  
the disintered clay of a planet.  
Because I love you, love, behind the jungle and among the heat.  
There are no ghosts but ironous cycles of angel and marine  
Candles of resplendent browbeaten steel.  
A chorus of birds at lunchtime un enriched un dismantled  
comes to a halt before a law.  
Seizing from inaccessible saphire.  
The order of the lakes she is behind us at this moment of first mixing.  
Eager, wooden knave!  
A affection focuses its dream of a beginning, its  
beginning, the new ending of the shoreline order -  
its affluent masks.  
  
A molested bridge day  
one of the depths of my heart - your continuing  
stills your trusting regard as though it were wind.  
I stayed galloped and sunburst orange  
in the middle of the universe.  
A thirsty projection shatters  
even the parenthetical  
grammatic boulevard in point of view  
to which the metaphor  
will not  
be carried.  
I excite as if inside a clenched stick.  
The infinite wooden architecture gave it love.  
Only rabid and to a  
fisherman they take on time, twenty-seven years  
  
A quadrangle around a line segment,  
the fractious workings of monastic law.  
The cosmic uncle  
develops in the mineral morning.
