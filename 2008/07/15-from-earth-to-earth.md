From Earth To Earth
-------------------
Like lashed lighthouse, kiss  
because I love you, love, outside the earth and behind the jungle.  
And you connect like a guitar and and meetings of insatiable curves only frightened and to a  
child they take on time, thousand years  
Moonlit, ceramic dew!  
When you fly seized like a coat.  
Full stop.  
I could trust felicity, dust, and whisper  
from sea's skins and natures  
with a opaque red salt  
with explications in my leg.  
With the burnt umber eye of the fire.  
For a day, maybe thousand,  
I rested under a unrelenting rain  
at a bus stop, waiting  
for the astronaut to be outside.  
The reasons for my respect  
are trod in my finger of cork.  
What secrets does the ostrich contain?  
How little we reconcile and how much it excites the phenomena of this universe.  
  
Mingle on the roosters that wait for you  
attacking the molested chairs, passing the doors.  
One algorithmic option and not the green moment  
when the morning mixes the warmths of your body.
