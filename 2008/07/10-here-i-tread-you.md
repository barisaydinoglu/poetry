Here I Tread You
----------------
A dead love day  
what seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
The bitterest oyster lights inside the self-assured trapdoors.  
You promise my worn-out jugular  
like a loving ostrich to fresh peach.  
The order of the miracles your leaf is a trouser filled with rabid stars in the sky.  
Form of a imprisoned thirsty bottle.  
They are all women  
professional clefts in whose domestic leaves originate.  
Decency is gone, the subject  
has wetted.  
I'm the stranger to the ritual of immediate bridge.  
Overflow me and let my substance create.  
Like egoes bristling among flutes.
