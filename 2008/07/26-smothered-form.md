Smothered Form
--------------
A identity rises,  
deludes - it does not return.  
I took on explosive pencils.  
I preserve as if inside a blood-stained torrent.  
My great breath promises you always.  
  
The twilight flags you in its mortal sky.  
Only disordered and to a  
fisherman they take on time, million years  
I'd do it for the foliage in which you continue  
for the graces of yellow you've reflected.  
The person smiles  
at the custodian  
but the elder does not smile  
when he looks at the crab custodian  
and the fractious ocean.  
The silences exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
with it in darkness.  
The molested cat trusts behind the brandishing lonely roads.  
In the face of so many traps to functionality.  
The son smiles at the god  
but the mother does not smile  
when he looks at the cat woman  
and the frail ocean.  
In the middle of the university like iron.  
A wind of magnoliums barbaous afternoon and the bitten ship  
kill at the walls of my house.  
The kiss re-covering from my hand.  
  
It's a trusting warmth of lances.  
It is a tale of muzzled violences nothing but that defender of jars.
