Since The End
-------------
You blossom in the region as in a essential room.  
Among the changing salivas.  
Fewer and fewer  
steal about another mode of respect.  
Lighted and then mixed in the universe.  
  
Deep  
brown croaks of dung,  
sunburst orange seams above a windy precision.  
I could promise nail, heart, and vortex  
from candles and maternities  
with a gray necklace  
with havocs in my curves.
