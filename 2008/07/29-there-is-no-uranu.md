There Is No Uranu
-----------------
The order of the wells one of them is steady,  
the other knows metaphors.  
Where is someone  
she  
quips, and when can  
we see what  
is going to happen?  
She is among us at this moment of first growing.  
A curves and a leg  
relaxing the moonlight evening. An odor has refreshed outside the sea's skin,  
a mixture of bloodied sand and body, a developing  
tiger that brings sorrow.  
I'd do it for the stars in  
the sky in which you understand  
for the starlights of sand-colored you've showered.  
Pockets of broken glass converted into silicon.  
In your finger of animosity the boulevard of magnoliums dawn.
