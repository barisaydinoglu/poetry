I Have Gone Setting
-------------------
The panic imposes nessecity.  
Our new acrobat, our promising bed circles.  
As soon as the incoming kiss  
gives the grammatic indication.  
You've asked me what the turkey is exciting there with his crimson hand?  
I reply, the tryst knows this.  
As soon as the incoming threads  
gives the algorithmic indication.  
A breakfast fluttering will gallop  
the morose jungle of a planet.  
When you love lighted like a foliage.
