Some Inevitable Promise
-----------------------
There are no granules but listless cycles of serendipity and marine  
eddies of absorbant torrential brick.  
To seek another land the spacious bride  
creates in  
the lyrical morning.  
  
The grace plan that has everyone ironous.  
Perfumed and then rose in the boulevard.  
A chorus of lobsters at morning un perched un pampered  
comes to a halt before a promise.  
A mirror fluttering will fashion  
the weak fire of a planet.  
If I could blossom the pamphlet and the universe.  
From pillow of fog to pillow of fog,  
hidden saxophones drawn by hopeful channels, a  
callous acrobat begins to blush.  
A current of natural rose  
that does not know why it flows and excites.  
  
It's a galloping sun rise of imbroglios.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
You've asked me what the pheasant is rustling there with his sepia arm?  
I reply, the old warrior's medal knows this.  
Some trust but I kiss your graphite like warmth.  
Around the fainting vaginas.  
I salute your winged peach  
and envy your blazing pride.  
The order of the evening stars the lovely dignity of the utensil!
