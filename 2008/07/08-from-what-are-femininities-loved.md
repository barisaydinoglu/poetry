From What Are Femininities Loved
--------------------------------
Because I love you, love, in the heat and inside the mud. As soon as the incoming telegraphs  
gives the algorithmic indication.  
I was without doubt the goddess toucan  
there in the blood-stained region.  
When it looked me with its fluidic flint eyes  
it had neither ears nor toe  
but marble kiss on its sides.  
And so that its blades will coagulate your brow.  
How returning is the silent saliva and it's poetic legless horses?  
Not the deep brown moment  
when the night wakes the homes.  
What penetrates the props of decency?  
Your curves understands from north to east  
here I am, a incredulous leg deformed in the jungle of tiger.  
Sorrow and opaque transluscent  
burnt umber car - lands of fear.
