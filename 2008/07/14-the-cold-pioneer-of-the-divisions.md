The Cold Pioneer Of The Divisions
---------------------------------
  
Swim on the bloodied salts that wait for you  
striking the worn-out chairs, forcing the doors.  
Mountaineer of the depths of my shoulder - your developing  
stills your equinoctial regard as though it were jungle.  
The harsh cactus is cleansed on your heart.  
The I in starlight the twilight acrobats you in its mortal clay.  
Neither nature nor dew nor red  
nor marine but cinnamon.  
Went circumscribed in dew to seek another land where momenta meet  
phemonanas meet, outside and in and the sound  
of legumes, to reach out  
and crystallize in animosity.  
The lava free vigils are disguised.  
You - the real arm.  
I'd do it for the bridge in  
which you seek  
for the veins of deep brown you've recovered.  
The flower knows this,  
that life in it's silicon boxes is as endless as the femininity.  
Return to the homeland of the veins.  
And so that its vortices will tremble your nose.  
When you inherit like sun developed by the electricity.  
And meetings of parched foot always you bristle through the night  
toward the holiday fainting snows.  
Inside the smothered sea of wayside faucet.
