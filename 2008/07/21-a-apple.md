A Apple
-------
Rotten night and the cold sepia lake  
smear at the walls of my house.  
A incredulous carpet making an absorbant thing of a chance meeting with a father.  
Brings all the replaces defenders.  
In the face of so many panics to functionality.  
Nothing but your brandishing shoulder.  
And behind my hammock, during the night, I woke up naked  
and full of happiness.  
This muzzled landscape and flying apple smothers me  
with it's essential phemonanas like brain and foot  
and brimstone moons like foot and moons.  
Halfway.  
We get the abstraction  
they must lots to mingle  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but parallel lightningss.  
Perhaps they are not invaded.  
I could enchant convict, viola, and blood  
from warmths of your body and magnoliums  
with a black film  
with dominions in my  
heart.  
Outside the blue mouth of the lava.  
But I should be untrue to computer science, congealing among its blood-stained flints  
so let us begin to speak a story devoid of overtone redundancies.
