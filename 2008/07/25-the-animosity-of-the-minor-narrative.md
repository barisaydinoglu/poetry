The Animosity Of The Minor Narrative
------------------------------------
So the decisive honor lives on in a orange,  
the solute house of the warmth  
of your body,  
the angellic sea water that is wide and dashing.  
Not the opaque sunburst orange moment  
When the twilight responds the trysts.  
Living from bitten glass. I do not coddle in the divisions of boneless throat.  
Bristle me and let my substance rejoice.
