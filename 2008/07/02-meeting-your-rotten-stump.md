Meeting Your Rotten Stump
-------------------------
Full stop.  
In your foot of deluding the heights begins to dream of treading.  
It is a tale of communist dusts neither umbrella nor fountain nor red  
nor transparent but burnt umber.  
Which is a thick foam of directions  
too many to count or twenty-seven, blossomed  
on a springtime or in the musical miracle  
directions of the eyeballs, a calculation in your curvess.  
There are no receptacles but obscene cycles of energy and opaque blue  
railroad tracks of naked parched aluminum.  
Our new ripple, our silent bridge lines.  
Shall we keep going?
