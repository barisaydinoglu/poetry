Elders Of A Fragmented Country
------------------------------
Panic and echo - manes of illusion.  
A current of friendly silk architecture  
that does not know why it flows and shines.  
Attracted and then imbued in the land.  
The rectum imposes nessecity.  
A sunburst orange wave trusts.  
In  
your brain of panic the night of books grow.  
From blade of grass to palm tree leaf,  
hidden sea's skins drawn by delicate channels, a  
wet-winged vein begins to magnify.
