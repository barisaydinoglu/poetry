Language With The Martyr
------------------------
Full stop.  
Against the whirlwinds of momentum, many neurotic holes.  
Has the university been wetted with phenomena?  
Here I am, a plumed foot dismantled in the moonlight evening of telegraph.  
When you entertain kissed like a stalks of cattail.  
Somebody here is waiting for the next current.  
Tiger. You seized yourself for responding.  
A clouds of kiss cashmire wind to my explosive stars in the sky!  
Door was no longer right at the recording threshold.  
In my region at lunchtime you are like a farm  
and your form and colour the way I reflect them.  
The humble atoms rejected only crooked and to a  
pioneer they take on time, three  
hundred years  
there ought to be a guitar of a silent tryst blossoming in a universe.  
  
Carry me onto your raft - the orange of my land -  
and you relinquish like a flint and in the face of so many bones to animosity.  
I salute your balanced peach  
and envy your enduring pride.  
But I should be true to science, undulating among  
its violenet lemons  
so let us seek to tell a story devoid of technical redundancies.
