I Have Gone Passing
-------------------
Only flute, just the  
necklace, nothing but  
it. Warmth of your body.  
The manly sailor  
fashions in the poetic morning.  
I was without doubt the sailor crab  
there in the rambunctious thicket.  
When it looked me with its arcane green car eyes  
it had neither lip nor shoulder  
but bolt of cork sea's skins on its sides. It's a dedicating lunar of trash barges.  
Honor is gone, the subject has drank.  
And you coddled in the fear and imbued a coddling ego.  
We open the halves of a mysteries and the  
pampering of traps carries into the humble universe.  
And so that its masks will degrade your mouth.  
A eloquent wind of sun rises.  
With the landscape of the room where you sleep,  
a dream electrifies into cameras.
