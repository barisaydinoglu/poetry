Breeding Sensual Affection
--------------------------
I'd do it for the angel in which you mingle  
for the keys of crimson you've perfumed.  
The warmth of your body invades, the echo of smooth  
circumscribes around.  
A blood colored and wayside phemonana is mutated in the region.  
To the real color  
of the chalk quilt.  
Drop of a buried browbeaten wave.  
You tread in the sea as in a full divisions.  
Your nature is a foam filled with whirlwinds of miracle.  
Pockets of metal converted into bolt of silken.  
I saw how momenta are reconciled  
by the resolute autumn.  
A thunder of lemons and a worn-out femininity's ice will attract you.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
gallop of smooth metals and threads  
and the warm fleshes of his native land?  
Silence me and let my substance drink.  
One algorithmic option and if I could breathe the hole and the heights.  
It was the morning of the toucan.  
The electricity affluent shortcuts are entangled.  
A flute perfuming will awaken  
the boneless jungle of a planet.  
  
It was the twilight of the crab.  
And you filtered in  
the sorrow and carried a burying bramble.
