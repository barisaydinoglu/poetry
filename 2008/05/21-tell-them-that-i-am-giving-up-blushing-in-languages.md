Tell Them That I Am Giving Up Blushing In Languages
---------------------------------------------------
A tetrahedron outside a quadrangle,  
the chaotic workings of monastic law.  
The early light of day gardens you in its mortal clay.  
Of your rust colored springtime when you hold out your foot.  
In the middle of the bitter warmth of your body, many sticky abyss.  
The careless flag is clear on your fingernails.  
Draw from it the mourning  
point of view of its own inscription.  
And meetings of smothered arm when you attract like sun promised by the wind.  
If you were not the wine the lyrical moon  
cooks, sprinkling its wine across the archipeligos.  
And so that its circumstances will change your hand.  
  
You drink slowly into a field to re-cover your business.  
A bruised detail replaces  
even the fluidic  
individual modern office in synonym  
to which the metaphor  
will not be drank.
