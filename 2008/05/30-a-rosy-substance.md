A Rosy Substance
----------------
Of your dull shades of blue railroad track when you hold out your breath.  
The boulevard  
around hers  
a tale we speak in passing,  
with notions of happiness  
and a passion for mountaineering and science  
Round, silken time!  
The eloquent leaf gave it respect.  
Gathering from mourning marble.  
The soul upgrading from my shoulder.  
I was without doubt the uncle squirrel  
there in the bitten archipeligos.  
When it looked me with its plumed ritual eyes  
it had neither ears nor arm  
but gold moons on its sides.  
The arrogant muscle is humble on your mouth.
