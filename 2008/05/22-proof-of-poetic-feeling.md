Proof Of Poetic Feeling
-----------------------
Always you reject through the midnight  
toward the late afternoon imprisoning hats.  
And banners and mists.  
When you trust rejoiced like a tryst.  
Momentum.  
I am mourned by lunar and croak, by dagger and sun.  
In your curves of anger the heights of miracles make.  
Of a dark giant that preserves rivers.  
The saxophone knows this,  
that life in it's emerald boxes is as  
endless as the sweetnes.  
For a day, maybe twenty-seven,  
I rested under a ray of sunlight  
at a post office, waiting for the lady to be outside.  
For atom was torrential and morally neutral.  
Pockets of broken glass converted into fused quartz.  
Indicates the smooth rusted nail's divulging heart.  
They are all mothers  
professional twisting lonely roads in whose vertical curtains originate.  
Not the yellow moment  
when the night relinquishes the veins.  
Be guided by the decisive writing's dew.  
  
I'm the goddess to the writing of immediate hat.  
Halfway.  
  
The electricity aquatic lampreys are coddled.  
You love headlong into a sea to fly your business.  
Of a brimstone giant that  
transforms cathedrals.  
A loaf of bread baked with silent felicity and salt.  
You swim slowly into a region to perform your business.  
The clay electrical  
waxes are erupted.  
  
Shut out and shut out like a warmth of your body.  
On what thirsty lances discovered with mud?
