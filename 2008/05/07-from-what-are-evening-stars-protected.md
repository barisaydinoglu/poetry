From What Are Evening Stars Protected
-------------------------------------
In your finger of animosity the city of foams pulse.  
From her arm and her hand kiss  
prizes of the earth.  
Of a dark bride that gallops splendors.  
As soon as the incoming circuss  
gives the historical indication.  
Troubled women and mountaineers.  
For me they are aerial.  
Everything fuming with starry voices,  
the salt of the warmth of your body  
and piles of iridescent bread with holiday.  
Around the impaling flames.  
The nocturnal bride  
wakes in the round morning.  
One of them is changeless,  
the other knows sequences.  
Where is everybody  
she quips, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Noone here is waiting for the next cactus.  
Bridge. You pulsed yourself for perching.
