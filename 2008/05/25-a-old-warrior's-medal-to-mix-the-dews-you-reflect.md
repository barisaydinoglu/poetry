A Old Warrior's Medal To Mix The Dews You Reflect
-------------------------------------------------
You are the mango of my morose eyelids.  
My heart moves from being boneless to being changeless.  
Full stop.  
When the boulevard is full of tenacious shoulder  
with whispers and forceful dead springtimes  
and the acidulous pastures and the lands  
at last give forth their sordid depth.  
I took on hollow movies.  
I wish to make a line segment  
amid, and every faith, many  
times hidden in a bottle.  
Multitude of flutes!  
In and out of the transluscent crimson the crimson and the sand-colored  
and a tremulous blue lake's ice will reconcile you.  
I stayed perfumed and blue  
inside the area.  
The changeless son  
gathers in the honest morning.  
A fog of praises here I am, a parsimonious heart smeared in the room of promise.  
A wheel is not enough to pamper me and keep me  
from the field of your handsome funny things.  
As soon as the incoming aspens  
gives the alphabetic indication.  
The fluidic astronaut  
sets in the winged morning.  
I want you to play on my heart.  
And a forceful home's water will breathe you.
