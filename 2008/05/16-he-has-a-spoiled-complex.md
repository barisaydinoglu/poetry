He Has A Spoiled Complex
------------------------
A current of starry silence  
that does not know why it flows and refreshes.  
Where productivities meet  
propellers meet, inside and next to and the sound  
of ashes, to reach out and shower in sorrow.  
In your leg of panic the thicket of lighthouses rise.  
Fewer and fewer  
abandon about another mode of tiredness.
