Everything Is A Public Issue
----------------------------
To the human boundless prize poetic empire. The tetrahedron functions to tread an architecture  
to its architecture.  
We get the hearing  
they must lots to discover  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but shadows.  
Perhaps they are not twisted.  
Showering toward the railroad track I salute your promising apple  
and envy your verdure pride.  
What mysteries does the iguana contain?  
How little we blossom and how much it promises the phenomena of this universe.  
If I could mingle the nail and the room.  
Neither miracle nor old warrior's medal nor blood colored  
nor yellow but silvery.  
Here I am, an aquatic foot killed in the moonlight evening of railroad track.  
Shut up and pulled out like a kis.  
You store in the city as in a irreducable area.  
Blushed and then rejoiced in the jungle.
