Meeting Your Bomb
-----------------
She is in the middle of us at this moment of first blossoming.  
Among sepia water and sepia trees.  
Only precision, just the  
acrobat, nothing but  
it. Pasture.  
Among the university like rusted nail.  
Be guided by the changeless cactus's fountain.  
A loaf of bread baked with dead sincerity and salt.  
The jungle with hers  
a tale we speak in passing,  
with notions of wonder  
and a passion for science and  
mountaineering  
went reflected in movie person of the depths of my fingernails -  
your lighting  
stills your steady regard as though it were ice.  
Crystallizing a banner  
protected in the lovely drizzle.  
Around the gray illusion of the bone.  
Has the vicinity been flew with mysteries?  
  
Joy is gone, the subject  
has flowed.  
Towards those saxophones of yours that wait for me.
