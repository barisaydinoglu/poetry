The Fatherless Person
---------------------
Sea's skin. Cinnamon twisting lonely roads of juice,  
transparent seams above a directionless warmth.  
They are all mothers  
professional dungs in whose smooth propellers originate.  
In your shoulder of illusion the modern office of knaves imbue.  
To the electric color of the gold book.  
The lonely cactus is cosmic on your leg.  
Conversations of mists, the recitation  
of rituals we call soft maternity.  
Sepia and deedy one,  
imperalist sunrise and the bleak key  
protest at the walls of my house.  
Around the black anger of the ghost.
