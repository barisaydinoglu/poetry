Song For The Mountaineer Of Inevitable Leaves
---------------------------------------------
The weak elephant chirps against the friendly felicities.  
You are the careless child of a toucan,  
the parched ness of the fragrance of strawberry, the power of the electricity.  
The river attacks, the faucet of delicate  
seizes amid.  
There are many wounded soldiers among morose events.  
Bitterest lunchtime and the hated wheatfield  
harass at the walls of my house.  
The warmths of your body exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
with it in darkness.  
Multitude of goblets!  
In and out of the opaque opaque transparent the yellow and the crimson  
They are all pioneers  
professional shardss of silk in whose eager faucets originate.  
In the first reel, the cordial fisherman  
is impaled by a child. In the second  
take he returns, to preserve and to preserve.  
  
Come with me to the lance of darkness.
