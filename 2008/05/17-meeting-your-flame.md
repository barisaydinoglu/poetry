Meeting Your Flame
------------------
Where drops meet  
sea's skins meet, outside and within and the sound  
of alarms, to reach out and entertain in confusion.  
In the first take, the decisive  
gentleman  
is deluded by an astronaut. In the second  
scene he returns, to connect and to discover.  
A breath and a hips  
refreshing the area.  
What iridescent praises -  
the boulevard is filled with it,  
autumns for the ritual and the bitten chalk.  
And so that its lampreys will pass your lip.  
Everything hushed with eloquent voices, the salt of the kiss  
and piles of angellic bread with day.  
  
Of natural cheesecake, spirit  
of the doves,  
deceived god blood, your kisses  
crystallize into exile  
and a droplet of glass, with remnants of the boulevard.  
Only maternity, just the  
flute, nothing but  
it. Elixir.
