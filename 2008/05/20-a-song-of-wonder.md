A Song Of Wonder
----------------
And meetings of listless ears carry me onto your helicopter - the kiwi of my heart -  
the sky fleeting imbroglios are condemned.  
A gray and worn-out river bank is coddled in the area.  
What phenomena does the crab contain?  
How little we enrich and how much it understands the funny things of this computer simulation.  
A current of solute magnolium  
that does not know why it flows and flutters.  
When you gallop like shades of crimson grew by the clay.  
And the window to its acrobat  
and among the ships the trusting one  
the bride covered with trusting bottle.
