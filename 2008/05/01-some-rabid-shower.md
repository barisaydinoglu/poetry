Some Rabid Shower
-----------------
Of homogeneous sugar, spirit  
of the energies,  
passed god blood, your kisses  
refresh into exile  
and a droplet of silicon, with remnants of the land. Wonder is gone, the subject has protected.  
A inscription flutters,  
drops - it does not return.  
It's a standing lemon of moths.  
A chorus of elephants at holiday un made un mutated  
comes to a halt before a phemonana.
