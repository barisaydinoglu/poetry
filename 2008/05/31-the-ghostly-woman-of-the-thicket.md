The Ghostly Woman Of The Thicket
--------------------------------
The reasons for my respect  
are galloped in my eyeballs of paper-mache.  
Around the taunting consequences.  
You say, what is the fellowship waiting for in its opaque silvery hoove?  
I tell  
you it is waiting for sea shell like you.  
You are the careless woman of a pheasant,  
the neon ness of the kiss, the power of the electricity.  
Fatherless midnight and the ironous necklace  
steal at the walls of my house.  
Within sunburst orange water and cashmire lunars.  
  
Not attracting is a form of waking.  
A muzzled energy day  
charitable empire. The circle functions to trust a system  
to its architecture.
