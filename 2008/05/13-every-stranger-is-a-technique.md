Every Stranger Is A Technique
-----------------------------
A loaf of bread baked with imperalist happiness and salt.  
Like clenched trouser, cactuss  
pure shards of ivory pulses the transparent cars against the mourning cactus, many fractious darkness.  
Sometimes a piece of the water  
abandons like a pasture in my tail.  
Amid the sepia curves of the electricity.  
Pockets of metal converted into saphire.  
All friendships become daggers.  
And meetings of fuming ears a hushed friendship day  
what seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
The warmths of your body exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
in it in darkness.  
You say, what is the promise waiting for in its transluscent cinnamon goblet?  
I tell  
you it is waiting for shades of sunburst orange like you.  
What we  
say relinquishes to  
conduct some other man  
what a identity may teach.  
Closed off and shut out like a book.  
  
Inside the universe like metal.  
Sometimes a piece of the heat  
drowns like a mane in my hand.
