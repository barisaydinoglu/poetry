I Have Gone Reconciling
-----------------------
An odor has crystallized against the wreath,  
a mixture of clock and body, a rejoicing  
springtime that brings sorrow.  
Nothing but that springtime of perfumes.  
Nothing but your enchanting breath.  
Fewer and fewer  
drown about another mode of honor.  
Here I am, a delicate finger loathed in the vicinity of thread.  
With its communist trust what fresh writings -  
the boulevard is filled with it,  
circuss for the root and the frail silk.  
Perfume  
on the dusts that wait for you  
dying the browbeaten chairs, entangling the doors.  
You carry my frail explication  
like a musical cat to fresh plum.  
Carry me onto your ship - the cherry of my praise -  
  
You - the celestial nose.
