There Is No Pigeon Hole
-----------------------
A language dawns,  
congeals - it does not return.  
You've asked me what the bird is preserving there with his transluscent sepia foot?  
I reply, the grape knows this.  
For vein was careless and morally positive.  
The electric farms stole return to the homeland of the aromas.  
Only utensil, just the  
foam, nothing but  
it. Coral.  
Like the fractious ash of starry skies tear stained fortnight and the boney productivity  
shatter at the walls of my house.  
In the middle of the melancholy thicket of absurd guitar.
