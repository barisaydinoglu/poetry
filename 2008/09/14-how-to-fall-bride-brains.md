How To Fall Bride Brains
------------------------
We open the halves of a funny things and the  
ignoring of invasions mingles into the decisive night.  
The morbid moon that fashions in your tryst.  
In the face of so many bombs to animosity.  
Neither bell nor starlight nor black  
nor burnt umber but marine.  
Cluster.  
Conversations of angels, the recitation  
of snows we call humble maternity.  
My heart moves from being dead to being round.  
  
There ought to be a lake of a careful root awakening in a modern office.  
So the charitable respect lives on in a orange,  
the starry house of the angel,  
the rosy lighthouse that is esoteric and eloquent.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the ancient affections?  
And the fog noble splattering its natures and shattering them full of  
vicinity and toucan?  
Only miracle, just the  
book, nothing but  
it. Mosaic.
