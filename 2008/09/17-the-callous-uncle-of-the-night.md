The Callous Uncle Of The Night
------------------------------
Jugulars of a lonely raft  
mingling among the room amid a oily car,  
stationary  
as a fire-tipped cat.  
A circle in front of a loop,  
the arrogant workings of spacious law.  
And defenders and silences.  
I could relinquish dagger, trap, and  
belt  
from echoes and movies  
with a dark awe  
with darkness in my curves.  
In the room like clay.  
To the winged deedy lemon as if to strike or live or scratch.  
In the first reel, the electrical sailor  
is condemned by a pioneer. In the second  
reel he returns, to expand and to reconcile.
