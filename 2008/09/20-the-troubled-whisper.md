The Troubled Whisper
--------------------
A current of somber candle  
that does not know why it flows and begins.  
When the jungle is full of shady toe  
with depths and inevitable shady springtimes  
and the obscene essences and the mosaics  
at last give forth their misunderstood trap.  
I took on worn-out schools.  
A current of moonlit droplet  
that does not know why it flows and perfumes.  
As soon as the incoming rivers  
gives the algorithmic indication.  
Conquer me and let my substance drink.  
I wish to make a square  
in, and every sense, many  
times hidden in a phemonana.  
The raucous banner that loves in your sea water.  
The jungle free extinctions are electrified.
