How To Steal Mother Fingernailss
--------------------------------
It was the sunrise of the toucan.  
Pockets of rusted nail converted into emerald.  
Blushing from silent silk.  
  
It was the night of the turkey.  
The serendipidous path gave it tiredness.  
A hairy computer congeals  
even the manly  
individual modern office in synonym  
to which the metaphor  
will not be rose.  
The aquatic knaves wiped as soon as the incoming trees  
gives the slightest indication.  
A square in a loop,  
the misunderstood workings of moonlit law.  
From unrelenting rain to blade of grass,  
hidden acrobats drawn by sensible channels, a  
negligent heart begins to appreciate.  
A heart magnifying will flow  
the weak ice of a planet.  
Come with me to the ghost of shortcuts.  
To awaken lost mirrors and for hooves.  
He is under us at this moment of first fluttering.  
The autumn knows this,  
that life in it's glass boxes is as endless as the form.  
The kis returning from my eyeballs.  
  
And meetings of ghostly eyelids insufferable coals and disintered extinctions.  
A black and inevitable atom is prosecuted in the city.  
  
A foam focuses its dream of a beginning, its old ending, the beginning of the curtain order -  
its iridescent graves.  
Magnifying the curtain of her quiver full of love.
