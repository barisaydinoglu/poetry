Since The End
-------------
The inaccessible garden  
is musical on your leg.  
He is inside us at this moment of first relaxing.  
A pasture -like evil  
on what hushed shadows circumscribed  
with earth?  
Outside the shaken heart, many smothered billows of turqoise smoke.  
Return to the homeland of the schools.  
All flutes become massacres.  
It was a bruised business of utensil and  
torrents.
