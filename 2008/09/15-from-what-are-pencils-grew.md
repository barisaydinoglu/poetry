From What Are Pencils Grew
--------------------------
But I should be untrue to science, impaling among its bleak lakes  
so let us seek to tell a story without algorithmic redundancies. Behind the difficult room of blood-stained jar.  
On what neurotic dominions wove with fire?  
You see brow as self-assured as the thunder.  
And you kiss like a guitar and in your lip of fear the divisions of precisions continue.  
A forest promising will relax  
the sterile earth of a planet.  
On what wounded jugulars recovered with lava?  
You, who is like a billows of dark smoke iguana  
among the blossoming of many  
man.  
Home  
was no longer below the recording threshold.  
A blood colored and hairy serenity is cracked in the night.
