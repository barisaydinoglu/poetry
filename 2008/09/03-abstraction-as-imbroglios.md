Abstraction As Imbroglios
-------------------------
My heart is filled with decency like a silicon smooth graphite.  
And you love like a vein and brainwash me and let my substance mix.  
Realized slender sea water outside the jungle like rusted nail.  
So the pure pride lives on in a cherry,  
the lyrical house of the kiss,  
the changeless productivity that is resolute and soft.  
A velvety carpet making an arcane thing of a impossible meeting  
with a god.
