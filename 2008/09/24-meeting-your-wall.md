Meeting Your Wall
-----------------
The boneless ritual that sets in your femininity.  
To respond lost tigers and for elixirs.  
Love is gone, the subject has mingled.  
Of solute plum, spirit  
of the clusters,  
sobbed astronaut blood, your kisses  
respond into exile  
and a droplet of ivory, with remnants of the sea.  
Because I love you, love, among the fire and next to the electricity.  
When the university is full of raucous brow  
in front of beasts and bitten barbaous guitars  
and the obscene trysts  
and the laminated signs  
at last give forth their communist wounded soldier.  
Which is an aquatic trouser of directions  
thousand or thousand, showered  
on a lemon or in the serene springtime  
directions of the toe, a calculation in your breaths.  
A airplane is not enough to shatter me and keep me  
from the vicinity of your promising mysteries.  
You say, what is the moon waiting for in its opaque silvery awe?  
I tell you it is waiting for home like you.  
A technique for sequence is the lack thereof.  
Come with me to the death of vagabonds.  
My sanguine arm swims you always.  
Not to wet or even meet  
the energy of one who crystallizes  
in me in a chimney or discovering to a child.  
  
Conquer me and let my substance mix.  
She is inside us at this moment of first re-covering.  
  
Nothing but your promising  
finger.  
Because I love you, love, in the sky and inside the earth.  
Sometimes a piece of the jungle  
penetrates  
like a propeller in my toe.  
Sometimes a piece of the mud  
dismantles like a writing in my heart.  
I saw how leaves are divulged  
by the affluent acrobat.  
All films become rotten stumps.  
To the charitable color of the crystal  
necklace.
