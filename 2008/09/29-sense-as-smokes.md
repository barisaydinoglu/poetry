Sense As Smokes
---------------
A loaf of bread baked with crooked love and salt.  
Pasture of a pampered exiled goblet.  
The early light of day praises you in its mortal lava.  
Among the molested flint, many ghostly martyrs.  
I took on guilt sweetness.  
My lyrical fingernails expands you always.  
You see curves as cordial as the drizzle.  
The I in laminated sign come with me to the felicity of wombs.  
  
And meetings of ironous hand  
handsome, silken honeysuckle!  
Nothing but that wheatfield of essences.  
  
But the cluster grew the memory.  
From her fingernails and her eyelids rejoice  
mosaics of the earth.
