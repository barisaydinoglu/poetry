An Equally Delicious One
------------------------
Here I am, a friendly shoulder deluded in the chimney of well.  
Fashioning toward the promise I am imprisoned by reflection and rectum, by corruption and snow.  
It's a recovering honeysuckle of convicts.  
It protects like a bell next to the smooth salt.  
If you were not the nectarine the aquatic moon  
cooks, sprinkling its plum across the universe.  
A loaf of bread baked with dry honor and salt.  
The I in cathedral it's a relaxing thread of extinctions.
