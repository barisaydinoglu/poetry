Meeting Your Viola
------------------
Not the deep brown moment  
when the late afternoon discovers the bottles.  
What brainwashes the props of happiness?  
And splendors and femininities.  
The sweetnes knows this,  
that life in it's emerald boxes is as endless as the precision.  
I stayed loved and transparent  
inside the archipeligos.  
One of them is enchanting,  
the other knows details.  
Where is nobody  
she quips, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
  
Always you disguise through the afternoon  
toward the day chaining propellers.  
With its chaotic dawn I want you to drink on my breath.  
Which is a myriad promise of directions  
too many to count or thousand, developed  
on a dew or in the fleeting coat  
directions of the mouth, a calculation in your hipss.  
When the moonlight evening is full of lethargic toe  
behind wounds and furious torrential friendships  
and the smothered moons and the praises  
at last give forth  
their neurotic noise.  
In silvery water and yellow laws.
