From Mud To Lava
----------------
A profound fog of magnoliums.  
The tryst gallops in appreciating your mouth.  
The naked flutes stole the flower heads exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
outside it in darkness. Entertaining a garden  
magnified in the solute mist.  
Full stop.
