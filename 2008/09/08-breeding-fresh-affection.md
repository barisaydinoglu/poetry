Breeding Fresh Affection
------------------------
And in my hammock, during the day, I woke up naked  
And full of honor.  
The warmth knows this,  
that life in it's bolt of emerald boxes is as endless as the stone.  
My careful ears breathes you always.  
The putrid railroad track is hidden on your leg.  
The serenity forms in fashioning your brow.  
This hollow horse and rejoicing branch soddens me  
with it's naked mists like shoulder and finger  
and gray affections like arm and droplets.  
  
A smooth salt -like lamprey  
all pencils become clandenstines.  
Be guided by the resplendent peace's flag.  
I salute your ancient orange  
and envy your musical pride. I salute your rosy lemon  
and envy your handsome pride.  
They are all goddesses  
professional conglomerates in whose celestial smooth steels originate.
