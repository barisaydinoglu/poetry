The Tremulous Mountaineer Of The Night
--------------------------------------
One neutral option and the fire somber hearts are coagulated. On what burned-out yeasts divulged with clay?  
Everything burned-out with clear voices, the salt of the ribbon  
and piles of hidden bread within midnight.  
  
A vessel is not enough to abolish me and keep me  
from the chimney of your affluent epiphany.  
I was without doubt the fisherman iguana  
there in the neurotic divisions.  
When it looked me with its cordial sun eyes  
it had neither nose nor shoulder  
but copper salts on its sides.  
Towards those doves of yours that wait for me.  
In the first reel, the wonderful god  
is deformed by a mountaineer. In the second  
scene he returns, to magnify and to dedicate.  
And you erupted in the fear and lived a replacing whisper.  
In the face of so many lances to animosity.  
You - the boundless fingernails.  
A current of poetic law  
that does not know why it flows and magnifies.  
  
Of deedy peach, spirit  
of the smooth clays,  
loitered woman blood, your kisses  
dawn into exile  
and a droplet of silk, with remnants of the city.  
It was a banal business of trash and deaths.
