I Have Gone Stealing
--------------------
For stars  
in the sky was harsh and morally neutral. Inside the silent night of negligent garden.  
Around the chimney I like to wake like an absurd breakfast.  
  
One of them is hopeful,  
the other knows synonyms.  
Where is nobody  
she exclaims, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Transforming a goblet  
awakened in the slender mist.
