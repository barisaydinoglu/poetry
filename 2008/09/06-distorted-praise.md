Distorted Praise
----------------
What careful flower heads -  
the modern office is filled with it,  
kisses for the hoove and the disintered ivory.  
Like circumstances filtering inside windows.  
Among the ultraviolet  
panic of the billows of gray smoke.  
And you conduct like a railroad track and conversations of souls, the recitation  
of bells we call absent minded sun rise.  
Your toe connects from west to south
