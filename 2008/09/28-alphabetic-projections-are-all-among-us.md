Alphabetic Projections Are All Among Us
---------------------------------------
The universe in front of hers  
a tale we tell in passing,  
with notions of love  
and a passion for jouranlism and mountaineering  
you wake in the sea as in a sanguine jungle.  
Around the chimney I like to swim like a lashed thread.  
Spoiled lances and directionless moths.  
Draw from it the disordered  
language of its own antenna.  
As if  
to steal or return or electrify.  
  
Shall we go forward?  
A boat is not enough to freeze me and keep me  
from the moonlight evening of your fresh secrets.  
When you love fluttered like a fragrance of strawberry.  
Bottle of a faltered neon eddy.  
Multitude of productivities!  
In and out of the sunburst orange the sand-colored and the sepia  
inside the dull shades of marine embarassement of the wasteland.  
Like polyps twisting outside magnoliums.  
The hollow turkey appreciates in the middle of the myriad roosters.
