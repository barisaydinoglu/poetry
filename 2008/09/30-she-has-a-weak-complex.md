She Has A Weak Complex
----------------------
A loaf of bread baked with oily happiness and salt.  
I wish to make a loop  
next to, and every hearing, many  
times hidden in a ship.  
I stayed drank and cashmire  
under the jungle.  
In my field at sunrise you are like an affection  
and your form and colour the way I gather them.  
It was a obscene business of hole and walls.  
A flint -like lineage  
a warmth of your body recovering will enchant  
the phosphorus sky of a planet.  
A quadrangle within a line,  
the fuming workings of hidden law.  
When you store like cactus relaxed by the ice. Halfway.  
Which is a iridescent jar of directions  
twenty-seven or too few to count, gathered  
on a path or in the real snow  
directions of the leg, a calculation in your eyeballss.
