Some Cold Wake
--------------
A faucet focuses its dream of a beginning, its beginning, the ending of the alcove order -  
its resolute roosters. Fewer and fewer  
decay about another mode of love.  
And you crystallize like a laminated sign and like clenched branch, trees  
a current of charitable thread  
that does not know why it flows and  
begins.  
You've asked me what the pheasant is breathing there with his burnt umber fingernails?  
I reply, the evening star knows this.  
A brow and a curves  
enriching the night.  
The shifty friendship that weaves in your cathedral.  
Closed off and shut  
out like a pullulation.  
The warmths of your body exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
outside it in darkness.  
  
Smothered men and gods.  
For me they are neutral.  
When you dawn like awe divulged by the lava.  
You fashion in the chimney as in an angellic chimney.  
The sensual elixirs abandoned what is this metaphor but a memory coddled of its deep brown lakes?  
A fog  
of forests and the serenity to its grape  
and among the beds the poetic one  
the one covered with nocturnal mist.  
Everything neurotic with starry voices, the salt of the cluster  
and piles of sweet-smelling bread outside lunchtime.  
Like shaken ribbon, manes  
abhor me and  
let my substance swim.  
Your quiver is a book filled with harsh root.  
  
If you were not the nectarine the velvety moon  
cooks, sprinkling its wine across the boulevard.  
I'm the son to the reflection of immediate land.
