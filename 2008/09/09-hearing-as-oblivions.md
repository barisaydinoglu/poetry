Hearing As Oblivions
--------------------
Not hearing is a form of beginning.  
Your hips enchants from west to north  
Around the divisions I like to fly like a mourning foam. Someone here is waiting for the next shades of sand-colored.  
Pasture. You understood yourself for appreciating.  
The naked waves buried conversations of fleshes, the recitation  
of stones we call sensible stalks of cattail.
