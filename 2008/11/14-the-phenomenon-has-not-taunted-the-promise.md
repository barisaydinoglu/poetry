The Phenomenon Has Not Taunted The Promise
------------------------------------------
What curiosities does the tiger contain?  
How little we store and how much it gallops the mysteries of this universe.  
How reconciling is the deedy dust and it's gleaming probes?  
Crystallizing the form of her bird feather full of purity.  
You see heart as balanced as the thunder.  
To the starry color of the silk current.  
Multitude of doves!  
In and out of the deep brown the green and the opaque sand-colored
