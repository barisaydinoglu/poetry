An Equally Pure Custodian
-------------------------
It wakes like a telegraph  
next to the old warrior's medal.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the thick elixirs?  
And the thunder balanced splattering its splendors and abolishing them full of  
vicinity and toucan?  
And knaves and  
bridges. You are the orange of my insufferable hips.  
Myriad, fused quartz precision!  
Neither movie nor eddy nor blood colored  
nor sand-colored but cinnamon.  
Pockets of rusted nail converted into ceramic.
