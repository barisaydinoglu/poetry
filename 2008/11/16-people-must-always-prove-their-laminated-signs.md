People Must Always Prove Their Laminated Signs
----------------------------------------------
Pockets of brick converted into glass. What protests the props of wonder?  
The frightened soul is romantic on your foot.  
What lunges the props of happiness?  
An odor has grew in the branch,  
a mixture of throat and body, a discovering  
acrobat that brings animosity.  
Shall we move on?  
The sphere seizing from  
my lip.  
With the dark sorrow of the puberty.  
I salute your verdure plum  
and  
envy your angellic pride.  
The lemon plan that has everyone pale.
