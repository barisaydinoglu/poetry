I Have Gone Gathering
---------------------
Multitude of smooth salts!  
In and out of the burnt umber the burnt  
umber and the sunburst orange I took on directionless  
affections.  
And  
the railroad track to its landscape  
and among the transparent lakes the serendipidous one  
the cousin covered with free reflection.  
I was without doubt the son squirrel  
there in the muzzled thicket.  
When it looked me with its sensual fellowship eyes  
it had neither  
shoulder nor foot  
but marble precisions on its sides.  
In your ears of sorrow the boulevard of angels play.  
A current of warm atom  
that does not know why it flows and inherits.  
A loving wind of banners.  
Of your blood colored coral when you hold out your eyelids.  
There are many trash barges next to morose events.  
  
Realized myriad cactus star.  
This fractious school and exciting smooth ash replaces me  
with it's somber energies like shoulder and brain  
and ultraviolet flints like nose and corals.
