Your Lip Is Enough
------------------
Halfway. What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
Which is a serendipidous friendship of directions  
too many to count or three hundred, pulsed  
on a dove or in the verdure foliage  
directions of the lip, a calculation in your hipss.
