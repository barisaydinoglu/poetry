The Boneless Mother
-------------------
As if to fall or perform or compound.  
Your home is a gold architecture filled with exiled muscle.  
In the face of so many yeasts to positivity.  
Your brain rejoices from west to south  
and outside my hammock, during the sunset, I woke up naked  
and full of sincerity.  
Ripple of a changed sifted praise.  
My parsimonious arm creates you always.  
When the jungle is full of banal breath  
with moths and insufferable atrocious cathedrals  
and the browbeaten kisses and the warmths  
at last give forth their callous rectum.  
There are many circumstances next to listless events.  
  
My humble hips shines you always.  
I could hear cubicle, darknes, and bloodied clay  
from defenders and propellers  
with a rust colored lemon  
with  
depths in my foot.  
The soul faints, the salt of irreducable  
inherits outside.  
Gathered and then began in the thicket.  
A loaf of bread baked with bitter decency and salt.  
To the moonlit  
color of the diamond flute.  
As if to puncture or transform or protest.  
I am deprived by lunar and salt, by oxide and rain.  
An odor has mixed inside the vein,  
a mixture of stain and body, a reflecting  
sun that brings sorrow.  
Of a rust colored pioneer that  
gathers banners.  
Once there was  
a fatherless mother who  
gathered at parties, sitting in a circle, among love.  
  
Not to perch or even meet  
the vein of one who kisses  
behind me in a modern office or fashioning to a son.  
I do not decay in the land of hollow  
vagabond.
