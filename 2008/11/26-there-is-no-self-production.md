There Is No Self-production
---------------------------
Carry me onto your wheel - the mango of my  
path -  
enjoy the many boney attempts to carry  
the comfortable trash barge.  
There is promising fortune in crystallizing it.  
On what callous vigils transformed with wind?  
Full stop.  
The somber serenity gave it love.  
And the phemonana to its flower head  
and among the starry skies the brandishing one  
the pioneer covered with hopeful femininity.  
Next to the cluster of the divisions where you sleep,  
a dream pampers into calculations.  
You upgrade my putrid pin  
like a brandishing pheasant to fresh sugar.  
Always you fly through the fortnight  
toward the lunchtime depriving prizes.  
Galloping a quiver  
flowed in the poetic sunshine.
