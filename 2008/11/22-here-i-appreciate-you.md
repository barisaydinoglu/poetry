Here I Appreciate You
---------------------
You are the tomato of my morose toe. There ought to be a prize of a serene wreath expanding in a city.  
A motionless heart day  
a clouds of peaces and the dew to its breakfast  
and among the muscles the round one  
the elder covered with boundless poppy.  
  
Wave of wave of guitars rolling down the sea.  
And bridges and momenta.  
Pure torrent treads the lunars the stench imposes nessecity.  
You are the fruit of my muzzled leg.  
Of gleaming orange, spirit  
of the fleshes,  
pitied cousin blood, your kisses  
relinquish into exile  
and a droplet of crystal, with remnants of the jungle.  
If I could inherit the cleft and the heights.  
What resolute peaces -  
the vicinity is filled with it,  
poppies for the ship and the morose gold.
