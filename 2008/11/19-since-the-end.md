Since The End
-------------
Only senile and to a  
child they take on time, too few to count years  
when you kiss relaxed like a current.  
There are many martyrs among difficult events.  
The root plan that has everyone hated.  
Sepia and cleansed fisherman,  
you've asked me what the oyster is mingling there with his yellow lip?  
I reply, the mist knows this.  
The night doves  
you in its mortal jungle.
