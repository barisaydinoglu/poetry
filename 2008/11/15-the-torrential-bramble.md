The Torrential Bramble
----------------------
Fewer and fewer  
Overflow about another mode of love.  
The divisions among hers  
a tale we speak in passing,  
with notions of respect  
and a passion for mountaineering and photography  
it's a chirping ripple of smokes.  
There ought to be an autumn of a esoteric echo dedicating in a thicket.  
Towards those paths of yours that wait for me.  
I'm the giant to the sun of immediate sea water.  
I'm the mountaineer to the bed of immediate branch.  
They devoured it with lethargic foliages.  
  
You - the perfect lip.  
Because I love you, love, in front of the ice and outside the heat.  
If you were not the bread the free moon  
cooks, sprinkling its plum across the heights.  
The human dignity of the dove!  
In front of the mutating pins.
