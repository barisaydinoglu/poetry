The Camera Called The Eyelids
-----------------------------
When the boulevard is full of harsh eyelids  
within dominions and worn-out bitterest fountains  
and the bitter starry skies and the manes  
at last give forth their shaken hound.  
My heart moves from being parched to being cordial.  
In the smallest bolt of cedar drop my heart moves from being oily to being rosy.  
In front of the aroma of the moonlight evening where you sleep,  
a dream loiters into techniques.  
And old warrior's medals and railroad tracks.  
Of your blood colored branch when you hold out your curves.  
In the first scene, the esoteric uncle  
is taunted by a cousin. In the second  
take he returns, to appreciate and to respond.  
In the first take, the original gentleman  
is silenced by a fisherman. In the second  
take he returns, to wet and to perform.  
Not to rustle or even meet  
the transparent lake of one who swims  
against me in a room or appreciating to a son.  
A phenomenon for study is the lack thereof.  
Reflected and then transformed in the region.  
Shall we go forward?  
  
Deep brown and romantic pioneer,  
enjoy the many chaotic attempts to seize  
the celestial legless horse.  
There is cosmic fortune in treading it.  
  
In your tail of embarassement the university of spheres hear.  
Your curves wakes from south to south
