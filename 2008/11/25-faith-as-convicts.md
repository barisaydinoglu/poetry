Faith As Convicts
-----------------
Your lake is a grace filled with calculating dew. Against the cold opaque green car, many calculating serections.  
Neither book nor flag nor blood colored  
nor opaque sunburst orange but cashmire.  
And among my hammock, during the sunrise, I woke up naked  
and full of joy.  
A metaphor for sequence is the lack thereof.
