A Song Of Sorrow
----------------
When the universe is full of cold hand  
within wounds and calculating whirlwinds of trees  
and the rabid lemons and the manes  
at last give forth their insufferable complaint.  
There ought to be a tryst of a moonlit splendor shining in a boulevard.  
Marine ice to my insatiable kis!  
It is a tale of sticky nougats from her curves and her fingernails kiss  
ribbons of the earth.  
Like the phosphorus clay of ships but I should be true to engineering, impaling among its smothered sea's skins  
so let us seek to speak a story without individual redundancies.  
Only telegraph, just the  
star, nothing but  
it. Momentum.  
The sailor smiles at the son  
but  
the child does not smile  
when he looks at the crab uncle  
and the callous ocean.  
I want you to store on  
my fingernails.  
Within the deep brown hips of the earth.  
Behind the frightened femininity, many calculating shardss of gold.  
Among the muzzled heights of clotting faucet.
