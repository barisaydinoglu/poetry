Everything Is A Grammatic Issue
-------------------------------
What crushes the props of wonder?  
In your eyelids of overflowing the boulevard begins to dream of making.  
What we say magnifies to  
tread some other custodian  
what a metaphor may teach.  
The boneless iguana makes under the boundless self-productions.  
And you build like a serendipity and you see leg as honest as the drizzle.  
With its melancholy pacify not the green moment  
when the morning entertains the drops.  
Towards those shorelines of yours that wait for me.  
In your shoulder of confusion the heights of fellowships relax.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the verdure schools?  
And the snow moonlit splattering its productivities and conquering them full of  
sea and squirrel?  
The delicate autumn gave it happiness.
