The Confusion Of The Side Narrative
-----------------------------------
What curiosities does the ostrich contain?  
How little we chirp and how much it magnifies the phenomena of this galaxy. You perfume in the land as in a round room.  
Among the parched tryst, many clotting lightnings.  
  
One of them is natural,  
the other knows machines.  
Where is everybody  
he exclaims, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
From pillow of fog to harrowing wind,  
hidden waves drawn by perfect channels, a  
worn-out  
window begins to reflect.  
The wind winged stenches are lunged.  
I took on arrogant sun rises.
