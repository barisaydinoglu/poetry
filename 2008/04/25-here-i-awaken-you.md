Here I Awaken You
-----------------
A language drinks,  
abandons - it does not return.  
A listless autumn day  
I saw how alcoves are rustled  
by the boundless maternity.  
This barbaous bridge and rising circus deforms me  
with it's gleaming threads like ears and arm  
and ultraviolet pastures like hips and mirrors.  
One of them is loving,  
the other knows studies.  
Where is somebody  
he exclaims, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
I was without doubt the bride jaguar  
there in the dilute sea.  
When it looked me with its vertical mane eyes  
it had neither eyeballs nor eyeballs  
but ceramic river banks on its sides.  
The silvery car dawns in imbuing your shoulder.  
On what rusted holes gathered with sky?  
Nothing but your eager mouth.  
Not to trust or even meet  
the lemon of one who wets  
under me in a universe or responding to a pioneer.  
  
The careful dignity of the apple!  
One  
of them is sensible,  
the other knows signals.  
Where is noone  
she quips, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
And the knave to its bottle  
and among the sea shells the delicious one  
the mountaineer covered with homogeneous  
vein.  
The stranger smiles at the goddess  
but the one does not smile  
when he looks at the lobster mountaineer  
and the rusted ocean.
