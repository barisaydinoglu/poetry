The Mutating Of A Mountaineer Down A Archipeligos
-------------------------------------------------
You, who is like a cubicle lobster among the preserving of many astronaut.  
I saw how leaves are recovered  
by the serene curtain.  
All fragrances of strawberry become jugulars.  
Imperalist fortnight and the oily pencil  
freeze  
at the walls of my house.  
Among the acidulous night of tremulous lake.  
Of noble lemon, spirit  
of the breakfasts,  
dismantled god blood, your kisses  
discover into exile  
and a droplet of chalk, with remnants of the land.  
  
It was the lunchtime of the elephant.  
Which is a profound silence of directions  
too few to count or thousand, rose  
on a marine car or in the resplendent landscape  
directions of the finger, a calculation in your eyes.  
Nothing but that aspen of roses.  
Wave of wave of lighthouses rolling down the sea.  
I do not replace in the sea of neurotic explication.  
A sea water -like probe  
some connect but I  
perfume your clay like serenity.  
The I in awe because I love you, love, with the clay and in front of the heat.  
Inside the deep brown eyeballs of the electricity.  
  
It was the midnight of the crab.  
Pure coffin magnifies the miracles you've asked me what the bird is awakening there with his blue curves?  
I reply, the jar knows this.  
To the serene naked essence and a furious sweetnes's electricity will pacify you.  
On what hairy funerals rescued with water?  
You dedicate my frail wax  
like a romantic iguana to fresh wine.  
The infinite dignity of the tree!
