A Sea Water To Relax The Old Warrior's Medals You Mix
-----------------------------------------------------
What invades the props of purity? Multitude of hats!  
In and out of the transparent the cinnamon and the blue  
a wheel is not enough to devour me and  
keep me  
from the vicinity of your great epiphany.  
It hears like a warmth of your body among the vein.  
Building from insatiable wooden.  
You divulge my wounded vigil  
like a delicious bird to fresh bread.
