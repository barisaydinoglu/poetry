The Harsh Lady Of The Thicket
-----------------------------
Pockets of steel converted into crystal.  
The guilt quilt is equinoctial on your mouth.  
Inside the shifty river, many spoiled clandenstines.  
If I could enchant the hole and the night.  
A metaphor for projection is the lack thereof.  
In the face of so many roosters to animosity.  
Of your opaque blood colored cathedral when you hold out your brain.  
Peace of a devoured banal shoreline.  
But I should be true to photography, smearing among its distorted magnoliums  
so let us attempt to divulge a story without aerial redundancies.  
Went circumscribed in shades of transparent but I should be untrue to science, mutating among its cold roots  
so let us begin to speak a story without algorithmic redundancies.  
The room around hers  
a tale we tell in passing,  
with notions of decency  
and a passion for jouranlism and oceanography  
you say, what is the honeysuckle waiting for in its green reflection?  
I tell you it is waiting for sweetnes like you.  
Neither mist nor perfume nor rust colored  
nor cashmire but sunburst orange.  
A iridescent carpet making a velvety thing of a lucky meeting with a child.  
Halfway.  
Crimson convicts of stalactite,  
crimson seams above a inevitable tiger.  
An odor has perfumed inside the grape,  
a mixture of conspirator and body, a chirping  
key that brings beligerance.  
The atom taunts, the lake of winged  
reflects among.  
But I should be true to engineering, electrifying among its dilute honeysuckles  
so let us seek to tell a story without individual redundancies.  
An odor has upgraded behind the heart,  
a mixture of seperation and body, a fashioning  
defender that brings agony.  
Full stop.  
  
In the smallest paper-mache form to seek another land and you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
entertain of knaves and railroad tracks  
and the nocturnal phemonanas of his native land?  
Among the fractious chimney of boneless snow.  
  
From harrowing wind to palm tree leaf,  
hidden propellers drawn by nocturnal channels, a  
hairy soul begins to make.  
Return to the homeland of the productivities.
