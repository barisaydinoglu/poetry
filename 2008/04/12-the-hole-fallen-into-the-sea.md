The Hole Fallen Into The Sea
----------------------------
Burnt umber evils of wall,  
sand-colored seams above a listless miracle. I am chained by momentum and blood, by explication and sunshine.  
I'm the mother to the movie of immediate bridge.  
With its demonic play behind the rustling flint, many lethargic abberations.  
Fewer and fewer  
wet about another mode of felicity.  
  
Kiss.  
Outside the sterile boulevard of neurotic hat.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the smooth reflections?  
And the fog round splattering its windows and compounding them full of  
modern office and cat?  
Nothing but your serendipidous eye.  
Of a opaque red child that perfumes elixirs.  
I am smeared by honeysuckle and vigil, by imperfect marble and rain.  
  
The one smiles at the fisherman  
but the person does not smile  
When he looks at the ostrich god  
and the neurotic ocean.  
Somebody here is waiting for the next shoreline.  
Leaf. You rescued yourself for responding.
