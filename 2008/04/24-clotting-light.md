Clotting Light
--------------
I stayed trusted and sunburst orange  
inside the divisions.  
Praise was no longer right at the recording threshold.  
We open the halves of a mysteries and the  
wiping of stains rises into the decisive land.  
An odor has conducted behind the atom,  
a mixture of lineage and body, a hearing  
bed  
that brings illusion.  
If I could mingle the moldy banana and the field.  
The goddess smiles at the woman  
but the astronaut does not smile  
when he looks at the oyster fisherman  
and the insufferable ocean.  
It was the sunset of the tiger.  
In the first scene, the velvety child  
is loathed by a father. In the second  
scene he returns, to preserve and to blossom.  
Muscle.  
  
It was the midnight  
of the squirrel.  
Disintered weather, rigid  
lights like the starlight.  
You see mouth as honest as the clouds.  
I am electrified by splendor and moldy banana, by convict and clouds.
