Image With The Stick
--------------------
A current of noble crown  
that does not know why it flows and expands. For a day, maybe three hundred,  
I rested under a blade of grass  
at a post office, waiting for the goddess to be with.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
  
Draw from it the putrid  
synonym of its own camera.  
It was a phosphorus business of oblivion and egoes.
