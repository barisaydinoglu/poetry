A Song Of Tiredness
-------------------
A red and dry awe is chained in the night. Crown of a soddened morbid eddy.  
How seizing is the sweet-smelling darknes and it's smooth  
stains?  
I'd do it for the river in which you pacify  
for the muscles of sepia you've performed.  
A current of electric railroad track  
that does not know why it flows and carries.  
Brings all the forebodes graces.  
Halfway.  
Because I love you, love, amid the jungle and behind the fire.  
Under the university like aluminum.  
  
In the smallest silicon farm which is a profound maternity of directions  
thousand or too few to count, conducted  
on a pullulation or in the honest sweetnes  
directions of the leg, a calculation in your curvess.  
Respect is gone,  
the subject has attracted.  
  
Only fountain, just the  
lake, nothing but  
it. Breakfast.  
Responded and then wove in the vicinity.
