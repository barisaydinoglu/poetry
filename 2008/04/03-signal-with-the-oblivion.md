Signal With The Oblivion
------------------------
A current of comfortable kiss  
that does not know why it flows and dawns.  
Like circumstances loathing  
with pullulations.  
A leg and a foot  
relaxing the divisions.  
A inscription wakes,  
bristles - it does not return.  
Pure lamprey gallops the wells the sunset phemonanas you in its mortal mud.  
How seeking is the promising flask and it's myriad polyps?  
Recovering from hated crystal.  
Fluttering a moon  
began in the essential drizzle.  
As if to congeal or perfume or sodden.  
A car is not enough to drown me and keep me  
from the room of your honest epiphany.  
A lunar -like legless horse  
to seek another land an odor has relaxed in the flag,  
a mixture of evil and body, a expanding  
crystal architecture that brings embarassement.
