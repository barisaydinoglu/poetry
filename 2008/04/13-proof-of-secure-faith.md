Proof Of Secure Faith
---------------------
And a lashed saxophone's water will excite you.  
Towards those telegraphs of yours that wait for me.  
You are the orange of my raucous hips.  
Shall we proceed?  
To the real eager flower and leaves and honeysuckles.  
Not to dawn or even meet  
the praise of one who begins  
in me in a region or living to a mother.  
A path enchanting will gather  
the callous earth of a planet.
