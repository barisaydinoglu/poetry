The Skeleton Bride
------------------
You say, what is the fellowship waiting for in its marine tiger?  
I tell you it is waiting for sea water like you.  
Infinite, saphire  
rose!  
The stick understands on its sifted mare  
waking sand-colored phemonanas over the moonlight evening.  
As soon as the incoming elixirs  
gives the neutral indication.  
And so that its utensils will drop your eyelids.  
A slender rain of flints.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the electric paths?  
And the drizzle scrupulous splattering its gardens and faltering them full of  
boulevard and crab?  
Shining from obscene emerald.  
  
To the lyrical loving law a line segment inside a line segment,  
the tremulous workings of nocturnal law.  
A current of scrupulous jar  
that does not know why it flows and perfumes.
