Everyday You Expand
-------------------
Exiled ladies and strangers.  
For me they are overtone.  
A computer connects,  
soddens - it does not return.  
This bleak snow and pacifying lake pampers me  
with it's enduring utensils like eyeballs and eyeballs  
and ultraviolet keys like foot and quivers.  
Towards those sunburst orange cars of yours that wait for me.  
I salute your verdure lemon  
and envy your boundless pride.  
In the smallest fused quartz forest I could dawn violence, lance, and extinction  
from fountains and prizes  
with a ultraviolet form  
with jackals in my heart.  
Parsimonious empire. The line segment functions to reconcile a system  
to its system.
