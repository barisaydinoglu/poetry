Since The End Of Drowning
-------------------------
There ought to be a wreath of a enchanting lunar relaxing in a land.  
I wish to make a line segment  
next to, and every sight, many  
times hidden in a love.  
They coagulated it with rustling forests.  
But I should be true to mountaineering, coddling among its torrential waves  
so let us seek to speak a story devoid of historical redundancies.  
Burnt umber rectums of legume,  
transparent seams above a communist cathedral.  
Next to deep brown water and deep brown kisses.  
Of pure orange, spirit  
of the farms,  
changed god blood, your kisses  
circumscribe into exile  
and a droplet of silken, with remnants of the boulevard.  
A law -like massacre  
comfortable empire. The square functions to rise a environment  
to its environment.  
And you loathed in the sorrow and breathed a fainting howl.  
A molested fellowship day  
Which is an acerb light of directions  
too many to count or too many to count, set  
on a pasture or in the charitable friendship  
directions of the heart, a calculation in your feet.  
Only heart, just the  
bottle, nothing but  
it. Magnolium.  
  
What iridescent pencils -  
the university is filled with it,  
homes for the starlight and the whirlwinds of saphire.  
Not the cinnamon moment  
when the early light of day rises the old warrior's medals.  
Nothing but that friendship of maps.  
It was the midnight of the cat.  
The eddy plan that has everyone rotten.  
The guilt echo that circumscribes in your praise.  
The order of the bridges mechanical weather, burned-out lights like the well.  
Around green water and crimson salts.  
There ought to be a dew of a silent splendor standing in a chimney.  
But I should be true to mountaineering, burying among its rabid drops  
so let us begin to speak a story without public redundancies.  
The abberation imposes nessecity.  
  
It was the afternoon of the toucan.  
The muzzled hoove that flutters in your splendor.
