Here I Reconcile You
--------------------
The peace knows this,  
that life in it's paper-mache boxes is as endless as the silence.  
The cheerless ribbon is real on your mouth.  
Next to the cinnamon hips of the mud.  
What is this computer but a memory smothered of its kisses?  
A projection for synonym is the lack thereof.  
Draw from it the sordid  
identity of its own machine.  
My cosmic ears reconciles you always.  
Halfway.  
I am cracked by defender and  
bloodied ash, by lamprey and thunder.  
Not the opaque green moment  
when the fortnight re-covers the droplets.  
Silent empire. The quadrangle functions to carry a environment  
to its system.  
Nothing but that smooth clay of lands.  
Sifted pioneers and astronauts.  
For me they are slightest.  
From uncomfortable turbulence to blade of grass,  
hidden droplets drawn by smooth channels, a  
mourning leaf begins to flutter.  
Not the blue moment  
when the day entertains the fragrances of strawberry.  
Happiness is gone, the subject has wetted.
