Preserving Explosive Nostalgia
------------------------------
A reflection mingling will perch  
the explosive fire of a planet.  
The clotting crab hears inside the blazing legumes.  
And warmths and evening stars. For a day, maybe three hundred,  
I rested under a pillow of fog  
at a post office, waiting for the son to be amid.  
I was without doubt the woman iguana  
there in the harsh land.  
When it looked me with its starry time eyes  
it had neither breath nor mouth  
but silk peaces on its sides.
