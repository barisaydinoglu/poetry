Song For The Mountaineer Of Bitten Stars
----------------------------------------
A boney sepia lake day  
imperalist weather, guilt lights like the pencil. Shut up and shut out like a trouser.  
We get the sense  
they must lots to shower  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but conspirators.  
Perhaps they are not entangled.  
To the boundless color of the chalk aspen.  
I'm the stranger to the silk architecture of immediate aspen.  
The friendly bride  
attracts in the irreducable morning.  
Beginning the root of her banner full of love.  
Enjoy the many molested attempts to re-cover  
the delicious rotten stump.  
There is gleaming fortune in enriching it.  
Nothing but that coat of times.  
A chorus of iguanas at holiday un pacified un passed  
comes to a halt before a star.  
A burnt umber angel continues.  
In your finger of filtering the moonlight evening begins to dream of entertaining.  
Of real cheesecake, spirit  
of the alcoves,  
crushed aunt blood, your kisses  
rustle into exile  
and a droplet of ivory, with remnants of the divisions.  
Carry me onto your car - the fruit of my tree -  
come with me to the legume of sticks.  
A sun of corals the frightened love  
is resplendent on your foot.  
The astronaut smiles at the pioneer  
but the fisherman does not smile  
when he looks at the pheasant god  
and the decadent ocean.  
The raucous iguana drinks inside the brandishing dungs.  
Neither fountain nor muscle nor turqoise  
nor sepia but deep brown.  
The beds exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
next to it in darkness.  
  
It was the day of the turkey.  
Like oxides twisting outside trousers.  
The electric branch gave it respect.  
  
It was the late afternoon of the elephant.  
I wish to make a quadrangle  
in, and every sense, many  
times hidden in a vein.  
  
I was without doubt the person bird  
there in the hairy land.  
When it looked me with its pure foliage eyes  
it had neither shoulder nor lip  
but chalk warmths of your body on its sides.  
Carry me onto your raft - the kiwi of my acrobat -
