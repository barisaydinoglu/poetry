Everyday You Respond
--------------------
It is a tale of windy martyrs my solute heart protects you always.  
I want you to wake on my eye.  
For grace was calcerous and morally negative.  
Nothing but that lemon of gardens.  
I salute your lion hearted plum  
and envy your trusting pride.  
The stars in the sky steals, the angel of fleeting  
flows outside.  
Be guided by the hidden love's river bank.
