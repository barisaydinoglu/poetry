Behind Of Coral And Peace
-------------------------
I'm the pioneer to the tiger of immediate lighthouse.  
Wave of wave of ribbons rolling down the sea.  
The candles exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
next to it in darkness.  
To the perfect hopeful planetarium appreciating from smothered saphire.  
Which is a cosmic land of directions  
twenty-seven or too few to count, created  
on a grape or in the real crown  
directions of the tail, a calculation in your hands.  
My heart moves from being distorted to being pure.  
A misunderstood camera abhors  
even the resplendent  
grammatic modern office in machine  
to which the metaphor  
will not be blossomed.
