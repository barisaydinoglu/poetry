It Relinquished With Breakfasts
-------------------------------
For a day, maybe too many to count,  
I rested under a unrelenting rain  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the giant to be around.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
tread of flower heads and branches  
and the serene river banks of his native land?
