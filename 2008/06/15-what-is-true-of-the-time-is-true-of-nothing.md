What Is True Of The Time Is True Of Nothing
-------------------------------------------
Behind the rotten starlight, many torrential juices. You protect slowly into a jungle to store your business.  
And you mix like a quilt and because I love you, love, behind the clay and amid the heat.  
The I in fellowship and the shades of sunburst orange to its aspen  
and among the movies the naked one  
the aunt covered with poetic flower head.  
A flower focuses its dream  
of a new ending, its ending, the beginning of the circus order -  
its verdure jackals.  
  
You set in the heights as in an absent minded jungle.  
Harsh imbroglios and misunderstood scandalmongerings.  
A production for identity is the lack thereof.  
My heart moves from being furious to being sanguine.  
The violenet toucan returns in the boundless martyrs.  
In your heart of gnawing the archipeligos begins to dream of weaving.  
A distorted technique ignores  
even the balanced  
individual night in technique  
to which the metaphor  
will not  
be divulged.
