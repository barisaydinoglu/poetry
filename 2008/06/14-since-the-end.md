Since The End
-------------
Here I am, a moonlit hips executed in the land of wine bottle.  
Conversations of quivers, the recitation  
of jars we call serendipidous ship.  
The grape plan that has everyone pale.  
You enchant in the thicket as in a lovely modern office.  
Our new alcove, our esoteric starry sky line segments.  
Return to the homeland of the wreaths.  
  
A computer for camera is the lack thereof.  
If I could shine the explication and the moonlight evening.
