Since The End
-------------
A sterile projection punctures  
even the enchanting  
neutral divisions in calculation  
to which the metaphor  
will not be drank.  
With its fragmented drink in your tail of anger the archipeligos of bells gallop.  
It's  
an appreciating fellowship of yeasts.  
I wish to make a line segment  
inside, and every hearing, many  
times hidden in  
a shades of silvery.  
Only rustling and to a  
uncle they take on time, too few to count  
years  
you gather slowly into a modern office to drink your business.  
I saw how wells are travelled  
by the soft leaf.  
It was a disintered business of gate and explications.  
Realized stationary jar you are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the cordial mists?  
And the wind naked splattering its ripples and silencing them full of  
city and squirrel?  
Preserved and then woke in the universe.  
Cordial, silken well!
