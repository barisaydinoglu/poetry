Meeting Your Hound
------------------
Your angel is a tiger filled with burned-out sea's skin.  
Once there was a lethargic daughter who  
reflected at parties, sitting in a circle, among lakes.  
Not the blue  
moment  
when the early light of day develops the planetariums.  
Multitude of souls!  
In and out of the transparent the crimson and the blue  
in your arm of loitering the room begins to dream of rising.  
With its shaken kiss on what negligent daggers mingled  
with water?  
As soon as the incoming warmths of your body  
gives the public indication.  
Not the yellow  
moment  
when the lunchtime understands the sun rises.  
  
A tetrahedron in a square,  
the banal workings of parsimonious law.  
The hidden dignity of the banner!  
The afternoon autumns you in its mortal ice.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.
