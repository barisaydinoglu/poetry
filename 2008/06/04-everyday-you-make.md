Everyday You Make
-----------------
The field with hers  
a history we tell in passing,  
with notions of joy  
and a passion for engineering and engineering  
the senile miracle is smooth on your heart.  
My pure hips relinquishes you always.  
The parenthetical landscapes sobbed the dews exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
behind it in darkness.  
Towards those fountains of yours that wait for me.  
Realized resolute sun rise like calculating foliage, starlights  
I stayed swam and marine  
under the modern office.  
And sun rises and starlights.  
The dashing dignity of the muscle!  
A loop outside a loop,  
the worn-out  
workings of balanced law.  
  
In the first reel, the humble person  
is abandoned by a man. In the second  
scene he returns, to grow and to blossom.  
To seek another land juice was no longer above the recording threshold.
