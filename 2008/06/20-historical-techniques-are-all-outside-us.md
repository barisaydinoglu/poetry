Historical Techniques Are All Outside Us
----------------------------------------
Tear stained weather, inevitable lights like the bird feather.  
I wish to make a line segment  
amid, and every meaning, many  
times hidden in an alcove.  
My heart is filled with respect like a paper-mache droplet.  
Where stones meet  
cactuss meet, outside and outside and the sound  
of coffins, to reach out and set in illusion.  
Making the fragrance of strawberry of her quiver full of love.  
In your brow of condemning the heights begins to dream of inheriting.  
Because I love you, love, with the wind and outside the clay.
