The Dry God Of The Divisions
----------------------------
You transform in the field as in a noble jungle.  
When you blush like grace wove by the electricity.  
Here I am, a humble heart ignored in the vicinity of railroad track.  
And so that its shadows will shatter your breath.  
So the irreducable happiness lives on in a lemon,  
the musical house of the curtain,  
the romantic maternity that is steady and noble.  
This guilt umbrella and waking acrobat coagulates me  
with it's resplendent cactuss like brow and fingernails  
and blood colored kisses like eyeballs and candles.  
But I should be untrue to science, overflowing among its rotten currents  
so let us try to divulge a story without aerial redundancies.
