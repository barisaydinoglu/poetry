Color Is An Episode Of Lard
---------------------------
With the undulating explications.  
When you wake like heart refreshed by the heat.  
The slender mane gave it sincerity.  
Multitude of mirrors!  
In and out of the crimson the green and the deep brown  
The bleak current that shines in your law.  
One of them is wonderful,  
the other knows antennae.  
Where is nobody  
she quips, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
A fleeting mist of movies.  
Our new flower, our moonlit honeysuckle lines.  
It was an absurd business of lard and ashes.  
Living toward the poppy weak seperations and windy scandalmongerings.  
The reasons for my respect  
are transformed in my fingernails of ivory.  
A pencil focuses its dream of a new beginning, its new beginning, the new ending of the awe order -  
its mineral dominions.  
  
Not to perfume or even meet  
the coral of one who lives  
in me in a divisions or rescuing to a man.  
A warmth performing will shine  
the bitter sky of a planet.
