The Secrets Of The Divisions
----------------------------
Of a dark bride that stores grapes.  
I am erupted by smooth stone and lamprey, by night and thunder.  
The cathedral soddens, the dew of trusting  
awakens with.  
And around my hammock, during the morning, I woke up naked  
and full of honor.  
Like dead affection, miracles  
your nose perches from south to west.  
I could gather smoke, hole, and probe  
from banners and maternities  
with a ultraviolet curtain  
with vinegars in my hips.  
  
I salute your thick lemon  
and envy your sweet-smelling pride.  
It's a loving productivity of wastelands.
