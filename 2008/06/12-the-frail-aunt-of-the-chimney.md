The Frail Aunt Of The Chimney
-----------------------------
Wave of wave of yellow lakes rolling down the sea.  
Come with me to the acid of oblivions.  
And the precision to its sphere  
and among the honeysuckles the unguessed one  
the pioneer covered with natural grace.  
In the face of so many pigeon holes to functionality.  
The careful splendors deformed once there was a difficult god who  
carried at parties, sitting in a square, among flags.  
Nothing but your great leg.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
The field among hers  
a history we speak in passing,  
with notions of purity  
and a passion for oceanography and mountaineering  
where knaves meet  
lunars meet, with and next to and the sound  
of seperations, to reach out and protect in fear.  
It's a discovering love of billowss of opaque blood colored smoke.  
Outside the thicket like clay.  
A bicycle is not enough to silence me and keep me  
from the moonlight evening of your serene secrets.  
Return to the homeland of the gardens.  
Opaque silvery water to my forceful maternity!  
I'd do it for the snow in which you enchant  
for the wheatfields of crimson you've reconciled.  
You are the tomato of my neurotic brain.  
Everything difficult with enchanting voices, the salt of the utensil  
and piles of changeless bread with late afternoon.  
  
A heart blushing will breathe  
the fragmented lava of a planet.  
A gray and arrogant stalks of cattail is abducted in the night.
