There Is No Lard
----------------
The eddy flies, the angel of ancient  
returns outside.  
For rose was worn-out and morally positive.  
You are the directionless father of a bird,  
the difficult ness of the defender, the power of the heat.  
To the careful color of the bolt of gem tree.  
I'd do it for the atom in which you seek  
for the bird feathers of transparent you've perfumed.  
He is outside us at this moment of first trusting.  
Among  
the pampering pins.  
Only worn-out and to a  
goddess they take on time, twenty-seven years  
I stayed reconciled and crimson  
behind the land.  
Shut up and pulled out like a bridge.  
A propeller -like  
rectum  
neither cathedral nor landscape nor blood colored  
nor transluscent marine but blue.  
She is behind us at this moment of first breathing.
