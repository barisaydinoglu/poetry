I Have Gone Abducting
---------------------
Beligerance and pasture - snows of panic. Mechanical weather, windy lights like the pasture.  
The deedy momentum gave it felicity.  
All forms become alarms.  
As soon as the incoming ships  
gives the historical indication.  
To seek another land I could divulge abys, wax, and trap  
from cactuss and trees  
with a turqoise horse  
with self-productions in my foot.  
One of them is comfortable,  
the other knows studies.  
Where is somebody  
she says, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
The defenders exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
behind it in darkness.  
We open the halves of a epiphany and the  
puncturing of deaths conducts into the balanced land.  
  
But the vein  
attracted the memory.  
Shall we keep going?  
  
Shake me and let my substance travel.  
Carry me onto your ship - the kiwi of my candle -
