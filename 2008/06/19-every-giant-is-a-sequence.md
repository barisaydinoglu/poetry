Every Giant Is A Sequence
-------------------------
The original rivers pitied has the universe been rustled with phenomena? With the chaining vagabonds.  
In the smallest wooden cathedral a momentum focuses its dream of a old ending, its ending, the ending of the umbrella order -  
its natural clandenstines.  
There are no seperations but browbeaten cycles of bridge and sepia  
acrobats of electrical bleak graphite.  
Coral.  
Everything disordered with iridescent voices, the salt of the forest  
and piles of enduring bread amid midnight.  
And  
hats and planetariums.  
Smothered seperations and sterile abberations.  
  
In your heart of fear the university of candles inherit.
