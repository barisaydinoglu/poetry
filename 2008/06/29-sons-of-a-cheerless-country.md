Sons Of A Cheerless Country
---------------------------
The candle plan that has everyone inaccessible.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
So the affluent joy lives on in a orange,  
the serene house of the apple,  
the electric praise that is gleaming and trusting.  
The order of the umbrellas a loaf of bread baked with acidulous joy and salt.  
Like the raucous  
rusted nail of trousers responded and then stood in the city.  
What we say entertains to  
develop some other father  
what a calculation  
may teach.  
  
I wish to make a square  
behind, and every color,  
many  
times hidden in a flute.  
Halfway.
