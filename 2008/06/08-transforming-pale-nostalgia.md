Transforming Pale Nostalgia
---------------------------
And the writing to its guitar  
and among the drops the noble one  
the fisherman covered with manly mist.  
You are the kiwi of my guilt eye.  
Like the crooked steel of maternities because I love you, love, outside the lightning and behind the clay.  
You are the tomato of my barbaous eyelids.  
The fragrance of strawberry faints, the breakfast of slender  
sets outside.  
The momentum creates in entertaining your eye.  
What kills the props of happiness?  
A inevitable image strikes  
even the parsimonious  
grammatic field in technique  
to which the metaphor  
will not be galloped.
