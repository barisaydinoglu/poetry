Trusting Bleak Nostalgia
------------------------
The explosive aroma is delicious on your leg. Under the disintered sun, many pale waxes.  
Brings all the abandons stars.  
A chorus of iguanas at lunchtime un began un coddled  
comes to a halt before a starry sky.  
Sepia bloody  
feathers of night,  
silvery seams above a boney warmth of your body.  
Bleak weather, imperalist lights like the pencil.  
My heart moves from  
being cold to being gleaming.  
Full stop.  
Has the boulevard been heard with curiosities?
