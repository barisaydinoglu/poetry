Some Muzzled Recover
--------------------
And you light like a warmth and beligerance and sunburst orange car - sea's skins of fear.  
I want you to shine on my brain.  
I'm the person to the hat of immediate precision.  
For sun rise was fragmented and morally negative.  
Opaque crimson  
and sensible gentleman,  
you say, what is the droplet waiting for in its cashmire wreath?  
I tell you it is waiting for tryst like you.  
Full stop.
