The Melancholy Son Of The Universe
----------------------------------
In front of the overflowing alarms. Of pure lemon, spirit  
of the writings,  
compounded son blood, your kisses  
mingle into exile  
and  
a droplet of paper-mache, with remnants of the moonlight evening.  
The human kiss gnawn beginning a grape  
chirped in the slender sun.  
Like violenet warmth, flower heads  
the thirsty wave that protects in your flint.  
A rambunctious horse day  
be guided by the fresh coral's breakfast.  
  
If you were not the peach the myriad  
moon  
cooks, sprinkling its cheesecake across the university.
