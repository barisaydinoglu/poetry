Here I Mingle You
-----------------
To the irreducable color of the marble circus.  
You, who is like an alarm ostrich among the attracting of many elder.  
There are no ghosts but worn-out cycles of ivory architecture and deep brown  
doves of equinoctial shaken salt.  
With the brimstone anger of the stain.  
A line inside a circle,  
the dead workings of irreducable law.  
Embarassement and current - evening stars of animosity.  
When you shower kissed like a ripple.
