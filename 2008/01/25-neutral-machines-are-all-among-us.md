Neutral Machines Are All Among Us
---------------------------------
  
Love on the juices that wait for you  
gnawing the boney chairs, passing the doors.  
You flow my boneless  
blood  
like a handsome cat to fresh peach.  
Confusion and wheatfield - affections of anger.  
The silent tiger creates under the acerb egoes.  
Not hearing is a form of waking.  
Nothing but your somber nose.  
Transluscent deep brown ice to my banal soul!  
Not mixing is a form of rising.
