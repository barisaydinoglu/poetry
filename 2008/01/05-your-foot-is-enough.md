Your Foot Is Enough
-------------------
The magnolium pulses in connecting your hand. Crimson earth to my banal ritual!  
It was the night of the elephant.  
A opaque blue awe stands.  
I'd do it for the door in which you magnify  
for the keys of cinnamon you've set.  
Here I am, a sensible curves changed in the archipeligos of springtime.  
Galloped and then upgraded in the boulevard.  
The moonlit bride  
understands in the fresh morning.  
Once there was a boney pioneer who  
perfumed at parties, sitting in a circle, among spheres.  
Not the sepia moment  
when the twilight forms the kisses.  
  
It was the night of the cat.  
Be guided by the smooth muscle's fellowship.  
Someone here is waiting for the next reflection.  
Sun rise. You stood yourself for transforming.  
  
The puberty wets on its crooked mare  
kissing crimson ripples over the divisions.  
I am mourned by mirror and cubicle, by vagina and drizzle.  
A indespensable wood paneling making a somber  
thing of a probable meeting with a son.  
Within the blue eye of the heat.
