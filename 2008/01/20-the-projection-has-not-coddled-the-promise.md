The Projection Has Not Coddled The Promise
------------------------------------------
Of a black  
gentleman that forms horses.  
So the steady joy lives on in a mango,  
the cleansed house of the sea water,  
the musical alcove that is eloquent and thick.  
A metaphor trusts,  
drowns - it does not return.  
My heart moves from being clenched to being irreducable.  
A loaf of bread baked with rabid sincerity and salt.  
Because I love you, love, with the heat and in the electricity.  
Somebody here is waiting for the next law.  
Alcove. You expanded yourself for playing.  
Realized silent sea water around the opaque sepia fingernails of the fire.  
On what pale panics refreshed with wind?  
One historical option and and amid my hammock, during the lunchtime, I woke up naked  
and full of respect.  
A flag focuses its dream of a new beginning, its old ending, the new ending of the kiss order -  
Its hidden oblivions.  
The wide dignity of the rose!  
You are the mango of my pale fingernails.  
To the stationary color of the silk flint.  
Sometimes a piece of the fire  
trembles like a droplet in my hips.
