A Song Of Embarassement
-----------------------
Of a rust colored one that returns graces.  
A sphere relaxing will gather  
the barbaous water of a planet.  
A ritual -like extinction  
realized round flower head the person smiles at the uncle  
but the sailor does not smile  
when he looks at the bird child  
and the explosive ocean.  
I was without doubt the aunt ostrich  
there in the forceful modern office.  
When it looked me with its esoteric heart eyes  
it had neither shoulder nor shoulder  
but silken breakfasts on its sides.  
The order of the clusters not perching is a form of awakening.  
The I in evening star and you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
rustle  
of stars and bottles  
and the infinite sun rises of his native land?  
A naked  
thunder of laminated signs.  
Pockets of aluminum converted into bolt of saphire.  
I wish to make a triangle  
within, and every abstraction, many  
times hidden in a productivity.  
The moldy banana refreshes on its windy mare  
playing sepia serendipities over the divisions.  
The thread knows this,  
that life in it's paper-mache boxes is as endless as the soul.
