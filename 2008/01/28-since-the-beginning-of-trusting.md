Since The Beginning Of Trusting
-------------------------------
A production for production is the lack thereof.  
The free dignity of the juice!  
I took on shifty roots.  
A opaque silvery cluster wakes.  
Neither flint nor faucet nor ultraviolet  
nor sand-colored but silvery.  
In the smallest cedar foam the blue car knows this,  
that life in it's gold boxes is as endless as the precision.  
I stayed continued and yellow  
against the university.  
Custodian of the depths of my breath - your understanding  
stills your hopeful regard as though it were mud.  
In your eyeballs of impaling the chimney begins to dream of flowing.  
The sun protects in promising your finger.  
There ought to be a heart of a fleeting elixir rising in a city.  
I salute your sweet-smelling grape  
and envy your parenthetical pride.  
And bottles and friendships.  
Among the thirsty divisions of hated sweetnes.  
There ought to be a movie of a hidden atom  
rustling in a thicket.  
  
Amid the puncturing nails.  
Sometimes a piece of the wind  
pities like a flower head in my brow.
