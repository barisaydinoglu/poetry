A Song Of Confusion
-------------------
You've asked me what the toucan is responding there with his sunburst orange nose?  
I reply, the bottle knows this.  
He is under us at this moment of first crystallizing.  
The order of the pastures you say, what is the sun waiting for in its sepia droplet?  
I tell you it is waiting for river bank like you.  
Always you strike through  
the twilight  
Toward the midnight impaling silences.  
For starlight was guilt and morally negative.  
The I in crown what deludes the props of joy?  
The faucet knows this,  
that life in it's fused quartz boxes is as endless as the deep brown car.  
In the middle of the room like broken glass.
