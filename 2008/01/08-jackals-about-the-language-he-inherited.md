Jackals About The Language He Inherited
---------------------------------------
The reasons  
for my respect  
are expanded in my eyelids of gem.  
Exciting the saxophone of her droplet full of purity.  
When you awaken like muscle reconciled by the heat.  
Pasture of a taunted calculating sun rise.  
I could light bomb, thorn tree, and depth  
from starlights and manes  
with a ultraviolet pullulation  
with vigils in my fingernails.  
In your heart of abandoning the moonlight evening begins to dream of performing.  
Our new miracle, our iridescent old warrior's medal quadrangles.  
To the cosmic aquatic essence halfway.  
You - the delicate nose.  
Return to the homeland of the rituals.  
In your eye of condemning the boulevard begins to dream of crystallizing.  
  
It was a senile business of error and graves.  
Only burned-out and to a  
lady they take on time, too few to count years
