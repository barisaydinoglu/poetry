A Silent Substance
------------------
In the phosphorus room of disordered home.  
The juice plan that has everyone inaccessible.  
Has the room been lived with curiosities?  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
  
Showering a book  
flowed in the friendly fog.  
A black and nauesous bird feather is conquered in the sea.  
I wake as if among a bitter dagger.  
This misunderstood flute and standing drop drowns me  
with it's brandishing silences like tail and finger  
and ultraviolet laminated signs like tail and jars.  
A car is not enough to strike me and keep me  
from the vicinity of your sanguine secrets.  
Everybody here is waiting for the next mane.  
Starry sky. You recovered yourself for protecting.  
What we say seeks to  
travel some other elder  
what a sequence may teach.
