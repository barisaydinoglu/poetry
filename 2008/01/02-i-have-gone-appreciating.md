I Have Gone Appreciating
------------------------
Like the atrocious steel of bird feathers some transform but I awaken your clay like grace.  
Pulled out and shut out like a warmth.  
A loaf of bread baked with exiled felicity and salt.  
Appreciate on the gates that wait for you  
imprisoning the exiled chairs, executing the doors.  
In the face of so many nails to animosity.  
The mud humble enemies are decayed.  
  
To imbue lost mosaics and for elixirs.  
My heart is filled with sincerity like a cedar shoreline.
