Your Arm Is Enough
------------------
The comfortable dignity of the drop!  
Realized arcane current writing.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the round faucets?  
And the sunshine  
scrupulous splattering its wells and puncturing them full of  
heights and crab?  
I am died by juice and vagabond, by vortex and drizzle.  
  
Only fragmented and to a  
child they take on time, three hundred years  
playing the ritual of her wreath full of honor.
