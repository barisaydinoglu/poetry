Here I Reconcile You
--------------------
As soon as  
the incoming kisses  
gives the grammatic indication.  
What naked sea's skins -  
the city is filled with it,  
poppies for the kis and the wet-winged ivory.  
Like flames harassing among utensils.  
An odor has built against the lemon,  
a mixture of belt and body, a protecting  
utensil that brings animosity.  
From her curves and her nose excite  
fountains of the earth.  
My heart is filled with love like a marble vein.  
My perfect leg weaves you always.  
My heart moves from being bruised to being fluidic.  
There ought to be a honeysuckle of a enchanting mosaic promising in a land.  
And you mix like a stars in the sky and I'm the gentleman to the book of immediate key.  
The reasons for my respect  
are expanded in my lip of chalk.  
The giant smiles at the lady  
but the goddess does not smile  
when he looks at the lobster man  
and the shifty ocean.  
Evening star was no longer above the transmission threshold.
