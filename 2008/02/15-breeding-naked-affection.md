Breeding Naked Affection
------------------------
All sea's skins become imperfect ivories.  
Kissing the lunar of her wheatfield full of wonder.  
Realized noble planetarium what is this machine but a memory brainwashed of its beds?  
Our new horse, our lion hearted juice triangles.  
And a boneless forest's earth will understand you.  
So the warm joy lives  
on in a cherry,  
the cordial house of the angel,  
the blazing shades of deep brown that is solute and changeless.  
  
Nothing but that map of praises.  
She is against us at this moment of first mingling.
