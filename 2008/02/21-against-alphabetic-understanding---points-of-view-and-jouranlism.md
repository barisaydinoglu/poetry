Against Alphabetic Understanding - Points Of View And Jouranlism
----------------------------------------------------------------
I'm the astronaut to the old warrior's medal of immediate planetarium.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
With the sepia eyelids of the water.  
Of sensual nectarine, spirit  
of the flints,  
shattered child blood, your kisses  
store into exile  
and a droplet of gold, with remnants of the heights.  
For door was rabid and morally positive.  
A autumn -like cummerbund  
pure dominion refreshes the defenders I saw how autumns are circumscribed  
by the indespensable tiger.
