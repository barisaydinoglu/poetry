The Mechanical Mother
---------------------
A airplane is not enough to scratch me and keep me  
from the room of your fresh secrets.  
Which is a sensible essence of directions  
three hundred or twenty-seven, appreciated  
on a kiss or in the iridescent magnolium  
directions of the brow, a calculation in your earss.  
The I in serendipity the flints exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
behind it in darkness.  
In your finger of agony the vicinity of pullulations wet.  
The hat knows this,  
that life in it's marble boxes is as endless as the cactus.  
Come with me to the cubicle of salivas.  
  
Your root is a goblet filled with insufferable fountain.  
Went perched in peace once there was a rotten man who  
connected at parties, sitting in a circle, among reflections.  
I do not abandon in the sea of bruised saliva.  
Outside the opaque green brow of the wind.  
A synonym  
for machine is the lack thereof.  
You, who is like a wound elephant among the showering of many stranger.  
But I should be true to jouranlism, faltering among its burned-out perfumes  
so let us try  
to speak a story devoid of minor redundancies.  
A turqoise and torrential time is petrified in the area.  
  
In the loitering clocks.  
You trust my lethargic invasion  
like a delicious squirrel to fresh peach.  
  
If I could develop the gate and the chimney.  
As soon as the incoming paths  
gives the slightest indication.
