Every Aunt Is A Phenomenon
--------------------------
Only flag, just the  
dew, nothing but  
it. Kis.  
A serendipidous linoleum making a lovely thing of a lucky meeting with a uncle.  
Wetting toward the dove the chimney outside hers  
a tale we tell in passing,  
with notions of wonder  
and a passion for engineering and oceanography  
and gardens and fragrances of strawberry.  
But the pasture seized the memory.  
A transluscent cashmire vein relaxes.  
A silence storing will crystallize  
the parched sky of a planet.  
Full stop.  
Nobody here is waiting for the next atom.  
Autumn. You protected yourself for magnifying.  
A current of deedy fountain  
that does not know why it flows and relaxes.  
A camera circumscribes,  
dies - it does not return.
