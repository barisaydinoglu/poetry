Proof Of Serendipidous Meaning
------------------------------
Chirped and then returned in the heights.  
The misunderstood bird continues in the naked cubicles.  
Tread on the rectums that wait for you  
twisting the smothered chairs, condemning the doors.  
And the flesh to its flag  
and among the veins the sanguine one  
the son covered with absorbant sea water.  
Not to chirp or even meet  
the bed of one who refreshes  
against me in a night or hearing to a fisherman.  
We open the halves of a funny things and the  
electrifying of pamphlets reflects into the handsome modern office.  
Towards those bird feathers of yours that wait for me.
