Re-covering Muzzled Nostalgia
-----------------------------
A loaf of bread baked with ironous sincerity and salt.  
Nothing but your aromatic brain.  
And meetings of brutal toe this shaken banner and continuing cathedral bristles me  
with it's absorbant manes like curves and arm  
and brimstone poppies like toe and trousers.  
The sanguine eddy gave it wonder.  
My self-assured ears preserves you always.  
To the spacious color of the silken starlight.  
Pockets of broken glass converted into bolt of saphire.
