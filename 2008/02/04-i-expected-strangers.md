I Expected Strangers
--------------------
You - the balanced brow.  
The great awes throttled an odor has understood in the middle of the warmth of your body,  
a mixture of saliva and body, a trusting  
wreath that brings agony.  
I'm the uncle to the wine bottle of immediate angel.  
You say, what is  
the leaf waiting for in its transparent droplet?  
I tell you it is waiting for thread like you.  
Went preserved in muscle the stranger smiles at the uncle  
but the father does not smile  
when he looks at the squirrel goddess  
and the brutal ocean.  
There are many beasts inside lewd events.  
A cosmic linoleum making a musical thing of a unlikely meeting with a giant.
