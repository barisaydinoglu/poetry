What Is True Of The Door Is True Of Everything
----------------------------------------------
Decency is gone, the subject  
has blossomed.  
A cold projection twists  
even the arcane  
grammatic vicinity in inscription  
to which the metaphor  
will not be promised.  
Pockets of salt converted into silken.  
The hairy nature that wets in your forest.  
A sunshine of suns here I am, a sanguine hand rejected in the archipeligos of perfume.  
My heart is filled with love like a silicon planetarium.  
To mingle lost sea shells and for saxophones.
