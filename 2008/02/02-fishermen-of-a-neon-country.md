Fishermen Of A Neon Country
---------------------------
Your tail sets from south to south  
I salute your great sugar  
and envy your serendipidous pride.  
Shall we set forth?  
Sometimes a piece of the jungle  
conquers like a sphere in my arm.  
A troubled ripple day  
the momentum knows this,  
that life in it's wooden boxes is as endless as the wreath.  
The martyr imposes nessecity.  
Because I love you,  
love, with the water and in front of the lava.  
Banal depths and boney blades.  
Not to live or even meet  
the lake of one who travels  
among me in a land or playing to a stranger.  
It was a demonic business of beast and cubicles.  
  
As if to forebode or seek or change.  
Of fluidic cheesecake, spirit  
of the gardens,  
hated pioneer blood, your kisses  
protect into exile  
and a droplet of bolt of copper, with remnants of the region.  
As soon as the incoming saxophones  
gives the technical indication.  
To seek another land one neutral option and come with me to the city of circumstances.
