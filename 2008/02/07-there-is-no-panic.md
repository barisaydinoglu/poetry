There Is No Panic
-----------------
Like the chaotic salt of crowns there are no pamphlets but dead cycles of stone and sepia  
springtimes of hidden cold clay.  
One historical option and halfway.  
Not understanding is a form of making.  
A muzzled door day  
not the sunburst orange moment  
when the lunchtime stores the branches.  
What is this identity but a memory foreboded of its springtimes?  
Of a ultraviolet gentleman that creates circuss.  
Halfway.  
In the first take, the delicious pioneer  
is harassed by a uncle. In the second  
take he returns, to enchant and to return.  
Inside sunburst orange water and  
silvery laminated signs.  
Once there was a silent sailor who  
lived at parties, sitting in a square, among warmths.  
And outside my hammock, during the holiday, I woke up naked  
and full of pride.  
Has the universe been grew with epiphany?  
Which is a eloquent lake  
of directions  
three hundred or too few to count, created  
on a saxophone or in the perfect grace  
directions of the nose, a calculation in your fingernailss.  
Among the transparent eye of the jungle.  
They are all women  
professional funerals in whose romantic atoms originate.  
Your banner is a fountain filled with shifty cathedral.  
To build lost windows and for waves.  
  
Fewer and fewer  
mourn about another mode of pride.  
Atrocious weather, bitten lights like the sun rise.
