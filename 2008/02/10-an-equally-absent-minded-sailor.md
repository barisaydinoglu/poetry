An Equally Absent Minded Sailor
-------------------------------
And the starry sky to its stone  
and among the wine bottles the real one  
the elder covered with charitable river bank.  
Among the furious window, many sifted uranus.  
And so that its lances will tremble your curves.  
Pure blood makes the gardens  
enrich on the bombs that wait for you  
smothering the rabid chairs, deluding the doors.  
To the electrical color of the gem peace.  
One of them is sweet-smelling,  
the other knows details.  
Where is someone  
she cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
You, who is like a nougat toucan among the understanding of many goddess.  
The obscene squirrel kisses behind the somber massacres. The pamphlet lives on its bleak mare  
divulging transparent rituals over the region.  
Lemon.
