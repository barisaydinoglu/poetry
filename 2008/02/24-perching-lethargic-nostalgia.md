Perching Lethargic Nostalgia
----------------------------
You pacify slowly into a region to mingle your business.  
But I should be true to oceanography, faltering among its molested serenities  
so let us seek to tell a story without technical redundancies.  
Full stop.  
Realized perfect knave if you were not the cheesecake the electric moon  
cooks, sprinkling its wine across the chimney.  
As soon as the incoming curtains  
gives the technical indication.  
What compounds the props of decency?  
  
Inside sand-colored water and burnt umber burnt umber cars.  
What we say reconciles to  
travel some other gentleman  
what a calculation may teach.  
Around the chimney I like to magnify like a burned-out dove.  
I saw how sea shells are responded  
by the hidden path.  
We get the hearing  
they must lots to understand  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but rotten stumps.  
Perhaps they are not silenced.  
Carry me onto your boat - the fruit of my sphere -  
come with me to the clock of waxes.
