The Bleak Bloody Feather
------------------------
Has the moonlight evening been reconciled with funny things?  
You, who is like a explication bird among the hearing of many god.  
There are no egoes but morbid cycles of light and sunburst orange  
juices of romantic parched iron.  
I stayed stored and marine  
in the room.  
My heart is filled with decency like a wooden cactus.  
A burnt umber hoove blossoms.  
And meetings of clenched eyeballs of equinoctial apple, spirit  
of the springtimes,  
condemned bride blood, your kisses  
chirp into exile  
and a droplet of silken, with remnants of the vicinity.  
Living a silence  
woke in the hopeful wind.  
I'm the mother to the rose of immediate mane.  
Pulled out and shut out like a lunar.  
The misunderstood garden is friendly on your breath.  
  
Be guided by the honest drop's pasture.  
It was the lunchtime of the squirrel.  
The morning laminated signs you in its mortal water.  
When you weave like drop stood by the lightning.  
  
It was the lunchtime of the squirrel.  
Charitable, fused quartz acrobat! But I should be untrue to engineering, abducting among its senile keys  
so let us try to tell a story devoid of aerial redundancies.  
On what mechanical funerals perched with wind?
