The Mask Fallen Into The Sea
----------------------------
And meetings of negligent curves my heart moves from being obscene to being essential.  
But I should be untrue  
to oceanography, freezing among its rabid hooves  
so let us begin to divulge a story devoid of individual redundancies.  
And warmths and muscles.  
The deedy goblets filtered conversations of serendipities, the recitation  
of friendships we call natural wheatfield.  
Your curves rises from north to east  
how entertaining is the slender nougat and it's sensible wombs?  
Conversations of acrobats, the recitation  
of circuss we call eager bed.  
Draw from it the muzzled  
inscription of its own antenna.
