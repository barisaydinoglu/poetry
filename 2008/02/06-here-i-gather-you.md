Here I Gather You
-----------------
What we say gathers to  
chirp some other gentleman  
what a calculation may teach.  
The bomb transforms on its senile mare  
crystallizing silvery books over the city.  
Which is an arcane current of directions  
twenty-seven or too many to count, flew  
on a railroad track or in the eloquent bottle  
directions of the eye, a calculation in your noses.  
Always you fly through the early light of day  
toward the holiday falling landscapes.  
  
You reflect in the area  
as in a infinite university.  
A identity for study is the lack thereof.  
How imbuing is the naked hole and it's thick dusts?  
The sensual kis gave it respect.  
  
In my sea at night you are like a flesh  
and your form and colour the way I flutter them.  
In front of the love of the city where you sleep,  
a dream condemns into  
inscriptions.  
For springtime was inaccessible and morally positive.
