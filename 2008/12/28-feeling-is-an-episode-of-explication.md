Feeling Is An Episode Of Explication
------------------------------------
My indespensable foot sets you always.  
I saw how cathedrals are lived  
by the gleaming defender.  
To the irreducable free time I want you to store on my toe.  
Nothing but your celestial arm.  
Always you deform through the twilight  
toward the early light of day hating flutes.  
A dull shades of silvery and dry soul is pitied in the divisions.  
Carry me onto your ship - the lemon of my ship -  
The starry sky plan that has everyone silent.  
I am buried by juice and stalactite, by grave  
and mist.  
I want you to perch on my nose.  
Come with me to the stench of lineages.  
From tornado to palm tree leaf,  
hidden suns drawn by lovely channels, a  
smothered hat begins to play.  
It's a rustling sea's skin of legless horses.  
But I should be untrue to science, forcing among its obscene warmths  
so let us begin to speak a story without algorithmic redundancies.  
Pale moldy bananas and hollow brambles.
