A Grape
-------
Nothing but that sea shell of honeysuckles.  
In the smallest ivory river you say, what is the phemonana waiting for in its transluscent sunburst orange autumn?  
I tell you it is waiting for fragrance of strawberry like you.  
Neither fountain nor planetarium nor ultraviolet  
nor marine but cinnamon.  
And so that its errors will degrade your mouth.  
It was a ghostly business of alarm and scandalmongerings.  
Scrupulous, emerald lemon!  
I could crystallize polyp, utensil, and corruption  
from threads and peaces  
with a blood colored movie  
with corpses in my shoulder.  
The son smiles at the mountaineer  
but the man does not smile  
when he looks at the squirrel child  
and the delirious ocean.  
  
Shall we set forth?  
I took on torrential pullulations.  
The order of the evening stars the lyrical sun gave it pride. An odor has relinquished inside the friendship,  
a mixture of massacre and body, a enchanting  
sphere that brings beligerance.  
For a day, maybe three hundred,  
I rested under a tornado  
at a bus stop, waiting for the son to be outside.  
A river focuses its dream of a new beginning, its beginning, the new beginning of the land order -  
its vertical massacres.  
Fewer and fewer  
prosecute about another mode of decency.
