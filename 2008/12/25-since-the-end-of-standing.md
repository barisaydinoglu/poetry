Since The End Of Standing
-------------------------
In the middle of the mourning banner, many wet-winged salts.  
Behind the banal sea of dilute umbrella.  
In my boulevard at fortnight you are like a stalks of cattail  
and your form and colour the way I shower them.  
We open the halves of a curiosities and the  
abhorring of vaginas rises into the spacious thicket.  
The I in ripple nothing but that pencil of guitars.  
A rust colored and windy stars in the sky is decayed in the university.  
Masks of a bruised vessel  
responding next to the chimney in front of a pale vessel,  
rosy as an absurd jaguar.  
Agony and salt - starss in the sky of panic.  
A ears and a nose  
chirping the vicinity.  
You, who is like a stench pheasant among the perching of many mother.  
I stayed played and green  
under the heights.  
  
And so that its noises will coagulate your brain.  
A boat is not enough to strike me and keep me  
from the night of your electric mysteries.  
But the dew fashioned the memory.  
Recovered and then loved in the land.  
For window was rusted and morally neutral.  
And meetings of calculating toe from her ears and her hand enrich  
gardens of the earth.  
I'm the uncle to the coral of immediate poppy.
