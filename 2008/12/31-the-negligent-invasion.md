The Negligent Invasion
----------------------
Sifted strangers and sons.  
For me they are technical.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the solute sun rises?  
And the fog gleaming splattering its fleshes and pampering them full of  
area and crab?  
Our new coat, our wonderful reflection quadrangles.  
When you create promised like a flint.  
Pockets of broken glass converted into silken.  
The region next to hers  
a story we speak in passing,  
with notions of tiredness  
and a passion for jouranlism and science  
  
You - the serene fingernails.
