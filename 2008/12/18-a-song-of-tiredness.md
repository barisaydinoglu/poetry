A Song Of Tiredness
-------------------
Where bridges meet  
honeysuckles meet, outside and outside and the sound  
of circumstances, to reach out and blossom in anger.  
I was without doubt the daughter iguana  
there in the troubled archipeligos.  
When it looked  
me with its absorbant fountain eyes  
it had neither eyelids nor brain  
But wooden planetariums on its sides.  
A eye and an arm  
responding the area.  
I could play evil, havoc, and wax  
from essences and cathedrals  
with a black vein  
with explications in my hips.  
Silvery and myriad gentleman,  
a transluscent yellow momentum kisses.  
Sweet-smelling, emerald mist!
