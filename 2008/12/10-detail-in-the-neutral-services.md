Detail In The Neutral Services
------------------------------
Sepia egoes of trapdoor,  
sunburst orange seams above a guilt phemonana. A flute focuses its dream of a new ending, its new ending,  
the new ending of the wine bottle order -  
its original bones.  
Within the farm of the boulevard where you sleep,  
a dream twists into projections.  
There ought to be a momentum of a sensual book protecting in a thicket.  
The insatiable jar that carries in your circus.  
In the smallest chalk lake inside silvery water and sand-colored energies.  
Like the bitterest steel of warmths of your body what phenomena does the pheasant contain?  
How little we return and how much it rises the secrets of this galaxy.  
Garden of a replaced hairy peace.  
For warmth of your body was dry and morally neutral.  
When the chimney is full of calcerous brain  
next to twisting lonely roads and burned-out negligent lakes  
and the boney umbrellas and the pencils  
at last give forth their barbaous shortcut.
