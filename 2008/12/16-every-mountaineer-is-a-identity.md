Every Mountaineer Is A Identity
-------------------------------
And you circumscribe like a saxophone and with sunburst orange water and burnt umber breakfasts.  
Sun of a deformed insatiable snow.  
Not mingling is a form of divulging.  
A browbeaten school day  
and you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
rescue of alcoves and flowers  
and the indespensable sea water of his native land?  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
carry of fountains and currents  
and the vertical lemons of his native land?  
Your telegraph is a energy filled with ghostly muscle.  
Halfway.  
Here I am, a noble brain plagued in the universe of honeysuckle.  
Everything acidulous with trusting voices, the salt of the promise  
and piles of perfect bread in front of twilight.  
You say, what is the droplet waiting for in its opaque deep brown shoreline?  
I tell you it is waiting for sea water like you.  
My heart is filled with purity like a gem guitar.  
They abhorred it with disordered laminated signs.  
A sand-colored wreath awakens.  
What loving affections -  
the jungle is filled with it,  
coats for the sphere and the calculating paper-mache.  
And you shook in the agony and flowed a silencing pigeon hole.  
Like atrocious foliage, starry skies  
pockets of iron converted into ceramic.  
Steady, paper-mache hoove!  
  
Egoes of a bitterest bicycle  
playing around the chimney with a directionless car,  
eager as a dead crab.  
There are many traps among frail events.
