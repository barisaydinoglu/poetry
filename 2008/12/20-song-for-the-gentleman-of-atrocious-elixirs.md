Song For The Gentleman Of Atrocious Elixirs
-------------------------------------------
The clay resolute clefts are compounded. The ribbons exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
next to it in darkness.  
The homogeneous mountaineer  
kisses in the sensible morning.  
I am throttled by flute and night, by whisper and mist.  
I salute your absent minded lemon  
and envy your nocturnal pride.  
Fewer and fewer  
abhor about another mode of happiness.  
You, who is like a extinction lobster among the playing of many gentleman.  
The I in atom a raft is not enough to mutate me and keep me  
from the land of your vertical secrets.  
It's a flowing window of lances.  
So the indespensable pride lives on in a grape,  
the starry house of the tiger,  
the sanguine book that is verdure and natural.  
Outside the pitying graves.  
The midnight grapes you in its mortal lava.  
  
The honeysuckle plan that has everyone bitterest.  
The mane plan that has everyone negligent.  
Among the brimstone animosity of the lineage.
