Tell Him That I Am Giving Up Relinquishing In Details
-----------------------------------------------------
Burnt umber mud to my hairy pasture! Draw from it the fuming  
identity of its own image. On what listless lightnings dedicated with sky?  
Everything raucous with celestial voices, the salt of the landscape  
and piles of real bread outside morning.
