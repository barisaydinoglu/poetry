From Heat To Sky
----------------
It is a tale of morbid clocks shall we move on?  
In your lip of burying the city begins to dream of inheriting.  
A line within a line segment,  
the hollow workings of delicate law.  
On what atrocious hearts sought with jungle?  
The oily squirrel upgrades inside the changeless corruptions.  
Realized perfect smooth rusted nail like bitterest cluster, awes  
when you shower mingled like a garden.  
Root of a deluded imperalist  
home.  
Pockets of iron  
converted into gold.  
Everybody here is waiting for the next coral.  
Juice. You set yourself for reconciling.  
Once there was a fuming stranger who  
recovered at parties, sitting in a line, among saxophones.
