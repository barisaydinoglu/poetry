The Embarassement Of The Slightest Narrative
--------------------------------------------
On what thirsty masks conducted with wind?  
Pigeon holes of an acidulous raft  
hearing amid the region with a rustling car,  
humble as a insatiable cat.  
I do not penetrate in the divisions of morose mask.  
For a day, maybe too few to count,  
I rested under a ocean wave  
at a post office, waiting for the bride to be outside.  
You see nose as noble as the rain.  
You, who is like a evil bird among the magnifying of many elder.  
Pockets  
of rusted nail converted into silicon.  
Of a black giant that wets books.  
The soft dignity of the planetarium!  
But I should be true to computer science, puncturing among its exiled muscles  
so let us attempt to speak a story without overtone redundancies.  
Only furious and to a  
pioneer they take on time, too few to count years  
  
The foliage entertains in showering your heart.  
The reasons for my respect  
are rustled in my mouth of cork.
