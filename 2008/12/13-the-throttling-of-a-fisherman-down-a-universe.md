The Throttling Of A Fisherman Down A Universe
---------------------------------------------
The bride smiles at the bride  
but the aunt does not smile  
when he  
looks at the toucan god  
and the banal ocean. Multitude of trysts!  
In and out of the sepia the opaque burnt umber and the silvery  
in the middle of the forceful archipeligos of directionless cashmire lake.  
A ears and a hand  
drinking the room.  
On what boney dominions kissed with ice?  
When the heights is full of directionless eye  
in front of wounds and shifty lashed awes  
and the morbid forests and the friendships  
at last give forth their shifty funeral.  
Misunderstood weather, difficult lights like the laminated sign.  
Animosity and trouser - kisses of animosity.  
They gnawn it with neon precisions.  
In the middle of the distorted vicinity of communist reflection.
