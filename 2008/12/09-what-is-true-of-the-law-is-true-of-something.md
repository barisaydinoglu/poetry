What Is True Of The Law Is True Of Something
--------------------------------------------
If you were not the apple the wonderful  
moon  
cooks, sprinkling its bread across the modern office.  
A projection for sequence is the lack thereof.  
A forceful jar day  
flesh was no longer below the recording threshold.  
I could imbue trap, cummerbund, and self-production  
from breakfasts  
and corals  
with a gray forest  
with billowss of dark smoke in my toe.  
Only railroad track, just the  
starlight,  
nothing but  
it. Dove.  
You - the enduring arm.
