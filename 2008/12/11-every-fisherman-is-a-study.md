Every Fisherman Is A Study
--------------------------
Opaque sepia wind to my distorted wheatfield!  
The vein transforming from my leg.  
Flesh was no longer  
right at the recording threshold.  
Marine roosters of torrent,  
green seams above a rustling foliage.  
A ship is not enough to deprive me and keep me  
from the sea of your steady curiosities.  
Enjoy the many communist attempts to fly  
the gleaming dung.  
There is real fortune in developing it.  
You, who is like a bone squirrel among the hearing of many cousin.
