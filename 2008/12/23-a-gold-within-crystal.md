A Gold Within Crystal
---------------------
And a directionless evening star's jungle will carry you.  
Because I love you, love, inside  
the fire and behind the lightning.  
The I in muscle and you awaken like a star and if I could understand the vortex and the sea.  
There are many eternities behind bruised events.  
  
You've asked me what the bird is trusting there with his transluscent sunburst orange arm?  
I reply, the bell knows this.  
The ice infinite hearts are wetted.  
Pulsing from muzzled silken.  
A line around a circle,  
the bitter workings  
of absent minded law.  
You are the skeleton lady of a bird,  
the wayside ness of the landscape, the power of the lava.  
To the eloquent color of the glass magnolium.  
A loaf of bread baked with bleak sincerity and salt.
