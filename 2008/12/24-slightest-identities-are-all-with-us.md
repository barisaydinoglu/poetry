Slightest Identities Are All With Us
------------------------------------
The absurd lake is acerb on your curves.  
Has the sea been flowed with  
funny things?  
Shall we set forth?  
Where mists meet  
bottles meet, behind and among and the sound  
of vaginas, to reach out and circumscribe in beligerance.  
Shut out and shut up like a sea water.  
You trust headlong into a heights to pacify your business.  
  
Where railroad tracks meet  
leaves meet, in  
and  
amid and the sound  
of polyps, to reach out and respond in confusion.  
We open the halves of a phenomena and the  
invading of billows of dark smoke circumscribes into the esoteric universe.  
The stranger smiles at the person  
but the stranger does not smile  
when he looks at the squirrel son  
and the rambunctious ocean.  
And lemons and fragrances of strawberry.  
Once there was a bitter god who  
responded at parties, sitting in a quadrangle, among faucets.  
I salute your clear lemon  
and envy your slender pride.
