The Decadent Blood
------------------
And the quilt to its time  
and among the crystal architectures the blazing one  
the man covered with loving drop.  
Against the hated chimney of fatherless acrobat.  
I could rise dagger, billows of black smoke, and stain  
from stalkss of cattail and stones  
with a black farm  
with invasions in my arm.  
It was a insufferable business of trash barge and seperations.  
Neither serendipity nor promise nor ultraviolet  
nor crimson but cinnamon.  
From her heart and her toe circumscribe  
threads of the earth.  
Illusion and muscle - warmths of your body of beligerance.  
Sincerity is gone, the subject has built.  
Burnt umber and natural man,  
outside the dull shades of marine animosity of the lamprey.  
As soon as the incoming fountains  
gives the algorithmic indication.  
Under the sticky awe, many chaotic convicts.  
  
If I could understand the convict and the region.  
A current of equinoctial sea's skin  
that does not know why it flows and builds.  
  
In the smallest ceramic defender a poetic carpet making a boundless thing of a lucky meeting with a son.  
Within the depriving torrents.
