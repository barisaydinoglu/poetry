Absorbant Theories Of Hearts
----------------------------
Inside the morbid laminated sign, many callous brambles.  
This clotting school and rustling leaf strikes me  
with it's monastic kiss like brain and mouth  
and opaque brimstone flower heads like tail and natures.  
Like consequences deluding within roots. Towards those wheatfields of yours that wait for me.  
You - the esoteric ears.
