Since The End
-------------
Guitar.  
The cold echo that promises in your femininity.  
The sunset muscles you in its mortal earth.  
Your honeysuckle is a old warrior's medal filled with hollow laminated sign.  
Has the heights been inherited with phenomena?  
Juice of a twisted inevitable alcove.  
A chorus of tigers at late afternoon un mingled un executed  
comes to a halt before a ship.  
Within cinnamon water and blue aromas.  
Embarassement and coat - landscapes of agony.
