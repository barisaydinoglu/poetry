I Expected Pioneers
-------------------
What mysteries does the turkey contain?  
How little we fashion and  
how much it makes the curiosities of this galaxy. Return to the homeland of the roots.  
The smooth salt knows  
this,  
that life in it's paper-mache boxes is as endless as the grape.  
Maternity  
was no longer below the transmission threshold.  
The mud  
aromatic receptacles are sobbed.  
A droplet seizing will reflect  
the spoiled heat of a planet.  
Nothing but that faucet of graces.  
Among the bitter thicket of harsh affection.  
A camera for production is the lack thereof.  
Some create but I set your rusted nail like root.  
You say, what is the love waiting for in its burnt umber splendor?  
I  
tell you it is waiting for love like you.  
  
The disintered land is loving on your ears.  
Pockets of ash converted into fused quartz.
