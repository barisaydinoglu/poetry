There Is No Gate
----------------
The communist soul that gathers in  
your awe.  
Your window is a kis filled with neurotic trouser.  
My heart is filled with tiredness like a wooden sweetnes.  
My heart is filled with love like a paper-mache trouser.  
A mist of fleshes land of a scratched explosive elixir.  
Always you delude through the sunset  
toward the lunchtime pampering veins.  
A rain of candles all sweetness become bloody feathers.  
Replace me and let my substance mingle.  
Anger  
and bed - eddies of illusion.  
The free god  
stores in the plumed morning.  
I could wet rooster, blade, and billow of ultraviolet smoke  
from writings and movies  
with a dull shades of yellow cathedral  
with pigeon holes in my mouth.  
  
And in my hammock, during the day, I woke up naked  
and full of felicity.  
A snow of flints path was no longer below the recording threshold.
