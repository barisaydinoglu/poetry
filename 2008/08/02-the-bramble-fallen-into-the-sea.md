The Bramble Fallen Into The Sea
-------------------------------
For bed was rusted and morally negative.  
Nothing but that sea water of precisions.  
In your foot of anger the archipeligos of quivers crystallize.  
But the grace perfumed the memory.  
The sepia lake gathering from my nose.  
Be guided by the deedy snow  
's propeller.  
  
It was a neon business of dominion and dusts.  
Everybody here is waiting for the next  
aroma.  
Sea's skin. You crystallized yourself for seizing.  
Halfway.  
Conversations of doves, the recitation  
of eddies we call romantic bell.  
Closed off and shut up like a wheatfield.
