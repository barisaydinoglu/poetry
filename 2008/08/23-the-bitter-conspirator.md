The Bitter Conspirator
----------------------
Among green water and burnt umber windows.  
You, who is like a throat cat among the weaving of many  
woman.  
It's a seizing stars in the sky of invasions.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
enchant of love and fleshes  
and the thick graces of his native land?
