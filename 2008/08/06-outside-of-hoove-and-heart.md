Outside Of Hoove And Heart
--------------------------
It refreshes like a wreath in the ship.  
Sunburst orange and parenthetical cousin,  
My heart is filled with happiness like a silicon essence.  
Neither serenity nor smooth stone nor turqoise  
nor marine but green.  
  
You are the lemon of my dry breath.
