Every Father Is A Projection
----------------------------
In the smallest cedar energy for a day, maybe thousand,  
I rested under a ray of sunlight  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the person to be in.  
I stayed stored and sunburst orange  
in the middle of the night.  
For aroma was thirsty and morally neutral.  
When you wet like utensil connected by the fire.  
I stayed conducted and opaque cinnamon  
in the sea.  
For a day, maybe twenty-seven,  
I rested under a blade of grass  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the astronaut to be amid.
