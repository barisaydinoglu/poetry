Alarms About The Projection He Inherited
----------------------------------------
A disordered antenna strikes  
even the incredulous  
alphabetic divisions in sequence  
to which the metaphor  
will not be built. And the soul to its evening star  
and among the forests the absent minded one  
the man covered with self-assured cinnamon lake.  
It gallops like a essence in the poppy.  
  
We get the sense  
they must lots to inherit  
to each  
other  
Or perhaps nothing but felicities.  
Perhaps they are not taunted.  
Neither farm nor momentum nor rust colored  
nor opaque sunburst orange but silvery.  
What disguises the props of honor?  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
Inside the transluscent silvery hips of the electricity.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the human honeysuckles?  
And the drizzle serene splattering its starry skies and loitering them full of  
land and toucan?  
  
Has the modern office been excited with secrets?  
The poetic guitars punctured enriched and then kissed in the region.
