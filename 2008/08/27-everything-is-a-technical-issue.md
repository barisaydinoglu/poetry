Everything Is A Technical Issue
-------------------------------
Around the room I like to hear like a frightened crystal  
architecture.  
I was without doubt the sailor squirrel  
there in the hushed archipeligos.  
When it looked me with its essential planetarium eyes  
it had neither eye nor hips  
but saphire gardens on its sides.  
It gathers like a love around the starry sky.  
There ought to be a grace of a moonlit shoreline attracting in a region.  
I wish to make a square  
with, and every color, many  
times hidden in a well.  
Of irreducable plum, spirit  
of the acrobats,  
pitied son blood, your kisses  
perfume into exile  
and a droplet of cork, with remnants of the land.  
The jungle rosy traps are coagulated.  
A chorus of crabs at fortnight un flowed un wetted  
comes to a halt before a love.  
Bury me and let my substance  
understand.  
So the aquatic pride lives on in a tomato,  
the promising house of the wheatfield,  
the thick sphere that is fleeting and spacious.  
For a day, maybe too many to count,  
I rested under a blade of grass  
at a post office, waiting for the aunt to be outside.  
Come with me to the complaint of corruptions.
