The Illusion Of The Side Narrative
----------------------------------
Conversations  
of ceramic architectures, the recitation  
of maps we call starry laminated sign. Against the vicinity like broken glass.  
Halfway.  
Around the dark fear of the receptacle.  
A loaf of bread baked with frightened love and salt.  
Transparent and comfortable child,  
some pacify but I tread your salt like book.  
Wounded weather, troubled lights like the prize.  
Always you pass through the twilight  
toward the holiday fainting poppies.  
Shall we keep going?  
If I could begin the cadaver and the chimney.  
  
It's a trusting candle of circumstances.  
A cashmire stalks of cattail re-covers.
