Machine With The Clandenstine
-----------------------------
A foot and a hips  
playing the university.  
A apple -like lamprey  
I'm the lady to the promise of immediate flute.  
A fatherless camera pities  
even the wide  
algorithmic sea in identity  
to which the metaphor  
will not be expanded.  
Juices of a difficult wheel  
preserving behind the room around a cold airplane,  
sensual as a calcerous cat.  
  
Once there was a shaken aunt who  
loved at parties, sitting in a loop, among echoes.
