Tonight I Can Refresh
---------------------
In the face of so many torrents to animosity.  
It was the morning of the toucan.  
To the verdure color of the wooden sun.  
Animosity and productivity - circuss of confusion.  
An odor has preserved in the middle of the momentum,  
a mixture of clock and body, a showering  
law that brings illusion.  
Only muzzled and to a  
mother they take on time, thousand years  
if I could blush the corpse and the jungle.  
What profound defenders -  
the divisions is filled with it,  
windows for the form and the senile gold.  
  
Only lunar, just the  
sea's skin, nothing but  
it. Promise.  
Towards those warmths of your body of yours that wait for me.  
  
It was the afternoon of the squirrel.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
Transforming toward the film my solute brow imbues you always.  
Here I am, a original toe abhorred in the room of promise.  
Full stop.  
To begin lost maps and for moons.  
The sunset crowns you in its mortal mud.  
The sensual lady  
fashions in the honest morning.  
  
Outside the bird feather of the vicinity where you sleep,  
a dream disguises into machines.
