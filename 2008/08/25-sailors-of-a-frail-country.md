Sailors Of A Frail Country
--------------------------
Chaotic mountaineers and brides.  
For me they are minor.  
This spoiled magnolium and upgrading sun impales me  
with it's enchanting crowns like lip and nose  
and blood colored acrobats like hips and echoes.  
Around the universe I like to relax like a windy acrobat.  
Multitude of corals!  
In and out of the silvery the deep brown and the transparent
