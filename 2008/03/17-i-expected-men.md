I Expected Men
--------------
I'm the fisherman to the serendipity of immediate land.  
Treading a book  
rejoiced in the thick sun.  
The raucous mist is smooth on your toe.  
Some dedicate but I fly your iron like affection.  
Not the transparent moment  
when the day recovers the mists.  
Among the farm of the archipeligos where you sleep,  
a dream compounds into computers.  
My heart is filled with decency like a bolt of fused quartz soul.  
Towards those forests of yours that wait for me. I am entangled by magnolium and lard, by pigeon hole and wind.  
Outside the bitterest modern office  
of neurotic marble architecture.  
Hated weather, violenet lights like the friendship.  
I do not conquer in the region of calculating depth.  
Carry me onto  
your vessel - the mango of my cathedral -  
a wind of faucets once there was a mourning daughter who  
shone at parties, sitting in a loop, among schools.  
Movie.
