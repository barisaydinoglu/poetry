The Atrocious Mother
--------------------
My heart is filled with respect like a crystal acrobat.  
And among my hammock, during the afternoon, I woke up naked  
and full of happiness.  
Cashmire probes of grave,  
sunburst orange seams above a nauesous magnolium.  
In the night like iron.  
A current of noble shades of blue  
that does not know why it flows and breathes.  
Around the area I like to play like a lashed propeller.
