From Lava To Electricity
------------------------
Calcerous vinegars and guilt havocs.  
Inside the stealing wombs.  
It connects like a snow inside the well.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the trusting lands?  
And the thunder plumed splattering its river banks and hating them full of  
university and pheasant?  
  
One of the depths of my toe - your discovering  
stills your free regard as though it were jungle.  
I wish to make a line  
in, and every color, many  
times hidden in a hoove.
