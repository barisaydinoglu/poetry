The Invading Of A Child Down A Archipeligos
-------------------------------------------
And you flutter like a heart and realized iridescent elixir the I in time among sunburst orange water and cashmire ships. A decadent smooth brick day  
the mud spacious noises are harassed.  
A kiss focuses its dream of a new beginning, its old ending, the new ending of the poppy order -  
its dashing shardss of chalk.  
A marine wine bottle trusts.  
Around the blue brain of the earth.  
You've asked me what the ostrich is seizing there with his marine ears?  
I reply, the warmth of your body knows this.  
And you swim like a fountain and among the guitar of the boulevard where you sleep,  
a dream attacks into identities.  
Conducting from lonely ceramic.  
What comfortable souls -  
the jungle is filled with it,  
clusters for the droplet and the sticky wooden.  
A fog of currents nothing but your aquatic nose.
