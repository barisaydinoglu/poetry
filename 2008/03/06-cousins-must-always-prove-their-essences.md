Cousins Must Always Prove Their Essences
----------------------------------------
Storing the circus of her shades of blue full of tiredness.  
In my divisions at twilight you are like a railroad track  
and your form and colour the way I reflect them.  
What is this machine but a memory protested of its reflections?  
Next to the cashmire lip of the ice.
