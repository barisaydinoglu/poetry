The Stick Fallen Into The Sea
-----------------------------
You, who is like a extinction tiger among the treading of many cousin.  
The wonderful manes deluded I'm the lady to the cactus of immediate juice.  
And lemons and schools.  
And mirrors and phemonanas.  
The order of the suns you've asked me what the bird is rescuing there with his silvery brow?  
I reply, the ripple knows this.  
A line segment amid a quadrangle,  
the neon workings of naked law.  
  
The nocturnal dignity of the garden!  
A manly sun of precisions.  
A current of electrical aroma  
that does not know why it flows and appreciates.  
Shall we go forward?  
The reasons for my respect  
are enriched in my eyelids of ceramic.
