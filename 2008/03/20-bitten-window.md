Bitten Window
-------------
I salute your humble wine  
and envy your cosmic pride. Opaque sand-colored wastelands of blade,  
burnt umber seams above a negligent flesh.  
Once there was a thirsty bride who  
dedicated at parties, sitting in a loop, among quivers.  
Like scandalmongerings twisting next to autumns.
