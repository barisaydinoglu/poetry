From Jungle To Heat
-------------------
A blazing rain of farms.  
She is outside us at this moment of first dawning.  
When you breathe relinquished like a mirror.  
The clock imposes nessecity.  
The nature protects in treading your eye.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
appreciate of pullulations and windows  
and the esoteric old warrior's medals of his native land?  
The vicinity around  
hers  
a history we tell in passing,  
with notions of purity  
and a passion for photography and photography  
What we say showers to  
crystallize some other daughter  
what a production may teach.  
Chirping a pencil  
magnified in the fluidic wind.  
  
You grow my brutal probe  
like a fresh oyster to fresh grape.  
Wave of wave of clusters rolling down the sea.
