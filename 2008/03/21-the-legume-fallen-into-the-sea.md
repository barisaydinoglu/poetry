The Legume Fallen Into The Sea
------------------------------
But I should be true to jouranlism, fainting among its spoiled roses  
so let us seek to tell a story without public redundancies.  
My aquatic brain rustles you always.  
From pillow of fog to pillow of fog,  
hidden flutes drawn by eager channels, a  
mechanical fragrance of strawberry begins  
to enchant.  
Because I love you, love, inside the clay and within the ice.  
A droplet enchanting will swim  
the guilt jungle of a planet.  
Not to continue or even meet  
the flower of one who crystallizes  
against me in a universe or growing to a uncle.  
  
Halfway.  
What we say circumscribes to  
fly some other person  
what a computer may teach.  
I'm the stranger to the stars in the sky of immediate guitar.  
  
We get the meaning  
they must lots to shine  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but oxides.  
Perhaps they are not crushed.  
Sometimes a piece of the electricity  
degrades like a old warrior's medal in my hand.
