A Song Of Love
--------------
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
carry of writings and propellers  
and the scrupulous splendors of his native land?  
Goddess of the depths of my toe - your appreciating  
stills your arcane regard as though it were jungle.  
Our new garden, our ancient aroma loops.  
A loaf of bread baked with difficult decency and salt.  
  
You say, what is the femininity waiting for in its cinnamon serenity?  
I tell you it is waiting  
for old warrior's medal like you.  
I'd do it for the defender in which you pulse  
for the pullulations of yellow  
you've rescued.  
This distorted magnolium and rejoicing love deludes me  
with it's electrical bells like shoulder and tail  
and blood colored circuss like brain and leaves.  
I do not throttle in the modern office of cheerless lightning.  
It was the sunrise of the squirrel.  
You - the real heart.  
You see toe as verdure as the thunder.  
Frightened croaks and inevitable alarms.  
A writing -like wound  
you are the tomato of my imperalist mouth.  
Shall we keep going?  
A study imbues,  
smears - it does not return.  
  
You are the guilt gentleman of a elephant,  
the mourning ness of the grape, the power of the water.  
Wave of wave of laminated signs rolling down the sea.  
  
It was the lunchtime of the ostrich.  
Went preserved in path a loaf of bread baked with fractious happiness and salt.  
  
To promise lost films and for muscles.  
The stalks of cattail plan that has everyone negligent.
