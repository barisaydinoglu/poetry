Your Brow Is Enough
-------------------
In the middle of the night like clay.  
To seize lost propellers and for elixirs.  
Sometimes a piece of the heat  
passes like a stars in the sky in my shoulder.  
A rust colored and mechanical moon is killed in the modern office.  
  
For a day, maybe too many to count,  
I rested under a harrowing wind  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the mountaineer to be among.  
The sky warm throats are decayed.  
The sky sanguine  
beasts are throttled.  
A quadrangle behind a triangle,  
the motionless workings of acerb law.
