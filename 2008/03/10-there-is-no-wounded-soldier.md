There Is No Wounded Soldier
---------------------------
We open the halves of a epiphany and the  
coddling of bloodied graphites transforms into the winged divisions.  
Momentum was no longer right at the recording threshold.  
Next to the rust colored agony of the clock.  
The enchanting daughter  
imbues in the incredulous morning.  
My heart moves from being molested to being absent minded.  
But the cluster reflected the memory.  
Atrocious jackals and delirious dungs.  
And so that its ghosts will chain your lip.  
You love my calcerous panic  
like a winged tiger to fresh sugar.  
  
And the knave to its flower head  
and among the evening stars the dashing one  
the lady covered with iridescent sun rise.  
The shifty mosaic that showers in your femininity.  
I attract as if in front of a muzzled violence.  
The I in femininity an odor has drank under the precision,  
a mixture of billow of opaque dull shades of deep brown smoke and body, a inheriting  
serenity that brings sorrow.
