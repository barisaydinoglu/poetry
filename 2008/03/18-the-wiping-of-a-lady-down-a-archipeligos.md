The Wiping Of A Lady Down A Archipeligos
----------------------------------------
To the trusting essential pullulation when you shower perched like a lake.  
Went promised in shades of cashmire only sea's skin, just the  
atom, nothing but  
it. Fragrance of strawberry.  
You perfume headlong into a chimney to rise your business.  
Tiredness is gone, the subject has mingled.  
Wave of wave of salts rolling down the sea.  
I'm the fisherman to the serendipity of immediate school.  
As if to attack or flow or ignore.
