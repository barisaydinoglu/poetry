The Explosive Conglomerate
--------------------------
Come with me to the shards of cork of daggers.  
A loaf of bread baked with fuming pride and salt.  
You've asked me what the tiger is galloping there with his sunburst orange shoulder?  
I reply, the muscle knows this.  
Which is a irreducable evening star of directions  
twenty-seven or three hundred, returned  
on a smooth stone or in the arcane tiger  
directions of the hips, a calculation in your legs.  
  
Flew and then trod in the area.  
A precision relinquishing will build  
the furious water of a planet.  
Somebody here is waiting for the next propeller.  
Hat.  
You trusted yourself for building.  
I do not freeze in the thicket of explosive smoke.
