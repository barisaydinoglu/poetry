I Have Gone Killing
-------------------
I wish to make a triangle  
Inside, and every sense, many  
times hidden in a dew. What we say expands to  
seek some other stranger  
what a sequence may teach.  
Full stop.  
Rustling a mirror  
enriched in the balanced sun.  
Sepia fire to my ironous lemon!  
Shall we keep going?  
You are the banana of my shifty shoulder.  
In the smallest gem prize a hushed lunar day  
a chorus of elephants at lunchtime un carried un cracked  
comes to a halt before a fellowship.  
A identity responds,  
changes - it does not return.  
  
I do not protest in the heights of arrogant oxide.  
What is this machine but a memory deluded of its doors?  
Pure moth builds the lands of clear wine, spirit  
of the wreaths,  
fell lady blood, your kisses  
shine into exile  
and  
a droplet of ivory, with remnants of the thicket.  
Has the heights been relaxed with funny things?
