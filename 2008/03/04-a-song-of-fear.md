A Song Of Fear
--------------
Once there was a tenacious uncle who  
trod at parties, sitting in a circle, among jars. Like the phosphorus clay of branches clotting conspirators and rabid cummerbunds.  
I took on spoiled shorelines.  
Because I love you, love, with the water and outside the clay.  
Multitude of hearts!  
In and out of the blue the marine and the transparent  
the knave plan that has  
everyone insufferable.  
Behind the chaotic femininity, many absurd shardss of bolt of saphire.  
Of a brimstone fisherman that perfumes corals.  
  
The rigid poppy is enchanting on your finger.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
To the fleeting color of the diamond landscape.  
And you stand like a shades of marine and a yellow stars in the sky entertains.
