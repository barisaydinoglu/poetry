From What Are Prizes Showered
-----------------------------
Everything dry with angellic voices, the salt of the apple  
and piles of solute bread amid late afternoon.  
Here I am, a hidden curves plagued  
in the jungle of bell.  
Outside the coddling traps.  
Went blushed in essence tenacious fortnight and the smothered miracle  
falter  
at the walls of my house.  
And in front of my hammock, during the fortnight, I woke up naked  
and full of sincerity.  
Re-covering the wheatfield of her flower head full of happiness.  
Conversations of circuss, the recitation  
of roots we call plumed starlight.  
And a oily prize's wind will reconcile you.  
Went mingled in juice to seek another land I wish to make a circle  
behind, and every sight, many  
times hidden in a hat.  
  
The kis plan that has everyone lashed.
