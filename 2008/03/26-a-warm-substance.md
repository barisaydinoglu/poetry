A Warm Substance
----------------
Your lemon is a candle filled with decadent nature.  
The domestic yellow lake gave it decency.  
Where smooth stones meet  
phemonanas meet, around and outside and the sound  
of legumes, to reach out and magnify in embarassement.  
Everything frail with dashing voices, the salt of the affection  
and piles of parenthetical bread behind twilight.  
Nothing but that sun of wheatfields. My heart moves from being fire-tipped to being thick.
