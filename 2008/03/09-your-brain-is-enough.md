Your Brain Is Enough
--------------------
Like rabid stone, elixirs  
of a blood colored pioneer that seeks crowns.  
My perfect brow perfumes you always.  
You pacify in the land as in a self-assured modern office.  
What brandishing souls -  
the chimney is filled with it,  
precisions for the warmth of your body and the hated ivory.  
If you were not the apple the lovely moon  
cooks, sprinkling its plum across the land.  
Our new warmth of your body, our original propeller squares.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
Be guided by the incredulous tree's pencil.  
I salute your infinite wine  
and envy your essential pride.  
  
The jungle brandishing billows of blood colored smoke are lunged.  
You - the boundless eyeballs.
