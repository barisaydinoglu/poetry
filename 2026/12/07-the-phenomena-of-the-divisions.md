The Phenomena Of The Divisions
------------------------------
An odor has enriched under the love,  
a mixture of womb and body, a reconciling  
horse that brings illusion. Inside the harassing violas. It stores like a trouser in the bird feather.  
A promising rug making a noble thing of a lucky meeting with a fisherman.  
Mutate me and let my substance play.  
Under the silent boulevard of barbaous landscape.  
I was without doubt the lady squirrel  
there in the arrogant moonlight evening.  
When it looked me with its charitable nature eyes  
it had neither eye nor nose  
but ceramic starss in  
the sky on its sides.  
The planetarium plan that has everyone muzzled.  
  
The indespensable dignity of the snow!  
When you hear like fragrance of strawberry perfumed by the heat.
