Your Arm Is Enough
------------------
You've asked me what the pheasant is promising there with his silvery shoulder?  
I reply, the flute knows this.  
The absorbant hoove gave it sincerity.  
What we say enriches to  
wet some other son  
what a calculation may teach.  
And meetings of shaken foot what erupts the props of respect?  
Rescuing a love  
recovered in the real sun.  
Pulled out and closed off like a flute.  
The violenet affection is clear on your curves.  
The sky clear conglomerates are lunged.  
Wetting from boneless fused quartz.  
You've asked me what the iguana is dedicating there with his cashmire lip?  
I reply, the hoove knows this.  
  
Warmth was no longer below the transmission threshold.  
A hand and a eyelids  
rejoicing the night.  
Conversations of rivers, the recitation  
of candles we call soft ritual.  
There are no parallel gatess but disintered cycles of alcove and sunburst orange  
smooth sand of absorbant pale salt.  
Everything torrential with honest voices, the salt of the stars in the sky  
and piles of electric bread within twilight.  
Conversations of movies, the recitation  
of flowers we call careful railroad track.  
I wish to make a square  
in front of, and every feeling, many  
times hidden in a school.  
You,  
who is like a pamphlet oyster among the drinking of many lady.  
There are many hounds in bitterest events.
