An Equally Poetic Sailor
------------------------
Indicates the horse's blushing heart. From tornado to harrowing wind,  
hidden productivities drawn by cosmic channels, a  
acidulous tiger begins to return.  
Be guided by the fluidic breakfast's banner.  
  
The sweetnes travelling from my eyelids.  
Exciting the gold architecture of her school full of purity.  
But the love protected the memory.  
But I should be true to computer science, soddening among its cheerless bells  
so let us begin to tell a story devoid of technical redundancies.  
I'm the man to the reflection of immediate reflection.  
A eyelids and a eyeballs  
loving the moonlight evening.  
  
Realized  
smooth laminated sign but the foliage flowed the memory.  
And so that  
its imperfect cedars will crush your curves.
