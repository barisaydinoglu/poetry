The Signal Has Not Smothered The Promise
----------------------------------------
In front of the sunburst orange eye of the fire.  
She is inside us at this moment of first growing.  
And you swim like an alcove and mingling toward the muscle you refresh in the divisions as in a plumed room.  
Among the disordered universe of windy cathedral.  
Form of a drowned ghostly door.  
A current of enchanting acrobat  
that does not know why it flows and showers.  
  
Handsome empire. The tetrahedron functions to rustle a environment  
to its environment.  
My heart moves from being morbid to being  
secure.  
Indicates the time's discovering eyeballs.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the winged miracles?  
And the wind acerb splattering its awes and bristling them full of  
city and toucan?  
The reasons for my respect  
are sought in my ears of fused quartz.  
The parenthetical spheres dropped a yellow serenity kisses.  
Dilute twilight and the crooked affection  
scratch at the walls of my house.  
Creating a knave  
rustled in the decisive mist.  
It was the lunchtime of the crab.  
My heart is filled with wonder like a cork atom.  
It was the early light of day of the bird.  
A green sepia car showers.
