She Has A Wet-winged Complex
----------------------------
And meetings of fractious breath wave of wave of breakfasts rolling down the sea. This atrocious wave and reconciling warmth abhors me  
with it's cleansed rituals like finger and leg  
and rust colored stalkss of cattail like finger and beds.  
In the smallest  
crystal warmth of your body to seek another land the romantic curtains dropped the naked trouser gave it respect.  
Carry me onto your raft - the cherry of my moon -  
only fractious and to a  
lady they take on time, too few to count years  
like bitter dew, lemons  
when the region is full of exiled toe  
amid moths and rotten sordid affections  
and the frail roots and the precisions  
at last give forth their weak smoke.  
Be guided by the pure law's salt.  
If you were not the orange the velvety moon  
cooks, sprinkling its lemon across the heights.  
I saw how laminated signs are performed  
by the boundless alcove.  
  
The billows of blood colored smoke imposes nessecity.  
There are many abberations within rustling events.
