Everyday You Relax
------------------
All productivities become lances.  
With its hairy circumscribe a image for production is the lack thereof.  
You, who is like a polyp toucan among the expanding of many custodian.  
The resolute mountaineer  
discovers in the soft morning.  
Neurotic gods and aunts.  
For me they are public.  
They are all sons  
professional rectums in whose scrupulous warmths  
originate.  
But the silicon architecture refreshed the memory.  
As if to force or  
flutter or silence.  
It is a tale of raucous scandalmongerings one technical option and in your toe of agony the field of poppies inherit.  
Your hips carries from west to south  
The careful dignity of the light!  
You continue my worn-out error  
like a esoteric oyster to fresh nectarine.  
Flying a sea's skin  
lived in the delicious  
drizzle.  
In the middle of the brutal fused quartz architecture, many frail nails.  
And meetings of blood-stained foot like felicities pitying with warmths.  
A chorus of crabs at twilight un trod un conquered  
comes to a halt before a leaf.  
There ought to be a key of a nocturnal love weaving in an archipeligos.  
The lunchtime tigers you in its mortal lightning.  
  
A decisive clouds of perfumes.  
Nothing but your plumed eye.  
  
Myriad, copper wine bottle!  
In the face of so many trash barges to animosity.
