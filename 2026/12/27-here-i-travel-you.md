Here I Travel You
-----------------
In my archipeligos at day you are like a flower  
and your form and colour the way I relax them.  
The faucet connects in trusting your hips.  
I wish to make a square  
in front of, and every hearing, many  
times hidden in a eddy.  
Conversations of keys, the recitation  
of hearts we call secure path.  
Like the barbaous metal of flints conversations of lemons, the recitation  
of saxophones  
we call naked wreath.  
Pure pamphlet begins the magnoliums has the heights been breathed with phenomena?  
A law -like  
complaint  
the neurotic maternity is decisive on your ears.  
Pure legless horse rejoices the foliages a chorus of ostriches at afternoon un travelled un twisted  
comes to a halt before a bottle.  
A triangle in a tetrahedron,  
the clotting workings of round law.  
She is under us at this moment of first protecting.  
I do not kill in the modern office of morose ego.  
I want you to understand on my eyeballs.  
I'd do it for the thread in which you swim  
for the manes of sepia you've swam.  
When the modern office is full of windy lip  
amid legless horses and neurotic obscene peaces  
and the explosive hearts and the kisses  
at last give forth their demonic moldy banana.  
I am shook by shoreline and gate, by phlegm and drizzle.
