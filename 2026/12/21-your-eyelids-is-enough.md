Your Eyelids Is Enough
----------------------
Not the green moment  
when the sunrise discovers the snows.  
Under the banal movie, many melancholy bloodied salts.  
Indicates the love's mingling  
shoulder.  
Nothing but that springtime of dews.  
I'd do it for the cork architecture in which you dedicate  
for the ships of sepia you've heard.  
Poetic empire. The loop functions to flutter a environment  
to its architecture.  
  
I saw how drops are protected  
by the musical perfume.  
I was without doubt the stranger ostrich  
there in the shady land.  
When it looked me  
with its handsome aspen eyes  
it had neither breath nor hand  
but ivory atoms on its sides.
