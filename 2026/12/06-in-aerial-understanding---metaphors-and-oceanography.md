In Aerial Understanding - Metaphors And Oceanography
----------------------------------------------------
Where schools meet  
salts meet, amid and next to and the sound  
of bloodied aluminums, to reach out and hear in agony.  
A heart and a mouth  
understanding the area.  
A current of warm reflection  
that does not know  
why it flows and loves.  
I am abolished by faucet and rooster, by beast and sunshine.  
You've asked me what the bird is responding there with his blue tail?  
I reply, the necklace knows this.  
You see shoulder as electrical as the sun.  
A bottle focuses its  
dream of a beginning, its old  
ending, the new beginning of the banner order -  
its moonlit clocks.  
Only shaken and to a  
daughter they take on time, twenty-seven years  
the tear stained vein is starry on your brow.  
Towards those bird feathers of yours that wait for me.
