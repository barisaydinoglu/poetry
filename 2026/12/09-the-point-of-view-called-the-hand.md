The Point Of View Called The Hand
---------------------------------
A rust colored and wayside bell is abolished in the city.  
In front of the deep brown eyelids of the lightning.  
A friendly wood paneling making a nocturnal thing of a impossible meeting with a fisherman.  
All eddies become lightnings.  
Galloping the elixir of her movie full of purity.  
A autumn -like wasteland  
full stop.  
Shut up  
and closed off like a jar.  
Pockets of salt converted into chalk.  
  
Silvery panics of dust,  
cinnamon seams above a fractious writing.  
I took on cold sea's skins.  
  
It dedicates like a wave with the fellowship.
