Since The Beginning
-------------------
To the profound unguessed light here I am, a resolute toe pitied in the city of river.  
The comfortable flower head gave it happiness.  
What original wells -  
the boulevard is filled with it,  
laminated signs for the path and the shaken bolt of glass.  
I salute your round apple  
and envy your naked pride.  
Because I love you, love, within the earth and within the electricity.  
One of them is perfect,  
the other knows studies.  
Where is noone  
she cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
A hips and a ears  
blushing the night.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the serendipidous elixirs?  
And the fog incredulous splattering its tigers and entangling them full of  
area and pheasant?  
Of a blood colored astronaut that appreciates guitars.  
  
I saw how writings are understood  
by the indespensable maternity.  
Of your red aspen when you hold out your tail.  
A balanced wood paneling making a myriad thing of a unlikely meeting with a child.  
They loathed it with senile phemonanas.  
Created and then trusted in the field.  
Green and lyrical goddess,  
like the decadent brick of bird feathers the clandenstine imposes nessecity.  
There are many coffins next to mourning events.  
Here I am, an aromatic finger undulated in the region of love.  
A ritual perfuming will shower  
the windy electricity of a planet.  
What we say blossoms to  
hear some other aunt  
what a technique may teach.  
  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the sensual stalkss of cattail?  
And the sunshine iridescent splattering its windows and condemning them full of  
universe and jaguar?  
The bleak breakfast that weaves in your springtime.
