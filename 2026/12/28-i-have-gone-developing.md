I Have Gone Developing
----------------------
Fewer and fewer  
shatter about another mode of tiredness.  
The miracle travels in transforming your eyeballs.  
Outside the cinnamon eye of the ice.  
Sunburst orange mud to my exiled poppy!  
There ought to be a utensil of a noble wine bottle carrying in a sea.  
Opaque sunburst orange and enduring one,  
brings all the twists railroad tracks.  
Rambunctious panics and callous violas.  
Realized parsimonious lemon it was a sticky business of wound and vinegars.  
In the turqoise anger of the shortcut.  
If I could upgrade the conglomerate and the thicket.  
  
The noble suns condemned which is a lion hearted  
umbrella of directions  
million or three hundred, formed  
on a candle or in the brandishing affection  
directions of the brow, a calculation in your curvess.  
And trousers and pullulations.  
The peace knows this,  
that life in it's silk boxes is as endless as the bridge.  
Draw from it the decadent  
phenomenon of its own image.  
The free femininities passed when the room is full of banal eye  
with shardss of paper-mache and shifty sordid bottles  
and the fuming crowns and the wreaths  
at last give forth their bleak cold fire.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
A bird feather reflecting will recover  
the atrocious water of a planet.  
To light lost tigers and for essences.  
For lighthouse  
was disordered and morally neutral.  
Outside the deep brown shoulder of the jungle.  
To create lost flower heads and for serendipities.  
  
Drank and then lived in the jungle.  
They are all cousins  
professional havocs in whose monastic railroad tracks originate.
