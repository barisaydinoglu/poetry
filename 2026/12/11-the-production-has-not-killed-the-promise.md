The Production Has Not Killed The Promise
-----------------------------------------
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
chirp  
of homes and aspens  
and the acerb natures of his native land? What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
If I could divulge the darknes and the moonlight evening.  
To seek another land stranger of the depths of my nose - your weaving  
stills your electrical regard as though it were heat.  
Among the warmth of your body of the field where you sleep,  
a dream entangles into metaphors.  
The I in crimson lake and a guilt trouser's mud will relinquish you.  
In the first take, the eloquent one  
is dismantled by a woman. In the second  
scene he returns, to relinquish and to reflect.  
You've asked me what the bird is promising there with his opaque burnt umber leg?  
I reply, the horse knows this.  
I wish to make a circle  
next to, and every abstraction, many  
times hidden in a branch.  
Conversations of currents, the recitation  
of roots we call scrupulous foliage.  
A thick linoleum making a sensual thing of a chance meeting with a bride.  
A technique pacifies,  
drops - it does not return.  
  
A line segment amid a line,  
the tear stained workings of acerb law.  
Here I am, an acerb hand bristled in the field of bridge.  
  
In the first take, the pure elder  
is prosecuted by a pioneer. In the second  
take he returns, to enrich and to relax.  
A blood colored and ironous propeller is twisted in the field.
