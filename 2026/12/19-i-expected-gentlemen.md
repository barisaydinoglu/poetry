I Expected Gentlemen

For ritual was rabid and morally negative.  
What we say rises to  
rustle some other person  
what a metaphor may teach.  
Like delirious silence, threads  
sifted weather, shifty lights like the splendor.  
And the cluster to its branch  
and among the sea water the eloquent one  
the daughter covered with profound promise.
