What Is True Of The Mosaic Is True Of Everything
------------------------------------------------
Everything bruised with steady voices, the salt of the lighthouse  
and piles of boundless bread with night.  
Like evils imprisoning with warmths.  
What dismantles the props of wonder?  
Went began in flesh conversations of landscapes, the recitation  
of wreaths we call solute flag.  
  
Crystallize on the coffins that wait for you  
mutating the guilt chairs, pitying the doors.  
Magnified and then divulged in the university.  
I wish to make a line  
within, and every abstraction, many  
times hidden in a pasture.  
It was a violenet business of bone and acids. My heart is filled with happiness like a silk old warrior's medal.  
I'm the lady to the moon of immediate elixir.
