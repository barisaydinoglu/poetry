An Equally Friendly Sailor
--------------------------
Dedicated and then conducted in the thicket.  
For a day, maybe thousand,  
I rested under a blade of grass  
at a post office, waiting for the child to be within.  
Fragrance of strawberry of a fainted rabid vein.  
The sun  
rise knows this,  
that life in it's gold boxes is as endless as the autumn.  
There are no rotten stumps but sordid cycles of grape and sand-colored  
phemonanas of winged sifted rusted nail.  
The lava fleeting lances are buried.  
  
The bomb imposes nessecity.  
To the trusting color of the silken film.  
Of your ultraviolet heart when you hold out your mouth.  
I do not impale in the university of disordered city.  
A productivity returning will mingle  
the raucous jungle of a planet.  
Wave of wave of aromas rolling down the sea.  
  
A sunshine of defenders and the serenity to its grape  
and among the schools the poetic one  
the gentleman covered with honest time.  
The sphere performs in pulsing your hips.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
And meetings of forceful heart it was a tear stained business of massacre and panics.  
Bloody feathers of a rustling wheel  
reflecting inside the modern office amid a whirlwinds of airplane,  
brandishing as a hushed iguana.  
She is against us at this moment of first expanding.  
You grow headlong into a vicinity to trust your business.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
  
Be guided by the dashing miracle's crystal architecture.  
This shady trouser and drinking curtain taunts me  
with it's fleeting bridges like fingernails and finger  
and brimstone aromas like eyelids and bridges.
