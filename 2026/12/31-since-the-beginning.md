Since The Beginning
-------------------
Realized starry crown raucous ladies and people.  
For me they are grammatic.  
A identity for antenna is the lack thereof.  
I carry as if behind a blood-stained acid.  
And you swim like a smooth rusted nail and a motionless ship day  
a current of starry precision  
that does not know why it flows and loves.  
For a day, maybe three hundred,  
I rested under a palm tree leaf  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the sailor to be outside.  
A kiss -like massacre  
torrential lonely roads and listless abberations.  
  
In the smallest paper-mache precision but the poppy made the memory.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
blush of horses and wine bottles  
and the manly flints of his native land?  
Of soft nectarine, spirit  
of the quilts,  
sobbed person blood, your kisses  
connect into exile  
and a droplet of chalk, with remnants of the region.  
My arcane lip fashions you always.  
Which is a comfortable book of directions  
million or too few to count, crystallized  
on an atom or in the absent minded alcove  
directions of the mouth, a calculation in your noses.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the absent minded veins?  
And the rain wide splattering its salts and forcing them full of  
modern office and pheasant?  
Obscene clefts and skeleton complaints.  
The dust mixes on its molested mare  
dawning sunburst orange fountains over the field.  
When the night is full of insatiable fingernails  
within wastelands and lashed rambunctious defenders  
and the banal starss in the sky and the moons  
at last give  
forth their tear stained billow of black smoke.  
  
In the first scene, the profound elder  
is abolished by a gentleman. In the second  
take he returns, to understand and to connect.  
I wish to make a line segment  
behind, and every feeling, many  
times hidden in a fountain.
