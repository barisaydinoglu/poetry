I Expected Brides
-----------------
Time.  
And a bitten necklace's water will preserve you.  
The spacious cousin  
develops in the boundless morning.  
Carry me onto your boat - the apple of my splendor -  
the droplet performs  
in living your shoulder.  
A disintered inscription compounds  
even the equinoctial  
slightest field  
in phenomenon  
to which the metaphor  
will not be stored.  
I'm the lady  
to the umbrella of immediate perfume.  
From ray of sunlight to tornado,  
hidden spheres drawn by smooth channels, a  
shaken lighthouse begins to trust. A silvery foliage carries.  
It develops like a breakfast with the ritual.
