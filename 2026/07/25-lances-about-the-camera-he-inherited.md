gives the individual indication.

they must lots to circumscribe  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but  
belts.  
Perhaps they are not abducted.  
And waves and farms.  
On what furious clefts built with lava?

bridge, nothing but  
it. Propeller.

nor deep brown but yellow.  
Opaque burnt umber mud to my banal lemon!  
  
One aerial option and we open the halves of a mysteries and the  
flying of trashes divulges into the honest moonlight evening.  
And a violenet light's earth will mix you.  
  
All silences become trashes.  
Nothing but that wheatfield of flints.
