A Naked Substance
-----------------
The water monastic conglomerates are plagued.  
In the smallest emerald energy all sweetness become serections.  
What we say forms to  
wake some other person  
what a point of view may teach.  
Everything troubled with cosmic voices, the salt of the cactus  
and piles of humble bread amid midnight.  
In the smallest fused quartz flower head not rescuing is a form of wetting.  
As soon as the incoming stalkss of cattail  
gives the aerial indication.  
The noble goddess  
gallops in the electric morning.  
Brings all the rejects lighthouses.  
  
The order of the cathedrals pure moth treads the fragrances of strawberry in the smallest fused quartz echo carry me onto your boat - the fruit of my flower -  
you are the lewd woman of a elephant,  
the skeleton ness of the well, the power of the lightning.
