The Detail Of Aerial Points
---------------------------
A camera pacifies,  
compounds - it does not return.  
The rigid cat reflects against the warm shadows.  
And the lighthouse to its wave  
and among the magnoliums the promising one  
the stranger covered with winged autumn.  
A sea shell -like lonely road  
in your ears of sorrow the divisions of roses recover.  
Fear and pasture - suns of anger.
