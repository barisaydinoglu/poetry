The Curiosities Of The Field
----------------------------
A lethargic study compounds  
even the absent minded  
algorithmic vicinity in computer  
to which the metaphor  
will not be wetted. I was without doubt the goddess bird  
there in the putrid land.  
When it looked me with its moonlit nature eyes  
it had neither brain nor mouth  
but saphire praises on  
its sides.  
Outside the smearing traps.  
My human shoulder protects you always.  
Conversations of writings, the recitation  
of magnoliums we call absent minded mane.  
Fewer and fewer  
reject about another mode of purity.  
A blue time travels.  
  
They filtered it with fractious waves.  
The melancholy current that responds in  
your cactus.  
  
A current of self-assured railroad track  
that does not know why it flows and rejoices.
