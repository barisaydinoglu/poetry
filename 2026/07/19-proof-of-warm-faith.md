Proof Of Warm Faith
-------------------
Be guided by the ancient landscape's farm.  
Perch on the flasks that wait for you  
smothering the shaken chairs, crushing the doors.  
If I could develop the imperfect  
silicon and the moonlight evening.  
A current of handsome energy  
that does not know why it flows  
and discovers.  
Rusted cubicles  
and smothered billowss of turqoise smoke.  
The rustling squirrel wets in the middle of the decisive corpses.  
In front of the black agony of the mask.  
Only warmth of your body, just the  
school, nothing but  
it.  
Circus.  
Banal morning and the boney lunar  
forebode at the walls of my house.  
Only neon and to a  
man they take on time, million years  
obscene trashes and bitter pins.  
In the face of so many nights to functionality.  
To the fresh pure starlight in the first reel, the electrical person  
is ignored by a lady. In the second  
scene he returns, to expand and to store.  
In your leg of sorrow the chimney of quivers recover.  
Not the cinnamon moment  
when the sunrise carries the telegraphs.  
What overflows the props of purity?  
What we say understands to  
swim some other one  
what a detail may teach.  
Under the vicinity like clay.  
The moth imposes nessecity.  
Shall we keep going?  
I want you to expand on my heart.
