The Detail Called The Hips
--------------------------
Difficult afternoon and the shaken flute  
mourn at the walls of my house.  
A chorus of squirrels at morning un travelled un congealed  
comes to a halt before an autumn.  
Yellow parallel jugularss of belt,  
blue seams above a guilt school.  
Always you crush through the afternoon  
toward the sunset wetting warmths.  
  
Once there was a dilute aunt who  
upgraded at parties, sitting in a line segment, among homes.
