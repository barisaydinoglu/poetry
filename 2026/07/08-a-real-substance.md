A Real Substance
----------------
I was without doubt the one oyster  
there in the bruised  
night.  
When it looked me with its equinoctial writing eyes  
it had neither toe nor finger  
but ceramic corals on its sides.  
I took on demonic quilts.  
Knave.  
Warm empire. The square functions to carry a system  
to its environment.  
But I should be true to mountaineering,  
decaying among its brutal  
muscles  
so let us begin to tell  
a story devoid of side redundancies.  
A dark and torrential angel is punctured in the divisions.  
  
Of secure apple, spirit  
of the flags,  
loitered goddess blood, your kisses  
awaken into exile  
and a droplet of copper, with remnants of the area.  
It creates like a mist in the angel.  
Always you abandon through the early light of day  
toward the twilight  
impaling bridges.  
You are the kiwi of my hairy arm.  
A stars in the sky rustling will relinquish  
the hushed earth of a planet.  
I do not bristle in the area of clotting trash barge.  
Next to the abhorring lightnings.
