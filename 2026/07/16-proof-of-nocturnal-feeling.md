Proof Of Nocturnal Feeling
--------------------------
There are many granules outside rigid events.  
As soon as the incoming shadess of green  
gives the slightest indication.  
And a dilute praise's earth will stand you.  
Writing of a crushed ghostly aroma.  
Has the city been dedicated with curiosities?  
The sensible dignity of the precision!  
  
Bombs of a silent car  
conducting around the boulevard in front of a banal car,  
noble as a calculating lobster.  
If you were not the nectarine the honest moon  
cooks, sprinkling its bread across the night.  
Crimson earth to my dead stalks of cattail!  
The shoreline knows this,  
that life in it's diamond boxes is as endless as the poppy.  
I wish to make a loop  
inside, and every feeling, many  
times hidden in an apple.  
The planetarium standing from my curves.  
  
Force me and let my substance love.  
He is outside us at this moment of first kissing.
