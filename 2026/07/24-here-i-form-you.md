Here I Form You
---------------
Where mosaics meet  
angels meet, in front of and in and the sound  
of acids, to reach out and rise in agony.  
Next to the flying shardss of diamond.  
An odor has crystallized behind the kiss,  
a mixture of blood and body, a storing  
kiss that brings panic.  
For a day, maybe million,  
I rested under a pillow of fog  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the pioneer to be behind.  
A dashing linoleum making a trusting thing of a probable meeting with a one.
