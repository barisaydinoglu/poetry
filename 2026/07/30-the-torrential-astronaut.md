The Torrential Astronaut
------------------------
From her mouth and her eyelids reconcile  
suns of the earth.  
Wonder is gone, the subject has continued.  
Not the sepia moment  
when the day circumscribes the dews.  
As if to filter or blush or faint.  
I'm the bride to the propeller of immediate snow.  
Somebody here is waiting for  
the next aroma.  
Crown. You heard yourself for refreshing.  
I could travel clandenstine, evil, and coffin  
from crowns and flints  
with a black aspen  
with torrents in my shoulder.  
The arrogant cat lights behind the pure jugulars.
