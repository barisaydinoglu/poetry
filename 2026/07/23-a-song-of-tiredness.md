A Song Of Tiredness
-------------------
Understanding from guilt silken.  
The balanced perfumes dismantled so the irreducable wonder lives on in a grape,  
the smooth house of the essence,  
the decisive well that is delicate and irreducable.  
I wish to make a triangle  
outside, and every meaning, many  
times hidden in a emerald architecture.  
And the goblet to its sea's skin  
and among the sea water the charitable one  
the mother covered with decisive heart.  
A sun focuses its dream of a new beginning, its new ending, the new ending of the reflection order -  
its balanced enemies.  
Only curtain, just the  
warmth, nothing but  
it. Warmth.  
All natures become oblivions.
