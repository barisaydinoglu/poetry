It Reconciled With Faucets
--------------------------
Here I am, a velvety eye throttled in the archipeligos of rose. And amid my hammock, during the midnight, I woke up naked  
and full of decency.  
The hopeful dignity of the mirror!  
  
This misunderstood bridge and loving guitar attacks me  
with it's solute wells like ears and shoulder  
and dark aspens like tail and forms.  
Amid the ritual of the moonlight evening where you sleep,  
a dream rejects into languages.
