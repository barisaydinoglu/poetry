Fuming Grape
------------
What drowns the props of sincerity?  
Carry me onto your helicopter - the grape of my bottle  
-  
They are all pioneers  
professional errors in whose thick aromas originate.  
Some dawn but I relinquish your salt like smooth aluminum.  
  
Our new old warrior's medal, our indespensable time quadrangles.  
The trap imposes nessecity.  
The university in hers  
a history we divulge in passing,  
with notions of respect  
and a passion for jouranlism and computer science  
enjoy the many fire-tipped attempts to develop  
the stationary womb.  
There is self-assured fortune in refreshing it.
