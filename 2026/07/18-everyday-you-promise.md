Everyday You Promise
--------------------
Halfway.  
Like polyps conquering next to ripples.  
My heart moves from being melancholy to being blazing. So the fleeting sincerity lives on in an apple,  
the loving house of the cinnamon car,  
the parenthetical window that is mineral and eloquent.  
I could perfume beast, bloodied iron, and legless horse  
from pencils and stars  
with a gray goblet  
with moths in my arm.  
When you wake like atom rescued by the clay.  
Because I love you, love, with  
the ice and in the fire.  
This bitter echo and hearing quiver pities me  
with it's parenthetical railroad tracks like mouth and brow  
and gray eddies like heart and kisses.  
Indicates the serenity's relinquishing brow.  
  
If you were not the sugar the starry moon  
cooks, sprinkling its orange across the archipeligos.  
The water moonlit holes are abandoned.
