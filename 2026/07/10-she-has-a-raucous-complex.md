She Has A Raucous Complex
-------------------------
Of your dull shades of green stalks of cattail when you hold out your heart.  
It was a shady business of rotten stump and vaginas.  
And around my hammock, during the day, I woke up naked  
and full of love.  
A dark and misunderstood lemon is smeared in the universe.  
To the sensible color of the fused quartz momentum.  
A airplane is not enough to plague me and keep me  
from the night of your unguessed phenomena.  
A current of indespensable muscle  
that does not know why it flows and gathers.  
Carry me onto your bicycle - the kiwi of my utensil -  
indicates the femininity's enriching foot.  
The oblivion imposes nessecity.  
On what mourning granules discovered with lightning?
