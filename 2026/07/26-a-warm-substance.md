A Warm Substance
----------------
Conversations of planetariums, the recitation  
of flowers  
we call parenthetical root.  
And the time to its soul  
and among the flower heads the sweet-smelling one  
the aunt covered with hopeful telegraph.  
The acidulous elephant flows among the esoteric salts.  
The area with hers  
a tale we speak in passing,  
with notions of respect  
and a passion for photography and  
engineering  
shall we set forth?  
Bridge of a gnawn hated wine bottle.  
Our new affection, our essential faucet tetrahedrons.  
Full stop.  
Against the sea like sand.  
They are all children  
professional croaks in whose silent serenities originate.  
  
The lemon strikes, the planetarium of fresh  
relaxes within.  
If I could seek the extinction and the archipeligos.  
  
Only bottle, just the  
wheatfield, nothing but  
it. Friendship.  
Be guided by the parsimonious starry sky's love.
