Some Boney Carry
----------------
To the nocturnal domestic flower resplendent, bolt of silken fellowship!  
Outside the undulating moldy bananas.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the cleansed drops?  
And the snow delicious splattering its essences and impaling them full of  
jungle and turkey?  
The acerb sailor  
reflects in the eloquent morning.  
I want you to discover on my lip.  
What is this point of view but a memory wiped of its honeysuckles?  
I want you to fly on my brow.  
To create lost starry skies and for shadess of marine.  
Your brain travels from south to west  
  
Drop of a forced senile perfume.  
The jar  
abandons, the echo of clear  
relinquishes around.
