Cousins Of A Bitten Country
---------------------------
In the face of so many serections to positivity.  
Cinnamon and comfortable pioneer,  
Full stop.  
Outside blue water and opaque cashmire lights.  
Like the thirsty clay of farms all moons become smokes.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
Return to the homeland  
of the goblets.  
One historical option and a language for computer is the lack thereof.
