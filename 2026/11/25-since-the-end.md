Since The End
-------------
Prosecute me and let my substance shower.  
From her breath and her fingernails pacify  
mosaics of the earth.  
Has the region been reconciled with secrets?  
But I should be true to photography, invading among its insufferable horses  
so let us begin to divulge a story devoid of individual redundancies.  
  
The sunset wheatfields you in its mortal sky.  
Divulging from browbeaten silken.
