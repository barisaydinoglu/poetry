Everyday You Breathe
--------------------
I want you to light on my foot.  
Felicities of a burned-out train  
continuing outside the thicket within a wet-winged raft,  
lion hearted as a violenet jaguar.  
With its rigid develop around the jungle I like to rustle like a difficult sun rise.  
For a day, maybe million,  
I rested under a harrowing wind  
at a bus stop, waiting for the gentleman to be within.  
Sometimes a piece of the wind  
buries like a tree in my leg.  
The I in flute the I in momentum return to the homeland of the candles.  
You are the grape of my oily nose.  
Profound, saphire evening star!  
A current of clear lunar  
that does not know why it flows and inherits.  
To the slender sanguine starlight your flower head is a sea's skin filled with communist cathedral.
