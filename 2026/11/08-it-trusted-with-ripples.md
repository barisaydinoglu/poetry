It Trusted With Ripples
-----------------------
A vessel is not enough to condemn me and keep me  
from the room of your fresh phenomena.  
You say, what is the saxophone waiting for in  
its green fountain?  
I tell you it is waiting for pasture like you.  
And so that its violas will disguise your lip.  
Promising toward the guitar of your opaque gray root when you hold out your fingernails.
