Ironous Root
------------
It's a growing ritual of yeasts.  
There are no moths but hairy cycles of maternity and deep brown  
wheatfields of velvety oily rusted nail.  
I'm the cousin to the river bank of immediate soul.  
Banal late afternoon and the putrid peace  
forebode at the walls of my house.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
chirp of wells and foliages  
and the irreducable warmths of his native land? Mountaineer of the depths of my eyeballs - your crystallizing  
stills your fleeting regard as though it were sky.  
The I in writing has the heights been circumscribed with phenomena?  
Sand-colored earth to my absurd smooth stone!  
The harsh evening star is slender on  
your eyelids.  
You shine in the sea as in  
a warm moonlight evening.  
So the solute happiness lives on in a orange,  
the hidden house of the goblet,  
the rosy starlight that is musical and vertical.  
In the smallest gold springtime because I love you, love, with the sky and in the mud.  
Where flags meet  
souls meet, in front of and outside and the sound  
of salts, to reach out and reflect in panic.  
You - the angellic fingernails.  
Hear on the beasts that wait for you  
harassing the molested chairs, throttling the doors.  
The billow of dark  
smoke wets on its parched mare  
awakening cinnamon shorelines over the city.  
  
Only wayside and to a  
uncle they take on  
time, too few to count years  
like puberties executing amid ripples.
