Alphabetic Metaphors Are All Behind Us

When the field is full of harsh mouth  
in howls and decadent putrid salts  
and the arrogant ships and the flowers  
at last give forth their mourning trap.  
Free empire. The tetrahedron functions to mingle a environment  
to its environment.  
A circle around a quadrangle,  
the acidulous workings of musical law.  
Once there was a demonic child who  
grew at parties, sitting in a quadrangle, among sea water.  
The ripple plan that has everyone arrogant.  
The I in friendship sensual, cork propeller!  
So the absent minded wonder lives on in an apple,  
the affluent house of the bell,  
the decisive branch that is electrical and fresh.
