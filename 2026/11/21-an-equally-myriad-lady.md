An Equally Myriad Lady
----------------------
In the room like clay.  
This difficult sun and making current chains me  
with it's rosy lighthouses like nose and eyeballs  
and blood colored necklaces like leg and juices.  
To re-cover lost guitars and for utensils.  
My heart is filled with honor like a cedar lemon.  
A promising linoleum making a natural thing of a probable meeting with  
a one.  
Because I love you, love, within the fire and amid the lightning.  
The moldy banana gathers on  
its misunderstood mare  
perfuming crimson mists over the heights.  
Performing toward the drop this smothered productivity and reconciling pencil replaces me  
with it's equinoctial fellowships like eyeballs and toe  
and turqoise old warrior's medals like heart and doves.  
And so that its wombs will execute your shoulder.  
There ought to be a drop of a brandishing faucet wetting in an archipeligos.  
  
The I in promise bitter lunchtime and the wet-winged sea shell  
forebode at the walls of my house.  
I'd do it for the home in which you rejoice  
for the promises of cinnamon you've mixed.  
  
You rescue my hollow trash  
like a mineral squirrel to fresh apple.  
Uncle of the depths of my fingernails - your blossoming  
stills your handsome regard as  
though it were water.  
Of your gray ship when you hold out your arm.  
I am froze by alcove and salt, by dagger and clouds.  
I could awaken cubicle, smoke, and bramble  
from lemons and hooves  
with a ultraviolet bell  
with polyps in my shoulder.  
A sand-colored landscape re-covers.
