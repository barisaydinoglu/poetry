How To Delude God Legs
----------------------
Where  
silences meet  
wine bottles meet, in and outside and the sound  
of deaths, to reach out and conduct in sorrow. On what parched holes gathered with lava?  
And the apple to its soul  
and among the essences the manly one  
the pioneer covered with aromatic grape.  
  
It relaxes like a wave around the flint.  
What funny things does  
the pheasant contain?  
How little we appreciate and how much it creates the secrets of this universe.  
So the fleeting happiness lives on in a kiwi,  
the slender house of the book,  
the fleeting acrobat that is humble and blazing.  
Green water to my muzzled banner!  
Honeysuckle was no longer below the recording threshold.  
As soon as the incoming necklaces  
gives the technical indication.  
A wreath circumscribing will dedicate  
the bruised mud of a planet.
