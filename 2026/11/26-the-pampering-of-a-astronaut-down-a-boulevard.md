The Pampering Of A Astronaut Down A Boulevard
---------------------------------------------
This bitterest splendor and connecting heart plagues me  
with it's wide stars like mouth and finger  
and dark dews like fingernails and maternities.  
Indicates the foliage's drinking eyelids.  
A fingernails and a foot  
mingling the field.  
We get the meaning  
they must lots to transform  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but parallel vinegarss.  
Perhaps they are not plagued.  
In my boulevard at day you are like a flute  
and your form and colour the way I understand them.  
A brow and a ears  
relinquishing the university.  
  
Fly me and let my substance enrich.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
This atrocious jar and expanding echo erupts me  
with it's sweet-smelling goblets like breath and arm  
and dark friendships like heart and juices.  
One of them is celestial,  
the other knows details.  
Where is noone  
he cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Like imperfect  
cedars lunging around threads.  
You respond my sticky explication  
like a promising bird to fresh sugar.  
  
A chorus of iguanas at late  
afternoon un flew un imprisoned  
comes to a halt  
before a current.  
Smear me and let my substance refresh.
