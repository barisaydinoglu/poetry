Flying toward the umbrella for a day, maybe too few to count,  
I rested under a pillow of fog  
at a bus stop, waiting for the custodian to be amid.

But the honeysuckle attracted the memory.  
The bottle discovering from my ears.  
All tigers become felicities.  
They are all mountaineers  
professional cold fires in whose blazing roses originate.
