Here I Perform You
------------------
The wind smooth funerals are attacked.  
You expand in the universe as in a comfortable sea.  
Be guided by the parsimonious tree's flag.  
Everything spoiled with eloquent voices, the salt of the pasture  
and piles of lovely bread outside early light of day.  
  
Your perfume is a path filled with sifted fellowship.
