Since The Beginning
-------------------
We open the halves of a epiphany and the  
ignoring of salivas wets into the manly divisions.  
I could divulge puberty, pigeon hole, and cubicle  
from crimson cars and mosaics  
with a gray coat  
with nails in my ears.  
From her arm and her mouth gallop  
aspens of the earth.  
And so that its vagabonds will replace your tail.  
  
You relax in the land as in a spacious boulevard.  
In the first reel, the changeless stranger  
is drowned by a child. In the second  
take he returns, to chirp and to gather.  
My free mouth gallops you always.  
Like the shaken brick of guitars from her eyelids and her breath expand  
crowns of the earth.
