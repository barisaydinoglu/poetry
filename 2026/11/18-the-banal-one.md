The Banal One
-------------
Full stop.  
From her foot and her hand trust  
corals of the earth.  
A language mingles,  
forces - it does not return.  
Among the gray illusion of the darknes.  
As soon as the incoming mosaics  
gives the individual indication.  
Purity is gone, the subject has recovered.  
The magnolium knows this,  
that life in it's fused quartz boxes is as endless as the tryst.  
And the faucet to its perfume  
and among the sun rises the homogeneous one  
the pioneer covered with fresh ripple.  
For laminated sign was morose and morally neutral.  
  
There are no abyss but bitterest cycles of old warrior's medal and green  
lemons  
of delicious dilute rusted nail.
