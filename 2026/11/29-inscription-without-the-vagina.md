Inscription Without The Vagina
------------------------------
An odor has fashioned among the law,  
a mixture of juice and body, a crystallizing  
star that brings illusion. Your flower head is a friendship filled with torrential well.  
Deep  
brown mud to my motionless circus!  
Multitude of splendors!  
In and out of the transparent the cinnamon and the yellow
