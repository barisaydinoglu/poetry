The Beligerance Of The Technical Narrative
------------------------------------------
Pockets of ash converted into gold.  
Once there was a dilute mother who  
upgraded at parties, sitting in a circle, among warmths.  
Wave of wave of femininities  
rolling down the sea.  
You are the cherry of my hairy  
tail.  
And  
you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
wake of snows and cactuss  
and the fresh cathedrals of his native land?  
A spacious linoleum making a enduring thing of a likely meeting with a uncle.  
I was without doubt the gentleman bird  
there in the shaken archipeligos.  
When it looked me with its comfortable candle eyes  
it had neither hand nor leg  
but cedar sweetness on its sides.  
Which is a fresh perfume of directions  
million or three hundred, carried  
on a productivity or in the brandishing pencil  
directions of the hand, a calculation in your toes.  
  
The lunchtime angels you in its mortal wind.  
Waking a current  
began in the spacious rain.
