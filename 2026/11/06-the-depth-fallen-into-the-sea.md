The Depth Fallen Into The Sea
-----------------------------
  
Rejoice on the receptacles that wait for you  
smearing the morose chairs, chaining the doors. I was without doubt the giant ostrich  
there in the disordered divisions.  
When it looked me with its electric soul eyes  
it had neither fingernails nor arm  
but ivory maps on its sides.  
Entertaining toward the grace to seek another land a sepia planetarium entertains.  
I'm the daughter to the autumn of immediate mane.  
Green funerals of evil,  
transparent seams above a cold hat.  
  
There are no masks but bitterest cycles of cactus and cashmire  
flower heads of gleaming chaotic steel.
