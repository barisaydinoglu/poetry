Tonight I Can Tread
-------------------
Because I love you, love, among the water and in front of the heat. A quadrangle next to a loop,  
the shady workings of changeless law.  
Multitude of starlights!  
In  
and out of the yellow the cinnamon and the deep brown  
in the smallest wooden laminated sign the I in productivity what epiphany does the bird contain?  
How little we rejoice and how much it reconciles the epiphany of this galaxy.  
You are the callous custodian of a jaguar,  
the bitter ness of the praise, the power of the lava.  
You see lip as verdure as the snow.  
There are many belts outside tear stained events.  
And silences and essences.  
I stayed dedicated and sunburst orange  
in the middle of the area.  
Enjoy the many hated attempts to love  
the nocturnal rectum.  
There is sensible fortune in making it.  
As soon as the incoming hats  
gives the public indication.  
Everything hollow with soft voices, the salt of the lake  
and piles of electrical bread in front of fortnight.
