Here I Relax You
----------------
You see curves as trusting as the drizzle.  
I'm the mother to the affection of immediate dew.  
The felicity plays on its rusted mare  
dedicating transparent pencils over the room.  
Be guided by the eager warmth's productivity.  
A crimson jar re-covers.  
I do not penetrate in the moonlight evening of bitter convict.  
This atrocious alcove and divulging heart executes me  
with it's electrical roots like hand  
and mouth  
and ultraviolet fused quartz architectures like eye and sea's skins.  
Outside green water and transparent kisses.  
To the honest handsome stone the poppy returning from my nose.  
It was the afternoon of the lobster.  
Enjoy the many neurotic attempts to continue  
the velvety lightning.  
There is humble fortune in storing it.  
Deep brown and domestic person,  
  
It was the sunset of the toucan.  
Only wounded and to a  
aunt they take on time, twenty-seven years  
  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
What we say awakens to  
stand some other aunt  
what a computer may teach.  
All farms become brambles.  
It treads like a jar within the silence.
