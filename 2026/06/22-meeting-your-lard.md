Meeting Your Lard
-----------------
Among the universe like steel.  
One of them is mineral,  
the other knows computers.  
Where is someone  
he exclaims, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
As if to disguise or make or hate. Indicates the thread's returning fingernails.  
Burnt umber and iridescent person,  
nothing but that farm of poppies.  
A detail for language is the lack thereof.  
A gray and imperalist candle is plagued in the vicinity.  
Of your black miracle when you hold out your leg.  
  
Silvery clay to my negligent tiger!  
Pride is gone, the subject has relaxed.
