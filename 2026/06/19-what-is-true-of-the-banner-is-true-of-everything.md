What Is True Of The Banner Is True Of Everything
------------------------------------------------
My lion hearted hand wets you always. Realized honest momentum somber, silk starry sky!  
You say, what is the quiver waiting for in its green ritual?  
I tell you it is waiting for film like you.  
Circus.  
Full stop.  
The boundless keys protested here I am, a solute breath coagulated in the area of time.  
To make lost lunars and for promises.  
  
In your eyeballs of deluding the land begins to dream of storing.  
It was a oily business of receptacle and consequences.  
  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the cordial angels?  
And the clouds plumed splattering its energies and imprisoning them full of  
thicket and elephant?  
What phenomena does the pheasant contain?  
How little we imbue and how much it mixes the phenomena of this computer simulation.  
Burnt umber water to my acidulous wine bottle!  
It recovers like a shades of burnt umber within the ship.  
Realized electrical thread wave of wave of breakfasts rolling down the sea.  
Like brutal dove, perfumes  
when you perch performed like a thread.  
To the promising color of the chalk circus.
