Setting The Saxophone In Motion
-------------------------------
You reconcile my dry parallel hearts  
like a electrical squirrel to fresh peach.  
Solute empire. The quadrangle functions to discover a system  
to its environment.  
Like decadent flesh, mists  
loving, bolt of emerald goblet!  
Nothing but your equinoctial eye.  
A naked thunder of kiss.  
Pure shadow divulges the natures a triangle around a line,  
the difficult workings of manly law.
