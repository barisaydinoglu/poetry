Jackals About The Signal She Inherited
--------------------------------------
We open the halves of a epiphany and the  
mutating of oblivions flutters into the hopeful jungle.  
Conversations of schools, the recitation  
of warmths of your body we call domestic flower.  
The imperfect ceramic imposes nessecity.  
Appreciated and then loved in the sea.  
To inherit lost fountains and for necklaces.  
Of cordial peach, spirit  
of the fragrances of strawberry,  
degraded daughter blood, your kisses  
crystallize into exile  
and a droplet of crystal, with remnants of the vicinity.  
Inside transparent water and silvery fleshes.  
A ultraviolet and violenet forest is abhorred in the room.  
What epiphany does the cat contain?  
How little we build and how much it blossoms the epiphany of this universe.  
  
Brings all the disguises natures.  
When the thicket is full of cold hips  
around hounds and clotting morbid clusters  
and the ironous miracles and the echoes  
at last give forth their barbaous martyr.  
The stationary mother  
perches in the manly morning.  
A thick thunder of flower heads.
