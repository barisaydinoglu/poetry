Among Of Atom And Bed
---------------------
Indicates the wave's dawning eye.  
Only flag, just the  
well, nothing but  
it. Maternity.  
Living a path  
stood in the celestial wind.  
Sunburst orange consequences of blood,  
blue seams above a neon ribbon.  
A atom -like conspirator  
the bitterest railroad track that rescues in your landscape.  
A current of poetic salt  
that does not know why it flows and grows.  
  
Sometimes a piece of the earth  
executes like a farm in my tail.  
A chorus of pheasants at night un circumscribed un dropped  
comes to a halt before a ritual.  
Behind the undulating polyps.  
Wave of wave of springtimes rolling down the sea.
