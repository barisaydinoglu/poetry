A Apple
-------
This inevitable cathedral and connecting foam attacks me  
with it's warm foliages like eye and toe  
and red smooth stones like brow and warmths of your body.  
Draw from it the delirious  
sequence of its own machine.  
I chirp as if behind a tenacious stench.  
She is behind us at this moment of first reflecting.  
Inside the protesting  
complaints.  
Has the divisions been entertained with epiphany?  
Sometimes a piece of the jungle  
falters like a wine bottle in my eyelids.  
Dead weather, bitter lights like the hoove.  
They imprisoned it with tenacious landscapes.  
It is a tale of forceful vinegars some divulge but I gather your iron like hoove.  
Romantic, chalk mane!  
What gnaws the props of tiredness?  
Neither home nor serenity nor dull shades of sand-colored  
nor transparent but burnt umber.  
A sunshine of silences the yeast reflects on its thirsty mare  
travelling opaque sepia pullulations over the sea.  
The reasons for my respect  
are wetted in my tail of ceramic.
