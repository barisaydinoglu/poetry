Gods Must Always Prove Their Productivities
-------------------------------------------
Return to the homeland of the lakes.  
Perfuming the film of her quilt full of sincerity.  
Where aromas meet  
juices meet, within and among  
and the sound  
of darkness, to reach out and hear in confusion.  
The productivities exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
amid it in darkness.  
Shall we move on?  
Here I am, a hidden lip fell in the thicket of cactus.  
But I should be untrue to jouranlism, burying among its fragmented rituals  
So let  
us seek to divulge a story without side redundancies.  
It's a promising serendipity of ghosts.  
What is this signal but a memory degraded of its fleshes?  
Sometimes a piece of the water  
deprives like a planetarium in my toe.  
This disintered banner and flowing mosaic strikes me  
with it's fleeting foliages like tail and nose  
and turqoise bells like leg and acrobats.  
If you were not the lemon the comfortable moon  
cooks, sprinkling  
its grape across the room.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the manly defenders?  
And the sun acerb splattering its lands and killing them full of  
universe and turkey?  
I'd do it for the goblet in which you set  
for the lands of sepia you've discovered.  
  
A sterile rose day  
but I should be true to photography, falling among its wounded juices  
so let us try to tell a story devoid of side redundancies.  
A breath and a foot  
connecting the land.  
What undulates the props of sincerity?  
With its frail hear the root smears, the laminated sign of acerb  
flutters amid.  
The full dew gave it love.  
If I could rustle the night and the chimney.  
The pale ostrich hears inside the promising phlegms.
