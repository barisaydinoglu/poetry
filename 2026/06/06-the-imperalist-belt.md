The Imperalist Belt
-------------------
Exiled sunrise and the bitter perfume  
faint at the walls of my house.  
Seeking toward the praise if you were not the bread the parenthetical moon  
cooks, sprinkling its wine across the land.  
But I should be untrue to photography, deforming among its sterile sea water  
so let us attempt to divulge a story without grammatic redundancies.  
Everything burned-out with rosy voices, the salt of the fountain  
and piles of winged bread inside twilight.
