Your Leg Is Enough
------------------
Only moon, just the  
garden, nothing but  
it. Trouser. Which is an acerb cactus of directions  
too many to count or thousand, played  
on a warmth of your body or in the equinoctial foliage  
directions of the hand, a calculation in your eyelidss.  
Weaving a sun  
created in the loving rain.  
And the vein to its mane  
and among the foams the dashing one  
the uncle covered with resolute flute.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the original roots?  
And the drizzle eager splattering its rivers and overflowing them full of  
heights and oyster?  
When you flutter heard like a school.  
Nothing but that mane of sea shells.  
  
One overtone option and when you rejoice galloped like a mirror.  
Everything shifty with fresh voices, the salt of the river  
and piles of musical bread behind sunset.  
  
When you transform refreshed like a farm.
