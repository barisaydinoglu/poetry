Since The Beginning Of Wetting
------------------------------
The order of the ships explosive weather, mechanical lights like the pasture. In the cinnamon shoulder of the mud. To seek another land the cold fire imposes nessecity.  
An odor has appreciated among the tiger,  
a mixture of lard and body, a enchanting  
horse that brings illusion.  
And an atrocious serendipity's lava will  
dawn you.  
He is outside us at this moment of first mixing.
