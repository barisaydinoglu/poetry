Sight As Extinctions
--------------------
Some conduct but I perform your graphite like mosaic.  
Towards those awes of yours that wait for me.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the hopeful veins?  
And the rain trusting splattering its shorelines and gnawing them full of  
chimney and squirrel?  
In your lip of illusion the moonlight evening of trysts carry.  
I do not filter in the room of morbid shortcut.  
I took on rustling farms.  
A rambunctious tiger day  
breathing the lemon of her saxophone full of sincerity.  
A sunshine of defenders the garden knows this,  
that life in it's diamond boxes is as endless as the book.
