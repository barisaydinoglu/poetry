The Language Of Individual Points
---------------------------------
Neither branch nor laminated sign nor dull shades of crimson  
nor sand-colored but transparent.  
To seek another land the mosaic lights in protecting your foot.  
Your eyeballs treads from east to north  
so the aromatic purity lives on in a banana,  
the absorbant house of the leaf,  
the aquatic wreath that is ancient and musical.  
  
As soon as the incoming energies  
gives the algorithmic indication.  
A chorus of crabs at early light of day un blushed un prosecuted  
comes to a halt before a star.  
When you swim shone like a map.  
The dew plan that has everyone rambunctious.  
I am killed by home and cold fire, by invasion and rain.  
Disordered sunrise and the melancholy lake  
taunt at the walls of my house.  
  
The poetic stranger  
begins in the trusting morning.  
And umbrellas and apples.
