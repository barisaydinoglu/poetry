An Equally Sensible Bride
-------------------------
Inside burnt umber water and deep brown bird feathers.  
I wish to make a triangle  
with, and every color,  
many  
times hidden in a law.  
A camera plays,  
coddles - it does not return.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
make of evening stars and goblets  
and the warm candles of his  
native land?  
The veins exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
among it in darkness.  
If you were not the grape the loving moon  
cooks, sprinkling its cheesecake across the boulevard.  
Your brow breathes from east to west  
Around the heights I like to entertain like a decadent wreath. Flowing from furious gold.
