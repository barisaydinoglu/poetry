What Is True Of The Maternity Is True Of Nothing
------------------------------------------------
My romantic heart blushes you always. From her foot and her mouth pulse  
natures of the earth.  
When you magnify like flag created by the earth.  
Only muzzled and to a  
custodian they take on time, thousand years  
where serenities meet  
foliages meet, outside and in front of and the sound  
of imperfect chalks, to reach out and grow in sorrow.  
  
The consequence performs on its atrocious mare  
living opaque transparent muscles over the sea.  
In the face of so many enemies to positivity.  
And next to my hammock, during the day, I woke up naked  
and full of love.  
Umbrella of a buried skeleton flesh.  
Multitude of writings!  
In and out of the sepia the cashmire and the sunburst orange  
to play lost droplets and for juices.  
It wakes like a pullulation amid the path.  
What is this synonym but  
a memory filtered of its corals?  
A black and wet-winged ribbon is pitied in the city.  
Brings all the soddens roses.  
  
The reasons for my respect  
are crystallized in my shoulder of gem.  
A wheel is not enough to undulate me and keep me  
from the thicket of your absent minded epiphany.  
  
Sunburst orange heat to my phosphorus bird feather!  
From her toe and her finger fly  
dews of the earth.
