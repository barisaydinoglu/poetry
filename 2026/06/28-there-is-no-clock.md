There Is No Clock
-----------------
I wish to make a line  
in, and every hearing, many  
times hidden in a yellow lake.  
Which is a lyrical telegraph of directions  
three hundred or too many to count, dedicated  
On a stars in the sky or in the lion hearted bird feather  
directions of the tail, a calculation  
in your eyelidss.
