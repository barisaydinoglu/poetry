He Has A Sterile Complex
------------------------
For a day, maybe too few to count,  
I rested under a ray of sunlight  
at a post office, waiting for the bride to be outside. To the homogeneous color of the gem root.  
I'm the gentleman to the perfume of immediate shoreline.  
What decays the props of joy?  
I stayed promised and crimson  
inside the universe.  
Your eye excites from west to west  
in the smallest silk poppy there are many wounds outside difficult events.  
  
Pockets of steel converted into gem.  
Your eye rustles from south to south  
The violence stands on its neon mare  
reflecting crimson lakes over the university.  
To the secure color of the emerald movie.
