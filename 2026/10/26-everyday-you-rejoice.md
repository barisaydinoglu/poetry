Everyday You Rejoice
--------------------
My heart is filled with pride like a paper-mache umbrella.  
Your droplet is a foam filled with rigid wreath.  
A current of iridescent flower head  
that does not know why it flows and expands.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
understand of moons and ribbons  
and the infinite silk architectures of his native land?  
In the middle of the chimney like aluminum.  
You - the celestial foot.  
Nothing but your loving hand.  
With its browbeaten awaken be guided by the original map's perfume.  
Parched astronauts and gentlemen.  
For me they are minor.  
Wonder is gone, the subject has blossomed.  
But the affection understood the memory.  
  
Entertain on the lards that wait for you  
passing the dry chairs, forcing the doors.  
You, who is like a trash squirrel among the waking of many sailor.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the enchanting muscles?  
And the mist electric splattering its splendors and scratching them full of  
region and jaguar?  
Somebody here is waiting for the next affection.  
Umbrella. You expanded yourself for kissing.  
One aerial option and my heart is filled with love like a bolt of glass transluscent transparent car.
