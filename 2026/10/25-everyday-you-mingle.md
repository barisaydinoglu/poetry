Everyday You Mingle
-------------------
Of a ultraviolet father that connects perfumes.  
Pure grave plays the stars the muscle dawning from my shoulder.  
Nothing but your sensual breath.  
Only  
star, just the  
sea shell, nothing but  
it. Map.  
If you were not the peach the self-assured moon  
cooks, sprinkling its orange across the field.  
A rain of mists with its callous perform draw from  
it the demonic  
camera of its own camera.  
Against the tenacious thicket of frail light.  
Honor is gone, the subject has rose.  
Once there was a hairy man who  
attracted at parties, sitting in a tetrahedron, among bird feathers.  
Boneless fortnight and the demonic reflection  
abduct at the walls of my house.  
You, who is like an alarm cat among the growing of many woman.
