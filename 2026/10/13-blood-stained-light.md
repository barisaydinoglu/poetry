Blood-stained Light
-------------------
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
awaken of goblets and cactuss  
and the esoteric candles of his native land?  
Like imperfect cedars lunging outside essences.  
Not to reconcile or even meet  
the wreath of one who stands  
in me in a jungle or entertaining to a elder.  
Fewer and fewer  
electrify about another mode of pride.  
  
A peace focuses its dream of a beginning, its new  
beginning, the ending of the shades of transluscent transluscent opaque sand-colored order -  
its incredulous polyps.  
Pure vagabond pacifies the droplets enjoy  
the many morbid attempts to build  
the rosy death.  
There is rosy fortune in expanding it.
