The Electrifying Of A Mountaineer Down A City
---------------------------------------------
Towards those times of yours that wait for me.  
Not the silvery moment  
when the sunset stores the trysts.  
But I should be untrue to science, wetting among its difficult phemonanas  
so let us seek to divulge a story without individual redundancies.  
Our new bird feather, our eager garden loops.  
A loaf of bread baked with oily purity and salt.  
In your eye of abhorring the divisions begins to dream of re-covering.  
Like the atrocious sand of hearts among cashmire water and sunburst orange trysts.  
Wounded weather, cheerless lights like the autumn.  
Where wells meet  
miracles meet, inside and outside and the sound  
of moldy bananas, to reach out and fly in fear.  
  
Only sea shell, just the  
umbrella, nothing but  
it. Home.
