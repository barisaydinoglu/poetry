Projection With The Clandenstine
--------------------------------
My heart is filled with pride like a silicon snow.  
Towards those sea's skins of yours that wait for me.  
In my room at day you are like a peace  
and your form and colour the way I create them.  
My heart is filled with happiness like a marble perfume.  
The flower mourns, the pencil of handsome  
rises with.  
Pulled out and shut up like a phemonana.  
Here I am, an absorbant arm degraded in the room of guitar.
