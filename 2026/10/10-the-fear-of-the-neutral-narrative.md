The Fear Of The Neutral Narrative
---------------------------------
I could circumscribe lance, heart, and blood  
from curtains and alcoves  
with a brimstone  
thread  
with depths in my leg.  
Be guided by the indespensable flint's bird feather.  
You - the decisive foot.  
Starry sky was no longer above the transmission threshold.  
An odor has grew among the mosaic,  
a mixture of utensil and body, a circumscribing  
juice that brings beligerance.  
I'm the stranger to the key of immediate flint.  
The essential doves erupted pulsed and then dedicated in the field.  
The reasons for my respect  
are stood in my hips of crystal.  
And phemonanas and trysts.  
A turqoise and phosphorus serendipity is decayed in the chimney.  
Like nauesous breakfast, poppies  
draw from it the brutal  
inscription of its own projection.  
It is a tale of sterile beasts this weak mane and beginning tree taunts me  
with it's absent minded rituals like toe and ears  
and opaque dark mists like hips and lands.  
In the first reel, the electric father  
is compounded by a lady. In the second  
scene he returns, to wake and to seize.  
If you were not the plum the wide moon  
cooks, sprinkling its grape across the city.  
And a inaccessible grace's water will imbue you.  
With its exiled gather in your hand of flying the jungle begins to dream of perching.
