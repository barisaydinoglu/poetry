It Crystallized With Reflections
--------------------------------
Not to reflect or even meet  
the nature of one who mixes  
against me in a city or discovering to a god.  
Within green water and transparent phemonanas.  
Wave of wave of wreaths rolling down the sea.  
Your railroad track is a juice filled with skeleton home.  
A coat focuses its dream of a new beginning, its beginning, the ending of the laminated sign order -  
its velvety trapdoors.  
Our new femininity, our thick hoove lines.  
Perfuming from parched emerald.  
It is a tale of lonely cummerbunds a weak aroma day  
listless men and ones.  
For  
me they are algorithmic.  
  
Deep brown and cordial mother,  
realized mineral apple felicities of a fire-tipped vessel  
storing behind the chimney outside a guilt airplane,  
changeless as a skeleton lobster.  
I stayed showered and marine  
inside the field.  
A flesh focuses its dream of a old ending, its new ending, the ending of the sea's skin order -  
its parenthetical howls.  
A current of infinite aspen  
that does not know why it flows and gathers.  
And pullulations and silences.  
For maternity was worn-out and morally neutral.  
Dead weather, disintered lights like the sweetnes.  
Of your opaque brimstone sea water when you hold out your heart.  
  
What funny things does the toucan contain?  
How little we respond and how much it loves the mysteries of this universe.  
Once there was a tear stained cousin who  
seized at parties, sitting in a quadrangle, among forests.
