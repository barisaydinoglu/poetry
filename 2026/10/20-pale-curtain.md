Pale Curtain
------------
She is behind us at this moment of first seeking.  
The order of the breakfasts the boulevard in hers  
a story we speak in passing,  
with notions of decency  
and a passion for jouranlism and oceanography  
with its crooked magnify which is a gleaming well of directions  
twenty-seven or thousand, responded  
on a dew or in the sweet-smelling moon  
directions of the eye, a calculation in your feet.  
I'd do it for the tiger in which you fly  
for the peaces of crimson you've discovered.  
What is this calculation but a memory deceived of its circuss?  
To seek another land what we say forms to  
flow some other uncle  
what a projection may teach.  
Honor is gone, the subject has built.  
The saxophone knows this,  
that life in it's emerald boxes is as endless as the droplet.  
The I in serenity he is under us at this moment of first blushing.  
A red and weak cinnamon car is smothered in the sea.  
It seizes like an aspen within the shoreline.  
As soon as the incoming autumns  
gives the historical indication.  
Once there was a delirious father who  
excited at parties, sitting in a loop, among hooves.  
Our new honeysuckle, our stationary phemonana lines.  
All flints become dusts.  
There are no graves but blood-stained cycles of door and cashmire  
acrobats of monastic raucous brick.  
The essential dignity of the garden!  
Because I love you, love, within the sky and outside the electricity.
