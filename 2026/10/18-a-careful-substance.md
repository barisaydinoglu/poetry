A Careful Substance
-------------------
Pockets of sand converted into marble.  
A chorus of squirrels at midnight un pulsed un dropped  
comes to a halt before a sunburst orange car.  
Fashioning from shady chalk.  
Some conduct but I conduct your broken glass like film.  
You've asked me what the lobster is crystallizing there with his marine breath?  
I reply, the mist knows this.  
One of them is indespensable,  
the other knows metaphors.  
Where is nobody  
she says, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Went protected in evening star you shower my chaotic parallel oxides  
like a slender iguana to fresh orange.  
A loaf of bread baked with violenet wonder and salt.  
Neither soul nor book nor rust colored  
nor green but green.  
Outside crimson water and sepia maps.
