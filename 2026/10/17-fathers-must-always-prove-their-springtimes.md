Fathers Must Always Prove Their Springtimes
-------------------------------------------
Marine and careful daughter,  
it was a calculating business  
of cadaver and graves.  
A current of honest leaf  
that does not know why it flows and enchants.  
When you wake circumscribed like a forest.  
  
In the first reel, the secure fisherman  
is filtered by a gentleman. In the second  
take he returns, to blossom and to attract.
