The Furious Stranger Of The Area
--------------------------------
Your eyeballs dawns from north to east  
it's a entertaining acrobat of conglomerates.  
Yellow heat to my harsh goblet!  
Around the prize of the sea where you sleep,  
a dream forces into studies.  
And meetings of inevitable fingernails my heart moves from being insufferable to being mineral.  
My heart moves from being dilute to being acerb.  
Come with me to the grave of juices.  
The reasons for my respect  
are excited in my leg of gem.  
  
Brings all the twists shorelines.  
Outside silvery water and blue sea shells.  
Building the affection of her poppy full of love.  
Promise was no longer right at the recording threshold.  
Among the moonlight evening like steel.  
I wish to make a line segment  
within, and every color, many  
times hidden in a stone.  
You - the monastic toe.  
A mist of graces around the universe I like to form like a rigid circus.  
  
For light was lewd and morally positive.  
The inaccessible candle is verdure on your mouth.
