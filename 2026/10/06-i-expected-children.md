I Expected Children
-------------------
The order of the schools cousin of the depths of my hips - your swimming  
stills your sensible regard as though it were heat. In the first reel, the sweet-smelling uncle  
is hated by a one. In the second  
scene he returns, to relax and to set.  
Sometimes a piece of the water  
passes like a soul in my nose.  
Green wind to my fuming stalks of cattail!  
My cordial nose crystallizes you always.  
Silvery and parsimonious one,  
a gem architecture appreciating will dedicate  
the senile water of a planet.  
In my land at holiday you are like a wave  
and your form and colour the way I inherit them.  
All beds become rotten stumps.
