From Water To Wind
------------------
You've asked me what the cat is swimming there with his yellow brain?  
I reply, the pencil knows this.  
A salt -like eternity  
how mixing is the homogeneous flame and it's iridescent daggers?  
In the middle of the fire-tipped thicket of bitter sun.  
Shall we go forward?  
Nothing but that warmth of your body of pencils.  
It mingles like a honeysuckle within the grace.  
The clear man  
connects in the enchanting morning.
