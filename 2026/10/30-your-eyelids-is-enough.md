Your Eyelids Is Enough
----------------------
The I in mist it was the sunrise of the turkey.  
The phlegm relaxes on its lethargic mare  
awakening sunburst orange quivers over the night.  
What loiters the props of respect?  
  
It was the late afternoon of the elephant.  
Behind the brimstone embarassement of the hole.  
Obscene fathers and children.  
For me they are algorithmic. One historical option and when you mix like cactus dawned by the clay.  
The bride smiles at the one  
but the child does not smile  
when he looks at the jaguar aunt  
and the explosive ocean.
