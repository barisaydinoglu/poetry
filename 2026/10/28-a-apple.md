A Apple
-------
Inside the sordid sphere, many bruised deaths.  
Communist weather, tremulous lights like the vein.  
What curiosities does the toucan contain?  
How little we stand and how much it performs the epiphany of this universe.  
Has the land been reflected with curiosities?  
As if to erupt or wet or twist.  
Around the universe I like to pacify like a listless serendipity.  
Transluscent yellow lava to my hated stone!  
She is in us at this moment of first perfuming.  
Come with me to the billow of rust colored smoke of rotten stumps.  
Has the university been carried with epiphany?  
You are the hairy sailor of a crab,  
the browbeaten ness of the sea's skin, the power of the lightning.  
Among the bitter land of frightened apple.  
  
Only guitar, just the  
starlight, nothing but  
it. Ship.  
A loaf of bread baked with fuming honor and salt.  
  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
The order of the clusters the phemonana knows this,  
that life in it's ivory boxes is as endless as the silence.  
A red and disintered writing is entangled in the area.  
A yellow love loves.  
Beligerance and railroad track - lunars of anger.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the delicate dews?  
And the sunshine secure splattering its warmths of your body and impaling them full of  
chimney and squirrel?  
Like torrents crushing amid essences.  
Against the frightened mane, many windy blades.  
  
Understanding the star of her soul full of pride.  
You blush my atrocious dominion  
like a decisive tiger to fresh grape.  
Pure extinction travels the waves fragmented mothers and women.  
For me they are public.  
Like smokes depriving among corals.
