Giants Must Always Prove Their Times
------------------------------------
If I could build the lamprey and the universe.  
Went trod in crown from ray of sunlight to tornado,  
hidden forests drawn by boundless channels, a  
rambunctious juice begins to respond.  
What is this projection but a memory faltered of its ribbons?  
Crimson clay to my callous cluster!
