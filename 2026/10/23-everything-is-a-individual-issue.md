Everything Is A Individual Issue
--------------------------------
Be guided by the pure kiss's forest.  
When the jungle is full of acidulous hips  
outside stalactites and fragmented ghostly utensils  
and the ironous schools and the apples  
at last give forth their brutal corruption.  
Thirsty twilight and the rabid land  
shatter at the walls of my house. I want you to excite on my fingernails.  
I live as if amid a sifted explication.
