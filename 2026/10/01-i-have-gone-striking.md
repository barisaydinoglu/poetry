I Have Gone Striking
--------------------
You transform my spoiled circumstance  
like an aromatic cat to fresh orange.  
The wreath plan that has everyone fractious.  
Tiredness is gone, the subject has responded.  
You reconcile headlong into a room to imbue your business.  
The reasons for my respect  
are wetted in my hips of crystal.  
A loving carpet making a plumed thing of a chance meeting with a god.  
Lion hearted empire. The triangle functions to blush an architecture  
to its system.  
Multitude of sea water!  
In and out of the silvery the marine and the cashmire  
I was without doubt the child turkey  
there in the browbeaten night.  
When it looked me with its affluent sweetnes eyes  
it had neither brow nor foot  
but wooden horses on its sides.  
And you tread like a warmth of your body and there ought to be a essence of a solute bird feather gathering in a night.  
To seek another land the honeysuckles exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
inside it in darkness.
