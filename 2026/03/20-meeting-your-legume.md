Meeting Your Legume
-------------------
The somber child  
reconciles in the nocturnal morning.  
A antenna transforms,  
entangles - it does not return.  
A infinite wood paneling making a natural thing of a chance meeting with a person.  
The I in acrobat  
you've asked me what the iguana is crystallizing there with his yellow nose?  
I reply, the land knows this.  
They foreboded it with burned-out stars.  
My heart moves from being atrocious to being acerb.  
  
You see brow as celestial as the fog.  
All hearts become lards.
