Outside Of Ribbon And Poppy
---------------------------
In the smallest gold old warrior's medal from her fingernails and her breath excite  
sea shells of the earth. Your hand creates from east to west  
a fog of propellers you've asked me what the elephant is expanding there with his transluscent crimson lip?  
I reply, the river bank knows this.  
The somber gentleman  
Re-covers in the charitable morning.
