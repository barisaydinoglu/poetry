Since The End Of Chirping
-------------------------
A river bank focuses its dream of a new ending, its old ending, the new beginning of the railroad track order -  
its sweet-smelling oblivions.  
Kis of a pitied listless map.  
I could weave cummerbund, corruption, and city  
from alcoves and sea shells  
with a opaque opaque dark vein  
with clocks in my breath.  
Somebody here is waiting for the next pasture.  
Shoreline. You recovered yourself for making.  
  
Drink on the coffins that wait for you  
scratching the nauesous chairs, taunting the doors.  
A circus focuses its dream of a new ending, its ending, the old ending of the tryst order -  
its myriad imperfect woodens.  
And schools and wine bottles.
