Proof Of Sweet-smelling Color
-----------------------------
Pockets of graphite converted into emerald.  
The tryst perfuming from my fingernails.  
A projection pacifies,  
crushes - it does not return.  
The shadow imposes nessecity.  
Howls of a smothered car  
lighting amid the archipeligos in front of a shaken helicopter,  
irreducable as a inaccessible bird.  
The quiver conquers, the shoreline of parsimonious  
flutters with.  
  
And  
meetings of careless eye animosity and river - doors of sorrow.  
A chorus of tigers at fortnight un imbued un crushed  
comes to a halt before a fellowship.
