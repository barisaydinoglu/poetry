Standing Directionless Nostalgia
--------------------------------
Halfway.  
Brings all the devours alcoves.  
Inside the blood colored anger of the belt.  
They are all children  
professional probes in whose fleeting doors originate.  
The reasons for my respect  
are sought in my nose of paper-mache.  
In my land at sunrise you are like a starry sky  
and your form and colour the way I blush them.  
Lemon of a harassed boneless awe.
