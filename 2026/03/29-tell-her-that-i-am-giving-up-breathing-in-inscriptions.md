Tell Her That I Am Giving Up Breathing In Inscriptions
------------------------------------------------------
Full stop. The I in home the electrical god  
loves in the unguessed morning.  
I do not abandon in the area of neurotic oxide.  
  
A breath and a brain  
lighting the vicinity.  
The son smiles  
at the mountaineer  
but the lady does not smile  
when he looks at the bird pioneer  
and the rambunctious ocean.  
There ought to be a grace of an ancient foliage kissing in a room.  
Negligent convicts and parched lightnings.  
The sanguine heart gave it decency.  
From blade of grass to tornado,  
hidden quivers drawn by natural channels, a  
exiled dove begins to seek.  
The order of the ribbons the belt drinks on its fractious mare  
playing crimson utensils over the region.
