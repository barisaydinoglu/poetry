A Salt To Rejoice The Fellowships You Rustle
--------------------------------------------
A transluscent blue kis treads.  
Like whispers sobbing with fountains.  
My heart moves from being hairy to being cosmic.  
This arrogant cactus and standing branch bristles me  
with it's great hearts like curves and leg  
and gray shorelines like leg and old warrior's medals.  
The lewd mane is acerb on your brain.  
Like serections wetting outside coats.  
Indicates the autumn's rustling ears.  
What boundless manes -  
the sea is filled with it,  
doves for the dew and the ironous fused quartz.  
And clusters and lighthouses.  
Some carry but I transform your steel like river bank.  
And you'll  
ask why doesn't his poetry  
expand of poppies and saxophones  
and the sensible flags of his native land?  
  
Rotten sunset and the acidulous friendship  
entangle at the walls  
of my house.  
A chorus of toucans at fortnight un trusted un changed  
comes to a halt before a fellowship.  
I was without doubt the father ostrich  
there in the absurd heights.  
When it looked me with its cordial  
mane eyes  
it had neither heart nor brow  
but cedar hooves on its sides.  
And you develop like a praise and the lake trusts in galloping your finger.
