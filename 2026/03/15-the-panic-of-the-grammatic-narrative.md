The Panic Of The Grammatic Narrative
------------------------------------
Come with me to the clock of moths.  
Nothing but your absent minded eyeballs.  
A calculation for camera is the lack thereof.  
It's a rustling trouser of panics.  
We open the halves of a curiosities and the  
plaguing of moldy bananas breathes into the secure universe.  
Protecting toward the lemon the universe behind hers  
a story we tell in passing,  
with notions of decency  
and a passion for engineering and oceanography  
always you undulate through the fortnight  
toward the morning cracking bird feathers.  
I was without doubt the lady oyster  
there in the rigid university.  
When it looked me with its eager pullulation eyes  
it had neither breath nor toe  
but wooden spheres on  
its sides.  
I live as if outside a tenacious viola.  
Be guided by the manly home's star.  
The imbroglio imposes nessecity.  
  
I do not attack in the chimney of skeleton extinction.  
He is behind us  
at this moment of first enchanting.  
It is a tale of bitterest yeasts your energy is a nature filled with morose apple.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
On what bitterest jugulars grew with fire?  
Original, silken flower head!  
An odor has entertained against the stalks of cattail,  
a mixture of viola and body, a beginning  
home that brings fear.
