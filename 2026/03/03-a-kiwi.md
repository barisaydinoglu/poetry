A Kiwi
------
Halfway.  
Transluscent burnt umber sky to my cold dove!  
Wonder is gone, the subject has fashioned.  
I took on pale flutes.  
A mane -like martyr  
when you shower drank like a flute.  
Your juice is an aroma filled with fuming umbrella.  
The lightning awakens on its fuming mare  
chirping marine flowers over the heights.  
I saw how coats are upgraded  
by the slender current.  
Connecting the shades of transparent of her ship full of joy.  
I wish to make a triangle  
in front of, and every abstraction, many  
times hidden in a essence.  
Halfway.  
The I in circus and the smooth stone to its window  
and among the femininities the aromatic one  
the elder covered with monastic map.
