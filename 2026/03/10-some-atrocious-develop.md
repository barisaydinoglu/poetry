Some Atrocious Develop
----------------------
Towards those bells of yours that wait for me.  
The night branches you in its mortal ice.  
A sunshine of circuss  
you, who is  
like a bramble squirrel among the kissing of many stranger.  
With its smothered play of your rust colored poppy when you hold out your brow.  
Outside the pampering shardss of fused quartz.  
A tetrahedron behind a loop,  
the acidulous workings of hopeful law.  
It wakes like a friendship in front of the hoove.  
The silent dignity of the wheatfield!  
Nothing but that maternity of lighthouses.  
Return to the homeland of the momenta.  
  
Nothing but that school of roses.  
What faints the props of purity?  
  
Not reflecting is a form of beginning.  
The steady dignity of the honeysuckle!  
A machine for point of view is the lack thereof.  
Indicates the foliage's forming eyelids.  
If you were not the sugar the resplendent moon  
cooks, sprinkling its cheesecake across the universe.  
Where old warrior's medals meet  
magnoliums meet, in and outside and the sound  
of traps, to reach out and seize in sorrow.  
  
The femininities exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
outside it in darkness.  
Like the disintered iron of evening stars as soon as the incoming spheres  
gives the alphabetic indication.
