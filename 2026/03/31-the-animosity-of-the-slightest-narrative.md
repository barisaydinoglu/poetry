The Animosity Of The Slightest Narrative
----------------------------------------
The infinite gentleman  
divulges in the poetic morning.  
Because I love you, love, next to the lightning and with the lava.  
  
Enrich on the yeasts that wait for you  
entangling the calcerous chairs, deceiving the doors.  
Among deep brown water and cashmire crowns.  
For cashmire car was calculating and morally neutral.  
Inside the black illusion of the oblivion.  
Nothing but your blazing eyeballs.  
How entertaining is the noble wasteland and it's myriad serections?  
This arrogant bridge and expanding flesh loiters me  
with it's plumed books like breath and brain  
and brimstone candles like foot and shadess of burnt umber.  
  
You - the infinite tail.  
And you understand like a wine bottle and there are no yeasts but dead cycles of eddy and opaque blue  
natures of deedy crooked graphite.  
I am smeared by necklace and explication, by ghost and sunshine.  
I saw how angels are awakened  
by the rosy miracle.  
Faint me and let my substance seize.  
I salute your iridescent orange  
and envy your sensible pride.  
But I  
should be true to computer science, impaling among its absurd lemons  
so let us try to divulge a story devoid of slightest redundancies.
