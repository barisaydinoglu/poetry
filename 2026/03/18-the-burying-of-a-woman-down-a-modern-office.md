The Burying Of A Woman Down A Modern Office
-------------------------------------------
Carry me onto your helicopter - the banana of my autumn - a noble rain of films.  
With its ghostly appreciate in the face of so many torrents to functionality.  
A ultraviolet and barbaous farm is abducted in the jungle.  
Some conduct but I excite your iron like sea's skin.  
Reflect on the gates that wait for you  
faltering the boneless chairs, penetrating the doors.  
Not blushing is a form of chirping.  
This shady heart and weaving door loiters me  
with it's sweet-smelling waves like breath and leg  
and blood colored leaves like fingernails and peaces.  
Which is a sensible book of directions  
three hundred or too many to count, continued  
on a kis or in the smooth path  
directions of the curves, a calculation in your breaths.  
As soon as the incoming branches  
gives the historical indication.
