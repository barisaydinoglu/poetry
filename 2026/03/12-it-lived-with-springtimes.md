It Lived With Springtimes
-------------------------
Towards those angels of yours that wait for me. You discover my insufferable city  
like an ancient elephant to fresh sugar.  
It was a morose business of juice and nails.  
Our new tiger, our balanced thread quadrangles.  
And meetings of hated lip and the tree to its awe  
and among the roots the absent minded one  
the pioneer covered with cleansed sea's skin.  
  
Promising toward the muscle amid the cactus of the sea where you sleep,  
a dream deprives into synonyms.
