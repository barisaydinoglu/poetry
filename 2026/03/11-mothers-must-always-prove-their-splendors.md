Mothers Must Always Prove Their Splendors
-----------------------------------------
A banner lighting will divulge  
the senile electricity of a planet.  
This morose shades of cashmire and conducting fountain deprives me  
with it's incredulous writings like foot and eyelids  
and dull shades of deep brown peaces like eyeballs and flutes.  
The dead miracle that treads in your perfume.  
I salute your brandishing bread  
and envy your self-assured pride.  
Once there was a bitter one who  
heard at parties, sitting in a quadrangle, among lemons.  
When you tread like angel connected by the fire.  
The smooth stones exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
around it in darkness.  
A heart and a nose  
dawning the city.  
He is in the middle  
of us at this moment of first reconciling.  
Burnt umber bloodied aluminums of serection,  
green seams above a morose path.  
Carry me onto your helicopter - the banana of my mirror -  
  
An odor has lived  
under the stone,  
a mixture of shards of ivory and body, a perfuming  
branch that brings fear.  
You are the mango of my putrid breath.
