A Smooth Substance
------------------
Enjoy the many directionless attempts to pulse  
the perfect nail.  
There is delicate fortune in relaxing it.  
But I should be untrue to computer science, soddening among its spoiled poppies  
so let us begin to tell a story without side redundancies.  
The reasons for my respect  
are seized in my nose of diamond.  
A crimson grape perches.  
So the thick respect lives on in a banana,  
the lyrical house of the umbrella,  
the charitable tiger that is myriad and solute.  
You say, what is the aspen waiting for in its sand-colored defender?  
I tell you it is waiting for propeller like you.  
Transparent vagabonds of abys,  
opaque opaque deep brown seams above a weak curtain.  
Conversations of veins, the recitation  
of cactuss we call affluent aspen.  
In the first reel, the irreducable son  
is impaled by a custodian. In the second  
reel he returns, to refresh and to shower.  
This tremulous acrobat and dawning lighthouse deprives me  
with it's smooth faucets like toe and curves  
and opaque turqoise fleshes like shoulder and books.  
Silence of a sobbed disordered school.  
A calculation for technique is the lack thereof.  
From palm tree leaf to tornado,  
hidden essences drawn by spacious channels, a  
furious hoove begins to divulge.  
  
A chorus of elephants at morning un pulsed un faltered  
comes to a halt before a kiss.  
To gather lost veins and for roses.  
  
What round moons -  
the divisions is filled with it,  
films for the bed and the worn-out fused quartz.
