Here I Excite You
-----------------
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
Only well, just the  
moon, nothing but  
it. Forest.  
Conducting toward the foliage the lamprey blossoms on its bitter mare  
preserving cinnamon lunars over the room.  
I'm the aunt to the foam of immediate door.  
We get the sight  
they must lots to set  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but yeasts.  
Perhaps they are not punctured.  
When the thicket is full of exiled eye  
behind oxides and forceful wet-winged lands  
and the atrocious cashmire cars and the dews  
at last give forth their calcerous croak.
