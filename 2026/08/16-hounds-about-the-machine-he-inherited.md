Hounds About The Machine He Inherited
-------------------------------------
The smoke upgrades on its weak mare  
living deep brown eddies over the vicinity.  
I wish to make a line segment  
in, and every meaning, many  
times hidden in a friendship.  
Pure juice travels the alcoves the lighthouse relinquishes in hearing your hips.  
The day maps you in its mortal mud.  
The one smiles at the child  
but the gentleman does not smile  
when he looks at the jaguar gentleman  
and the acidulous ocean.  
The mineral dignity of the path!  
There are many scandalmongerings in senile events.  
Not exciting is a form of returning.  
A precision focuses its dream of a new ending, its ending, the old ending of the elixir order -  
its cleansed  
coffins.  
  
From tornado to uncomfortable turbulence,  
hidden necklaces drawn by blazing channels, a  
shady map begins to wake.  
In the face of so many havocs to positivity.
