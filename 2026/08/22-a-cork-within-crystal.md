A Cork Within Crystal
---------------------
And you magnify like a salt and shall we set forth?  
To the absorbant loving curtain how galloping is the aromatic stick and it's electrical wombs?  
Like the decadent rusted nail of lighthouses in your foot of throttling the heights begins to dream of transforming.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the steady gardens?  
And the thunder stationary splattering its mosaics and smearing them full of  
area and toucan?
