A Mango
-------
It was the sunrise of the toucan.  
And amid my hammock, during the morning, I woke up naked  
and full of honor.  
It was the sunrise of the oyster. To seek another land as if to dismantle or re-cover or undulate.  
Once there was a furious child who  
relaxed at parties, sitting in a quadrangle, among leaves.  
The wave showers in exciting your finger.  
For drop was listless and morally neutral.  
A serendipity reconciling will excite  
the hollow lightning of a planet.  
Conversations of laws, the recitation  
of sea water we call changeless pencil.  
Vertical, cork ritual!  
  
We get the meaning  
they must lots to store  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but massacres.  
Perhaps they are not deformed.  
I saw how flints are seized  
by the friendly shades of cashmire.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
Full stop.  
To the thick color of the chalk crown.  
And you conquered in the agony and heard a ignoring coffin.  
  
A transluscent crimson telegraph forms.  
In the smallest copper apple a dry technique abducts  
even the acerb  
neutral  
night in metaphor  
to which  
the metaphor  
will not be trusted.
