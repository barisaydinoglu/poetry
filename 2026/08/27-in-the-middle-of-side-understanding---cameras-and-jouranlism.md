In The Middle Of Side Understanding - Cameras And Jouranlism
------------------------------------------------------------
Some perform but I reconcile your aluminum like angel. Around the jungle I like to entertain like a wet-winged serenity.  
I want you to trust on my curves.  
  
So the hopeful joy lives on in a cherry,  
the plumed house of the stalks of cattail,  
the humble evening star that is angellic and changeless.
