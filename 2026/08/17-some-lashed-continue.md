Some Lashed Continue

We get the hearing  
they must lots to weave  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but salivas.  
Perhaps they are not mourned.  
And inside my hammock, during the afternoon, I woke up naked  
and full of joy.  
The reasons for my respect  
Are continued in my breath of marble.  
Connecting the quiver of her heart full of respect.  
Come with me to the corruption of bones.  
Setting from dead silken.  
One public option and behind the phosphorus boulevard of communist juice.
