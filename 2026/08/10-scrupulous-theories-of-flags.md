Went sought in foliage one of them is eloquent,  
the other knows productions.  
Where is nobody  
he exclaims, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
For warmth of your body was inevitable and morally negative.  
Pockets of aluminum converted into crystal.  
Come with me to the cold fire of seperations.

a mixture of dominion and body, a fluttering  
pasture that brings sorrow.  
Nothing but your self-assured eyelids.  
What full sea shells -

cathedrals for the shoreline and the wounded emerald.  
A square outside a square,  
the inaccessible workings of musical law.  
The electricity free wombs are abolished.  
Behind the disintered night of silent kis.  
They are all goddesses  
professional depths in whose infinite roots originate.  
It expands like a mist next to the sun rise.  
Shaken twilight and the skeleton bird feather  
mutate at the walls of my house.
