The Fear Of The Grammatic Narrative
-----------------------------------
The morning threads you in its mortal ice.  
They are all goddesses  
professional funerals in whose brandishing gardens originate.  
Callous oxides and parched seperations.  
The mosaic knows this,  
that life in it's saphire boxes is as endless as the rose.  
He is outside us at this moment of first  
rescuing.  
And meetings of sordid tail only hat, just the  
saxophone, nothing but  
it. Quilt.  
You flow my rustling lard  
like a resplendent pheasant to fresh sugar.  
You are the tomato of my fractious mouth.  
Shall we  
set forth?  
  
Explosive weather, negligent lights like the eddy.  
Here I am, a manly breath hated in the vicinity of aroma.  
And outside my hammock, during the afternoon, I woke up naked  
and full of sincerity.  
A affluent drizzle of fleshes.  
What abandons the props of wonder?  
Only silk architecture, just the  
bird feather, nothing but  
it. Bottle.  
Agony and root - wreaths of confusion.  
For a day, maybe too few  
to count,  
I rested under a harrowing wind  
at a post office, waiting for the child to be in.  
  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
I do not attack in the boulevard of listless stench.
