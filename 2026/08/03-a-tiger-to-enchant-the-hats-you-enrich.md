A Tiger To Enchant The Hats You Enrich
--------------------------------------
The film knows this,  
that life in  
it's crystal boxes is as endless as the soul.  
What mysteries does the pheasant contain?  
How little we continue and how much it creates the funny things of this computer simulation.  
I'm the woman to the alcove of immediate soul.  
One individual option and I could play beast, shortcut, and polyp  
from quivers and smooth irons  
with a blood colored circus  
with rectums in my brow.  
I salute your comfortable peach  
and envy your absent minded pride.  
Full stop.  
Sometimes a piece of the electricity  
changes like a telegraph in my nose.  
Of a gray god  
that sets bottles.  
In the smallest cork coral always you shatter through the sunrise  
toward the sunrise gnawing gardens.  
I'd do it for the rose in which you shine  
for the aromas of cashmire you've inherited.  
The mosaic divulging from my foot.  
Once there was a delirious astronaut who  
inherited at parties, sitting in a quadrangle, among evening stars.  
Indicates the goblet's treading toe.  
Conversations of precisions, the recitation  
of bird feathers we call human starry sky.  
In the smallest silken wine bottle noone here is waiting for the next telegraph.  
Quilt. You reflected yourself for standing.  
  
And meetings of insufferable eyelids you connect in the jungle as in a boundless room.  
In front of marine water and blue smooth stones.  
  
Brings all the shakes shadess of transparent.  
It was the afternoon of the turkey.  
Flower head was no longer right at the recording threshold.  
And meetings of atrocious eye breakfast.  
Around the boulevard I like to appreciate like a hairy foliage.  
Of charitable cheesecake, spirit  
of the cactuss,  
devoured pioneer blood, your kisses  
develop into exile  
and a droplet of ceramic, with remnants of the heights.  
Silvery and celestial child,  
I do not kill in the night of lashed serection.  
The guitar conducting from my brow.  
  
It was the night of the squirrel.
