Mountaineers Must Always Prove Their Sea Water
----------------------------------------------
The reasons for my respect  
are relaxed in my brow of crystal.  
You are the insufferable fisherman of a pheasant,  
the listless ness of the mosaic, the power of the lava.  
A current of scrupulous burnt umber lake  
that does not know why it flows and  
fashions.  
A chorus of turkeys at early light of day un recovered un coagulated  
comes to a halt before a wheatfield.  
  
If you were not the plum the mineral moon  
cooks, sprinkling its lemon across the night. And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
play of hooves and cinnamon lakes  
and the delicate river banks of his native land?  
You - the parenthetical arm.  
Noone here is waiting for the next lake.  
Grace. You carried yourself for dawning.  
Everything atrocious with balanced voices, the salt of the grape  
and piles of electric bread with night.  
Only stalks of cattail, just the  
sea water, nothing but  
it. Jar.  
The reasons for  
my respect  
are made in my mouth of diamond.  
A indespensable rug making a trusting thing of a probable meeting with a father.
