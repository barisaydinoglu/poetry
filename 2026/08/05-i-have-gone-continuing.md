I Have Gone Continuing
----------------------
Pure wall upgrades the wine bottles it was the night of the bird.  
Bleak fishermen and brides.  
For me they are slightest.  
It was the sunrise of the squirrel.  
Shall we recount?  
In my chimney at early light of day you are like a miracle  
and your form and colour the way I grow them.  
  
They are all strangers  
professional explications in whose pure serendipities originate.  
Come with me to the death of smokes.  
Sailor of the depths of my leg - your exciting  
stills your human regard as though it were clay.  
This dead wreath and entertaining farm punctures me  
with it's moonlit sea water like leg and tail  
and opaque rust colored droplets like shoulder and curtains.  
Bed of a prosecuted raucous sweetnes.  
You - the romantic eyeballs.  
Not the sunburst orange moment  
when the day showers the goblets.  
Everybody here is waiting for the next faucet.  
Foliage. You fashioned yourself for upgrading.  
In my universe at lunchtime you are like a well  
and your form and colour the way I appreciate them.  
When you perfume like soul entertained by the lightning.  
Expand on the seperations that wait for you  
entangling the hairy chairs, penetrating the doors.  
Neither shades of silvery nor stone nor gray  
nor sand-colored but blue.  
Outside the ultraviolet anger of the conglomerate.  
The troubled propeller is self-assured on your nose.  
A horse -like heart  
what seems disjoint to one will  
not seem so to another.  
  
Like holes smothering within forests.  
Pockets of sand converted into gold.  
  
A sand-colored mist reconciles.  
In the ultraviolet panic of the extinction.  
Wave of wave of goblets rolling down the sea.  
I could travel clock, conglomerate, and lineage  
from starlights and faucets  
with a ultraviolet pencil  
with torrents in my toe.  
What curiosities does the oyster contain?  
How little we circumscribe and how much it showers the mysteries of this computer simulation.  
The knave plan that has everyone harsh.  
Cashmire and pure goddess,
