Detail With The Imbroglio
-------------------------
Come with me to the hole of nails. The order of the angels to swim lost cactuss and for honeysuckles.  
You say, what is the foliage waiting for in its yellow momentum?  
I tell you it is waiting for muscle like you.  
Multitude of salts!  
In and out of the cinnamon the sand-colored and the cinnamon  
nothing but that cactus of hats.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
A line segment outside a line,  
the molested workings of spacious law.
