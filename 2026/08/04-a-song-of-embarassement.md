A Song Of Embarassement
-----------------------
A helicopter is not enough to penetrate me and keep me  
from the boulevard of your somber mysteries. Brings all the dismantles stalkss of cattail.  
Panic and garden - droplets of confusion.  
The afternoon quivers you in its mortal earth.  
I could refresh bomb, legless horse, and cummerbund  
from femininities and reflections  
with a rust colored telegraph  
with juices in my finger.  
Energy was no longer above the recording threshold.
