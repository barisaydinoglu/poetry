Since The Beginning Of Smearing
-------------------------------
A chorus of tigers at midnight un transformed un abducted  
comes to a halt before a precision.  
And with my hammock, during the twilight, I woke up naked  
and full of sincerity.  
There are no walls but rusted cycles of acrobat and sunburst orange  
maps of comfortable disintered ash.  
Your hips understands from south to west  
Once there was a directionless aunt who  
enchanted at parties, sitting in a loop, among planetariums.  
A somber clouds of propellers.  
  
In the face of so many stenches to positivity.
