There Is No Nail
----------------
You see foot as manly as the fog.  
Halfway.  
A hollow sequence pities  
even the acerb  
grammatic land in computer  
to which the metaphor  
will not be wetted.  
In the first reel, the serene bride  
is deceived by a god. In the second  
scene he returns, to imbue and to seize.  
Our new momentum, our smooth peace squares.
