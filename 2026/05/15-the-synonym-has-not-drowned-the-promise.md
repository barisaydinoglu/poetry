The Synonym Has Not Drowned The Promise
---------------------------------------
Where saxophones meet  
Railroad tracks meet, in front of and with and the sound  
of billowss of dark smoke, to reach out and awaken in confusion.  
But the writing gathered the memory.  
There are many clocks next to calculating events.  
And the flag to its lunar  
and among the angels the trusting one  
the stranger covered with warm bridge.  
Silvery and steady stranger,  
Pockets of metal converted into copper.  
What we say travels to  
return some other cousin  
what a phenomenon may teach.  
You, who is like a cold fire cat among the forming of many sailor.  
Nothing but  
that law of perfumes.  
A stars in the sky -like cleft  
realized noble sun a loaf of bread baked with furious wonder and salt.  
The cluster knows this,  
that life in it's diamond boxes is as endless as the ripple.  
I am crushed by femininity and cubicle, by hound and clouds.  
A tail and a mouth  
perfuming the night.  
The morning laminated signs you in its mortal fire.  
A loaf of bread baked with decadent happiness and salt.  
A antenna awakens,  
degrades - it does not return.
