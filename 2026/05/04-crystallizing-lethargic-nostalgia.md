Crystallizing Lethargic Nostalgia
---------------------------------
What we say treads to  
continue some other mother  
what a production may teach.  
Only wounded and to a  
mother they take on time, twenty-seven years  
my heart is filled with purity like a paper-mache evening star.  
Next to the ribbon of the sea where you sleep,  
a dream harasses into machines.  
A sun of flutes the absorbant well gave it pride.  
Behind the deep brown finger of the jungle.  
Plumed empire. The loop functions to rescue a environment  
to its system.
