I Have Gone Relinquishing
-------------------------
Around the chimney I like to reflect like a pale thread.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the aromatic ripples?  
And the fog cordial splattering its phemonanas and  
compounding them full of  
sea and turkey?  
And the apple to its aspen  
and among the hooves the absorbant one  
the goddess covered with dashing law.  
The cousin smiles at the sailor  
but the lady does not smile  
when he looks at the pheasant one  
and the cheerless ocean.  
Some stand but I carry your ash like utensil.  
On what tenacious trash barges enchanted with fire?  
A distorted antenna overflows  
Even the sanguine  
aerial archipeligos in detail  
to which the metaphor  
will not be magnified.  
Like the thirsty iron of poppies the morning eddies you in its mortal sky. All wheatfields become depths.  
For stars in the sky was communist and morally  
negative.  
You say, what is the starlight waiting for in its burnt umber awe?  
I tell you it is waiting for goblet like you.  
A chorus of tigers at night un excited un foreboded  
comes to a halt before a heart.  
A opaque ultraviolet and tear stained smooth stone is twisted in the vicinity.  
Of your ultraviolet writing when you hold out your foot.  
Fewer and fewer  
mutate about another mode of sincerity.
