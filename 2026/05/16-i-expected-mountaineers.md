I Expected Mountaineers
-----------------------
Green and silent sailor, an odor has awakened in the map,  
a mixture of panic and body, a weaving  
stone that brings agony. In the face of so many eternities to positivity.  
A tear stained light day  
free, ceramic droplet!  
For star was chaotic and morally  
neutral.  
You magnify my blood-stained complaint  
like a cleansed cat to fresh wine.  
I am fell by bridge and wax, by salt and sunshine.  
To seek another land because I love you, love, inside the jungle and in front of the electricity.  
The reasons for my respect  
are divulged in my foot of marble.
