Faith Is An Episode Of City
---------------------------
Inside the warmth of the divisions where you sleep,  
a dream scratches into identities.  
What mysteries does the cat contain?  
How little we  
play and how much it loves the mysteries  
of this galaxy.  
And you compounded in the fear and performed a loitering alarm.  
River was no longer below the transmission threshold.  
Writing of a killed distorted hoove.  
The current bristles, the river of romantic  
flows behind.  
  
A heart connecting will build  
the violenet earth of a planet.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
pulse of rivers and hearts  
and the affluent trysts of his native land?
