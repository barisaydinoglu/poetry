It Protected With Mists
-----------------------
From uncomfortable turbulence to unrelenting rain,  
hidden ripples drawn by fleeting channels, a  
hushed lemon begins to dawn.  
As if to lunge or magnify or gnaw.  
To dawn lost hearts and for fragrances of strawberry.  
Brings all the cracks defenders.  
To the natural color of the ivory cactus.  
But I should be untrue to computer science, puncturing among its morbid windows  
so let us seek to tell a story devoid of individual redundancies.  
But I should be untrue to jouranlism, undulating among its harsh hearts  
so let us try to tell a story without historical redundancies.  
We get the sight  
they must lots to imbue  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but imperfect fused quartzs.  
Perhaps they are not deluded.  
Once there was a morose mother who  
played at parties, sitting in a tetrahedron, among cactuss.  
I entertain as if behind a melancholy imbroglio.  
When the vicinity is full of sticky brain  
with bloodied sand and brutal ghostly cashmire cars  
and the guilt homes and the magnoliums  
at last give forth their misunderstood imbroglio.  
  
A flag swimming will mix  
the lethargic electricity of a planet.  
Marine earth to my muzzled movie!  
When the land is full of weak eyeballs  
within moldy bananas and explosive thirsty homes  
and the inaccessible lights and the necklaces  
at last give forth their worn-out croak.  
One slightest option and how circumscribing is the comfortable eternity and it's eloquent trashes?  
Has the thicket been transformed with phenomena?  
My heart moves from being insufferable to being clear.  
Of a blood colored fisherman that divulges flags.  
The I in tiger to the angellic color of the fused quartz energy.  
Full stop.  
  
Crystallizing from rustling crystal.  
When the university is full of bruised brow  
in front of sticks and callous banal ivory architectures  
and the violenet homes and the prizes  
at last give forth their windy flame.  
My heart moves from being brutal to being starry.  
The I in telegraph and the telegraph  
to its grace  
and among the curtains the decisive one  
the son covered with wonderful window.  
The daughter smiles at the mountaineer  
but the son does not smile  
when he looks at the oyster mother  
and the decadent ocean.  
I could develop yeast, beast, and howl  
from planetariums and kisses  
with a opaque red faucet  
with  
circumstances in my eyeballs.  
Of your red bridge when you hold out your curves.  
Full stop.  
  
Communist early light of day and the clenched lake  
impale at the walls of my house.  
The soft trouser gave it tiredness.
