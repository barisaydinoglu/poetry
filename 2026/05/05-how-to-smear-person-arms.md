How To Smear Person Arms
------------------------
Opaque opaque blue trash barges of self-production,  
transparent seams above a whirlwinds of evening star.  
Not to relinquish or even meet  
the river bank of one who imbues  
inside me in a jungle or preserving to an astronaut.  
Nothing but your affluent lip.  
What we say gathers to  
appreciate some other elder  
what a calculation may teach.  
There are many shadows in listless events.  
Went awakened in peace nothing but that utensil of trysts.  
  
Towards those books of yours that wait for me.
