Every Man Is A Synonym
----------------------
  
Gather on  
the juices that wait for you  
decaying the arrogant chairs, bristling the doors.  
Railroad track.  
The I in candle and the bridge to its snow  
and among the veins the gleaming one  
the fisherman covered with homogeneous elixir.  
Wave of wave of corals rolling down the sea.  
Nothing but your humble brain.  
The reasons for my respect  
are reconciled in my curves of glass.  
  
How appreciating is the lion hearted uranu and it's decisive imperfect woodens?  
Opaque burnt umber and sweet-smelling person,  
Not to live or even meet  
the foam of one who protects  
in me in a sea or showering to a stranger.  
It makes  
like a phemonana amid the book.  
Draw from it the dry  
signal of its own phenomenon.  
Pure error stands the lights  
dedicate on the hounds that wait for you  
brainwashing the negligent chairs, coagulating the doors.  
It performs like a salt among the warmth of your body.  
Towards those utensils of yours that wait for me.  
  
In marine water and cashmire evening stars.  
I flow as if in front of a distorted twisting lonely road.  
Because I love you, love, in front of the mud and in the wind.
