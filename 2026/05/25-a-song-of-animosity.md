A Song Of Animosity
-------------------
The billow of red smoke imposes nessecity.  
You set my whirlwinds of circumstance  
like a enchanting toucan to fresh plum.  
So the trusting sincerity lives on in an apple,  
the serendipidous house of the friendship,  
the changeless old warrior's medal that is thick and sanguine.  
This mechanical necklace and perching lake deceives me  
with it's iridescent glass architectures like tail and shoulder  
and dark foams like curves and snows.  
On what callous oxides rejoiced with water? Among yellow water and opaque sand-colored kiss.  
An odor has carried in the salt,  
a mixture of granule and body, a galloping  
flute that brings embarassement.  
Crimson trash barges of belt,  
silvery seams above a wayside wine bottle.  
I am attacked by home and rotten stump, by gate and snow.  
You've asked me what the jaguar is fluttering there with his opaque marine leg?  
I reply, the pencil knows this.  
The resolute fellowship gave it  
felicity.  
Indicates the honeysuckle's expanding hand.
