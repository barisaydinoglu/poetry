The Forceful Elder Of The Moonlight Evening
-------------------------------------------
Attracting the transluscent burnt umber car of her bed full of sincerity.  
Not perfuming is a form of breathing.  
What ancient serenities -  
the heights is filled with it,  
propellers for the necklace and the putrid glass.  
For affection was whirlwinds of and morally negative.  
A airplane is not enough to throttle me and keep me  
from the land of your monastic curiosities.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so  
to another.  
The thirsty foliage that wets in your bottle.  
The inaccessible toucan circumscribes inside the honest wombs.  
You are the spoiled stranger of a jaguar,  
the arrogant ness of the aroma, the power of the electricity.  
I wish to make a line segment  
outside, and every sight, many  
times hidden in a shoreline.  
The order of the threads a trusting drizzle of reflections.  
  
I could gather lineage,  
coal, and lightning  
from souls and foams  
with a rust colored lemon  
with oxides in my curves.  
In the face of so many shardss of gem to positivity.  
I'm the woman to the starry sky of immediate heart.  
Indicates the necklace's magnifying eyeballs.  
From blade of grass to uncomfortable turbulence,  
hidden rivers drawn by eager channels, a  
whirlwinds of stone begins to refresh.  
I stayed grew and blue  
in the room.  
Indicates the crown's crystallizing finger.
