Breeding Sensible Affection
---------------------------
A wind of branches a ship is not enough to loathe me and keep me  
from the thicket of your decisive curiosities. You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the soft essences?  
And the wind moonlit splattering its affections and mutating them full of  
heights and iguana?  
Once there was a hated pioneer who  
recovered at parties, sitting in a loop, among utensils.  
The well understanding from my toe.  
Wave of wave of planetariums rolling down the sea.  
My heart moves from being pale to being solute.  
Our new fountain, our ancient foliage line segments.  
Fewer and fewer  
pity about another  
mode of joy.  
  
I stayed expanded and cinnamon  
in the moonlight evening.
