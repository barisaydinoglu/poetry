I Expected Astronauts
---------------------
All books become hearts.  
One aerial option and  
there ought to be a horse of a solute ripple wetting in a region.  
Of your black maternity when you hold out your lip.  
A sea shell -like stench  
I saw how telegraphs are swam  
by the clear momentum.  
My heart moves from being imperalist to being changeless.  
For soul was weak and morally negative.
