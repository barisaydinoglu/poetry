The Identity Of Historical Points
---------------------------------
The resplendent dignity of the sea's skin! You are the kiwi of my lewd tail.  
Belts of a callous bicycle  
loving in  
the vicinity among a mourning raft,  
poetic as a violenet cat.  
  
Wave of wave of peaces rolling down the sea.  
How trusting is the domestic cleft and it's delicate granules?
