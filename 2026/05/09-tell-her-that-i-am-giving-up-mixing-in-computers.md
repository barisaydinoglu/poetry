Tell Her That I Am Giving Up Mixing In Computers

You are the inaccessible pioneer of a elephant,  
the crooked ness of the salt, the power of the lava.  
Neither flower head nor river nor blood colored  
nor sand-colored but transparent.  
The nocturnal light gave it pride.  
Return to the homeland of the faucets.
