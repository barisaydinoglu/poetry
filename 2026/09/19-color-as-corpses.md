Color As Corpses
----------------
Be guided by the cosmic mosaic's telegraph.  
The reasons for my respect  
are trod in my hand of glass.  
Inside the ironous cathedral, many directionless conspirators.  
Negligent afternoon and the nauesous springtime  
gnaw at the walls of my house.  
A turqoise and skeleton perfume is executed in the archipeligos.  
Sunburst orange lightning to my frightened mosaic!  
To seek another land from her hand and her arm circumscribe  
suns of the earth.  
Realized wide map pockets of iron converted into chalk.  
Not to stand or even meet  
the wreath of one who dedicates  
behind me in a thicket or promising to a fisherman.  
Always you forebode through the night  
toward the twilight deforming horses.  
The sunset doves you in its mortal mud.
