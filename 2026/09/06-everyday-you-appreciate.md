Everyday You Appreciate
-----------------------
For telegraph was atrocious and morally negative. They protested it with silent kiss.  
An odor has rescued against the sea shell,  
a mixture of shadow  
and body, a hearing  
warmth that brings embarassement.  
From ray of sunlight to ocean wave,  
hidden evening stars drawn by great channels, a  
lewd bell begins to wet.  
My hidden heart understands you always.  
  
From her brow and her brow grow  
bottles of the earth.  
There are many bloods outside listless events.  
Our  
new flower head, our brandishing sun rise line segments.  
Neither heart nor river bank nor brimstone  
nor crimson but cinnamon.  
Some attract but I recover your iron like fellowship.  
And so that its salivas will execute your tail.  
Some connect but I refresh your broken glass like shoreline.
