The Blood-stained Astronaut Of The Jungle
-----------------------------------------
When you form like sun rise drank by the fire.  
Nothing but your fleeting leg.  
We open the halves of a epiphany and the  
foreboding of oxides gathers into the esoteric moonlight evening.  
What great ships -  
the heights is filled with it,  
phemonanas for the momentum and the melancholy silk.  
Come with me to the noise of flames.  
Outside the inaccessible energy, many rustling circumstances.  
From her mouth and her hand continue  
cashmire cars of the earth.  
From her eyelids and her finger tread  
forests of the earth.  
Multitude of echoes!  
In and out of the sepia the yellow and the deep brown  
you are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the handsome roses?  
And the fog aromatic splattering its bird feathers and disguising them full of  
modern office and oyster?  
Pockets of salt converted into diamond.  
You see breath as irreducable as the fog.  
For a day, maybe twenty-seven,  
I rested under a ocean wave  
at a post office, waiting for the bride to be next to.  
Only nauesous and to a  
lady they take  
on time, too many to count years  
Neither key nor dew nor red  
nor blue but green.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
Honor is gone,  
the subject has stood.  
  
It's a circumscribing cluster of cummerbunds.  
Return to the homeland of the cathedrals.
