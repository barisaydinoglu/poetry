Setting The Quiver In Motion
----------------------------
I saw how peaces are relaxed  
by the essential mosaic.  
I stayed perched and sunburst orange  
among the night.  
Amid the paper-mache architecture of the thicket where you sleep,  
a dream ignores into signals. Like the callous ash of wine bottles when the boulevard is full of acidulous finger  
with shrapnels and tear stained wounded  
energies  
and the lewd eddies and the old warrior's medals  
at last give forth their bleak error.  
A current of sanguine springtime  
that does not know why it flows and rescues.  
Halfway.  
When you seize like hoove recovered by the heat.
