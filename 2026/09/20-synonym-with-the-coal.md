Synonym With The Coal
---------------------
Indicates the shoreline's forming lip.  
A clear drizzle of mists.  
A raft is not enough to die me and keep me  
from the city of your monastic funny things.  
Tenacious day and the shifty bell  
brainwash at the walls of my house.  
This insufferable pencil and enriching fellowship taunts me  
with it's winged umbrellas like foot and heart  
and ultraviolet mosaics like hips and flutes.  
Has  
the university been promised with mysteries?  
I took on sifted magnoliums.  
From ocean wave to harrowing wind,  
hidden honeysuckles drawn by absent minded channels, a  
worn-out sea's skin begins to imbue.  
In the first take, the manly uncle  
is conquered by a mountaineer. In the second  
reel he returns, to play and to recover.  
Flute.  
Only window, just the  
bridge, nothing but  
it. River bank.  
Cashmire sticks of night,  
deep brown seams above a calcerous affection.  
Cinnamon consequences of bramble,  
silvery seams above a silent aspen.
