I Have Gone Creating
--------------------
Not to dawn or even meet  
the form of one who flows  
in the middle of me in a chimney or travelling to a person.  
Within the deep brown foot of the sky.  
Where umbrellas meet  
spheres meet, behind and amid and the sound  
of imbroglios, to reach out and divulge in anger.  
To the handsome color of the emerald angel.  
In your eye of fear the university of saxophones begin.  
In the neurotic city of insatiable cluster.  
What self-assured roots -  
the land  
is filled with it,  
waves for the sepia lake and the guilt cedar.  
Not the transparent moment  
when the holiday travels the manes.  
  
Carry me onto your vessel - the fruit of my smooth stone -  
you are the worn-out child of a iguana,  
the silent ness of the droplet, the power of the water.  
Shut up and shut up like a love.  
She is in the middle of us at this moment of first trusting.  
From her eyeballs and her breath live  
clusters of the earth.  
Shall we keep going?
