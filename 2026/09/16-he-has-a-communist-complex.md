He Has A Communist Complex

So the acerb joy lives on in a banana,  
the blazing house of the cathedral,  
the friendly sea water that is  
fresh and round.  
You, who is like a howl jaguar among the crystallizing of many goddess.  
Of your brimstone honeysuckle when you hold out your foot.  
Panic and sun - springtimes of confusion.  
The lashed ribbon that awakens in your starry sky.  
A heart and a eye  
showering the heights.  
And you drowned in the confusion and wetted a crushing wound.
