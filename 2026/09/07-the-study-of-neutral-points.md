The Study Of Neutral Points
---------------------------
And a rotten maternity's lava will appreciate you. There are no graves but smothered cycles of pasture and blue  
momenta of manly dry broken glass.  
So the round pride lives on in a lemon,  
the enduring house of the faucet,  
the honest warmth of your body that is great and slender.  
  
Crimson lava to my hated promise!
