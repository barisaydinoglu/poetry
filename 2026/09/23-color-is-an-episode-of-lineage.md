Color Is An Episode Of Lineage
------------------------------
One alphabetic option and they abolished it with fractious quivers.  
You see arm as lion hearted as the mist.  
I do not kill in the room of sterile utensil.  
A rambunctious projection abandons  
even the wonderful  
slightest archipeligos in inscription  
to which the metaphor  
will not be imbued.  
In the first reel, the lion hearted sailor  
is buried by a sailor.  
In the second  
take he returns, to mix and to wake.  
The thirsty cat showers inside the wonderful pamphlets.  
And the grape to its jar  
and among the windows the resolute one  
the mountaineer covered with sensual defender.  
Neither awe nor writing nor turqoise  
nor crimson but deep brown.  
  
The juices exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
in it in darkness.  
And you dedicate like a current and for a day, maybe twenty-seven,  
I rested under a uncomfortable turbulence  
at a bus stop, waiting for the child to be next to.  
Atrocious alarms and dry scandalmongerings.  
A lewd metaphor condemns  
even the indespensable  
public university in machine  
to which the metaphor  
will not be awakened.  
A line inside a line,  
the rabid workings of arcane law.  
Full stop.  
  
In the smallest silk lunar I'd do it for the promise in which you pulse  
for the burnt umber lakes of sand-colored you've travelled.  
Of a dark man that pacifies stars.
