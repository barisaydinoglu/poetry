The Motionless Stain
--------------------
For stalks of cattail was difficult and morally neutral.  
Your peace is a necklace  
filled with bitten femininity.  
The weak sun that grows in your rose.  
Conversations of lunars, the recitation  
of manes we call friendly flower.  
Only sea's skin, just the  
phemonana, nothing but  
it. Movie.  
What sweet-smelling maps -  
the modern office is filled with it,  
autumns for the lighthouse and the hollow silk.  
Enrich on the noises that wait for you  
smearing the wounded chairs, gnawing the doors.
