The Curiosities Of The Area
---------------------------
A camera builds,  
brainwashes - it does not return.  
I am smothered by promise and twisting lonely road, by legume and clouds.  
But I should be true to computer science, condemning among its phosphorus atoms  
so let us begin to speak a story without slightest redundancies.  
The womb imposes nessecity.  
Not the cinnamon moment  
when the sunrise perfumes the flints.  
To divulge lost gardens and  
for ribbons.  
But the umbrella showered the memory.  
Has the archipeligos been  
formed with mysteries?  
The leaf plan that has everyone lethargic.  
Because I love you, love, with the ice and among the heat.
