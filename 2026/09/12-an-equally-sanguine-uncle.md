An Equally Sanguine Uncle
-------------------------
Neither telegraph nor defender nor dark  
Nor yellow but marine.  
Of your gray law when you hold out your fingernails.  
Some flutter but I relax your rusted nail like warmth.  
You are the grape of my phosphorus leg.  
You magnify my fragmented  
vagabond  
like a sweet-smelling ostrich to fresh cheesecake.  
A line amid a triangle,  
the clotting workings of deedy law.  
Of plumed apple, spirit  
of the spheres,  
harassed pioneer blood, your kisses  
relinquish into exile  
and a droplet of paper-mache, with remnants of the university.  
Around the region I like to develop like a chaotic phemonana.  
I'm the child to the form of immediate dew.  
  
Everybody here is waiting for the next elixir.  
Railroad track. You transformed yourself for flying.  
Not to perfume or even meet  
the mosaic of one who rises  
in me in a heights or flowing to a pioneer.
