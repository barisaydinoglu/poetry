A Self-assured Substance
------------------------
I drink as if outside a shifty oblivion.  
The vertical sea's skin gave it love.  
In the smallest marble maternity as if to gnaw or appreciate or bristle.  
Pockets of rusted nail converted into marble.  
Of soft grape, spirit  
of the awes,  
condemned  
gentleman blood, your kisses  
protect into exile  
and a droplet of ivory, with remnants of the sea.  
My heart is filled with sincerity like a diamond bird feather.  
  
Tiredness is gone, the subject has enchanted.  
Stars in the sky of a chained troubled sea's skin.  
The fire acerb imbroglios are deceived. The electric dignity of the ribbon!  
In your finger of confusion the archipeligos of smooth stones transform.
