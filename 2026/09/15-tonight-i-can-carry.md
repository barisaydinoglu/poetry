Tonight I Can Carry
-------------------
Vein of a wiped putrid nature.  
The child smiles at the lady  
but the stranger does not smile  
when he looks at the ostrich fisherman  
and the bitten ocean.  
It mingles like a foliage amid the wave.  
In your eye of faltering the night begins to dream of wetting.  
One overtone option and opaque yellow and musical elder,  
the reasons for my respect  
are wetted in my leg of gold.  
Not recovering is a form of beginning.  
I salute your free cheesecake  
and envy your warm pride.  
What is this image but a memory compounded of its grapes?  
  
All warmths of your body become salts.  
A chorus of ostriches at afternoon un  
continued un soddened  
comes to a halt before a bed.
