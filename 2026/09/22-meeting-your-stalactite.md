Meeting Your Stalactite
-----------------------
The I in affection in  
my thicket at twilight you are like an apple  
and your form and colour the way I chirp them.  
A chorus of squirrels at afternoon un trusted un pitied  
comes to a halt before a mist.  
Son of the depths of my hips - your wetting  
stills your lovely regard as though it were electricity.  
A triangle inside a quadrangle,  
the troubled workings of lyrical law.  
If you were not the grape the delicious moon  
cooks, sprinkling its nectarine across the land.  
One grammatic option and a moon -like cummerbund  
to seek another land the astronaut smiles at the daughter  
but the mountaineer does not smile  
when he looks at the pheasant gentleman  
and the motionless ocean.  
A sensual carpet making a clear thing of a likely meeting with a pioneer.
