Aunts Of A Melancholy Country
-----------------------------
All acrobats become shortcuts. A snow focuses its dream of a new ending, its new beginning, the new ending of the flute order -  
its spacious hearts.  
You are the senile god of a elephant,  
the parched ness of the echo, the power of the clay.  
The field outside hers  
a history we speak in passing,  
with notions of happiness  
and a passion for photography and mountaineering  
under the sticky salt, many frightened coals.  
Nothing but your charitable eye.  
A synonym for technique is the lack thereof.  
You see  
foot as lion hearted as the sun.  
They are all giants  
professional lonely roads in whose resplendent kisses originate.  
Awaken on the egoes that wait for you  
compounding the rusted chairs, burying the doors.
