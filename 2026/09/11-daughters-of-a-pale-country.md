Daughters Of A Pale Country
---------------------------
And you replaced in the agony and loved a puncturing wall.  
A hopeful wood paneling making a monastic thing of a probable meeting with a man.  
Cordial empire. The line functions to mingle an architecture  
to its architecture.  
For a day, maybe  
thousand,  
I rested under  
a ray  
of sunlight  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the god to be behind.  
Be guided by the trusting sea's skin's momentum.  
And you gather like a mirror and where pullulations meet  
writings meet, with and outside and the sound  
of self-productions, to reach out and tread in anger.  
And outside my hammock, during the midnight, I woke up naked  
and full of joy.
