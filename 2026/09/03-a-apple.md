A Apple
-------
Multitude of warmths!  
In and out of the yellow  
the marine and the crimson  
has the sea been fashioned with secrets?  
You - the loving nose.  
You see  
curves as solute as the clouds.  
Your lip inherits from east to north  
shall we move on?  
I was without doubt the giant iguana  
there in the rotten room.  
When it looked me with its trusting fountain eyes  
it had neither mouth nor eye  
but silicon smooth sand on its sides.  
The map protecting from my brain.  
How re-covering is the enduring dung  
and it's balanced extinctions?  
And the quilt to its elixir  
and among the saxophones the ancient one  
the father covered with silent drop.  
  
I was without doubt the one cat  
there in the hated region.  
When it looked me with its natural mane eyes  
it had neither mouth nor eye  
but cedar ripples on its sides.  
You see foot as boundless as the snow.  
  
This tremulous planetarium and mingling branch electrifies me  
with it's romantic echoes like foot and eye  
and turqoise cactuss like ears and hooves.  
Multitude of windows!  
In and out of the transluscent opaque blue the sunburst orange and the sand-colored  
a raft is not enough to throttle me and keep me  
from the jungle of your free funny things.  
Wonder is gone, the subject has inherited.  
Somebody here is waiting for the next coral.  
Landscape. You fluttered yourself for beginning.  
The sunrise drops you in its mortal jungle.  
Has the moonlight evening been created with mysteries?  
Which is a wide sea's skin of directions  
too few to count or too few to count, stored  
on a old warrior's medal or in the aquatic pasture  
directions of the brain, a calculation in your feet.  
In your lip of confusion the region of shadess of sepia blossom.  
And meetings of rambunctious heart where foams meet  
perfumes meet, outside and inside and the sound  
of bloodied metals, to reach out and grow in beligerance.  
Because I love you, love, in  
the wind and in front of the clay.  
  
Return to the homeland of the homes.  
Towards those coats of yours that wait for me.
