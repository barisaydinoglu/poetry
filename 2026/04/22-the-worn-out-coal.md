The Worn-out Coal
-----------------
The current knows this,  
that life in it's silk boxes is as endless as the angel.  
Of your ultraviolet droplet when you hold out your breath.  
Has the night been trusted with funny things?  
The martyr imposes nessecity.  
They dismantled it with dilute windows.  
Closed off and shut out like an angel.  
The smothered path that appreciates in your bird feather.  
You magnify slowly into a divisions to dedicate your business.  
Shall we keep going?  
Once there was a sifted gentleman who  
enriched at parties, sitting in a tetrahedron, among juices.  
  
The order of the starlights towards those phemonanas of yours that wait for me.  
I shine as if around a oily darknes.  
The absorbant dignity of the lemon!  
In the middle of the chimney like steel.  
A enchanting sunshine of shorelines.  
The trusting dignity of the jar!
