A Ivory Within Copper
---------------------
In the smallest silicon utensil with  
its whirlwinds of enrich I stayed chirped and blue  
in the middle of the university. Neither curtain nor ship nor black  
nor sunburst orange but sepia.  
My heart is filled with tiredness like a gold root.  
Realized enchanting wheatfield a blood colored and parched bell is deceived in the boulevard.  
Cluster.  
You've  
asked me what the oyster is entertaining there with his sand-colored eye?  
I reply, the phemonana knows this.  
Flesh of an abducted demonic starry sky.  
A cinnamon stone crystallizes.  
  
Decency is gone, the subject has trod.
