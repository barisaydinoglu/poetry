A Form To Awaken The Suns You Discover
--------------------------------------
Green puberties of pigeon hole,  
blue seams above a spoiled rose.  
Insufferable day and the guilt femininity  
drop at the walls of my house.  
Around the sea I like to seize like a lonely quilt.  
Always you freeze through the lunchtime  
toward the afternoon mourning promises.  
A line segment in a quadrangle,  
the bleak workings of brandishing law.  
The deedy dignity of the peace!  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
Where moons meet  
warmths meet, behind and with and the sound  
of massacres, to reach out and perform in illusion.  
  
A moonlit wind of rivers.  
And you'll  
ask why doesn't his poetry  
perfume of faucets and currents  
and the solute telegraphs of his native land?  
Invade me and let my substance light.  
It's a setting writing of roosters.  
Only hated and to a  
bride they take on time, too few to count years  
and meetings of barbaous breath in your arm of rejecting the heights begins to dream of pulsing.
