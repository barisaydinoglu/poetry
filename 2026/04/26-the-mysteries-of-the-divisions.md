The Mysteries Of The Divisions
------------------------------
It was the holiday of the bird.  
I wish to make a loop  
behind, and every abstraction, many  
times hidden in a miracle.  
To the esoteric color of the gem foliage.  
I wish to make a loop  
next to, and every meaning, many  
times hidden in a landscape.  
Around the modern office I like to imbue like a disintered pullulation.  
  
It was the twilight of the bird.  
From uncomfortable turbulence to palm tree leaf,  
hidden jars drawn by lovely channels, a  
harsh wheatfield begins to awaken.  
Directionless weather, negligent lights like the maternity.  
A moon -like invasion  
like the hairy salt of flints  
the imperalist autumn that rescues in your grace.  
Neither flint nor kiss nor opaque gray  
nor sand-colored but sunburst orange.  
Shall we set forth?  
  
I saw how droplets are reflected  
by the equinoctial thread.
