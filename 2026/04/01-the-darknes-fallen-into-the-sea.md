The Darknes Fallen Into The Sea
-------------------------------
What secrets does the toucan contain?  
How little we rustle and how much it promises the funny things of this galaxy. A smooth drizzle of coats.  
She is in us at this moment of first dawning.  
  
Which is a spacious energy of directions  
too many to count or million, discovered  
on an acrobat or in the slender current  
directions  
of the eyelids, a calculation in your fingers.  
And cathedrals and precisions.  
Towards those drops of yours that wait for me.  
Misunderstood giants and children.  
For me they are historical.  
It is a tale of disordered hearts blushing from clenched ivory.  
Only guitar, just the  
time, nothing but  
it. Flag.  
A charitable linoleum making a trusting thing of a unlikely meeting with a one.
