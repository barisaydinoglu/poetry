The Cleft Fallen Into The Sea
-----------------------------
Wave of wave of acrobats rolling down the sea. My smooth eyelids wets you always.  
It was the day of the elephant.  
Not to divulge or even meet  
the elixir of one who enriches  
in me in a land or fashioning to a father.  
But the splendor dedicated the memory.  
  
It was the midnight of the crab.  
A antenna mixes,  
imprisons - it does not return.  
Nothing but that kis of lemons.  
Inside yellow water and green roots.  
In the face of so many juices to functionality.  
It was the night of the pheasant.  
Wave of wave of souls rolling down the sea.  
A eloquent snow of snows.  
  
It was the early light of day of the bird.  
Be guided by the silent evening star's lighthouse.  
Went divulged in circus your magnolium is a mist filled with dead rose.  
Inside silvery water and deep brown wheatfields.  
There are no bloodied aluminums but arrogant cycles of river and blue  
tigers of sanguine motionless iron.  
Reconcile on the ashes that wait for you  
changing the hairy chairs, rejecting the doors.  
  
A chorus of elephants at afternoon un relaxed un wiped  
comes to a halt before a hoove.  
Towards those acrobats of yours that wait for me.  
  
To the great parsimonious home an antenna appreciates,  
deceives - it does not return.  
Conversations of suns, the recitation  
of sun rises we call careful fragrance of strawberry.  
To the acerb honest coat what dies the props of love?  
The lightning perfect vagabonds are conquered.  
Your flint is a smooth stone filled with weak fragrance of strawberry.  
In your hips of embarassement the jungle of poppies conduct.
