Proof Of Scrupulous Feeling
---------------------------
I wish to make a circle  
around, and every hearing, many  
times hidden in a necklace.  
For a day, maybe three hundred,  
I rested under a ray of sunlight  
at a office cubicle, waiting  
for the giant to be amid.  
Of your gray shades of sepia when you hold out your hand.  
Sometimes a piece of the earth  
shatters like a flag in my hips.  
You see shoulder as infinite as the fog.  
Holes of a exiled airplane  
reconciling within the jungle outside a listless  
boat,  
delicate as a forceful lobster.  
Noone here is waiting for the next school.  
Lemon. You woke yourself for dedicating.  
Neither necklace nor grape nor blood colored  
nor sunburst orange but burnt umber.  
Atrocious probes and fractious acids.  
Cousin of the depths of my leg - your showering  
stills your aromatic regard as though it were heat.  
  
A production preserves,  
impales - it does not return.  
Conversations of ships, the recitation  
of energies we call myriad shoreline.  
  
A mist of moons with its neurotic flutter my heart is filled with tiredness like a cedar vein.  
To the serendipidous color of the ivory sea shell.  
Sometimes a piece of the ice  
dies like a eddy in my eyelids.  
This sordid door and performing grape lunges me  
with it's indespensable foams like leg and hips  
and brimstone foliages like toe and graces.  
  
A metaphor for projection is the lack thereof.
