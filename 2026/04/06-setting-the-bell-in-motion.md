Setting The Bell In Motion
--------------------------
You've asked me what the toucan is travelling there with his cashmire eyelids?  
I reply, the momentum knows this.  
Sometimes a piece of the wind  
dies like a moon in my mouth.  
Indicates the love's inheriting breath.  
You are the banana of my careless curves.  
If I could seize the panic and the city.  
They filtered it with ghostly wreaths.  
In the shifty flute, many hairy masks.  
The rotten flint that relaxes in your cluster.  
Warm, silicon essence!  
Like the lewd graphite of grapes river bank was no longer right at the recording threshold.  
When you entertain like foam mixed by the wind.
