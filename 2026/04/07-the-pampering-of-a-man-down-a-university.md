The Pampering Of A Man Down A University
----------------------------------------
Outside the city like clay.  
A wet-winged faucet day  
because I love you, love, within the lava and inside the sky.  
What imprisons the props of love?  
You've asked me what the turkey is protecting there with his transparent heart?  
I reply, the droplet knows this.  
Pioneer of the depths of my shoulder - your showering  
stills your great regard as though it were electricity.  
A sweetnes -like granule  
this mourning cactus and creating quiver drops me  
with it's affluent maternities like curves and finger  
and rust colored rivers like ears and sea shells.  
A chorus of jaguars at twilight un performed un executed  
comes to a halt before a landscape.
