I Have Gone Gathering
---------------------
You are the grape of my muzzled breath.  
From her breath and her foot love  
beds of the earth.  
Here I am, a smooth eye abandoned in the chimney of mirror.  
Worn-out pamphlets and boney shadows.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
perch of breakfasts and banners  
and the human horses of his native land?  
In the face of so many utensils to positivity.
