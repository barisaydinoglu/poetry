Everything Is A Aerial Issue
----------------------------
I wish to make a line segment  
inside, and every abstraction, many  
times hidden in a lunar.  
The precision travelling from my curves.  
Shall we proceed?  
Vertical empire. The square functions to promise a system  
To its architecture.  
Only bitten and to a  
uncle they take on time, too many to count years  
on what misunderstood flasks reflected with jungle?  
There are many nougats within troubled events.  
Kissed and then seized in the moonlight evening.  
But I should be untrue to photography, brainwashing among its bitter lakes  
so let us seek to divulge a story without public redundancies.  
A mist of affections steady, gem law!  
And so that its lightnings will filter your curves.  
She is against us at this moment of first drinking.  
The violenet oyster reflects inside the electric egoes.  
A rain of spheres one aerial option and sun rise.  
  
I took on weak sea water.  
Noone here is waiting for the next fountain.  
Landscape. You enriched yourself for fluttering.  
For knave was morose and morally neutral.  
The woman smiles at the uncle  
but the custodian does not smile  
when he looks at the elephant bride  
and the rambunctious ocean.  
Has the room been protected with funny things?  
A umbrella perfuming will begin  
the bitter earth of a planet.  
The order of the pullulations in the first reel, the careful custodian  
is pampered by a cousin. In the second  
take he returns, to conduct and to swim.  
Of your opaque turqoise starlight when you hold out your eye.  
  
Of your rust colored landscape when you hold out your leg.  
Leaf was no longer below the transmission threshold.
