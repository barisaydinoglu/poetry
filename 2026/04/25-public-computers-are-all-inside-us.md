Public Computers Are All Inside Us

And within my hammock, during the midnight, I woke up naked  
and full of joy.  
A current of moonlit praise  
that does not know why it flows and sets.  
Wave of wave of candles rolling down the sea.  
Bitten sunset and the callous lunar  
conquer at the walls of my house.  
And so that its moldy bananas will smother your toe.  
You, who is like a wounded soldier bird among the enriching of many god.  
The natural breakfast gave it tiredness.
