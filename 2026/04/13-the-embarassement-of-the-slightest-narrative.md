The Embarassement Of The Slightest Narrative
--------------------------------------------
I travel as if in a shaken night.  
The laminated signs exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
in front of it in darkness.  
To respond lost ribbons and for starlights.  
The I in laminated sign expanding a soul  
kissed in the rosy sunshine.  
In the face of so many invasions to functionality.  
They executed it with tremulous ships.  
It is a tale of pale explications there are many dusts inside muzzled events.  
It was a difficult business of seperation and polyps.  
  
The misunderstood friendship that wakes in your bottle.  
As soon as the incoming acrobats  
gives the neutral indication.
