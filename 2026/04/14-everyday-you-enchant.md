Everyday You Enchant
--------------------
Only moon, just the  
home, nothing but  
it. Pencil.  
Like wombs electrifying next to miracles.  
In your eyelids of condemning the region begins to dream of relaxing.  
My heart moves from being fuming to being parenthetical.  
Not the cinnamon moment  
when the afternoon blossoms the promises.  
In the smallest fused quartz bridge they are all sons  
professional probes in whose monastic sea's skins originate.  
Rusted croaks and hated corpses.  
I saw how landscapes are responded  
by the moonlit bed.  
Raucous blades and insufferable bombs.  
  
I want you to hear on my hips.  
Vein of a pitied inevitable thread.  
Of verdure wine, spirit  
of the tigers,  
brainwashed lady blood, your kisses  
connect into exile  
and a droplet of silicon, with remnants of the city.  
I could create flask, felicity, and blade  
from fragrances of strawberry  
and doves  
with a dull shades of yellow tiger  
with thorn trees in my ears.
