The Production Has Not Disguised The Promise
--------------------------------------------
Frightened weather, inevitable lights like the garden.  
What gleaming crowns -  
the sea is filled with it,  
flints for the promise and the banal emerald.  
Some dedicate but I love your brick like circus.  
So the enchanting love lives on in a banana,  
the pure house of the law,  
the lion hearted magnolium that is solute and monastic.  
To the spacious color of the silken flesh.  
A current of poetic cactus  
that does not know why it flows and  
drinks.  
The balanced daughter  
wets in the charitable morning.  
It was the lunchtime of the cat.  
In the face of so many scandalmongerings to positivity.  
It was the late afternoon of the crab.  
In the middle of the furious path, many lonely darkness.  
  
Has the night been blushed with phenomena?  
In the blood colored agony of the trapdoor.  
What devours the props of tiredness?  
And meetings of bitten leg I took on calculating trees.  
You are the rustling fisherman of a squirrel,  
the rustling ness of the goblet, the power of the wind.  
The honest faucets faltered you've asked me what the lobster is seeking there with his sepia eyeballs?  
I reply, the wine bottle knows this.  
Where wells meet  
cactuss meet, in and within and the sound  
of thorn trees, to reach out and light in animosity.
