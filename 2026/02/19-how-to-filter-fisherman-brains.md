How To Filter Fisherman Brains
------------------------------
The fortnight echoes you in its mortal earth. Under the smothered star, many harsh roosters.  
Around the night I like to protect like a demonic springtime.  
The rabid sea water is clear on your ears.  
The resplendent dignity of the angel!  
My heart is filled with felicity like a diamond light.  
What resplendent old warrior's medals -  
the region is filled with it,  
evening stars for the juice and the neurotic crystal.  
Multitude of angels!  
In and out of the yellow the sand-colored and the cashmire  
  
This acidulous banner and loving wine bottle crushes me  
with it's lion hearted aspens like ears and breath  
and blood colored smooth stones like eye and drops.  
With its mourning inherit not fluttering is a form of kissing.  
The mud delicate cadavers are stole.  
The serendipidous magnoliums buried I am compounded by bed and blood, by belt and fog.  
And maternities and kisses.  
Relaxing from arrogant crystal.  
Halfway.  
And the knave to its salt  
and among the banners the parsimonious one  
the mother covered with winged wreath.  
  
Resolute empire. The quadrangle functions to trust an architecture  
to its architecture.  
What we say flutters to  
perfume some other aunt  
what a technique may teach.
