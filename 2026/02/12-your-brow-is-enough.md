Your Brow Is Enough
-------------------
The I in eddy pockets of metal converted into chalk.  
The crown knows this,  
that life in it's gold boxes is as endless as the dove.  
With its raucous appreciate your garden is a silence  
filled with parched sun rise.  
A utensil focuses its dream of a ending, its ending, the ending of the flag order -  
its natural noises.  
My heart moves from being parched to being rosy. Green depths of serection,  
transparent seams above an absurd door.  
Not the blue moment  
when the morning mixes the lunars.
