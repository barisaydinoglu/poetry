Everything Is A Individual Issue
--------------------------------
In the smallest saphire serenity of sweet-smelling wine, spirit  
of the books,  
struck stranger blood, your kisses  
hear into exile  
and a droplet of cedar, with remnants of the university.  
As soon as the incoming cathedrals  
gives the algorithmic indication.  
You continue slowly into a land to connect your business.  
Everything misunderstood with hopeful voices, the salt of the promise  
and piles of infinite bread amid day.  
Misunderstood ladies and cousins.  
For me they are individual.  
The astronaut smiles at the fisherman  
but the stranger does not smile  
when he looks at the iguana bride  
and the difficult ocean.  
  
Neither ribbon nor circus nor turqoise  
nor deep brown but crimson.  
With its communist mix my deedy breath carries you always.  
Blood-stained billows of black smoke and molested deaths.  
On what burned-out holes wetted with electricity?  
A dead computer pampers  
even the enchanting  
public region in study  
to which the metaphor  
will not be entertained.  
And serenities and flints.
