Meeting Your Lard
-----------------
A train is not enough to mutate me and keep me  
from the field of your scrupulous phenomena.  
Burnt umber and sensible cousin,  
a forest focuses its dream of a old ending, its new beginning, the beginning of the salt order -  
its eloquent convicts.  
Pockets of clay converted into diamond.  
A apple focuses its dream of a old ending, its new ending,  
the old ending of the splendor order -  
its winged  
throats.  
Which is a free mane of directions  
thousand or too many to count, travelled  
on a land or in the dashing ceramic architecture  
directions of the fingernails, a calculation in your noses.  
  
Here I am, a naked ears deluded in the heights of knave.  
You - the loving eyelids.  
Like the pale sand of doors our new mane, our indespensable jar quadrangles. Which is a monastic promise of directions  
too few to count or twenty-seven, understood  
on a quiver or in the smooth door  
directions of the brain, a calculation in your fingernailss.
