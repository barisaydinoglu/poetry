Setting The Writing In Motion
-----------------------------
The river bank circumscribing from my breath.  
A camera for inscription is the lack thereof.  
With the dark fear of the legless horse.  
I was without doubt the person jaguar  
there in the muzzled chimney.  
When it looked me with its poetic cactus eyes  
it had neither mouth nor leg  
but diamond sea shells on its sides.  
Pockets of aluminum converted into bolt of silken.  
Around the region I like to expand like a raucous maternity.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
What overflows the props of felicity?  
  
On what explosive trashes heard with sky?  
I took on thirsty bird feathers.  
They are all mothers  
professional vagabonds in whose myriad silences originate.  
Here I am, a comfortable leg fell in the land of sun.  
Some make but I relinquish your brick like ribbon.  
Circumscribing a tryst  
breathed in the full clouds.  
One individual option and not to rustle or even meet  
the silvery lake of one who gathers  
in me in a night or flying to a mother.  
Inside the black panic of the grave.  
  
Not the yellow moment  
when the twilight dawns the laws.  
Your hips relaxes from west to east  
  
All defenders become jackals.
