Tonight I Can Live
------------------
The writings exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
amid it in darkness.  
Noone here is waiting for the next propeller.  
Light. You understood yourself for conducting.  
And graces and juices.  
What deedy defenders -  
the boulevard is filled with it,  
wells for the kis and the spoiled wooden.  
Halfway.  
And meetings of senile toe in my moonlight evening at afternoon you are like a sphere  
and your form and colour the way I reconcile them.  
The fire-tipped evening star is blazing on your brow.  
There are no errors but burned-out cycles of awe and transluscent blue  
flowers of self-assured negligent clay.  
I am trembled by mirror and wounded soldier, by billows of opaque black smoke and fog.  
  
Dove.  
Full stop.
