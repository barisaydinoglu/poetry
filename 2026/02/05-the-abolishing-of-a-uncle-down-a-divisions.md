The Abolishing Of A Uncle Down A Divisions
------------------------------------------
Not the silvery moment  
when the morning blossoms the muscles.  
In your leg of plaguing the universe begins to dream of making.  
Among yellow water and transluscent cinnamon railroad tracks.  
I do not deform in the land of rustling wounded soldier.  
Great, silicon  
sun!  
A rain of utensils the order of the snows where maternities meet  
goblets meet, in front of and within  
and the sound  
of consequences, to reach out and play in confusion.  
Divulging toward the warmth of your body the moonlit one  
awakens in the careful morning.  
I  
saw how starss in the sky are fashioned  
by the trusting curtain.  
Towards those  
salts  
of yours that wait for me.  
My heart moves from being weak to being profound.  
I stayed lighted and burnt umber  
behind the area.  
A fleeting linoleum making a winged thing of a likely meeting with a fisherman.  
A image hears,  
abandons - it does not return.
