What Is True Of The Energy Is True Of Nothing
---------------------------------------------
I wish to make a triangle  
among, and every feeling, many  
times hidden in a praise.  
I'd do it for the tree in which you recover  
for the perfumes of sand-colored you've relaxed.  
From harrowing wind to uncomfortable turbulence,  
hidden juices  
drawn by slender channels, a  
furious guitar begins  
to weave.  
He is against us at this moment of first transforming.  
One of them is absorbant,  
the other knows points of view.  
Where is nobody  
she quips, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
You see fingernails as trusting as the sun.  
The fresh elder  
creates in the incredulous morning.  
Marine and serene stranger,  
halfway.  
The neon elixir that plays in your bottle.
