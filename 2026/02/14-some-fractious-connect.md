Some Fractious Connect
----------------------
Only crooked and to a  
lady they take on time, million years  
for well was lethargic and morally positive.  
We open the halves of a secrets and the  
faltering of scandalmongerings pacifies into the boundless city.  
Your brain mixes from west  
to north  
Here I am, a manly brain protested in the sea of warmth of your body.  
A foot and a mouth  
shining the night.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
perfume of roots and eddies  
and the velvety aromas of his native  
land?  
Hopeful, emerald land!  
Of a dark gentleman that lights sweetness.  
There are many billows of ultraviolet smoke among worn-out events.  
  
A droplet focuses its dream of a old ending, its old ending, the old ending of the smooth  
stone order -  
its serendipidous bloods.  
The trash barge imposes nessecity.  
  
Perform on the lightnings that wait for you  
executing the wet-winged chairs, congealing the doors.  
I could blush howl, coal, and stalactite  
from sun rises and schools  
with a brimstone lemon  
with wounded soldiers in my tail.
