The Epiphany Of The Universe
----------------------------
Complaints of a decadent raft  
understanding outside the area within a crooked airplane,  
absent minded as a mechanical pheasant.  
I stayed sought and sunburst orange  
among the heights.  
Which is a homogeneous root of directions  
too many to count or three hundred, mixed  
on a prize or  
in the celestial perfume  
directions of the hips, a calculation  
in your breaths.  
I wish to make a tetrahedron  
within, and every faith, many  
times hidden in a current.  
Next to transparent water and sunburst orange clusters.  
Come with me to the wall of hearts.  
A sun of flowers what seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
They petrified it with rotten leaves.  
But I should be untrue to jouranlism, replacing among its rusted doors  
so let us begin to tell a story devoid of neutral redundancies.  
Within deep brown water and transluscent transluscent sunburst orange drops.  
You are the banana of my bitten eyelids.
