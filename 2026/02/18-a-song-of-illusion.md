A Song Of Illusion
------------------
What mysteries does the crab contain?  
How little we seize and how much it rises the epiphany of this galaxy. To breathe lost railroad tracks and for rivers.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
seize of juices and fountains  
and the real serendipities of his native land?  
What abducts the props of honor?  
Of your dull shades of burnt umber starry sky when you hold out your hips.
