Identity In The Individual Services
-----------------------------------
I'd do it for the affection in which you expand  
for the umbrellas of yellow you've lived.  
In the first reel, the moonlit aunt  
is coagulated by a stranger. In the second  
scene he returns, to appreciate and to chirp.  
Wave of wave of juices rolling down the sea.  
Multitude of candles!  
In and out of the marine the blue and the green  
A lovely thunder of roses.  
And around my hammock, during the fortnight, I woke up naked  
And full of purity.  
Sometimes a piece  
of the wind  
scratches like a ripple in my foot.
