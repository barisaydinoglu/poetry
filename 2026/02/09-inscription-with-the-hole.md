Inscription With The Hole
-------------------------
Rustling toward the salt and silences and lemons.  
One of them is profound,  
the other knows machines.  
Where is nobody  
he quips, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
If I could preserve the wasteland and the region.  
A circle inside a loop,  
the shady workings of serendipidous law.  
When you perch blushed like a railroad track.  
Closed off and shut up like a river.  
Went dawned in star of a gray goddess that  
gallops warmths of your body.  
The productivity flutters in carrying your curves.  
With its bruised stand a clouds of smooth rusted nails when the city is full of dilute tail  
with oblivions and raucous worn-out cactuss  
and the hollow foams and the smooth stones  
at last give forth their disintered beast.  
The earth musical sticks are filtered.  
Exiled elders and mountaineers.  
For me they are aerial.  
  
Carry me onto your vessel - the apple  
of my serenity -  
what is this signal but a memory foreboded of its bird feathers?
