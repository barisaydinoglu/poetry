The Abandoning Of A Stranger Down A Heights
-------------------------------------------
Acidulous elders and custodians.  
For me they are technical.  
Amid the key of the vicinity where you sleep,  
a dream protests into languages.  
A projection for signal is the lack thereof.  
A chorus of ostriches at holiday un entertained un fainted  
comes to a halt before a drop.  
Everything frightened with solute voices, the salt of the aroma  
and piles of naked bread inside fortnight.  
Always you bury through the fortnight  
toward the holiday crushing forms.  
Wave of wave of lakes rolling down  
the sea.  
Sometimes a piece of the lava  
passes like a river in my heart.
