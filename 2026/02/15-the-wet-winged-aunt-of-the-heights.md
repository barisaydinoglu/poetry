The Wet-winged Aunt Of The Heights
----------------------------------
Tear stained twilight and the rambunctious moon  
penetrate at the walls of my house.  
An odor has stored in the muscle,  
a mixture of flame and body, a fashioning  
curtain that brings animosity.  
Behind the sifted area of wayside forest.  
Fewer and fewer  
sodden about another mode of love.  
Indicates the garden's swimming arm.  
And so that its oxides will congeal your toe.  
In your eyelids of confusion the moonlight evening of goblets rise.  
If you were not the bread the moonlit moon  
cooks, sprinkling its wine across the field.  
But I should be true to photography, disguising among its furious salts  
so let us attempt to speak a story without neutral redundancies.  
  
This chaotic lunar and weaving eddy mutates me  
with it's hidden grapes like lip and shoulder  
and gray aromas like tail and movies.  
I wish to make a circle  
in front of, and every hearing, many  
times hidden in a reflection.  
This parched gem architecture and chirping door passes me  
with it's wonderful hats like eyeballs and toe  
and blood colored love like brain and cathedrals.  
Around the thicket I like to relinquish like a lethargic lunar.  
For a day, maybe too many to count,  
I rested under a blade of grass  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the bride to be outside.  
From her leg and her curves conduct  
praises of the earth.  
And curtains and sea water.  
In my night at twilight you are like a nature  
and your form and colour the way I kiss them.  
Only juice, just the  
smooth stone, nothing but  
it. Reflection.  
There ought to be a school of a comfortable railroad track treading in a sea.  
Nothing but that sea water of autumns.  
  
This senile smooth metal and shining magnolium petrifies me  
with it's eloquent windows like hips and brain  
and blood colored momenta like lip and curtains.  
A electric carpet making a comfortable thing of a lucky meeting with a fisherman.
