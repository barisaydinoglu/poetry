The City Fallen Into The Sea
----------------------------
Went recovered in mosaic we get the abstraction  
they must lots to grow  
To each other  
or perhaps nothing but lampreys.  
Perhaps they are not wiped.  
And the sphere to its banner  
and among the fragrances of strawberry the somber one  
the mother covered with sensible sun rise.
