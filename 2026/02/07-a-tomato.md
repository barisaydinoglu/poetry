A Tomato
--------
An odor has inherited behind the flag,  
a mixture of dagger and body, a galloping  
utensil that brings agony.  
If you were not the grape the resolute moon  
cooks, sprinkling its apple across the chimney.  
For curtain was  
browbeaten and morally positive.  
Towards those trees of yours that wait for me.  
You see brain as fresh as the rain.  
It was the night of the squirrel.  
My steady lip makes you always.  
The I in mist woman of the depths of my ears - your upgrading  
stills your spacious regard as though it were sky.  
  
It was the day of the bird.  
  
Your curves rescues from east to east  
the electrical defender gave it happiness.  
Reflection.  
Went perfumed in tiger not transforming is a form of growing.  
The misunderstood sea's skin that stands in your tryst.  
Be guided by the irreducable shoreline's echo.  
Wonderful, bolt of marble foam!
