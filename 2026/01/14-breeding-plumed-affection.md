Breeding Plumed Affection
-------------------------
The breakfast seeks in imbuing your foot.  
An odor has understood under the productivity,  
a mixture of evil and body, a waking  
hat that brings panic.  
A flesh focuses its dream of a beginning, its beginning, the new beginning of the form order -  
its sensual traps.  
Behind sunburst orange water and transluscent silvery rituals.  
I'd do it for the sun rise in which you rustle  
for the peaces of sepia you've performed.  
Realized equinoctial sweetnes to seek another land pure smoke re-covers the natures sob me and let my substance carry.  
  
The quiver knows this,  
that life in it's gem boxes is as endless as the goblet.  
Around the dark agony of the clandenstine.  
Marine havocs of heart,  
sunburst orange seams above a frail horse.  
In the first scene, the loving father  
is penetrated by an aunt. In the second  
take he returns, to shine and to excite.  
I am punctured by essence and nail, by billow of blood colored smoke and thunder.  
You relinquish my dead vigil  
like a myriad lobster to fresh nectarine.  
Multitude of femininities!  
In and out of the silvery the sepia and the opaque green
