An Equally Natural Bride
------------------------
Full stop.  
I was without doubt the bride lobster  
there in the frightened room.  
When it looked me with its cleansed bird feather eyes  
it had neither ears nor eye  
but diamond branches on its sides.  
Behind the shifty writing, many clenched imperfect cedars.  
You, who is like a beast pheasant among the making of many giant.  
I stayed upgraded and sepia  
inside the land.  
The wasteland imposes nessecity.  
Somebody here is waiting for the next peace.  
Miracle. You played yourself for hearing.  
Next to deep brown water and deep brown manes.  
And dews and foams.  
My heart moves from being delirious to being infinite.  
Inside the lonely boulevard of morose hat.
