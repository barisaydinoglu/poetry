The Projection Of Side Points
-----------------------------
A time -like saliva  
because I love you, love, in the fire and inside the clay.  
Outside the sunburst orange hand of the ice.  
We open the halves of a funny things and the  
protesting of havocs forms into the promising night.  
The slender apple  
gave it happiness.  
And you degraded in the agony and mingled a faltering phlegm.  
Breathing a wave  
connected in  
the gleaming wind.  
  
Draw from it the difficult  
inscription of its own detail.  
Neither film nor book nor red  
nor cashmire but sunburst orange.  
Full stop.  
Seizing a umbrella  
chirped in the electrical snow.  
It's a preserving silence of holes.  
I'm the sailor to the form of immediate fellowship.  
Indicates the autumn's blossoming arm.  
Be guided by the serendipidous peace's foliage.  
Cheerless weather, fuming lights like the maternity.  
  
Somebody here is waiting for the next dove.  
Guitar. You developed yourself for rejoicing.  
Like the mourning aluminum of landscapes halfway.
