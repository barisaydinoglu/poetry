I Have Gone Cracking
--------------------
  
Gather on the hearts that wait for you  
disguising the hairy chairs, wiping the doors. Inside the silvery toe of the lightning.  
The decisive sea shell gave it sincerity.  
The order of the trousers it was the early light of day of the oyster.  
If I could enrich the conspirator and the sea.  
The banal glass architecture is handsome on your lip.  
Lighthouse was no longer above the recording threshold.  
Creating the aroma of her starlight full of honor.  
  
It was the sunrise of the iguana.  
Everything blood-stained with somber voices, the salt of the foliage  
and piles of electrical bread inside midnight.  
Hoove.  
A gray and burned-out mane is electrified in the night.  
You upgrade headlong into a chimney to excite your business.  
Blushed and then galloped in the moonlight evening.  
  
I salute your esoteric wine  
and envy your equinoctial pride.  
When you pulse rose like an aroma.  
A flint -like lightning  
the time knows this,  
that life in it's gold boxes is as endless as the flint.
