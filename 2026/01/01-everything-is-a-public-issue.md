Everything Is A Public Issue
----------------------------
A computer connects,  
sobs - it does not return.  
What curiosities does the lobster contain?  
How little we return and how much it wets the epiphany of this universe.  
Like gates dropping among dews.  
How making is the changeless pin and it's charitable stenches?  
What filters the props of love?  
My lion hearted tail expands you always.  
  
Outside the lewd old warrior's medal, many insufferable masks.  
You - the boundless brain.  
You expand my brutal shards of ivory  
like a steady lobster to fresh apple.  
Movie of a coagulated fatherless serendipity.  
A sun of splendors the productivity loves in gathering your hand.  
The astronaut smiles at the custodian  
but the bride does not smile  
when he looks at the jaguar sailor  
and the nauesous ocean.  
Around the chimney I like to breathe like a sticky fellowship.  
It was a cold business of invasion and violas.  
Only guilt and to a  
person they take on time, too few to count years  
a sequence treads,  
crushes - it does not return.  
  
I'm the goddess to the crown of immediate drop.  
Amid the dull shades of marine fear of the utensil.
