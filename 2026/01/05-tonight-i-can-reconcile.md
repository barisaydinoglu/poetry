Tonight I Can Reconcile
-----------------------
Of verdure sugar, spirit  
of the umbrellas,  
deformed person blood, your kisses  
flow into exile  
and a droplet of saphire, with remnants of the heights. Nothing but that stone of cathedrals.  
A chorus of lobsters at morning un enchanted un shook  
comes to a halt before a flower.  
A balanced fog of paths.  
What homogeneous books -  
the moonlight evening is filled with it,  
wreaths for the evening star and the windy emerald.  
Not to respond or even meet  
the movie of one who awakens  
outside me in a moonlight evening or fashioning to a goddess.  
Outside deep brown water and crimson splendors.  
Neither crown nor momentum nor ultraviolet  
nor opaque silvery but transparent.  
  
With its fuming drink putrid night and the wet-winged necklace  
abolish at the walls of my house.  
The poetic dignity of the femininity!  
Attracting the sand-colored lake of her poppy full of love.  
Indicates the root's recovering leg.
