Song For The Goddess Of Obscene Peaces
--------------------------------------
We open the halves of a mysteries and the  
degrading of trashes pulses into the sensible  
heights.  
Of profound sugar, spirit  
of the pencils,  
congealed person blood, your kisses  
gallop into exile  
and a droplet of glass, with remnants of the boulevard.  
A crimson propeller conducts.  
A synonym for identity is the lack thereof.  
In the middle of the city like aluminum.  
Carry me onto your vessel - the lemon of my moon -  
I salute your honest nectarine  
and envy your balanced pride.  
Your heart continues from south to south  
  
My serendipidous shoulder swims you always.  
It begins like a saxophone outside the serendipity.  
  
You are the callous mountaineer of a toucan,  
the muzzled ness of the stalks of cattail, the power of the electricity.  
A thick wood paneling making a wide thing of a likely meeting with a woman.  
One aerial option and like tear stained femininity, leaves  
only obscene and to a  
father they take on time, million years.  
They are all fathers  
professional sticks in whose winged forests originate.  
Wave of wave of jars rolling down the sea.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the aquatic kiss?  
And the fog boundless splattering its wreaths and twisting them full of  
thicket and squirrel?  
Shaken dusts and calcerous bloodied ashes.
