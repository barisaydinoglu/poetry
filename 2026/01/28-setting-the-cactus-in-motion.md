Setting The Cactus In Motion
----------------------------
Has the region been stored with curiosities?  
Reconciling toward the silence closed off and pulled out like a foam.  
Your fountain is a lunar filled  
with sterile guitar.  
A insufferable inscription impales  
even the self-assured  
technical moonlight evening in machine  
to which the metaphor  
will not be built.  
All writings become abberations.  
Has the jungle  
been dedicated with epiphany?  
Like flames fainting in splendors.  
And so that its clefts will lunge your nose.
