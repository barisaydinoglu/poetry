Song For The Astronaut Of Dry Fleshes
-------------------------------------
I want you to dawn on my brow.  
Honor is gone, the subject has recovered.  
Here I am, a delicious tail faltered in the archipeligos of necklace.  
It re-covers like a current behind the current.  
Shall we set forth?  
The sea shell bristles, the cathedral of balanced  
chirps outside.  
I took on banal foliages.
