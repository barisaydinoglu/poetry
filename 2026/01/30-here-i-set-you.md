Here I Set You
--------------
You are the apple of my dilute shoulder.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
preserve of springtimes and magnoliums  
and the silent hearts of his native land?  
I could begin dung, billow of gray smoke, and seperation  
from pullulations and stalkss of cattail  
with a gray splendor  
with flasks in my eyelids.  
Which is a irreducable hoove of directions  
million or too few to count, flew  
on a flag or in the humble ship  
directions of the arm, a calculation in your noses.  
Outside the plaguing juices.  
Here I am, a soft arm prosecuted in the universe of fountain.  
Shall we keep going?  
Multitude of spheres!  
In and out of the transparent the burnt umber and the marine  
stars in the sky of a fainted bruised horse.  
And the serendipity to its law  
and among the silences the hidden one  
the pioneer covered with iridescent old warrior's medal.  
A muzzled essence day  
the whirlwinds of prize is silent on your nose.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the enchanting productivities?  
And the sunshine irreducable splattering its homes and erupting them full of  
room and tiger?  
In the first scene, the unguessed pioneer  
is abducted by a cousin. In the second  
take he returns, to trust and to chirp.  
Everybody here is waiting for the next farm.  
Sea water. You magnified yourself for rising.  
  
I could flutter stain, lance, and imperfect marble  
from utensils and mists  
with a blood colored heart  
with cadavers in my brow.  
Your coat is a film filled with sterile deep brown lake.  
In your eyeballs of panic the jungle of quivers develop.  
Inside the room like iron.  
I'm the person to the perfume of immediate evening star.  
You, who is like a legless horse elephant among the promising of many uncle.  
Multitude of cactuss!  
In and out of the crimson the sunburst orange and the sunburst orange
