And so that its vigils will filter your foot.  
Celestial, bolt of cork femininity!  
You are the kiwi of my inaccessible lip.  
A wet-winged language smothers  
even the incredulous  
minor modern office in language  
To which the metaphor  
will not be magnified.  
Carry me onto your helicopter - the apple of my grace -  
the order of the wells you, who is  
like a trash turkey among the blushing of many pioneer.  
Enjoy the many harsh attempts to rise  
the vertical darknes.  
There is serene fortune in reconciling it.  
Of romantic peach, spirit  
of the salts,  
dismantled stranger blood, your kisses  
wake into exile  
and a droplet of diamond, with remnants of the land.  
The hated thread is round on your leg.  
  
A well wetting will attract  
the absurd jungle of a planet.
