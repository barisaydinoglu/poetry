Setting The Landscape In Motion
-------------------------------
I want you to hear on my leg.  
Behind yellow water and sepia awes.  
Wave of wave of reflections rolling down the sea.  
Draw from it the disintered  
production of its own synonym.  
What steady warmths -  
the region is filled with it,  
pencils for the pasture and the crooked glass.  
So the handsome sincerity lives on in a kiwi,  
the resplendent house of the tree,  
the hopeful bell that is delicious and honest.  
Outside the love of the night where you sleep,  
a dream penetrates into studies.  
Shining from dry marble.  
It flows like a movie inside the writing.  
From unrelenting rain to palm tree leaf,  
hidden muscles drawn by cordial channels, a  
rusted bell begins to relinquish.
