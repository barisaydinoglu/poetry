There Is No Trash
-----------------
Only smooth clay, just the  
drop, nothing but  
it. Door.  
In the face of so many nails to positivity.  
But I should be untrue to science, coagulating among its disordered drops  
so let us seek to speak a story devoid of aerial redundancies.  
I saw how shadess of transparent are made  
by the scrupulous peace.  
I perfume as if outside a explosive bloody feather.  
Hairy oxides and fuming uranus.  
Conversations of starry skies,  
the recitation  
of wine bottles we call brandishing  
elixir.  
And you invaded in the illusion and relinquished a smearing vagabond.  
  
Towards those river banks of yours that wait for me.  
But I should be untrue to jouranlism, rejecting among its hollow phemonanas  
so let us seek  
to divulge a story without neutral redundancies.  
I  
could divulge dagger, dagger, and billows of opaque dull shades of sand-colored smoke  
from flints and waves  
with a turqoise sea shell  
with enemies in my heart.  
I'm the sailor to the tiger of immediate flower head.
