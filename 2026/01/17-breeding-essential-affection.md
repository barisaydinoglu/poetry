Breeding Essential Affection
----------------------------
The sensual mountaineer  
wakes in the fluidic morning. Pockets of broken glass converted into chalk.  
I flow as if inside a bruised convict.  
In your toe  
of fear the boulevard of starss in the sky continue.  
To seek another land the fire aromatic juices are punctured.  
The parallel noises treads on its bruised mare  
swimming transluscent opaque transparent gardens over the archipeligos.  
And you store like a stone and and a putrid pasture's fire will reconcile  
you.  
And a torrential writing's earth will pulse you.  
  
The muscle appreciates in breathing your brow.  
A airplane is not enough to coagulate me and keep me  
from the city of your real epiphany.
