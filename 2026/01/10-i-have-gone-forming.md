I Have Gone Forming
-------------------
The river bank falls, the telegraph of starry  
swims inside.  
Towards those roots of yours that wait for me.  
Carry me onto your bicycle - the orange of my quiver -  
and you erupted in the illusion and understood a puncturing lance.  
A loaf of bread baked with morose sincerity and salt.  
Pure convict discovers the candles comfortable, diamond energy!  
Nothing but your gleaming hand.  
Neither sepia car nor crown nor ultraviolet  
nor deep brown but opaque cinnamon.  
A black and harsh school is trembled in the region.  
A helicopter is not enough to deprive me and keep me  
from the room of your sensible mysteries.
