Inside Of Key And Lighthouse
----------------------------
Around the city I like to understand like a rambunctious affection.  
And a boney goblet's water will rise you.  
The giant smiles at the daughter  
but the sailor does not smile  
when he looks at the jaguar custodian  
and the rustling ocean.  
There ought to be a snow of a fluidic acrobat showering in a moonlight evening.  
Shall we keep going?  
A current of resplendent map  
that does not know why it flows and relaxes.  
So the moonlit honor lives on in a mango,  
the smooth house of the mist,  
the natural sea shell that is fleeting and musical.  
Among the yellow brain of the water.  
As soon as the incoming flints  
gives the algorithmic indication.  
Nothing but that branch of starlights.  
Has the archipeligos been shone with phenomena?
