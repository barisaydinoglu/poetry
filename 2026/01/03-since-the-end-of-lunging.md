Since The End Of Lunging
------------------------
Everything delirious with eloquent voices, the salt of the goblet  
and piles of esoteric bread behind late afternoon.  
The stone plan that has everyone hollow.  
I was without doubt the sailor pheasant  
there in the nauesous land.  
When it looked me with its profound pasture eyes  
it had neither lip nor curves  
but gold flutes on its sides.  
The poppies exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
behind it in darkness.  
To the musical color of the gem bird feather.  
A aspen -like corruption  
trusting toward the prize a key  
treading will carry  
the browbeaten ice of a planet.  
My heart is filled with felicity like a bolt of gold film.  
Of loving lemon, spirit  
of the banners,  
died goddess blood, your kisses  
recover into exile  
and a droplet of diamond, with remnants of the boulevard.  
Of a blood colored custodian that reconciles waves.  
And paths and spheres.  
Only energy, just the  
alcove, nothing but  
it. Breakfast.  
Sometimes a piece of the wind  
imprisons like a mane in my breath.  
In front of transparent water and sunburst orange apples.  
For a day, maybe twenty-seven,  
I rested under a ray of sunlight  
at a post office, waiting for the goddess to be amid.  
Draw from it the raucous  
phenomenon of its own image.  
Be guided by the friendly vein's form.  
An odor has recovered outside the aroma,  
a mixture of havoc and body, a responding  
peace that brings beligerance.  
What secrets does the tiger contain?  
How little we refresh and how much it wakes the funny things of this computer simulation.  
  
Celestial empire. The line functions to mingle an architecture  
to its environment.  
My heart moves from being dilute to being fresh.  
You travel in the land as in a moonlit universe.  
Realized delicate nature our new home, our naked mosaic tetrahedrons.
