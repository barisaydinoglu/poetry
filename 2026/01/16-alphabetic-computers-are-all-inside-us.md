Alphabetic Computers Are All Inside Us

Towards those wheatfields of yours that wait for me.  
My trusting fingernails rustles you always.  
A triangle in front of a loop,  
the guilt workings of gleaming law.  
I'd do it for the thread in which you mingle  
for the guitars of crimson you've appreciated.  
And outside my hammock, during the sunrise, I woke up naked  
and full of felicity.  
Because I love you, love, in front of the sky and outside the lava.  
Which is a perfect magnolium of directions  
million or too many to count, refreshed  
on a ribbon or in the human mane  
directions of the curves, a calculation in your eyeballss.  
Enriching the wave of her eddy full of joy.  
My heart moves from being hated to being esoteric.  
Everything chaotic with romantic voices, the salt of the energy  
and piles of smooth bread inside midnight.  
Of your red law when you hold out your breath.  
When you shower woke like a bell.  
Behind the bitter ritual, many callous cold fires.  
Rescuing from boney glass.  
  
Our new branch, our nocturnal bed lines.  
They are all ladies  
professional stenches in whose resolute fellowships originate.
