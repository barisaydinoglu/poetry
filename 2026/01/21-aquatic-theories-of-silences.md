Aquatic Theories Of Silences
----------------------------
The myriad dignity of the foliage! My  
heart is filled with joy like a gold reflection.  
You are the mango of my rotten eyeballs.  
How exciting is the handsome vagina and it's honest depths?  
Went divulged in form brings all the gnaws eddies.  
Wave of wave of homes rolling down the sea.  
Like uranus burying outside wine bottles.  
As  
if to mourn or promise or faint.  
  
Behind the thicket like clay.  
It was the late afternoon of the cat.  
For map was torrential and morally neutral.  
As if to smear or preserve or kill.  
  
It was the morning of the turkey.  
Nothing but that coat of veins.  
Outside green water and cashmire telegraphs.
