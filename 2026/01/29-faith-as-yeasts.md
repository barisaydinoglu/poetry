Faith As Yeasts
---------------
Shut out and pulled out like a nature.  
Of your opaque turqoise sea shell when you hold out your brow.  
Full stop.  
What infinite manes -  
the area is filled with it,  
hooves for the light and the forceful silken.  
From her fingernails and her toe crystallize  
silvery lakes of the earth.  
Flower head was no longer below the transmission threshold.
