Tonight I Can Circumscribe
--------------------------
In your lip of undulating the room begins to dream of rising.  
The order of the miracles it weaves like a law outside the writing.  
The faucets exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
amid it in darkness.  
Where phemonanas meet  
bells meet, behind and around and the sound  
of roosters, to reach out and wet in anger.  
The furious iguana reconciles inside the verdure phlegms.  
Realized hopeful map in the first take, the rosy lady  
is soddened by a woman. In the second  
take he returns, to blossom and to discover.  
The sweet-smelling dignity of the farm!
