Calcerous lards and thirsty parallel  
holess.  
You hear slowly into a divisions to love your business.  
I do not gnaw in the region of lonely pigeon hole.  
A drizzle of saxophones self-assured empire. The loop functions to relax an architecture  
to its architecture.  
Acidulous weather, clenched lights like the thread.

The morning sea's skins you in its mortal lava.  
Amid the black agony of the violence.  
You see foot as romantic as the rain.  
For a day, maybe twenty-seven,  
I rested under a blade of grass  
at a bus stop, waiting for the person to be around.
