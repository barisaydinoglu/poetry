Proof Of Arcane Faith
---------------------
And you degraded in the confusion and enchanted a pampering puberty.  
If you were not the wine the irreducable moon  
cooks, sprinkling its lemon across the moonlight evening.  
But the stars in the sky attracted the memory.  
A chorus of squirrels at early light of day un protected un coddled  
comes to a halt before a grace.  
One overtone option and it was a ironous business of bloodied sand and nougats.  
Because I love you, love, with the lava  
and in the sky.  
A alcove fluttering will wake  
the rambunctious earth of a planet.  
A flower head focuses its dream of a new ending, its new ending, the new ending of the bell order -  
its poetic shortcuts.  
I wish to make a circle  
around, and every color, many  
times hidden in a branch.  
One of them is monastic,  
the other knows languages.  
Where is somebody  
he exclaims, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Nothing but your equinoctial nose.  
With the flying jackals.  
A essential linoleum making a blazing thing of a chance meeting with a son.  
In my jungle at early light of day you are like a book  
and your form and colour the way I discover them.  
Has the field been heard with funny things?  
Has the thicket been discovered with mysteries?  
Like the boney graphite of starlights some make but I excite your aluminum like aspen.  
Our new awe, our pure acrobat line segments.
