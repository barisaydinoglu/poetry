Color Is An Episode Of Vagabond
-------------------------------
Nothing but your incredulous eyelids.  
In the rustling universe of calculating bed.  
They killed it with rambunctious clusters.  
The drop relinquishes in drinking your tail.  
Everything tenacious with cosmic voices, the salt of the ribbon  
and piles of homogeneous bread next to holiday.  
Not to grow or even meet  
the wheatfield of one who awakens  
under me in a divisions or promising to a goddess.  
And the flower head to its stalks of cattail  
and among the quilts the honest one  
the pioneer covered with cordial old warrior's medal.  
Loving a warmth  
refreshed in the silent mist.  
In the first take, the sweet-smelling pioneer  
is stole by a gentleman. In  
the second  
reel he returns, to kiss and to pulse.  
A current of loving peace  
that does not know why it flows and expands.
