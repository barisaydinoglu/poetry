I Have Gone Forming
-------------------
I am impaled by curtain and billows of blood colored smoke, by trash barge and wind.  
Silvery conglomerates of dominion,  
green seams above a calculating stars in the sky.  
Pockets of graphite converted into gold.  
It's a seeking writing of evils.  
  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the myriad flutes?  
And the thunder starry splattering its miracles and brainwashing them full of  
divisions and crab?  
A bruised projection strikes  
even the great  
overtone thicket in production  
to which the metaphor  
will not be lighted.
