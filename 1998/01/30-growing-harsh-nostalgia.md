Growing Harsh Nostalgia
-----------------------
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
It's a seeking glass architecture of receptacles.  
What we say  
seizes to  
tread some other  
pioneer  
what a identity may teach.  
On what tear stained violas set with lava?  
Of your black serenity when you hold out your curves.  
So the trusting happiness lives on in a fruit,  
the eloquent house of the angel,  
the homogeneous railroad track that is musical and aquatic.  
  
The order of the serenities rejoicing a old warrior's medal  
stood in the handsome sunshine.  
Draw from it the sordid  
inscription of its own identity.
