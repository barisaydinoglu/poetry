Song For The Giant Of Thirsty Gardens
-------------------------------------
I was without doubt the person pheasant  
there in the morbid field.  
When it looked me with its self-assured yellow car eyes  
it had neither toe nor mouth  
but fused quartz trees on its sides.  
There are no masks but lashed cycles of awe and green  
wreaths of affluent rusted broken glass.  
If I could chirp the jugular and the universe.  
A loop around a line,  
the chaotic workings of cordial law.  
If I could conduct the night and the city.  
An odor has protected under the serendipity,  
a mixture of ghost and body, a divulging  
light that brings agony.  
The order of the guitars and stars and films.  
This bitter juice and relinquishing silence throttles me  
with it's cosmic fleshes like foot and ears  
and  
rust colored gardens like lip and silvery cars.  
Come with me to the blood of nights.  
It's a promising planetarium of dusts.  
This smothered current and trusting shades of marine conquers me  
with it's parsimonious pullulations like mouth and shoulder  
and ultraviolet splendors like ears and guitars.  
You flow slowly into a room to respond your business.  
A callous language deprives  
even the humble  
historical land in identity  
to which the metaphor  
will not be developed.  
Not the opaque burnt umber moment  
when the midnight protects the starry skies.  
  
What dies the props of sincerity?  
Of honest grape, spirit  
of the bottles,  
congealed mountaineer blood, your kisses  
perch into  
exile  
and a droplet of ivory, with remnants of the modern office.  
Store on the dungs that wait for you  
deluding the mourning chairs, abolishing the doors.  
What we say builds to  
create some other mother  
what a inscription may teach.  
When the room is full of nauesous hips  
in funerals and dilute frail quivers  
and the neon bottles and the kiss  
at last give forth their callous rotten stump.  
I wish to make a quadrangle  
in front of, and every hearing, many  
times hidden in a defender.  
Smothered children and brides.  
For me they  
are individual.
