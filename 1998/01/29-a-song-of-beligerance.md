A Song Of Beligerance
---------------------
He is against us at this moment of first setting.  
You - the solute tail.  
To the real wonderful time the essential cathedrals taunted  
purity is gone, the subject has protected.  
Neither railroad track nor flower head nor rust colored  
nor sunburst orange but cinnamon.  
The water real bones are abolished.  
Making from crooked glass.  
Windy children and daughters.  
For me they are slightest.  
All gem architectures become oblivions.  
Tremble me and let my substance entertain.  
  
From her brow and her eye grow  
breakfasts of the earth.  
One of them is lovely,  
the other knows cameras.  
Where is somebody  
he cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Kissing toward the well deep brown heat to my smothered droplet!  
On what lewd violences gathered with water?  
Promise.  
And so that its throats will strike your hips.  
Outside the branch of the vicinity where you sleep,  
a dream abolishes into techniques.
