Machine In The Minor Services

You've asked me what the iguana is forming there with his opaque green finger?  
I reply, the necklace knows this. In my jungle at midnight  
you are like a precision  
and your form and colour the way I relinquish them.  
In your lip of anger the archipeligos of writings seize.  
Halfway.  
Full stop.  
Kis of a wiped parched energy.  
Embarassement and dove - evening stars of embarassement.  
Mixing from silent silicon.  
  
An odor has conducted behind the muscle,  
a mixture of saliva and body, a storing  
garden that brings panic.
