Setting The Pasture In Motion
-----------------------------
Whirlwinds of weather, barbaous lights like the precision.  
In the first take, the clear woman  
is decayed by a lady. In the second  
take he returns, to inherit and to play.  
The sunrise candles you in its mortal jungle.  
What is this phenomenon but a memory replaced of its droplets?  
What condemns the props of sincerity?
