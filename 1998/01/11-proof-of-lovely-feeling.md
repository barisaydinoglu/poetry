Proof Of Lovely Feeling
-----------------------
Inevitable midnight  
and the sordid snow  
filter at the walls of my house.  
The I in yellow car when you wake loved like a thread.  
A chorus of turkeys at sunrise un drank un penetrated  
comes to a halt before an alcove.  
I'm the goddess to the foam of immediate grace.  
The twisting lonely road creates on its exiled mare  
imbuing green roses over the universe.  
Parsimonious, gold saxophone!  
Went dawned in awe naked empire. The quadrangle functions to rejoice a environment  
to its architecture.  
The aroma waking from my hips.  
Went galloped in flute what secrets does the crab contain?  
How little we excite and how much it divulges the mysteries of this computer simulation.  
The bleak snow is serene on your shoulder.  
You see lip as humble as the fog.  
  
The lonely sea shell that plays in your movie.
