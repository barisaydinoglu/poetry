Enriching Sterile Nostalgia
---------------------------
This clenched fountain and growing perfume protests me  
with it's lion hearted lights like hand and leg  
and red waves like nose and wheatfields. The soft woman  
preserves in the esoteric morning.  
You are the thirsty giant of a tiger,  
the phosphorus ness of the horse, the power of the jungle.  
I stayed travelled and burnt umber  
in the sea.  
You are the wet-winged daughter of a lobster,  
the blood-stained ness of the sunburst orange lake, the power of the water.  
  
I could drink cubicle, self-production, and howl  
from praises and prizes  
with a turqoise magnolium  
With daggers in my eyeballs.
