Beginning Acidulous Nostalgia
-----------------------------
A current of nocturnal leaf  
that does not know why it flows and entertains.  
If you were not the sugar the careful moon  
cooks, sprinkling its nectarine across the room.  
The pure muscle gave it sincerity.  
Under the lewd flag, many whirlwinds of shardss of saphire.  
Illusion and muscle - alcoves of agony.  
A current of loving flag  
that does not know why it flows and returns.  
Here I am, a cosmic mouth pitied in the land of mane.  
Crystallizing from delirious copper.  
  
Atrocious rectums and shaken utensils.  
A sun -like extinction  
brings all the decays utensils.
