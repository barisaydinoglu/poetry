I Have Gone Mingling
--------------------
A black and sticky salt is bristled in the city.  
In my sea at morning you are like a stalks of cattail  
and your form and colour the way I entertain them.  
You've asked me what the tiger is protecting there with his transluscent marine eyeballs?  
I reply, the starry sky knows this.  
Nothing but that wine bottle of echoes.  
As soon as the incoming breakfasts  
gives the technical indication.  
Transparent and soft cousin,  
there are many vigils in front of cold events.  
Went rustled in friendship to seek another land a chorus of iguanas at day un swam un crushed  
comes to a halt before a old warrior's medal.  
Full stop.  
For wave was sticky and morally negative.  
Closed off and shut out like a crown.  
Because I love you, love, in front of the mud and amid the fire.
