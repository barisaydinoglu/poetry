Feeling As Uranus
-----------------
Enjoy the many explosive attempts to wake  
the equinoctial invasion.  
There is dashing fortune in discovering it.  
To the lion hearted color of the bolt of copper window.  
Under the chimney like rusted nail.  
Fewer and fewer  
overflow about another mode of honor.  
Conversations of smooth rusted nails, the recitation  
of silences we call enchanting old warrior's medal.  
Decay me and let my substance conduct.  
Multitude of kiss!  
In and out of the cinnamon the cashmire and the transparent  
you, who is like a lamprey tiger among the making of many goddess.  
A current of celestial faucet  
that does not know why it flows and imbues.  
Outside the aroma of the divisions where you sleep,  
a dream prosecutes into  
languages.  
You've asked me what the iguana is pacifying there with his sunburst orange eye?  
I reply, the pencil knows this.
