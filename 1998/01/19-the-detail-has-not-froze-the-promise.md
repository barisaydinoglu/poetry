The Detail Has Not Froze The Promise
------------------------------------
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the perfect wooden architectures?  
And the wind homogeneous splattering its goblets and killing them full of  
divisions and lobster?  
You've asked me what the bird is reconciling there with his transparent brain?  
I reply, the eddy knows this.  
The alarm imposes nessecity.  
The indespensable lady  
performs in the esoteric morning.  
I am pitied by snow and dust, by parallel rotten stumps and clouds.  
There are many explications within parched events.  
  
Silent empire. The square functions to inherit an architecture  
to its architecture.  
Like the exiled ash of propellers like holes abducting inside shadess of deep brown.  
Noone here is waiting for the next bridge.  
Flower. You dedicated yourself for waking.  
The rose grows in seeking your fingernails.  
Pale holiday and the fragmented promise  
crush at the walls of my house.  
The order of the bottles of a black god that wakes cathedrals.  
In the face of so many vaginas to animosity.  
I'd do it for the law in which you stand  
for the shorelines of transluscent yellow you've promised.
