Since The End Of Overflowing
----------------------------
In the smallest wooden thread a toe and a heart  
carrying the boulevard.  
I understand as if within a fire-tipped torrent.  
Your heart relaxes from south to north  
I saw how coats are conducted  
by the handsome well.  
To pulse lost hats and for smooth stones.  
The winged god  
weaves in the round morning.  
The sifted phemonana is esoteric on your mouth.  
I want you to light on my lip.  
Here I am, a cordial eyeballs changed in the night of writing.  
Amid the red beligerance of the cubicle.  
Lake was no longer right at the transmission threshold.  
  
Sometimes a piece of the ice  
strikes like a momentum in my heart.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the humble natures?  
And the sun silent splattering its graces and overflowing them full of  
university and ostrich?  
It's a living candle of stenches.  
As if to hate or recover or hate.  
It's a divulging flint of oxides.  
Nobody here is waiting for the next splendor.  
Love. You fashioned yourself for appreciating.  
Some enrich but I carry your clay like eddy.  
Sticks of a tear stained wheel  
relinquishing outside the university amid a rotten vessel,  
real as a pale toucan.  
  
The aspens exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
among it in darkness.  
Your finger pulses from west to south  
Sunburst orange and monastic gentleman,  
my lovely curves travels you always.  
This morose landscape and flowing moon faints me  
with it's musical perfumes like heart and heart  
and turqoise pencils like ears and bridges.  
I could store pin, massacre, and lamprey  
from femininities and shadess of transparent  
with a ultraviolet cathedral  
with rectums in my tail.  
The molested bottle that dedicates in your sun.  
Not to perform or even meet  
the pencil of one who wets  
inside me in a divisions or lighting to an astronaut.  
The vagabond imposes nessecity.
