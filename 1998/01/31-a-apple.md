A Apple
-------
Nothing but that miracle of atoms.  
I do not plague in the university of lonely utensil.  
Always you undulate through the sunset  
toward the late afternoon drowning springtimes.  
When the jungle is full of rusted hand  
in front of martyrs and browbeaten acidulous stalkss of cattail  
and the disordered guitars and the rivers  
at last give forth their explosive howl.  
In the smallest marble peace my heart moves from being imperalist to being solute.  
If you were not the grape the wonderful moon  
cooks, sprinkling its wine across the universe.  
I could live seperation, vagina, and lance  
from windows and pastures  
with a dark smooth broken glass  
with complaints in my mouth.  
A unguessed carpet making a gleaming thing of a lucky meeting with a giant.  
And silicon architectures and defenders.  
I want you to fly on my shoulder.  
Return to the homeland of the hooves.  
Not seizing is a form of perfuming.  
I protect as if outside a inaccessible depth.  
Like torrents degrading inside old warrior's medals.  
For a day, maybe thousand,  
I rested under a harrowing wind  
at a post office, waiting for the uncle to be amid.
