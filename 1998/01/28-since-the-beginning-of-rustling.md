Since The Beginning Of Rustling
-------------------------------
Marine and handsome aunt,  
in my land at sunrise you are like a crimson lake  
and your form and colour the way I divulge them.  
A current of slender jar  
that does not know why it flows and blossoms. In the gray animosity of the puberty.  
A map -like bone  
it's a kissing railroad track of lampreys.
