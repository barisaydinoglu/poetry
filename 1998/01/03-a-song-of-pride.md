A Song Of Pride
---------------
Callous weather, cold lights like the salt.  
What secrets does the cat contain?  
How little we relinquish and how much it plays the curiosities of this universe.  
Multitude of hearts!  
In and out of the green the transparent and the opaque blue  
the jungle loving violas are chained.  
  
I want you to kiss on my breath.  
Sometimes a piece of the mud  
silences like a ship in my breath.
