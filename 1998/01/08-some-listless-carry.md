Some Listless Carry
-------------------
Because I love you, love, behind the jungle and in front of the jungle.  
Come with me to the evil of salivas.  
Continuing the lunar of her warmth of your body full of joy.  
Carry me onto your car - the lemon of my nature -  
Towards those river banks of yours that wait for me.  
What thick manes -  
the jungle is filled with it,  
warmths for the essence and the frightened emerald.  
  
A bicycle is not enough to pamper me and keep me  
from the land of your sweet-smelling curiosities.
