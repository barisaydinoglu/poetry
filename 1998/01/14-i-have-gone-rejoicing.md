I Have Gone Rejoicing
---------------------
Brings all the taunts graces.  
With its dilute refresh on what harsh cities blossomed with fire?  
What is this study but a memory entangled of its shorelines?  
The fellowship plan that has everyone lashed.  
Brings all the strikes perfumes.  
I do not pity in the land of bleak stalactite.  
It's a rising transluscent crimson  
lake of imbroglios.  
The deedy cousin  
conducts in the delicious morning.  
A loaf of bread baked with whirlwinds of wonder and salt.  
An odor has expanded among the cathedral,  
a mixture of evil and body, a imbuing  
acrobat that brings beligerance.  
A calculation for metaphor is the lack thereof.  
To seek another land what we say shines to  
attract some other sailor  
what a synonym may teach.  
And you silenced in the illusion and lighted a shaking trap.  
Our new precision, our monastic door loops.  
The garden performs in rustling your brow.  
Sometimes a piece of the water  
undulates like a starry sky in my brain.
