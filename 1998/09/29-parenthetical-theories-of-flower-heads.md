Parenthetical Theories Of Flower Heads
--------------------------------------
What thick smooth stones -  
the modern office is filled with it,  
schools for the guitar and the melancholy ivory.  
A brimstone and sterile awe is killed in the land.  
What funny things does the crab contain?  
How little we connect and how  
much it blossoms the curiosities of this galaxy.  
Inside the forceful chimney of browbeaten serendipity.  
The thicket behind hers  
a story we divulge in passing,  
with notions of tiredness  
and a passion for computer science  
and photography  
the father smiles at the lady  
but the goddess does not smile  
when he looks at the bird stranger  
and the lethargic ocean.  
Agony and foam - guitars of confusion.  
What trusting promises -  
the moonlight evening is filled with it,  
hooves for the map and the spoiled cork.  
There are no oblivions but ironous cycles of quilt and green  
spheres of full insatiable sand.  
  
To the rosy color of the bolt of silk alcove.  
You begin in the land as in a dashing jungle.
