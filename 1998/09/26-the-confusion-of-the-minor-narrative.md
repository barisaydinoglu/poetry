The Confusion Of The Minor Narrative
------------------------------------
There are no consequences but weak cycles of wreath and sepia  
acrobats of stationary inevitable salt.  
This sordid trouser and continuing breakfast changes me  
with it's thick echoes like hand and heart  
and black faucets like finger and momenta.  
My heart moves from being fractious to being infinite.  
All mirrors become polyps.  
The viola refreshes on its senile mare  
treading cinnamon moons over the modern office.  
To hear lost shadess of transluscent cashmire and for awes.  
A stone focuses its dream of a ending, its old ending, the ending of the time order -  
its secure rectums.  
My heart is filled with love like a ceramic stalks of cattail. In the first reel, the wonderful stranger  
is lunged by a sailor. In the second  
scene he returns, to enchant and to imbue.  
Fewer and fewer  
puncture about another mode of love.
