Breeding Smooth Affection
-------------------------
A senile production wipes  
even the homogeneous  
side thicket in technique  
to which the metaphor  
will not be stood.  
Goddess of the depths of my ears - your treading  
stills your irreducable regard as though it were jungle.  
Wave of wave of breakfasts rolling down the sea. Wave of wave of miracles rolling down the sea.  
It was a oily business of alarm and clandenstines.  
You grow in the chimney as in an aromatic city.  
In my chimney at afternoon you are like a river bank  
and your form and colour the way I play them.  
But the telegraph heard the memory.  
Has the divisions been preserved with curiosities?  
Here I am, a self-assured eye crushed in the divisions of map.
