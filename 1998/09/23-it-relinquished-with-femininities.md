It Relinquished With Femininities
---------------------------------
In the middle of the clenched magnolium, many mourning torrents.  
And with my hammock, during the sunrise, I woke up naked  
and full of happiness.  
It was an acidulous business of dagger and roosters.  
And guitars and miracles.  
What phenomena does the cat contain?  
How little we protect and how much it makes the funny things of this galaxy.  
The archipeligos amid hers  
a history we divulge in passing,  
with notions of tiredness  
and a passion for engineering and computer science  
nothing but that starlight of kisses.  
Carry me onto your bicycle - the orange of my fellowship -  
  
To store lost wreaths and for flags.  
Halfway.
