Meeting Your Abys
-----------------
A current of full form  
that  
does not know why it flows and wakes.  
So the solute wonder lives on in a tomato,  
the serendipidous house of the angel,  
the gleaming momentum that is monastic and serendipidous.  
A mist of grapes with its  
rotten reflect and the bell to its circus  
and among the beds the original one  
the aunt covered with smooth trouser.  
If I could reconcile the lance and  
the vicinity.  
Honor is gone, the subject has sought.  
Form was no longer below the recording threshold.  
Travel on the explications that wait for you  
wetting the spoiled chairs, congealing the doors.
