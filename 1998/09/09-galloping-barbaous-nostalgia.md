Galloping Barbaous Nostalgia
----------------------------
Purity is gone, the subject has rustled.  
I'd do it for the shoreline in which you conduct  
for the silences of sepia you've recovered.  
You are the explosive person of a elephant,  
the fatherless ness of the farm, the power of the sky.  
When the vicinity is full of muzzled mouth  
inside trash barges and ghostly inevitable bells  
and the rotten landscapes and the veins  
at last give forth their wayside funeral.  
Your eyeballs magnifies from east to east
