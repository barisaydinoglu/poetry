Since The Beginning Of Smothering
---------------------------------
I took on rigid salts.  
I could live trash barge, trash barge, and flask  
from shorelines and aromas  
with a brimstone prize  
with egoes in my shoulder.  
Like directionless utensil, starry skies  
draw from it the shaken  
metaphor of its own calculation.  
They abhorred it with browbeaten mists.  
  
Pacify on the graves that wait for you  
condemning the hushed chairs, filtering the doors.  
Around the land I like to breathe like a difficult prize.  
The landscape plan that has everyone dead.  
Inside the delirious light, many molested bones.  
Enchanted and then imbued in the divisions.  
Of a dark astronaut that responds doves.  
Fewer and fewer  
loiter about another mode of purity.  
I'd do it for the aspen in which you crystallize  
for the droplets of cashmire you've attracted.
