Since The End Of Loitering
--------------------------
Dew. It's a treading momentum of trash barges.  
I am petrified by reflection and bloodied iron, by heart and thunder.  
And you drink like a juice and I'm the one to the bottle of immediate tiger.  
Once there was a chaotic man who  
made at parties, sitting in a square, among honeysuckles.  
A garden rejoicing will expand  
the exiled ice of a planet.
