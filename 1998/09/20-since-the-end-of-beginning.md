Since The End Of Beginning
--------------------------
Shake me and let my substance kiss.  
A metaphor for technique is the lack thereof.  
Sorrow and map - coats of confusion.  
There are no corpses but troubled cycles of shoreline and green  
circuss of mineral neon aluminum.  
A line segment outside a triangle,  
the tremulous workings of celestial law.  
With the burnt umber heart of the heat.  
I'd do it for the bridge in which you enrich  
for the breakfasts of crimson you've drank.
