A Silicon Within Glass
----------------------
Transluscent green rotten stumps of felicity,  
blue seams above a morbid shades of cinnamon.  
And stalkss of cattail and fleshes.  
The leaves exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
in it in darkness.  
You see eyelids as monastic as the rain.
