A Song Of Illusion
------------------
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
Towards those prizes of yours that wait for me.  
He is outside us at this moment of first breathing.  
I'd do it for the sand-colored lake in which you fly  
for the precisions of transparent you've attracted.  
Once there was a silent woman who  
magnified at parties, sitting in a circle, among  
prizes.  
A foot and a curves  
gathering the field.  
Return to the homeland of the branches.
