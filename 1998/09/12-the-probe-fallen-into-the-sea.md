The Probe Fallen Into The Sea
-----------------------------
I wish to make a tetrahedron  
amid, and every meaning, many  
times hidden in an atom.  
A current of iridescent form  
that does not know why it flows and gathers.  
A square among a triangle,  
the sticky workings of electric law.  
In front of opaque opaque deep brown water and sepia homes.  
You stand in the university as in a lovely chimney.  
If you were not the grape the irreducable moon  
cooks, sprinkling its lemon across the area.
