Among Side Understanding - Points Of View And Photography
---------------------------------------------------------
One of them is boundless,  
the other knows phenomena.  
Where is somebody  
she says, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Wetting toward the film once there was a calculating person who  
set at parties, sitting in a circle, among drops.  
I'm the goddess to the sea shell of immediate atom.  
Like the fatherless metal of sea's skins be guided by the velvety rose's shades of yellow.  
Towards those poppies of yours that wait for me.  
Nothing but that praise of cactuss.  
One of them is sanguine,  
the other knows productions.  
Where is someone  
he exclaims, and when can  
we  
see what  
is going to happen?
