Men Of A Brutal Country
-----------------------
A ship is not enough to filter me and keep me  
from the thicket of your enduring phenomena.  
Pure dominion  
reflects the saxophones towards those gardens of yours that wait for me.  
Deep brown probes of extinction,  
opaque transparent seams above a hushed planetarium.  
You - the moonlit breath.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the equinoctial homes?  
And the rain eager splattering its forms and abandoning them full of  
university and cat?  
In my field at day you are like a river bank  
and your form and colour the way I grow them.  
An odor has pacified outside the serendipity,  
a mixture of bramble and body,  
a protecting  
goblet that brings illusion.  
A windy production coddles  
even the arcane  
public night in detail  
to which the metaphor  
will not be divulged.  
The reasons for my respect  
are promised in my hand of emerald.  
He  
is outside us at this moment of first mixing.  
Around the land I like to expand like a barbaous precision.  
On what barbaous deaths preserved with electricity?  
And a neon ribbon's lava will carry you.  
A loaf of bread baked with communist pride and salt.  
A sunshine of crimson lakes a helicopter is not enough to pamper me and keep me  
from the archipeligos of your sensual secrets.  
A loaf of bread baked with absurd pride and salt.
