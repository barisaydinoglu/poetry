Everyday You Stand
------------------
Outside the gray illusion of the night.  
Cinnamon heat to my blood-stained coat!  
Be guided by the warm school's mirror.  
To the profound slender bed conversations of drops, the recitation  
of flowers we call spacious foliage.  
The dead tiger chirps outside the starry scandalmongerings.  
Loving, cedar warmth of your body!  
We get the faith  
they must lots to refresh  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but clocks.  
Perhaps  
they are not shattered.
