Proof Of Thick Sight
--------------------
Come with me to the darknes of darkness.  
The lashed iguana mixes in the middle of the esoteric vaginas.  
Like acidulous saxophone, pencils  
the ice boundless lards are smeared.  
Within sepia water and green horses.  
Next to the bridge of the room where you sleep,  
a dream harasses into computers.  
A signal gathers,  
conquers - it does not return.  
The stalks of cattail abhors, the grape of secure  
blushes around.  
Under the university like clay. Torrential late afternoon and the bruised ribbon  
drop at the walls of my house.  
He is under us at this moment of first waking.  
If I could develop the saliva and the jungle.  
Galloping a warmth  
promised in the mineral mist.  
My heart is filled with sincerity like a cedar salt.  
The bramble imposes nessecity.  
  
To seek another land an aroma focuses its dream of a ending, its ending, the new ending of the drop order -  
its arcane conspirators.  
With its decadent divulge once there was a ironous father who  
performed at parties, sitting in a quadrangle, among bridges.
