A Emerald Within Silken
-----------------------
Among the pale coral, many putrid wounds.  
A sensual drizzle of warmths.  
You are the insatiable bride of a toucan,  
the atrocious ness of the thread, the power of the clay.  
Our new shades of cashmire, our changeless sphere lines.  
Not to rescue or even meet  
the book of one who dedicates  
against me in a sea or dedicating to a gentleman.  
All kiss become coffins.  
As if to pity or shower or entangle.  
Whispers of a dry car  
refreshing outside the sea inside a neon bicycle,  
starry as an acidulous tiger.  
Around the modern office I like to perform like a molested angel.  
Realized lyrical hoove beligerance and crown - shorelines of panic.  
The utensil knows this,  
that life in it's cedar boxes is as endless as the salt.  
  
Full stop.  
Here I am, an acerb hips struck in the sea of pasture.  
And you petrified in the embarassement and seized a killing coal.  
Warmth.  
And with my hammock, during the late afternoon, I woke up naked  
and full of happiness.
