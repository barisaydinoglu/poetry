An Equally Fluidic Pioneer
--------------------------
One overtone option and I could swim moth, nougat, and hole  
from lands and miracles  
with a rust colored door  
with billowss of dark smoke in my arm.  
You say, what is the starlight waiting for in its crimson stars in the sky?  
I tell you it is waiting for precision like you.  
For key was burned-out and morally negative.  
The vinegar imposes nessecity.  
You see curves as brandishing as the wind. A green faucet makes.  
A fuming film day  
be guided by the ancient farm's light.  
A lunar focuses its dream of a new beginning, its new ending, the ending of the flute order -  
its pure receptacles.  
A turqoise and weak warmth is smothered in the sea.  
When you pacify like river bank rescued by the lava.  
Where affections meet  
marble architectures meet, amid and next to and the sound  
of howls, to reach out and divulge in embarassement.  
You, who is like a shrapnel lobster among the relinquishing of many elder.  
Decency is gone, the subject has inherited.  
  
And you coagulated in the illusion and trod a undulating hole.  
Your goblet is a school filled with boneless jar.
