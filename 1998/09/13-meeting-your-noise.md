Meeting Your Noise
------------------
A foot and a toe  
mixing the room.  
In your arm of animosity the night of sun rises relinquish.  
In the face of so many vigils to positivity.  
The water hopeful trashes are overflowed.  
Green nights of womb,  
blue seams above a dead pasture.  
What we say treads to  
drink some other  
daughter  
what an antenna may teach.
