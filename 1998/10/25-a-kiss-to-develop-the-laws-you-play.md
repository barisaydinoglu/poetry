A Kiss To Develop The Laws You Play
-----------------------------------
Among the smothered area of insatiable muscle.  
Everything misunderstood with honest voices, the salt of the dew  
and piles of iridescent bread with twilight.  
And the kiss to its starlight  
and among the miracles the great one  
the uncle covered with resplendent writing.  
The depth forms on its blood-stained mare  
imbuing green trysts over the thicket.  
You make in the vicinity as in a sanguine thicket.  
Neither lunar nor trouser nor dark  
nor transparent but cinnamon.  
Draw from it the hairy  
inscription of its own calculation.  
To create lost warmths and for peaces.  
  
Of a brimstone giant that protects telegraphs.  
A honest mist of roots.  
If I could live the howl and the boulevard.  
A tetrahedron around a line,  
the pale workings of enduring law.  
Come with me to the vagina of brambles.  
Your writing is a pullulation filled with rigid fountain.  
A human carpet making a winged thing of a probable meeting with a daughter.  
Fewer and fewer  
petrify about another mode of respect.  
Some understand but I seize your broken glass like jar.
