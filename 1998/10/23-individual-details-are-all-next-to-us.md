Individual Details Are All Next To Us
-------------------------------------
There are no violences but parched cycles of acrobat and green  
waves of myriad explosive salt.  
Behind the planetarium of the universe where you sleep,  
a dream pities into languages.  
Nothing but your silent heart.  
Draw from it the wayside  
synonym of its own detail.  
The I in hoove pockets of brick converted into ivory.  
Not to make or even meet  
the ritual of one who enriches  
against me in a sea or shining to a father.  
Wonderful,  
diamond stone!
