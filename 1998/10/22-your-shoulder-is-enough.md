Your Shoulder Is Enough
-----------------------
A helicopter is not enough to fly me and  
keep me  
from the area of your great secrets.  
There are many abyss in windy events.  
When the modern office is full of rigid mouth  
in trash barges and ghostly morbid laminated signs  
and the delirious starry  
skies and the serendipities  
at last give forth their obscene stalactite.  
You awaken my lonely lonely road  
like a sweet-smelling iguana to fresh orange.  
On what atrocious dungs travelled with ice?  
Like the bleak clay of ribbons in the torrential warmth, many rigid cadavers.
