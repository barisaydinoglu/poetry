I Have Gone Setting
-------------------
The absurd muscle is celestial on your ears.  
You - the great brain.  
A circle in a triangle,  
the burned-out workings of angellic law.  
Because I love you, love, inside the lightning and around  
the lightning.  
When you relinquish refreshed like a river.
