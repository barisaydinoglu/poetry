It Shone With Juices
--------------------
A chorus of birds at holiday un blossomed un pampered  
comes to a halt before an atom.  
It was a spoiled business of massacre and puberties.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
I took on neurotic corals.  
Outside the dull shades of transparent sorrow of the gate. Fewer and fewer  
crush about another mode of happiness.  
A furious antenna abhors  
even the resplendent  
neutral university in metaphor  
to which the metaphor  
will not be gathered.  
I saw how snows are wove  
by the parsimonious dove.  
With its molested flow sometimes a piece of the wind  
bristles like a kiss in my finger.  
For a day, maybe thousand,  
I rested under a unrelenting rain  
at a post office, waiting for the goddess to be  
outside.  
The essence imbuing from my eyeballs.  
Enjoy the many rambunctious attempts to develop  
the naked funeral.  
There is spacious fortune in setting it.
