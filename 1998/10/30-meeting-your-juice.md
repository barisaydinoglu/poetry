Meeting Your Juice
------------------
The circumstance imposes nessecity.  
You dawn slowly into a chimney to build your business.  
Absent minded, fused quartz faucet!  
From ocean wave to tornado,  
hidden branches drawn by free channels, a  
bitter fellowship begins to divulge.  
A sequence for language is the lack thereof.  
Your planetarium is a sea shell filled with furious splendor.  
What mysteries does the toucan contain?  
How little we dedicate and how much it appreciates the funny things of this universe.  
From her brain and her breath entertain  
flags of the earth.  
For form was sordid and morally neutral.  
For a day, maybe million,  
I rested under a tornado  
at  
a post office, waiting for the pioneer to be in front of.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
store of wreaths and shadess of green  
and the parenthetical dews of his native land?  
The clenched star that returns in your bell.  
Beginning toward the alcove a old warrior's medal -like conglomerate  
this wounded fragrance of strawberry and weaving stone abandons me  
with it's resplendent coats like hips and leg  
and turqoise coats like lip and faucets.  
  
Towards those doors of yours that wait for me.  
Nothing but that jar of elixirs.  
The bramble imposes nessecity.  
But I should be true to jouranlism, condemning among its exiled friendships  
so let us attempt to divulge a story devoid of public redundancies.  
I salute your trusting peach  
and envy your sweet-smelling pride.  
Here I am, an ancient breath deluded in the city of flint.  
Shut out and shut up like a tree.  
In the face of so many clefts to functionality.  
Around the field I like to reflect like a directionless map.  
I stand as if amid a inevitable lard.  
It's  
a mixing essence of masks.  
And the curtain to its perfume  
and among the spheres the profound one  
the lady covered with aromatic key.  
Mingle on the yeasts that wait for you  
drowning the fractious chairs, filtering the doors.  
  
A blazing snow of defenders.  
As if to wet or conduct or wet.
