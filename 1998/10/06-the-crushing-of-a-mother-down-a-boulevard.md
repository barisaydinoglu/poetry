The Crushing Of A Mother Down A Boulevard
-----------------------------------------
The iridescent sea's skin  
gave it sincerity. As soon as the incoming honeysuckles  
gives the technical indication.  
I'd do it for the bottle in which you chirp  
for the productivities of blue you've dawned.  
The loving dignity of the echo!
