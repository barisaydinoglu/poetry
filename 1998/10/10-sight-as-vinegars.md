Sight As Vinegars
-----------------
A line inside a circle,  
the rigid workings of eloquent law.  
I want you to blossom on my brain.  
I'd do it for the circus in which you awaken  
for the autumns of sunburst orange you've woke.  
Friendly, emerald candle!  
You drink headlong into a night to perch your business.  
It is a tale of mourning sticks it's a protecting fountain of lineages.  
And you punctured in the embarassement and perched a harassing abberation.  
To seek another land a point of view for inscription is the lack thereof.  
You - the monastic curves.  
The sunrise silences  
you in its mortal ice.  
Inside the tiger of the archipeligos where you sleep,  
a dream dismantles into projections.  
Only ghostly and to a  
gentleman they take on time, twenty-seven years  
the shoreline drinks in showering your mouth.
