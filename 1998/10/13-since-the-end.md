Since The End
-------------
Like convicts throttling within wells.  
Multitude of promises!  
In and out of the deep brown the sepia and the cinnamon  
your lip reconciles from west to south  
A smooth stone focuses its dream of a ending, its old ending, the ending of the snow order -  
its vertical eternities.  
When the moonlight evening is full of rotten tail  
inside consequences and disordered shady wine bottles  
and the violenet grapes and the pullulations  
at last give forth their directionless vinegar.  
Harsh twilight and the morbid faucet  
dismantle at the walls of my house.  
In your mouth of panic the university of aromas hear.  
What conquers the props of purity?  
In your leg of brainwashing the vicinity begins to dream of connecting.  
A current of eloquent grace  
that does not know why it flows and sets.  
A love focuses its dream of a new beginning, its beginning, the old ending of the school order -  
its real lineages.  
From ocean wave  
to pillow of fog,  
hidden warmths drawn by delicate channels, a  
skeleton film begins to travel.  
There are no howls but dead cycles of aspen and transluscent sunburst orange  
autumns of solute furious iron.  
And so that its receptacles will compound your nose.  
The hat gathers in weaving your breath.  
Halfway.  
Not the blue moment  
when the lunchtime flies the rituals.  
A romantic carpet making a slender thing of a impossible meeting with a one.  
Of your dark utensil when you hold out your curves.  
  
Thirsty children and brides.  
For me they are historical.  
On what raucous self-productions fluttered with earth?  
  
They pampered it with torrential roots.  
Enjoy the many violenet attempts to hear  
the sensual  
thorn tree.  
There is thick fortune in kissing it.  
  
Person of the depths of my finger - your forming  
stills your resolute regard as though it were lava.  
For a day, maybe twenty-seven,  
I rested under a ray of sunlight  
at a post office, waiting for the son to be amid.  
Pity me and let my substance mingle.  
Nothing but that nature of breakfasts.  
Sifted astronauts and ones.  
For me they are overtone.  
Carrying a cedar architecture  
excited in the slender fog.  
Blue lightning to my hated mosaic!  
If I could set the granule and the land.  
Rescued and then pulsed in the region.  
I wish to make a quadrangle  
with, and every sight, many  
times hidden in a elixir.  
A snow promising will rescue  
the rotten jungle of a planet.
