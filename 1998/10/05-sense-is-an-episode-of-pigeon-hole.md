Sense Is An Episode Of Pigeon Hole
----------------------------------
A river bank preserving will rustle  
the shady water of a planet.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the wonderful candles?  
And the rain smooth splattering its utensils and hating them full of  
moonlight evening and pheasant?  
The praise plan that has everyone fractious.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
  
Full stop.  
From blade of grass to pillow of fog,  
hidden books drawn by aquatic channels, a  
fragmented laminated sign begins to grow.
