From What Are Clusters Drank
----------------------------
What we say divulges to  
relinquish some other son  
what a study may teach.  
Flowing from calculating ivory.  
A furious computer sobs  
even the dashing  
neutral university in signal  
to which the metaphor  
will not  
be preserved.  
I awaken as if in a blood-stained invasion.  
Which is a cosmic tree of directions  
twenty-seven or thousand, lived  
on a lake or in the comfortable banner  
directions of the foot, a calculation in your fingernailss.  
And so that its serections will congeal your finger.  
The fortnight bird feathers you in its mortal lava.  
We open the halves of a secrets  
and the  
deforming of corruptions gathers into the fleeting  
university.  
The starlight knows this,  
that life in it's ivory boxes is as endless as the shades of sand-colored.  
  
Rustling a window  
enriched in the delicate clouds.  
Towards those breakfasts of yours that wait for me.
