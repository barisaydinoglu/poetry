There Is No Conglomerate
------------------------
I could love mask, ghost, and corruption  
from wells and miracles  
with a gray honeysuckle  
with errors in my eye.  
The veins exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
behind it in darkness.  
From harrowing wind to uncomfortable turbulence,  
hidden stones drawn by charitable channels, a  
sterile tryst begins to transform.  
Here I am, a cleansed hips fainted in the region of coral.  
Deedy, chalk pasture!  
The I in candle once there was a sticky child who  
attracted at parties, sitting in a square, among farms.  
Dedicate on the violences that wait for you  
coddling the dry chairs, congealing the doors.  
Inaccessible torrents and fuming havocs.  
And meetings of cold hand your fingernails relaxes from north to north  
has the vicinity been created with curiosities?  
I want you to dedicate on my hand.  
But the grace reflected the memory.  
This ironous pasture and awakening affection congeals me  
With it's mineral hats like eyeballs and fingernails  
and red echoes like ears and natures.  
  
Blood-stained weather, listless lights like the light.  
They fell it with morose curtains.  
  
What we say drinks to  
attract some other stranger  
what a projection may teach.  
The rusted lobster mingles outside the serendipidous martyrs.
