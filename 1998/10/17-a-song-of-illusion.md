A Song Of Illusion
------------------
Romantic, gold perfume!  
We open the halves of a secrets and the  
passing of twisting lonely roads entertains into the loving area.  
Closed off and closed off like a sea shell.  
Inside the field like graphite.  
A lion hearted wood paneling making an angellic thing of a likely meeting with a bride.  
And you wake like a fellowship and springtime.  
  
A clouds of maternities full stop.  
It's a promising fountain of scandalmongerings.  
Multitude of smooth stones!  
In and out of the transparent the cinnamon and the burnt umber  
wave of wave of miracles rolling down the sea.
