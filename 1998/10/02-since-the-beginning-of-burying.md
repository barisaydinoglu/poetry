Since The Beginning Of Burying
------------------------------
The saliva perfumes on its neon mare  
blushing cashmire awes over the boulevard.  
Brings all the deludes ribbons.  
A decisive sunshine of lights.  
Outside the modern office like broken glass.  
  
I took on parched peaces.  
Walls of a demonic ship  
storing with the university next to a fragmented raft,  
careful as a senile elephant.  
When you seek sought like a planetarium.  
Halfway.  
Pockets of sand converted into fused quartz.  
Blood-stained weather,  
barbaous lights like the honeysuckle.  
All tigers become moths.
