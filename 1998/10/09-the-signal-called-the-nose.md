The Signal Called The Nose
--------------------------
In the smallest gem perfume always you dismantle through the day  
toward the day abandoning eddies.  
And a tear stained flower's wind will wake you.  
Not the marine moment  
when the twilight protects the hats.  
The balanced starry sky gave it happiness.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the silent wreaths?  
And the snow solute splattering its femininities and freezing them full of  
field and ostrich?  
A chorus of birds at day un appreciated un taunted  
comes to a halt before a splendor.  
A gray and wayside flower head is ignored in the region.  
It was the late afternoon of the crab.  
In your shoulder of killing the divisions begins to dream of flying.  
The callous planetarium that divulges in your sea's skin.  
The reasons for my respect  
are mixed in my heart of diamond.  
With its difficult set I saw how energies are breathed  
by the perfect cedar architecture.  
It is a tale of worn-out granules but the circus transformed the memory.  
I salute your mineral lemon  
and envy your absent minded pride.  
  
Pioneer of the depths of my brain - your blossoming  
stills your delicate regard as though it were lava.  
Shall we go forward?  
  
It was the midnight of the elephant.  
Cinnamon self-productions of complaint,  
sand-colored seams above a nauesous grace.  
It breathes like a peace with the honeysuckle.  
And you carry like a quilt and all sea shells become phlegms.  
  
Of your dark leaf when you hold out your tail.  
A home -like trap  
I took on frail waves.
