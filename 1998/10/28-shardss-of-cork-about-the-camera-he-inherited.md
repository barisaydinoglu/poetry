Shardss Of Cork About The Camera He Inherited
---------------------------------------------
A computer for signal is the lack thereof.  
In the transparent shoulder of the ice.  
Carry me onto your bicycle - the orange of my flesh -  
A wide sun of bells.  
A chorus of squirrels at sunset un performed un smeared  
comes to a halt before a flower.  
Return to the homeland of the wheatfields.  
  
A loop amid a square,  
the distorted workings of musical law.  
And you kiss like a path and like circumstances wiping outside pencils.  
Next to sand-colored water and sepia ripples.  
The smothered dove that flies in your praise.  
Refreshed and then swam in the chimney.
