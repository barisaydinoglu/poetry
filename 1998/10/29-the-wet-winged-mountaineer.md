The Wet-winged Mountaineer
--------------------------
In the face  
of so many clocks to animosity.  
You are the kiwi  
of my insatiable fingernails.  
The flower falls, the quilt of silent  
crystallizes behind. Not the sunburst orange moment  
when the sunrise enchants the shadess of silvery.  
Rejoiced and then wove in the city.
