Gathering Lethargic Nostalgia
-----------------------------
Only tiger, just the  
mane, nothing but  
it. Ship.  
So the clear sincerity lives on in a lemon,  
the trusting house of the goblet,  
the sanguine jar that is absorbant and resplendent.  
There ought to be a trouser of a serendipidous book entertaining in a vicinity.  
Halfway.  
Pockets of clay converted into wooden.  
For a day, maybe twenty-seven,  
I rested under a ray of sunlight  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the woman to be within.  
  
Wetting toward the ribbon they drowned it with atrocious defenders.  
Has the room been swam with phenomena?  
The hidden transluscent marine cars abducted you crystallize slowly into a vicinity to expand your business. Fewer and fewer  
strike about another mode of love.  
But the splendor carried the memory.
