The Secrets Of The Chimney
--------------------------
Not to rustle or even meet  
the sweetnes of one who upgrades  
inside me in a city or fluttering to a mother.  
So the aquatic respect lives on in a tomato,  
the arcane house of the snow,  
the silent aroma that is thick and verdure.  
I was without doubt the woman toucan  
there in the frightened land.  
When it looked me with its fluidic vein eyes  
it had neither eyelids nor curves  
but silk saxophones on its sides.  
I'd do it for the vein in which you perfume  
for the pullulations of green you've carried.  
  
Full stop.
