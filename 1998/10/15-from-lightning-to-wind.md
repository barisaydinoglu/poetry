From Lightning To Wind
----------------------
Once there was a cheerless mother who  
loved at parties, sitting in a circle, among smooth stones. Conversations of stars, the recitation  
of evening stars we call decisive poppy.  
You see breath as lyrical as the snow.  
I was without doubt the bride crab  
there in the inaccessible sea.  
When it looked me with its electrical shoreline eyes  
it had neither shoulder  
nor shoulder  
but wooden snows on its sides.  
Towards those grapes of yours that wait for me.  
From her brow and her leg circumscribe  
momenta of the earth.  
I could love trapdoor, utensil, and hole  
from alcoves and necklaces  
with a gray door  
with stalactites in my heart.  
Be guided by the somber springtime's kis.  
  
There ought to be a tiger of a homogeneous alcove seizing in a divisions.
