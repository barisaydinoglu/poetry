Projection With The Moth
------------------------
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the parenthetical curtains?  
And the sunshine irreducable splattering its trousers and cracking them full of  
university and iguana?  
A loaf of bread baked with mechanical love and salt.  
A blood colored and wayside prize is foreboded in the land.  
Pride is gone, the subject has breathed.  
They are all people  
professional bloods in whose absorbant goblets originate.
