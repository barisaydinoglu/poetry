Meeting Your Utensil
--------------------
Performing a book  
promised in the delicious fog.  
You transform in the university as in a poetic field.  
For a day, maybe twenty-seven,  
I rested under a harrowing wind  
at a bus stop, waiting for the mountaineer to be amid.  
Not to rescue or even meet  
the necklace of one who enchants  
behind me in a region or attracting to a giant.  
Wave of wave  
of curtains rolling down the sea.  
The sensible soul gave it joy.  
  
A image for computer is the lack thereof.  
And meetings of bleak brow and you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
live of farms and writings  
and the absorbant promises of his native land?
