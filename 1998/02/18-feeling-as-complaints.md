Feeling As Complaints
---------------------
I'd do it for the cactus in which you stand  
for the ripples of green you've lived.  
The moonlight evening with  
hers  
a history we divulge in passing,  
with notions of tiredness  
and a passion for computer science and jouranlism  
There are no legless horses but frail cycles of nature and silvery  
hooves of stationary communist ash.  
But the telegraph imbued the memory.  
And the candle to its sea's skin  
and among the lunars the promising one  
the goddess covered with serendipidous sun.  
I wish to make a line segment  
outside, and every abstraction, many  
times hidden in a vein.
