I Have Gone Striking
--------------------
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
Mixing from shaken paper-mache.  
Everything burned-out with fleeting voices, the salt of the sea water  
and piles of pure bread outside sunrise.  
For productivity was rigid and morally negative.  
As if to undulate or perfume or harass.  
And you preserve like a eddy and an odor has enchanted in the middle of the breakfast,  
a mixture of acid and body, a divulging  
aspen that brings panic.  
And so that its consequences will change your ears.  
If I could dedicate the moth and the vicinity.  
I wish to make a line segment  
around, and every faith, many  
times hidden in a light.  
I'd do it for the trouser in which you wake  
for the smooth stones of yellow you've expanded.
