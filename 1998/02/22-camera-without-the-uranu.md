Camera Without The Uranu
------------------------
With its hollow imbue from ray of sunlight to uncomfortable turbulence,  
hidden aromas  
drawn by absent minded channels, a  
troubled mist begins to weave.  
It was the fortnight of the cat.  
A loop behind a line segment,  
the smothered workings of aquatic law.  
It was  
the lunchtime of the crab.  
All starlights become invasions.  
If I could divulge the dung and the area.  
You are the orange of my senile shoulder.  
Smooth broken glass was no longer below the transmission threshold.  
  
Because I love you, love, next to the heat and outside the wind.  
The beast imposes nessecity.
