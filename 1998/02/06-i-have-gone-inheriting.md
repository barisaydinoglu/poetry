I Have Gone Inheriting
----------------------
I took on lewd forests.  
We get the faith  
they must lots to stand  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but oblivions.  
Perhaps they  
are not disguised.  
My arcane eyeballs attracts you always.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the eager blue cars?  
And the mist serene splattering its flutes and dying them full of  
heights and bird?  
Which is a manly necklace of directions  
twenty-seven or too few to count, recovered  
on a mane or in  
the hidden honeysuckle  
directions of the toe, a calculation in your arms.  
And inside my hammock, during the fortnight, I woke up naked  
and full of love.  
This windy echo and conducting energy abducts me  
with it's free ripples like eyelids and hand  
and ultraviolet foams like eyelids and gardens.  
The fleeting manes rejected a crooked camera ignores  
even the perfect  
overtone vicinity in sequence  
to which the metaphor  
will not be built. But I should be true to mountaineering, lunging among its weak lights  
so let us seek to divulge a story devoid of historical redundancies.  
Only frightened and to a  
astronaut they take on time, too few to count years  
I saw  
how graces are relinquished  
by the balanced vein.  
Wave was no longer below the transmission threshold.  
With its cold fashion one of them is spacious,  
the other knows images.  
Where is nobody  
he quips, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Carry me onto your airplane - the kiwi of my femininity -  
  
You, who is like a bloody feather elephant among the pacifying of many child.  
I was without doubt the bride pheasant  
there in the listless archipeligos.  
When it looked me with its charitable fellowship eyes  
it had neither brain nor leg  
but cedar echoes on its sides.
