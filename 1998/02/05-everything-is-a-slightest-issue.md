Everything Is A Slightest Issue
-------------------------------
Neither telegraph nor peace nor rust colored  
nor cinnamon but sand-colored. Of romantic nectarine, spirit  
of the flowers,  
erupted pioneer blood, your kisses  
make into exile  
and a droplet of emerald, with remnants of the room.  
And so that its seperations will forebode your brain.  
  
It rejoices like a reflection with the utensil.
