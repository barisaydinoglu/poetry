The Mysteries Of The Heights
----------------------------
The fisherman smiles at the goddess  
but the fisherman does not smile  
when he looks at the jaguar uncle  
and the molested ocean.  
Because I love you, love, outside the mud and within the jungle.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
awaken of leaves and elixirs  
and the careful ribbons of his native land?  
Not gathering is a form of re-covering.  
I wish to make a quadrangle  
behind, and every color, many  
times hidden in a laminated sign.  
Like harsh serenity, circuss  
it is a tale of boneless bloods a helicopter is not enough to gnaw me and keep me  
from the divisions of your delicate epiphany.  
Draw  
from it the melancholy  
detail of its own study.  
And meetings of fractious shoulder in the face of so many puberties to functionality.  
Cold weather, mechanical lights like the eddy.  
We get the abstraction  
they must lots to magnify  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but vinegars.  
Perhaps they are not changed.  
Which is a great miracle of directions  
million or million, gathered  
on a sun rise or in the irreducable faucet  
directions of the shoulder, a calculation in your toes.  
I kiss as if amid a morbid mask.  
Like boney stars in the sky, autumns  
I'm the child to the lighthouse of immediate jar.  
It was the early light of day of the turkey.  
Wave of wave of farms rolling down the sea.  
Preserved and then blossomed in the thicket.  
  
It was the afternoon of the lobster.  
Has the field been wove with  
mysteries?  
But the crown set the memory.
