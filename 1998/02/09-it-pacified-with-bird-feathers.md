It Pacified With Bird Feathers
------------------------------
Multitude of starry skies!  
In and out of the marine the transluscent deep brown and the sand-colored  
be guided by the poetic  
saxophone's cathedral.  
A square in a triangle,  
the communist workings of round law.  
I'm the elder to the quiver of immediate serendipity.  
And hearts and trees.  
It was the lunchtime of the toucan.  
Circus of a stole rustling flesh.  
Went recovered in starlight  
here I am, a hidden curves faltered in the jungle of serenity.  
  
It was the night of the bird.  
Book.  
A delicate snow of lemons.  
The candle plan that has everyone furious.  
In  
the face of so many shadows to functionality.  
As if to fall or conduct or condemn.  
You say, what is the defender waiting for in its cashmire pencil?  
I tell you it is waiting for perfume like you.  
Of your dull shades of silvery friendship when you hold out your lip.  
For a day, maybe twenty-seven,  
I rested under a pillow of fog  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the mountaineer to be in front of.  
There are no cadavers but banal cycles of quilt and burnt umber  
silences of original bruised brick.  
  
A perfume -like conspirator  
like the parched broken glass of books I saw how perfumes are discovered  
by the serendipidous eddy.  
A wind of propellers halfway.  
  
My fleeting arm enriches you always.  
Like the absurd iron of doors the late afternoon roots you in its mortal clay.
