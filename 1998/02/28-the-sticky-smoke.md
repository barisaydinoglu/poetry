The Sticky Smoke
----------------
Telegraph of a crushed fragmented ribbon.  
Showering from calculating bolt of saphire.  
Carry me onto your ship - the fruit of my ribbon -  
on what whirlwinds of ghosts created with sky?  
It was the late afternoon of the crab.  
Indicates the flower head's preserving eyeballs.  
Like violenet moon, curtains  
I was without doubt the god toucan  
there in the calcerous vicinity.  
When it looked me with its  
myriad evening star eyes  
it had neither arm nor hand  
but saphire forms on its sides.  
  
It was the morning of the oyster.  
Went shone in forest like ironous sun rise, crowns  
you've asked me what the lobster is pacifying there with his transparent ears?  
I reply, the wheatfield knows this.  
Elixir of a plagued disintered autumn.  
In the crimson finger of the clay.  
In the first reel, the sanguine sailor  
Is overflowed by a daughter. In the second  
reel he returns, to protect and to develop.  
A loaf of bread baked with tremulous joy and salt.  
Has the boulevard been shone with mysteries?  
You travel slowly into an area to relax your business.  
Conversations of knaves, the recitation  
of tigers we call unguessed root.  
Like the hairy brick of essences the noble horses twisted all evening stars become gates.  
You are the rabid mountaineer of a bird,  
the weak ness of the map, the power of the electricity.
