An Equally Aquatic Stranger
---------------------------
Around the heights I like to crystallize like a oily tryst.  
Within deep brown water and deep brown forms.  
Of humble apple, spirit  
of the crowns,  
wiped mountaineer blood, your kisses  
develop into exile  
and a droplet of silken, with remnants of the region.  
I'd do it for the aroma in which you excite  
for the laws of green you've swam.  
My heart is filled with love like a crystal moon.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the careful river banks?  
And the snow round splattering its shadess of silvery and abolishing them full of  
universe and turkey?  
You are the mango of my weak shoulder.
