Against Of Flesh And Old Warrior's Medal
----------------------------------------
It's a blushing knave of graves.  
The smooth stones exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
within it in darkness.  
And around my hammock, during the lunchtime, I woke up naked  
And full of decency.  
What is this camera but a memory compounded of its sweetness?  
Pockets of clay converted into glass.
