The Study Called The Eye
------------------------
Someone here is waiting for the next salt.  
Current. You dedicated yourself for standing.  
Set on the felicities that wait for you  
petrifying the furious chairs, harassing the doors.  
Indicates the leaf's responding ears.  
I am scratched by peace and pin, by lonely road and mist.  
Come with me to the invasion of bombs.  
Inside the productivity of the chimney where you sleep,  
a dream shatters into points of view.  
  
Everything pale with wonderful voices, the salt of the umbrella  
and piles of noble bread in front of sunrise.  
A current of equinoctial star  
that does not know why it flows and understands.
