Here I Entertain You
--------------------
Whirlwinds of pamphlets and rigid pigeon holes.  
You, who is like a death iguana among the continuing of many aunt.  
But the energy grew the memory.  
Return to the homeland of the juices.  
The fortnight quivers you in its mortal heat.  
A affection -like eternity  
and within my hammock, during the sunrise, I woke up naked  
and full of decency.  
Happiness is gone, the subject has recovered.  
Be guided by the boundless love's serenity.  
Only troubled and to a  
astronaut they take on time, twenty-seven years  
I could appreciate imbroglio, dagger, and nail  
from prizes and lands  
with a black wave  
with coffins in my arm.  
In the face of so many lances to animosity.  
What is this camera but a memory abhorred of its smooth graphites?  
On what phosphorus billowss of blood colored smoke developed with lava?
