Every Giant Is A Image
----------------------
For warmth of your body was wounded and morally neutral.  
Draw from it the crooked  
technique of its own technique.  
Playing the friendship of her bed full of decency.  
I want you to rise on my brow.  
Fear and foliage - reflections of beligerance.
