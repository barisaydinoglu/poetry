From Electricity To Fire
------------------------
Dove.  
And meetings of sordid toe went preserved in jar because I love you, love, next to the sky and amid the clay.  
A current of lovely old warrior's medal  
that does not know why it flows and develops.  
The fuming fellowship that makes in your cactus.  
  
An odor has connected among the stone,  
a mixture of vinegar and body, an appreciating  
root that brings illusion.
