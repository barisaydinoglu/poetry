Song For The Woman Of Obscene Guitars
-------------------------------------
Invade me and  
let my substance re-cover.  
In your brow  
of fear the field of fragrances of strawberry wake.  
A chorus of squirrels at night un fashioned un trembled  
comes to a halt before a quiver.  
The fisherman smiles at the child  
But the aunt does not smile  
when he looks at the cat one  
and the morose ocean.  
And you pacify like an atom and not playing is a form of creating.  
A sequence for camera is the lack thereof.  
You preserve my wounded smoke  
like a cleansed iguana to fresh plum.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
The reasons for my respect  
are performed in my nose of gem.  
Behind sepia water and deep brown essences.  
Reflected and then played in the city.  
The sensible gentleman  
transforms in the original morning.
