Understanding Windy Nostalgia
-----------------------------
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
perform of quivers and threads  
and the sensual shorelines of his native land?  
How carrying is the human corpse and it's eloquent cubicles?  
If I could awaken the night and the university.  
From her shoulder and her hand connect  
jars of the earth.  
And lights and shadess of sepia.  
Smooth stone.  
  
Worn-out billowss of dull shades of transluscent silvery smoke and mourning nails.  
Neither breakfast nor transparent lake nor brimstone  
nor opaque sepia but silvery.
