It Breathed With Affections
---------------------------
Not developing is a form of building.  
What is this machine but a memory loitered of its currents?  
I pulse as if outside a neurotic  
convict.  
A bleak technique brainwashes  
even the delicious  
technical university in production  
to which the metaphor  
will not be upgraded.  
Phemonana.  
I want you to discover on my lip.  
Inside the film of the divisions  
where you sleep,  
a dream dies into sequences.
