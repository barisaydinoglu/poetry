There Is No Trash
-----------------
You say, what is the old warrior's medal waiting for in its yellow blue lake?  
I tell you it is waiting for serenity like you.  
To the sensual color of the silicon coat.  
Draw from it the spoiled  
computer of its own synonym.  
Not seizing is a form of playing.  
  
There are no howls but fuming cycles of muscle and sepia  
poppies of soft silent metal.  
But the wine bottle  
conducted the memory.
