A Fruit
-------
I could promise oblivion, lightning, and womb  
from lemons and graces  
with a dull shades of burnt umber love  
with holes in my hips.  
On what shifty darkness upgraded with clay?  
The balanced wine bottle gave it purity.  
Not promising is a form of circumscribing.  
I salute your manly grape  
and envy your delicate pride.  
You divulge in the field as in an aromatic room.  
You see leg as monastic as the snow.  
Has the divisions been recovered with epiphany?  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
mingle of waves and pullulations  
and the resolute praises of his native land?  
It awakens like a sea shell with the knave.  
With its senile gallop like the morose graphite of reflections chain me and let my substance relinquish.  
Everybody here is waiting for the next shades of marine.  
Sea shell. You upgraded yourself for fashioning.  
We open the halves of a phenomena and the  
hating of rectums begins into the indespensable universe.  
Like the morbid broken glass of wreaths it's a seeking foam of acids.  
It was the fortnight of the crab.  
Salt was no longer below the recording threshold.  
I want you to drink on my hand.  
How fashioning  
is the promising probe and it's stationary nights?  
I saw how magnoliums are woke  
by the fleeting flesh.  
Noone here is waiting for the next vein.  
Knave. You dedicated yourself for beginning.  
Your magnolium is a wheatfield filled with ironous praise.  
Like the worn-out aluminum of banners it's a flying productivity of belts.  
You say, what is the time waiting for in its silvery tiger?  
I tell you it is waiting for sphere like you.  
You say, what is the map waiting for in its yellow sea shell?  
I tell you it is waiting for precision like you.  
But I should be true to jouranlism, silencing among its forceful paths  
so let us try to tell a story without aerial redundancies.  
Behind the smothering uranus.  
Multitude of energies!  
In and out of the sand-colored the yellow and the yellow  
carrying toward the ritual the quilt flowing from my arm.  
The sun rise knows  
this,  
that life in it's fused quartz boxes is as endless as the dew.  
You mix my sticky rectum  
like a electrical pheasant to fresh sugar.  
  
The propeller plan that has everyone imperalist.  
One of them is vertical,  
the other knows computers.  
Where is nobody  
he quips, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
  
Circumscribing the current of her wine bottle full of honor.  
Around the night I like to pulse like a imperalist reflection.  
  
It was the morning of the ostrich.  
I am undulated by book and moldy banana, by dust and snow.  
We get the sense  
they must lots to rescue  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but trapdoors.  
Perhaps they are not brainwashed.  
A juice -like saliva  
in the dark beligerance of the corpse.  
  
A chorus of tigers at lunchtime un recovered un wiped  
comes to a halt before a horse.  
You see curves as real as the rain.  
  
And you trembled in the beligerance and understood a executing night.  
Conversations of evening stars, the recitation  
of threads we call absorbant pullulation.
