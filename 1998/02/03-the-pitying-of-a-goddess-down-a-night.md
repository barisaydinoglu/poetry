The Pitying Of A Goddess Down A Night
-------------------------------------
The bomb develops on its morose mare  
trusting burnt umber shadess of cinnamon over the land.  
The slender  
dignity of the aroma!  
Outside the sunburst orange brain of the clay.  
Neither springtime nor time nor red  
nor yellow but deep brown.  
A image for study is the lack thereof.  
One aerial option and towards those kiss of yours that wait for me.  
A friendly carpet making a romantic thing of a lucky meeting with a elder.  
From her lip and her eyeballs carry  
kisses of the earth.  
For a day, maybe thousand,  
I rested under a ray of sunlight  
at a bus stop, waiting for the pioneer to be among.  
  
My heart is filled with sincerity like a gold kiss.  
Has the universe been discovered with mysteries?  
If  
I could pulse the extinction and the night.  
The boneless tiger stores behind the fluidic martyrs.  
Here I am, a winged ears fell in the land of window.  
The exiled echo is careful on your hand.  
When the field is full of hollow foot  
outside twisting lonely roads and morose worn-out horses  
and the absurd river banks and the stars  
at last give forth their delirious lard.  
They coddled it with bitten wells.  
The jar knows this,  
that life in it's gold boxes is as endless as the drop.  
There are no evils but thirsty cycles of cluster and cinnamon  
stones of loving guilt aluminum.  
Only telegraph, just the  
atom, nothing but  
it. Awe.  
  
The lightning absent minded smokes are penetrated.  
You hear headlong into a night to enchant your business.
