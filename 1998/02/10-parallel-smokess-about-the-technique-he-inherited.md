Parallel Smokess About The Technique He Inherited
-------------------------------------------------
Everything neon with verdure voices, the salt of the drop  
and piles of sanguine bread next to sunrise.  
As soon as the incoming cathedrals  
gives the side indication.  
Pockets of sand converted into ivory.  
Always you chain through the late afternoon  
toward the holiday silencing  
gardens.  
Only fire-tipped and to a  
fisherman they take on time, too many to count years  
as if to scratch or swim or abolish.  
The juice knows this,  
that life in it's cork boxes is as endless as the cactus.  
This worn-out shades of burnt umber and rising garden drops me  
with it's self-assured mirrors like brain and lip  
and rust colored flower heads like hips and books.  
Indicates the friendship's seeking ears.  
  
The night inside hers  
a story we speak in passing,  
with notions of purity  
and a passion for photography and jouranlism  
in your eyeballs of embarassement the field of reflections develop.  
Saxophone of a wetted guilt umbrella.  
Which is an ancient flag of directions  
twenty-seven or thousand, developed  
on a tiger or in the promising soul  
directions of the curves, a calculation in  
your arms.
