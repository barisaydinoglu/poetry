Since The Beginning Of Entangling
---------------------------------
An odor has heard inside the bridge,  
a mixture of wound and body, a fashioning  
mane that brings fear.  
The jungle outside hers  
a tale we tell in passing,  
With notions of respect  
and a passion for computer science and engineering  
always you decay through the twilight  
toward the lunchtime loitering ribbons.  
In your eye of panic the chimney of movies shower.  
The person smiles at the custodian  
but the man does not smile  
when he looks at the toucan lady  
and the disintered ocean.  
In your leg of striking the archipeligos begins to dream of perching.  
  
Behind the hoove of the archipeligos where you sleep,  
a dream loathes into projections.  
Snow.
