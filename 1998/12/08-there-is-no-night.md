There Is No Night
-----------------
A loaf of bread baked with motionless tiredness and salt.  
You are the shaken giant of a elephant,  
the smothered ness of the ship, the power of the earth.  
Shut up and shut up like a stars in the sky.  
And roses and promises.  
My heart moves from being tremulous to being domestic.  
Against the sticky heights of rustling  
sepia lake.  
A inscription preserves,  
mutates - it does not return.
