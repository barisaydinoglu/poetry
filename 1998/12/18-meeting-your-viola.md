Meeting Your Viola
------------------
One minor option and how rejoicing is the fluidic smoke and it's aromatic panics?  
Not the yellow moment  
when the twilight flows the trousers.  
And glass architectures and honeysuckles.  
Always you chain through the day  
toward the morning replacing horses.  
There are many legless horses with wayside  
events.  
For trouser was dead and morally neutral.  
To gather lost hearts and for lemons.  
Not the sepia moment  
when the sunrise reconciles the manes.  
I am brainwashed by knave and conspirator, by legless horse and sunshine.  
Be guided by the parsimonious bottle's phemonana.  
  
Nothing but that root of keys.  
The resplendent dignity of the flower head!  
  
Our new lemon, our angellic sea's skin loops.  
A poppy treading will relax  
the listless jungle of a planet.
