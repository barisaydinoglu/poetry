Feeling Is An Episode Of Dung
-----------------------------
Of a dark aunt that excites lands.  
Like the distorted rusted nail of chalk architectures not to flutter or even meet  
the soul of one who wets  
inside me in a land or storing to a daughter.  
The rotten sea shell that develops in your land.  
I dawn as if outside a distorted bone.  
Indicates the utensil's lighting ears.  
Went dedicated in muscle you are the ironous gentleman of a turkey,  
the neurotic ness of the knave, the power of the water.  
Shall we proceed?  
What we say imbues to  
rescue some other bride  
what a production may teach.  
Here I am, a wide ears dismantled in the universe of peace.  
And a rambunctious energy's wind will kiss you.  
In my room at fortnight you are like a crown  
and your form and colour the way I drink them.  
My heart is filled with purity like a copper wreath.  
From her hand and her lip inherit  
sand-colored cars of the earth.
