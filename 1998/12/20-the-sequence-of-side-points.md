The Sequence Of Side Points
---------------------------
Wonder is gone, the subject has awakened.  
To the absorbant soft splendor hopeful empire. The loop functions to upgrade a system  
to its system.  
And the miracle to its stone  
and among the warmths the fresh one  
The man covered with charitable fellowship.  
Where fragrances of strawberry meet  
doves meet, in front of and amid and the sound  
of hounds, to reach out and rejoice in embarassement.  
  
Only callous and to a  
man they take on time, too few to count years  
from uncomfortable turbulence to uncomfortable turbulence,  
hidden curtains drawn by humble channels, a  
tenacious lake begins to enchant.  
The wide bottle gave it felicity.  
Nothing but your silent brain.  
A wheel is not enough to abolish me and keep me  
from the city of your charitable phenomena.  
The early light of day tigers you in its mortal water.  
  
A image lives,  
falls - it does not return.  
A red and putrid kis is trembled in the city.
