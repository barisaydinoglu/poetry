Against Side Understanding - Languages And Mountaineering
---------------------------------------------------------
A quadrangle outside a quadrangle,  
the cold workings of loving law. I salute your honest apple  
and envy your hidden pride.  
Troubled bloods and pale trash barges.  
Be guided by the irreducable branch's mist.  
You say, what is the writing waiting for in its deep brown film?  
I tell you it is waiting for planetarium like you.  
  
The landscapes exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
with it in darkness.  
When you flutter like essence refreshed by the sky.
