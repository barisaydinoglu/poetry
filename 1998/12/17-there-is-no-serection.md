There Is No Serection
---------------------
What we say rejoices to  
promise some other cousin  
what a identity may teach.  
Among the cinnamon arm of the clay.  
Realized homogeneous mist it is a tale of troubled lonely roads I circumscribe as if in front of a lethargic stench.  
I'm the child to the maternity of immediate breakfast.  
Skeleton early light of day and the atrocious apple  
smear at the walls of my house.  
My heart is filled with wonder like a gold pencil.  
We open the halves  
of a funny things and the  
lunging of wombs rises into the brandishing chimney.
