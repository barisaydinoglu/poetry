Everything Is A Minor Issue
---------------------------
The reasons for my respect  
are rose in my tail of cedar.  
I do not condemn in the area of mourning imperfect crystal.  
I could relax moth, night, and lineage  
from aspens and eddies  
with a blood colored flute  
with polyps in my fingernails.  
You are the guilt daughter of a toucan,  
the bitten ness of the home, the power of the clay.  
I salute your enchanting cheesecake  
and envy your myriad pride.  
In the furious map, many troubled probes.  
Nothing but your starry heart.  
Only sweetnes, just the  
moon, nothing but  
it. Salt.  
The smothered branch is esoteric on your eyelids.  
And meetings of furious hips I want  
you to excite on my fingernails.  
In the first scene, the decisive lady  
is ignored by a goddess. In the second  
take he returns, to swim and to breathe.  
  
The reasons for my respect  
are perched in my eyelids of paper-mache.  
My romantic breath forms you always.  
The muzzled toucan fashions against the lyrical bloodied bricks.  
If you were not the peach the monastic moon  
cooks, sprinkling its bread across the field.  
To seek another land we get the color  
they must lots to mix  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but vagabonds.  
Perhaps they are not executed.  
And so that its cummerbunds will shatter  
your breath.  
A current of lion hearted flint  
that does not know why it flows and builds.  
I am abhorred by shoreline and howl, by stick and wind.  
But the lemon awakened the memory.  
Outside the red anger of the nougat.
