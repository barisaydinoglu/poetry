The Synonym Called The Arm
--------------------------
Pulled out and shut out like a smooth stone.  
Like the parched rusted nail of hearts you begin in the vicinity as in a manly night.  
To the solute great path the moons exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
in it in darkness.  
Not the marine moment  
when the day enriches the horses.  
To seek another land carry me onto your wheel - the apple of my vein -  
clenched afternoon and the negligent atom  
taunt at the walls of my house.  
  
What is this language but a memory froze of its aspens?  
The obscene smooth iron that divulges in your home.  
Always you crush through the afternoon  
toward the early light of day impaling shorelines.  
The wave performing from my eyeballs.  
Law.  
It was a burned-out business of felicity and oxides.  
So the monastic happiness lives on in a orange,  
the round house of the fragrance of strawberry,  
the winged marine car that is spacious and promising.  
Behind the barbaous moonlight evening of browbeaten ritual.  
It was a shady business of depth and felicities.  
But I should be untrue to jouranlism, cracking among its morose forms  
so let us begin to speak a story without side redundancies.  
A deep brown promise recovers.  
And lights and flags.  
And a calculating telegraph's ice will light you.
