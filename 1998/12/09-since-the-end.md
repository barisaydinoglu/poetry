Since The End
-------------
It imbues like a perfume around the stars in the sky.  
Inside the distorted field of frightened home.  
Has the chimney been developed with secrets?  
Demonic weather, distorted lights like the movie.  
The I in knave like the blood-stained aluminum of utensils pockets of sand converted into silicon.  
Reflecting toward the map everything forceful with resolute voices, the salt of the stalks of cattail  
and piles of serendipidous  
bread inside midnight.  
You've asked me what the squirrel is pulsing there with his sand-colored fingernails?  
I reply, the reflection  
knows this.
