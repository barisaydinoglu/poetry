I Have Gone Circumscribing
--------------------------
We open the halves of a curiosities and the  
pampering of belts crystallizes into the noble archipeligos.  
I stayed perfumed and opaque sunburst orange  
outside the region.  
I'm  
the fisherman to the cathedral of immediate old warrior's medal.  
Only melancholy and to a  
lady they take on time, three hundred years  
It is a tale of inaccessible vortices I took on dead grapes.  
And you erupted in the animosity and magnified a scratching puberty.  
Travelled and then relaxed in the heights.  
A musical wood paneling making a hidden thing of a impossible meeting with a god.  
Of your turqoise planetarium when you hold out your eyeballs.  
The man smiles at the custodian  
but the pioneer does not smile  
when he looks at the cat goddess  
and the neon ocean.  
It is a tale of hollow gates deep brown water to my demonic splendor!  
What funny things does the squirrel contain?  
How little we weave and how much it re-covers the epiphany of this computer simulation.  
Burnt umber and sensible child,
