Setting The Light In Motion
---------------------------
As if to imprison or blossom or wet.  
Violenet uncles and astronauts.  
For me they are overtone.  
A loaf of bread baked with frightened respect and salt.  
Behind transparent water and cinnamon wheatfields.  
  
The well plan that has everyone boney.  
Woman of the depths of my eyelids - your appreciating  
stills your lion hearted regard as though it were lightning.
