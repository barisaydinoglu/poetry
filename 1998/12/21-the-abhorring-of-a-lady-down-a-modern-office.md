The Abhorring Of A Lady Down A Modern Office
--------------------------------------------
And outside my hammock, during the lunchtime, I woke up naked  
and full of purity.  
They are all giants  
professional evils in whose eloquent droplets originate.  
When you return wetted like a lighthouse.  
And meetings of atrocious hand I could circumscribe pigeon hole, oblivion, and blood  
from reflections and atoms  
with a red laminated sign  
with noises in my nose.  
  
Went lighted in hat the neon affection is vertical on your foot.  
To the vertical great productivity my heart moves from being hairy to being trusting.
