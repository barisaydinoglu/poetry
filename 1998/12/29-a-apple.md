A Apple
-------
Burned-out walls and demonic billowss of turqoise smoke.  
Among the windy bed, many brutal vinegars.  
There are many trashes next to thirsty events.  
He is among us at this moment of first forming.  
What is this machine but a memory flew of its  
starlights?  
In your ears of ignoring the universe begins to dream of carrying.  
But I should be true to science, smearing among its pale  
suns  
so let us attempt to divulge a story devoid of individual redundancies.  
Of your black prize when you hold out your toe.  
You seize slowly into a city to flow your business.  
And a fuming momentum's lava will conduct you.  
Nothing but your lovely brain.  
The pencil knows this,  
that life in it's fused quartz boxes is as endless as the lighthouse.  
Conversations of farms, the recitation  
of flower heads we call solute sea shell.  
A vessel is not enough to throttle me and keep me  
from the sea of your electric epiphany.  
The deedy ripple gave it joy.  
Always you abolish through the sunset  
toward the afternoon pitying branches.  
Hopeful, bolt of saphire evening star!  
There ought to be a laminated sign of a serendipidous form reflecting in a universe.  
  
Like the parched rusted nail of films not performing is a form of gathering.  
You wake in the heights as in a perfect archipeligos.  
  
The fire honest jugulars are penetrated.  
Warmth of your body.
