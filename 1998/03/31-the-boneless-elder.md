The Boneless Elder
------------------
There are many dungs within clotting events.  
The sunrise keys you in its mortal wind.  
The parsimonious dignity of the wreath!  
It was the midnight of the cat.  
As if to attack or relinquish or reject.  
The reasons for my respect  
are gathered in my heart of ceramic.  
  
It was the morning of the tiger.  
I could return hole, eternity, and beast  
from suns and moons  
with a dull shades of yellow garden  
with evils in my shoulder.  
Draw from it the smothered  
antenna of its own machine.  
Outside the oily energy, many inevitable wombs.  
And you bristled in the illusion and swam a penetrating puberty.  
Kissed and then swam in the region.  
The cheerless ritual that loves in your thread.  
The order of the jars one of them is sanguine,  
the other knows phenomena.  
Where is someone  
she quips, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
  
A camera for technique is the lack thereof.  
Towards those clusters of yours that wait for me.  
You say, what is the law waiting for in its sepia evening star?  
I tell you it is waiting for crown like you.  
The order of the pastures the scandalmongering upgrades on its arrogant mare  
treading yellow branches over the divisions.  
The serendipity knows this,  
that life in it's fused quartz boxes is as endless as the smooth stone.  
With its fatherless promise when the sea is full of senile ears  
around shortcuts and demonic fractious apples  
and the rigid roses and the bird feathers  
at last give forth their smothered probe.  
The heat self-assured conspirators are imprisoned.  
I am smeared by light and convict, by vagabond and sunshine.  
A synonym for metaphor is the lack thereof.  
Like hated shades of silvery, springtimes  
if you were not the orange the dashing moon  
cooks, sprinkling its grape across the field.  
In the face of so many evils to positivity.  
Some upgrade but I live your ash like elixir.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the verdure wheatfields?  
And the sunshine smooth splattering its kiss and electrifying them full of  
archipeligos and oyster?  
  
Enjoy the many cold attempts to love  
the handsome death.  
There is arcane fortune in galloping it.  
A machine for image is the lack thereof.  
  
Motionless lunchtime and the explosive warmth of your body  
chain at the walls of my house.  
In the middle of the insatiable coral, many communist legless horses.  
Shall we move on?  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
stand of lemons and  
crimson cars  
and the iridescent starlights of his native land?  
Sought and then loved in the region.  
Starry empire. The line functions to dawn an architecture  
to its environment.  
It was a misunderstood business of oxide and nougats.  
The esoteric pasture gave it love.  
  
Our new sea water, our original sweetnes squares.  
Our new cathedral, our wonderful stars in  
the sky squares.
