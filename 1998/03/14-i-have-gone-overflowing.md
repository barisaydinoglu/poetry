I Have Gone Overflowing
-----------------------
Your tryst is a evening star filled with weak river bank. Behind the wetting moths.  
Nothing but that evening star of forests.  
A transparent sun rise carries.  
My decisive brain weaves you always.  
Next to marine water and  
transluscent transparent warmths.
