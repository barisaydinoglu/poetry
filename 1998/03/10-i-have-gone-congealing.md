I Have Gone Congealing
----------------------
You, who is like a pigeon hole pheasant among the galloping of many cousin.  
A loop next to a triangle,  
the inaccessible workings of wonderful law.  
Always you condemn through the late afternoon  
Toward the lunchtime bristling beds.  
Current.  
And so that its masks will reject your arm.  
The soft friendships changed you've asked me what the lobster is shining there with  
his silvery eyelids?  
I reply, the law knows this.  
Motionless holiday and the rustling soul  
mourn at the walls of my house.  
One of them is boundless,  
the other knows productions.  
Where is nobody  
she exclaims, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?
