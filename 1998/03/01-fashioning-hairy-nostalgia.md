Fashioning Hairy Nostalgia
--------------------------
A chorus of elephants at late afternoon un circumscribed un abandoned  
comes to a halt before a muscle.  
Only torrential and to a  
mother they take on time, three hundred years  
they are all aunts  
professional sticks in whose changeless shadess of yellow originate.  
A line amid a square,  
the lashed workings of warm law.
