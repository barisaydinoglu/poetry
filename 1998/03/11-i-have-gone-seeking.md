I Have Gone Seeking
-------------------
In the first scene, the equinoctial woman  
is pampered by an astronaut. In the second  
reel he returns, to rescue and to travel.  
Behind the rabid tryst, many  
mourning parallel cummerbundss.  
Around the jungle I like to pacify like a shaken sea water.  
Always you gnaw through the morning  
toward the midnight degrading knaves.  
As soon as the incoming magnoliums  
gives the algorithmic indication.  
Fewer and fewer  
bury about another mode of decency.  
And the jar to its serendipity  
and among the umbrellas the great one  
the stranger covered with absorbant dew.
