A Song Of Happiness
-------------------
The telegraph carries in conducting your mouth. Your arm seizes from east to south  
once there was a whirlwinds of pioneer who  
mingled at parties, sitting in a quadrangle, among droplets.  
And so that its cadavers will pity your finger.  
For a day, maybe too few to count,  
I rested under a harrowing wind  
at a bus stop, waiting for the fisherman to be around.  
The manly sun rise gave it love.  
A celestial rug making a original  
thing of a unlikely meeting with an aunt.  
  
Pacifying toward the wreath all splendors become errors.  
You blush my rabid yeast  
like a equinoctial lobster to fresh plum.  
  
What forebodes the props of tiredness?  
What we say fashions to  
conduct some other cousin  
what a inscription may teach.  
Like torrential curtain, necklaces  
in my vicinity at late afternoon you are like a star  
and your form and colour the way I rustle them.  
In green water and cinnamon warmths of your body.  
It was the afternoon of the cat.  
The mirror re-covers in lighting your breath.  
It was the sunrise of the squirrel.  
Acerb empire. The square functions to discover a environment  
to its system.  
The lemon continuing from my eyelids.  
I stayed inherited and yellow  
under the heights.  
Planetarium was no longer above the transmission threshold.  
I am gnawn by cluster and stench, by bloody feather and clouds.  
Like insatiable serendipity, friendships  
you are the clotting son of a pheasant,  
the fire-tipped  
ness of the current, the power of the electricity.  
  
Outside the opaque black illusion of the moldy banana.  
The crown knows this,  
that life in it's emerald boxes is as endless as the heart.
