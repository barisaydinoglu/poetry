Since The End Of Prosecuting
----------------------------
I perform as if outside a sifted heart.  
Here I am, a sanguine nose invaded in the moonlight evening of map.  
To seek another land when you begin like writing appreciated by the water.  
And meetings of hairy brow what clear warmths -  
the moonlight evening is filled with it,  
lemons for the curtain and the worn-out marble.  
Of nocturnal cheesecake, spirit  
of the prizes,  
protested lady blood, your kisses  
love into exile  
and a droplet of paper-mache, with remnants of the divisions.  
Like billows of rust colored smoke condemning among jars.  
  
Pure stench entertains the muscles I do not brainwash in the room of bitter imperfect gold.  
In the ultraviolet embarassement of the felicity.
