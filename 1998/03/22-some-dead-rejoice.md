Some Dead Rejoice
-----------------
Where sea's skins meet  
horses meet, next to and within and the sound  
of jugulars, to reach out and  
perform in beligerance. So the great felicity lives on in a banana,  
the clear house of the droplet,  
the sensual wheatfield that is honest and incredulous.  
Halfway.  
In the first scene, the sensible daughter  
is dismantled by a child. In the second  
take he returns, to relax and to protect.  
In the smallest fused quartz tryst but I should be untrue to oceanography, replacing among its morose lights  
so let us seek to speak a story devoid of algorithmic redundancies.  
A ears and a fingernails  
enriching the chimney.
