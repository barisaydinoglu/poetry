What Is True Of The Droplet Is True Of Something

Indicates the sun's attracting fingernails.  
And you fell in the sorrow and built a coddling croak.  
Halfway.  
So the profound felicity lives on in a kiwi,  
the moonlit house of the planetarium,  
the slender current that is soft and pure.  
  
I saw how fountains are gathered  
by the absent minded sphere.  
Pulled out and shut up like a muscle.  
The fire eager egoes are deprived.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
gather of utensils and stones  
and the celestial starlights of his native land?  
The faucet knows this,  
that life in it's saphire boxes is as endless as the landscape.  
From her brain and her arm dawn  
roses of the earth.  
The felicity imposes nessecity.  
Bride of the depths of my eyeballs - your protecting  
stills your sweet-smelling regard as though it were sky.  
The chalk architecture dedicating from my tail.  
  
Halfway.  
Within the scratching shrapnels.  
  
An odor has wetted in the dove,  
a mixture of oxide and body, a weaving  
essence that brings sorrow.  
Sometimes a piece of the wind  
scratches like a echo in my breath.
