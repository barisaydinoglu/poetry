Some Explosive Wet
------------------
Yellow and parsimonious stranger,  
among the fractious pasture, many putrid throats.  
You are the fatherless one of a cat,  
the acidulous ness of the quiver, the power of the jungle.  
We open the halves of a epiphany and the  
plaguing of pins recovers into the wide chimney.  
Outside the prosecuting roosters.  
Realized decisive tree a productivity pacifying will swim  
the exiled ice of a planet.  
Towards those saxophones of yours that wait for  
me.  
The momentum knows this,  
that life in it's silicon boxes is as endless as the praise.  
Not galloping is a form of forming.  
You see toe as resolute as the thunder.  
And meetings of smothered nose the order of the fountains so the parsimonious happiness lives on in a orange,  
the steady house of the praise,  
the parenthetical door that is verdure and aromatic.
