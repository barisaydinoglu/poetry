Since The End Of Chirping
-------------------------
Transparent brambles of conspirator,  
silvery seams above a imperalist horse.  
There are no explications but boneless cycles of snow and cashmire  
spheres of soft harsh graphite.  
Like the clotting broken glass of lakes my solute eyeballs recovers you always.  
One of them is thick,  
the other knows productions.  
Where is someone  
he says, and when can we  
see what  
is going to happen?  
But the lighthouse fashioned the memory.  
The fire-tipped toucan builds in the hopeful pamphlets.  
A bicycle is not enough to imprison me and keep me  
from the moonlight evening of your human secrets.  
I'd do it for the fragrance of strawberry in which you appreciate  
for the phemonanas of yellow you've conducted.  
The lunchtime waves you in its mortal heat.
