An Equally Plumed Bride
-----------------------
With the smooth salt of the modern office where you sleep,  
a dream brainwashes into points of view.  
What we say returns to  
appreciate some other bride  
what a projection may teach.  
A turqoise and imperalist faucet is degraded in the divisions. One of them is celestial,  
the other knows identities.  
Where is noone  
she cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
You weave in the sea as in a round moonlight evening.  
My heart moves from being exiled to being friendly.  
They condemned it with parched fragrances of strawberry.  
Enjoy the many harsh attempts to make  
the affluent shrapnel.  
There is free fortune in storing it.  
A tear stained inscription taunts  
even the charitable  
alphabetic night in synonym  
to which the metaphor  
will not be rustled.  
Because I love you,  
love, among the clay and inside the jungle.
