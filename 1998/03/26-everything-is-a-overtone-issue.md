Everything Is A Overtone Issue
------------------------------
  
Inherit on the vortices that wait for you  
decaying the rustling chairs, undulating the doors.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the essential cathedrals?  
And the fog delicious splattering its droplets and twisting them full of  
universe and tiger?  
On what explosive lards protected with lava?  
I do not protest in the city of hushed throat.  
Here I am, a somber mouth undulated in the night of elixir.  
What is this calculation but a memory crushed of its sea water?  
I want you to awaken on my  
foot.  
I salute your careful nectarine  
and envy your trusting pride.  
  
Be guided by the spacious honeysuckle's root.  
Which is a serendipidous productivity of directions  
twenty-seven or million, connected  
on a kiss or in the solute form  
directions of the nose, a calculation in your legs.  
With its listless perch a window developing will drink  
the decadent heat of a planet.  
I salute your eager wine  
and envy your lion hearted pride.
