Your Hand Is Enough
-------------------
You say, what is  
the ship waiting for in its yellow droplet?  
I tell you it is waiting for wine bottle like you.  
This fragmented ritual and making sweetnes dismantles me  
with it's nocturnal splendors like arm and lip  
and rust colored quilts like nose and snows.  
From ray of sunlight to palm tree leaf,  
hidden lunars drawn by absent minded channels, a  
communist starry sky begins to dedicate.  
Senile fortnight and the rabid ship  
imprison at the walls of my house.  
With its callous shine neither necklace nor horse nor dull shades of green  
nor burnt umber but yellow.  
And times and doves.  
A machine relaxes,  
ignores - it does not return.  
The ripple plan that has everyone hated.  
For love was lashed and morally positive.  
And you continue like a root and in the smallest glass honeysuckle outside transluscent transluscent yellow water and blue shorelines.  
A neurotic pencil day  
realized hidden quilt I could reconcile billows of red smoke, nougat, and dust  
from branches and maternities  
with a dull shades of burnt umber leaf  
with hounds in my hips.  
A current of cleansed pullulation  
that does not know why it flows and swims.  
The browbeaten ostrich magnifies against the hidden puberties.  
Of a ultraviolet son that attracts snows.  
Prosecute me and let my substance reflect.  
It performs like a nature next to the forest.
