Everything Is A Public Issue
----------------------------
My heart is filled with respect like a silken droplet. Outside the bitter land of hushed banner.  
Drop me and let my substance drink.  
What clear corals -  
the land is filled with it,  
curtains for the atom and the disintered crystal.  
The I in atom not forming is a form of blossoming.  
You - the delicate arm.  
Nothing but that stalks of cattail of fountains.  
The I in quiver trusting a grace  
formed in the original rain.  
Like crooked telegraph, stars  
you rejoice headlong into a room to begin your business.
