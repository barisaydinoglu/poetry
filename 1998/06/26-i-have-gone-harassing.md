I Have Gone Harassing
---------------------
What is this sequence but a memory prosecuted of its doors?  
Be guided  
by the irreducable poppy's soul.  
Among transparent water and marine ivory architectures.  
A image swims,  
mutates - it does not return.  
Neither deep brown lake nor goblet nor turqoise  
nor yellow but cinnamon.  
A transparent foam flies.  
You make my rambunctious vortex  
like a warm oyster to fresh wine.  
It was a sifted business of smoke and bloodied rusted nails.  
Showering from obscene gold.  
Towards those goblets of yours that wait for  
me.  
  
Warm empire. The square functions to continue an architecture  
to its environment.  
The blade treads on its delirious mare  
performing cashmire autumns over the sea.  
  
On what bitter abyss reflected with water?  
Only pencil, just the  
book, nothing but  
it. Droplet.  
An odor has lived outside the productivity,  
a mixture of shortcut and body, a seizing  
candle that brings embarassement.  
We get the hearing  
they must lots to carry  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but lards.  
Perhaps they are not shattered.  
I saw how hooves are wetted  
by the unguessed salt.  
Carry me onto your boat - the fruit of my mosaic -  
sweetnes of a compounded sticky love.  
The nail gallops on its rustling mare  
performing cinnamon branches over the jungle.  
  
A muzzled autumn day  
around the cluster of the room where you sleep,  
a dream loiters into languages.  
A careful thunder of fragrances of strawberry.
