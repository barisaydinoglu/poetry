A Ship To Pulse The Sea's Skins You Chirp
-----------------------------------------
A lunar enchanting will grow  
the mourning sky of a planet. What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
And you filtered in the beligerance and relaxed a dying cleft.  
Because I love you, love, with the electricity and next to the earth.  
A language drinks,  
soddens - it does not return.
