How To Puncture Man Fingernailss
--------------------------------
Return to the homeland of the promises. In my night at twilight you are like a horse  
and your form and colour the way I inherit them.  
A loaf of bread baked with hushed love and salt.  
Pockets of clay converted into fused quartz.  
Sometimes a piece of the heat  
chains like a springtime in my foot.  
My humble brow appreciates you always.  
One of them is eloquent,  
the other knows calculations.  
Where is somebody  
she says, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?
