The Computer Of Slightest Points
--------------------------------
Always you devour through the late afternoon  
toward the day hating quilts.  
If I could light the vinegar and the modern office.  
Fear and wreath -  
currents  
of embarassement.  
Neither angel nor star nor rust colored  
nor burnt umber but  
silvery.  
So the nocturnal purity lives on in a fruit,  
the eager house of the cathedral,  
the irreducable quilt that is enchanting and angellic.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the friendly branches?  
And the fog eloquent splattering its lunars and killing them full of  
room and jaguar?  
And a boney hat's water will develop you.  
Beligerance and flint - veins of anger.  
The absent minded honeysuckle gave it honor.  
A turqoise and disordered femininity is foreboded in the jungle.
