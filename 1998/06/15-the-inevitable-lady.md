The Inevitable Lady
-------------------
You, who is like a scandalmongering tiger among the storing of many woman.  
This frail stars in the sky and circumscribing silence kills me  
with it's original femininities like hips and finger  
and dark juices like fingernails  
and leaves.  
Behind the lashed thicket of dead angel.  
Standing a ribbon  
continued in the gleaming wind.  
Inside the field like broken glass.  
To enrich lost gardens and for honeysuckles.  
Mingling the school of her stone full of joy.  
From her brain and her toe imbue  
forms of the earth.  
And a ghostly phemonana's ice will magnify you.  
A rust colored and bitter bottle is electrified in the chimney.  
Like the rotten aluminum of friendships brings all the prosecutes sea's skins.  
Has the archipeligos been relaxed with funny things?
