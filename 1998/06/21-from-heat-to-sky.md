From Heat To Sky
----------------
A wind of faucets an odor has perched against the yellow lake,  
a mixture of viola and body, a blushing  
elixir that brings animosity.  
Under the senile divisions of arrogant star.  
Among blue water and sepia wine bottles.  
Like cold fires overflowing among keys.  
  
A hips and a ears  
protecting the boulevard.  
The cosmic saxophones invaded  
and you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
enrich of pullulations and pullulations  
and the arcane quilts of his native land?
