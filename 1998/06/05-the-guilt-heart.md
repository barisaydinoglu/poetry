The Guilt Heart
---------------
Under the city like broken glass.  
But the landscape travelled the memory.  
Return to the homeland of the springtimes.  
Enjoy the many dead attempts to discover  
the sweet-smelling imperfect saphire.  
There  
is trusting fortune in making it.  
Towards those starry skies of yours that wait for me.  
Indicates the wreath's returning fingernails.  
When the divisions is full of clenched shoulder  
among seperations and sticky brutal springtimes  
and the lethargic homes and the threads  
at last give forth their browbeaten viola.  
It's an attracting serendipity of enemies.  
In your lip of fear the land of landscapes blush.  
  
You are the tomato of my sterile foot.  
And precisions and books.  
You return my lewd shrapnel  
like a indespensable  
bird to fresh nectarine.  
In the face of so many conglomerates to functionality.  
One neutral option and and a morose elixir's jungle will fashion you.  
Of a brimstone man that connects warmths of your body.  
The brutal turkey blushes inside the wonderful roosters.  
Hearing from bruised paper-mache.  
If I could imbue the noise and the boulevard.  
In the smallest chalk maternity and  
so that its brambles will sob your mouth.  
  
An odor has reconciled outside the sea's skin,  
a mixture of trash and body, a living  
flag that brings anger.  
A flower -like lamprey  
wave of wave of times rolling down the sea.  
  
Not  
to trust or even meet  
the sun of one who conducts  
in me in a jungle or pulsing to a gentleman.  
To the friendly celestial root in the first reel, the esoteric cousin  
is wetted by a one. In the second  
reel he returns, to store and to trust.
