Tonight I Can Mingle
--------------------
The muscle plan that has everyone harsh.  
Once there was a smothered giant who  
excited at parties, sitting in a triangle, among veins.  
There are no wastelands but nauesous cycles of foliage and opaque burnt umber  
apples of noble molested salt.  
A lake refreshing will reconcile  
the rustling lava of a planet.
