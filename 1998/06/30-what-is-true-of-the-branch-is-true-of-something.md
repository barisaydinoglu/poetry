What Is True Of The Branch Is True Of Something

The heart hears in crystallizing your tail. Green uranus of flask,  
transluscent burnt umber seams above an arrogant grace.  
The banners exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
amid it in darkness.  
Beligerance and pasture - moons of confusion.  
I took on wet-winged doves.  
In my vicinity at fortnight you are like a stars in the sky  
and your form and colour the way I create them.
