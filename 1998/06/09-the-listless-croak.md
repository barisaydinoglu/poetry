The Listless Croak
------------------
There ought to be a heart of a lovely femininity fashioning in a region.  
The echo knows this,  
that life in it's paper-mache boxes is as endless as the apple.  
Only windy and to a  
cousin they take on time, thousand years  
a detail dawns,  
loathes - it does not return.  
And behind my hammock, during the afternoon, I woke up naked  
and full of sincerity.  
Everything harsh with celestial voices, the salt of the goblet  
and piles of slender bread next to morning.  
Indicates the acrobat's weaving ears.
