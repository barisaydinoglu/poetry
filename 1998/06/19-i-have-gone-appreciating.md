I Have Gone Appreciating
------------------------
And outside my hammock, during the day, I woke up naked  
and full of pride.  
And wells and eddies.  
This putrid  
saxophone and reflecting forest falls me  
with it's spacious roses like eyeballs and tail  
and dull shades of cinnamon foliages like heart and mirrors.  
Multitude of forests!  
In and out of the transluscent yellow the burnt umber and the sepia  
conversations of bird feathers, the recitation  
of aspens we call delicate key.  
The furious root that promises in your ripple.  
A wine bottle -like croak  
always you abolish through the fortnight  
toward the night erupting lands.  
The monastic man  
rises in the electrical morning.  
Which is a natural fountain of directions  
three hundred or thousand, rejoiced  
on a kiss or in the real fragrance of strawberry  
directions of the hips, a calculation in your fingers.  
On what wayside circumstances refreshed with lava?  
We get the hearing  
they must lots to reconcile  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but stains.  
Perhaps they are not throttled.  
And a weak necklace's sky will respond you.  
It was the late afternoon of the tiger.  
A loaf of bread baked with tremulous  
joy and salt.  
It was the fortnight of the crab.  
Brings all the mutates serenities.  
What irreducable faucets -  
the modern office is filled with it,  
waves for the lake and the weak silk.  
Sordid midnight and the demonic ritual  
chain at the walls of my house.
