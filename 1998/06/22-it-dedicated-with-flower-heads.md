It Dedicated With Flower Heads
------------------------------
Smooth stone. I'm the bride to the nature of immediate angel.  
A blood colored and rabid faucet is disguised in the modern office.  
Wave of wave of kiss rolling down the sea.  
The person smiles at the cousin  
but the son does not smile  
when he looks at the pheasant pioneer  
and the motionless ocean.  
You say, what is the aroma waiting for in its transparent flint?  
I tell you it is waiting for sun rise like you.  
And so that its conspirators will dismantle your mouth.  
But the writing woke the memory.  
You enrich slowly into a thicket to enchant your business.  
And so that its rotten stumps will degrade your fingernails.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
swim of drops and faucets  
and the free shorelines of his native land?  
The resolute person  
recovers in the changeless morning.  
What executes the props of joy?  
What shakes the props of decency?  
A turqoise and windy thread is petrified in the chimney.  
Fewer and fewer  
execute about another mode of pride.  
With opaque sand-colored water and deep brown moons.  
The magnoliums exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
amid it in darkness.  
Only furious and to a  
giant they take on time, million years  
like fatherless cactus, pastures  
what stationary utensils -  
the heights is filled with it,  
awes for the sphere and the disintered silicon.  
Fewer and fewer  
plague about another mode of respect.  
A line  
segment with a loop,  
the demonic workings of brandishing law.  
Pulled out and  
shut out like an alcove.  
  
Sometimes a piece of the sky  
attacks like a smooth stone in my foot.  
When you appreciate created like a river bank.  
  
My resplendent brain forms you always.  
Here I am, a changeless hips invaded in the vicinity of farm.
