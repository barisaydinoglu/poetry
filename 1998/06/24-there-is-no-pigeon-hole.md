There Is No Pigeon Hole

And the saxophone to its ripple  
and among the alcoves the deedy one  
the one covered with round pasture.  
It was the lunchtime of the cat.  
What slender branches -  
the night is filled with it,  
ships for the momentum and the sterile ivory.  
It was the sunset of the bird.
