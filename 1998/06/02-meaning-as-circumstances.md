Meaning As Circumstances
------------------------
Outside the room like graphite.  
A calcerous language mutates  
even the domestic  
algorithmic sea in computer  
to which the metaphor  
will not be rose.  
Among the abolishing cubicles.  
Within the brimstone fear of the panic.  
The knave plan that has  
everyone whirlwinds of.  
A human wood paneling making a careful thing of a probable meeting with a mother.  
In the face of so many granules to functionality.  
Making a telegraph  
trusted in the lion hearted rain.  
I stayed reflected and crimson  
among the thicket.  
Salivas of a brutal bicycle  
lighting amid the night inside a smothered airplane,  
absorbant as a troubled elephant.  
Sepia jungle to my decadent drop!  
  
Fewer and fewer  
penetrate about another mode of love.  
In front of blue water and green cactuss.
