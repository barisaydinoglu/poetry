What Is True Of The Trouser Is True Of Something
------------------------------------------------
Because I love you, love, around the wind and next to the wind.  
A sun -like ash  
not playing is a form of waking.  
Amid the opaque gray fear of the trash.  
We get the abstraction  
they must lots to chirp  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but extinctions.  
Perhaps they are not abducted.  
A triangle amid a quadrangle,  
the whirlwinds of workings of warm law.  
Seperations of a shifty raft  
entertaining among the universe amid a browbeaten vessel,  
stationary as a decadent crab.  
My comfortable brain blossoms you always.  
Mix on the shortcuts that wait for you  
chaining the molested chairs, burying the doors.  
On what senile torrents mingled with wind?  
I want you to perch on my mouth.  
Enjoy the many frightened attempts to form  
the noble pin.  
There is fleeting fortune in mixing it.
