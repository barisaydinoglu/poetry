Sons Of A Lewd Country
----------------------
So the lovely love lives on in a banana,  
the profound house of the serendipity,  
the naked tiger that is winged and thick.  
Embarassement and pasture - forms of panic.  
In your foot of anger the region of roses rustle.  
Not the sepia moment  
when the morning recovers the fleshes.  
Wave of wave of horses rolling down the sea.  
Where roots meet  
femininities meet, within and around and the sound  
of ghosts, to reach out and form in animosity.  
  
But I should be untrue to computer science, mourning among its chaotic leaves  
so let us begin to divulge a story without side redundancies.  
The lake degrades, the path of brandishing  
flows with.
