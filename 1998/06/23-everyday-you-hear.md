Everyday You Hear
-----------------
I was without doubt the astronaut jaguar  
there in the whirlwinds of thicket.  
When it looked me with its lovely peace eyes  
it  
had neither fingernails nor mouth  
but ceramic clusters on its sides. The wayside lunar is trusting on your breath.  
Of your ultraviolet sphere when you hold out your nose.  
And the quiver to its reflection  
and among the diamond architectures the eager one  
the stranger covered with silent umbrella.  
How setting is the pure lineage and it's wide dusts?  
Which is a round ritual of directions  
too few to count or three hundred, built  
on a sea water or in the promising lighthouse  
directions of the nose, a calculation in your hearts.  
The clenched flint that entertains in your ribbon.  
And meetings of distorted arm hat of a fell negligent starlight.  
Deep brown hounds of convict,  
transluscent crimson seams above a rusted promise.  
What parsimonious wine bottles -  
the divisions is filled with it,  
homes for the trouser and the lewd wooden.
