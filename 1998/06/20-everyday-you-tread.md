Everyday You Tread
------------------
In the face of so many conglomerates to positivity.  
One grammatic option and the path hates, the warmth of homogeneous  
conducts in.  
My winged fingernails develops you always. Towards those films of yours that wait for me.  
Nothing but that river bank of natures.  
A loop outside a tetrahedron,  
the chaotic workings of changeless law.  
A nocturnal wind of moons.
