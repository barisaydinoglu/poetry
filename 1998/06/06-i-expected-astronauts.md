I Expected Astronauts
---------------------
There are no conspirators but mechanical cycles of laminated sign and cashmire  
rituals of resplendent demonic graphite. The necklace continuing from my eyeballs.  
I am pampered by tree and trash barge, by belt and mist.  
  
In my chimney at fortnight you are like a poppy  
and your form and colour the way I trust them.  
The guilt lobster flies in the profound pigeon holes.  
Panics of a sterile bicycle  
performing outside the chimney amid a rotten wheel,  
musical as a parched turkey.  
Against the area like iron.  
When the thicket is full of forceful ears  
next to cubicles and wayside silent sea's skins  
and the sterile graces and the old warrior's medals  
at last give forth their muzzled howl.  
A loaf of bread baked with delirious decency and salt.  
  
What is this antenna but a memory petrified of its precisions?  
And a rotten sea's skin's mud will pacify you.
