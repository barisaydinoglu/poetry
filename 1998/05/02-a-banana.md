A Banana

From her hand and her tail respond  
droplets of the earth. Pure corruption relaxes the warmths one alphabetic option and you fashion slowly into a jungle to trust your business.  
Multitude of mirrors!  
In and out of the cashmire the green and the blue  
Of a brimstone god that blushes smooth graphites.  
You say, what is the laminated sign waiting for  
in its cashmire dove?  
I tell you it is waiting for sphere like you.  
She is in the middle of us at this moment of first fluttering.  
Because I love you, love, inside the water and behind the lava.
