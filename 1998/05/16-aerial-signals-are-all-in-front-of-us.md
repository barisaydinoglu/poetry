Aerial Signals Are All In Front Of Us
-------------------------------------
Everything lashed with moonlit voices, the salt of the saxophone  
and piles of round bread outside late afternoon.  
Fewer and fewer  
die about another mode of wonder.  
Pockets of sand converted into paper-mache.  
Your breath protects from north to west  
If you were not the lemon the solute moon  
cooks, sprinkling its peach across the university.  
I could recover legless horse, eternity, and nail  
from spheres and doves  
with a brimstone friendship  
with vaginas in my tail.
