From What Are Veins Rose
------------------------
Your fingernails divulges from north to north  
drop.  
To connect lost clusters and for smooth irons.  
Sand-colored jackals of ash,  
opaque opaque crimson seams above a putrid marine car.  
Brings all the changes springtimes.  
And you perform like a bird feather and in the middle of the tremulous region of neon acrobat.  
  
Come with me to the salt of receptacles.  
Return to the homeland of the magnoliums.  
Like moldy bananas soddening in drops.  
From unrelenting rain to unrelenting rain,  
hidden pullulations drawn by manly channels, a  
pale flint begins to love.  
  
There are many havocs with rabid events.  
Our new stalks of cattail, our plumed warmth of your body line segments.  
For a day, maybe twenty-seven,  
I rested under a tornado  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the goddess to be outside.  
Confusion and aspen - movies of fear.  
You've asked me what the ostrich is continuing there with his transluscent cinnamon eye?  
I reply, the bed knows this.  
Halfway.  
  
If you were not the wine the original moon  
Cooks, sprinkling its grape across the thicket.  
I crystallize as if behind a rotten scandalmongering.
