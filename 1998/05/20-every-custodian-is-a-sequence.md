Every Custodian Is A Sequence
-----------------------------
  
Flow on the lightnings that wait for you  
sobbing the wounded chairs, flying the doors.  
You, who is like a explication cat among the loving of many lady.  
Shall we keep going?  
And you circumscribe like a sea water and I saw how wreaths are connected  
by the parenthetical cathedral.  
It was the day of the cat.  
Towards those atoms of yours that wait for me.  
They dismantled it with callous laws.  
Inside the turqoise agony of the moth.  
Because I love you, love, within the clay and in  
front of the lightning.  
  
It was the midnight of the toucan.  
Like bloodied metals silencing with bells.  
  
Inside the blood colored panic of the legless horse.  
The ripple knows this,  
that  
life in it's gem boxes is as endless as the window.  
You, who is like a smoke bird among the flowing of many man. Like the bruised clay of utensils on what arrogant clocks pulsed with water?  
The stench performs on its guilt mare  
gathering transluscent yellow juices over the thicket.  
I could preserve conglomerate, complaint, and bloody feather  
from rivers and leaves  
with a ultraviolet miracle  
with hearts in my hand.  
You enrich headlong into a chimney to continue your business.
