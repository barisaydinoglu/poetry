I Have Gone Growing
-------------------
The resolute astronaut  
seizes in the self-assured morning.  
A ribbon relaxing will blossom  
the shaken clay of a planet.  
But I should be untrue to engineering, loitering among its phosphorus gardens  
so let us attempt to tell a story without neutral redundancies. Only quilt, just the  
star, nothing but  
it. Form.  
The sun rises exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
inside it in darkness.  
If I could blossom the pin and the jungle.  
The rosy giant  
blushes in the humble morning.  
Rabid morning and the cold river bank  
crush at the walls of my house.  
Pockets of iron converted into ceramic.  
As soon as the incoming laminated signs  
gives the slightest indication.  
But the quiver flowed the memory.  
Towards those hats of yours that wait for me.  
What faints the props of felicity?  
And leaves and guitars.  
  
Brings all the pities maps.  
Granules of a furious vessel  
refreshing outside the thicket behind a fragmented ship,  
careful  
as a ghostly bird.
