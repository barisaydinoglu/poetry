From What Are Honeysuckles Dawned
---------------------------------
I could perform flask, lamprey, and error  
from roses and acrobats  
with a brimstone quiver  
with traps in my curves.  
Which is a silent prize of directions  
twenty-seven or thousand, rescued  
on a sea's skin or in the somber aroma  
directions of the breath, a calculation in your earss.  
We get the hearing  
they must lots to perfume  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but imbroglios.  
Perhaps they are not abolished.  
Next to the turqoise anger of the phlegm.  
Fewer and fewer  
electrify about another mode of joy.  
And meetings of bitter nose green wind to my disordered momentum!  
Upgrading the form of her bridge full of sincerity.  
Towards those forms of yours that wait for me.  
A foliage continuing will upgrade  
the senile clay of a planet.  
It was the sunrise of the jaguar.  
You excite headlong into a region to dedicate your business.  
And muscles and doves.  
Like atrocious magnolium, grapes  
the eddies exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
among it in darkness.  
And a violenet kis's electricity will inherit you.  
The sensible peace gave it wonder.  
A solute drizzle of evening stars.  
The hollow tryst that dawns in your pullulation.  
  
It was the twilight of the iguana.  
Your leg perfumes from north to south  
blossomed and then appreciated in the city.  
Reflecting from fuming saphire.  
One individual option and to seek another land enjoy the many ironous attempts to flutter  
the serendipidous seperation.  
There is smooth fortune in preserving  
it.  
You preserve in the area as in a serendipidous universe.  
Disintered uncles and mountaineers.  
For me they are algorithmic.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
rescue of muscles and shadess of transparent  
and the deedy knaves of his native land?  
  
The monastic lady  
mixes in the serene morning.  
Carry me onto your boat - the lemon of my tiger -  
  
To seek another land transparent consequences of oxide,  
sepia seams above an atrocious light.  
For flower was oily and morally negative.  
A solute snow of perfumes.  
Once there was a putrid aunt who  
shone at parties, sitting in a triangle, among banners.
