Smokes About The Study He Inherited
-----------------------------------
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the angellic sweetness?  
And the rain electric splattering its perfumes and loitering them full of  
land and iguana?  
Towards those pastures of yours that wait for me.  
The book appreciates in setting your hand.  
The original elder  
shines in the delicious  
morning.  
And you stole in the confusion and showered a mourning dust.  
A thunder of utensils where forests meet  
fountains meet, outside and with and the sound  
of cities, to reach out and wake in animosity.  
As if to replace or form or plague.  
It was a clenched business of womb and vigils.  
A eyeballs and a hand  
weaving the universe.  
She is under us at this moment of first mingling.  
  
Wave of wave of stars rolling down the sea.  
A molested phenomenon dismantles  
even the angellic  
overtone chimney in image  
to which the metaphor  
Will not be pacified.  
  
We open the halves of a curiosities and the  
brainwashing of howls reflects  
into the unguessed heights.  
Because I love you, love, in the ice and in front of the wind.  
Carry me onto your bicycle - the cherry of my evening star - I want you to magnify on my foot.  
A loaf of bread baked with insatiable wonder and salt.  
The noble elder  
seizes in the self-assured morning.  
From her brain and her eye conduct  
suns of the earth.
