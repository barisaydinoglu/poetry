A Iridescent Substance
----------------------
Around  
the modern office I like to reflect like a callous smooth brick.  
Draw from it the smothered  
computer of its own projection.  
Outside the lashed divisions of fractious kis.  
Flowed and then pacified in the moonlight evening.  
Be guided by the parenthetical serendipity's salt.  
Tiredness is gone, the subject has rejoiced.  
  
Everything chaotic with eloquent voices, the salt of the mist  
and piles of delicious bread among lunchtime.  
In front of the cashmire nose of the jungle.  
Parenthetical, saphire flower head!  
I was without doubt the uncle cat  
there in the sordid chimney.  
When it looked me with its balanced branch eyes  
it had neither arm nor brow  
but paper-mache warmths on its sides.  
  
In the face of so many oblivions to positivity.
