A Song Of Beligerance
---------------------
They overflowed it with tremulous banners.  
Draw from it the sifted  
metaphor of its own inscription.  
  
Perfume on the shrapnels that wait for you  
drowning the rabid chairs, taunting the doors.  
The mourning propeller that flies in your dew.  
  
It was the lunchtime of the squirrel.  
Steady empire. The tetrahedron functions to fly an architecture  
to its environment.  
It was the late afternoon of the jaguar.  
But the poppy heard the memory.
