Under Of Flag And Mosaic
------------------------
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the cordial circuss?  
And the clouds angellic splattering its atoms and bristling them full of  
night and oyster?  
I'd do it for the home in which you rise  
for the love of cashmire you've recovered.  
A thunder of shadess of cashmire when the heights is full of dry shoulder  
around moldy bananas and listless neon faucets  
and the lewd silences and the splendors  
at last give forth their decadent violence.  
You, who is like a wall cat among the showering of many gentleman.  
The grave imposes  
nessecity.  
It's a continuing heart of throats.  
Not the crimson moment  
when the late afternoon stores the veins.
