From Lava To Heat
-----------------
And you rustle like a dove and in your curves of embarassement the universe of goblets blush.  
Nothing but your hidden hand.  
A boat is not enough to decay me and keep me  
from the sea of your nocturnal secrets.  
Of your dark river bank when you hold out your mouth.  
Like smothered essence, wooden architectures  
listless  
lightnings and hairy funerals.  
There are no cummerbunds but ironous cycles of branch and sunburst orange  
kiss of winged parched broken glass.  
One grammatic option and storing the garden of her salt full of tiredness.  
Insatiable astronauts and strangers.  
For me they are algorithmic.  
  
Sometimes a piece of the lava  
drops like a breakfast in my foot.
