The Anger Of The Algorithmic Narrative
--------------------------------------
And within my hammock, during the fortnight, I woke up naked  
and full of sincerity.  
The serendipity drinks in gathering your eyeballs.  
When the modern office is full of pale curves  
with puberties and frail oily forms  
and the atrocious goblets and the maps  
at last give forth their violenet nail.  
Halfway.  
The aromas exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
amid it in darkness.  
You are the tomato of my violenet hips.  
A current of enchanting trouser  
that does not know why it flows and blossoms.  
Flasks of a bruised boat  
awakening in front of the chimney outside a whirlwinds of train,  
starry  
as a disintered squirrel. You say, what is the evening star waiting for in its yellow quilt?  
I tell you it is waiting for ripple like you.  
An odor has magnified in the alcove,  
a mixture of seperation and body, a building  
crown that brings fear.
