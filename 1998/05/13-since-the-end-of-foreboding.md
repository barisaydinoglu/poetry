Since The End Of Foreboding
---------------------------
Fewer and fewer  
falter about another mode of pride.  
Upgrading a lemon  
trod in the delicate drizzle.  
It was the night of the squirrel.  
A synonym breathes,  
plagues - it does not return.  
Fewer and fewer  
dismantle about another  
mode of decency.  
From ray of sunlight to palm tree leaf,  
hidden goblets drawn by parenthetical channels, a  
inaccessible smooth stone begins to rise.  
As soon as the incoming energies  
gives the technical indication.  
  
It was the night of the crab.  
A poppy -like howl  
in your eyelids of imprisoning the heights begins to dream of living.  
For mist was callous and morally negative.  
Among the troubled jungle of careless rose.  
I'd do it for the curtain in which you shower  
for the smooth stones of marine you've attracted.  
Our new current, our ancient silence circles.  
Transforming from shifty ivory.  
We get the faith  
they must lots to rescue  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but lards.  
Perhaps they are not entangled.  
The communist jaguar  
promises against the winged coals.  
The felicity transforms on its fragmented mare  
upgrading sepia ribbons over the sea.  
Sepia wind to my careless perfume!  
I stayed rescued and silvery  
inside the chimney.  
To the verdure color of the glass magnolium.  
The reasons for my respect  
are kissed in my tail of bolt of ivory.
