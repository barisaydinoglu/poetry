Song For The Mountaineer Of Windy Energies
------------------------------------------
For circus was calculating and morally positive.  
Carry me onto your airplane - the orange of my pullulation -  
sepia water to my bruised law!  
A spacious rug making a naked thing of a lucky meeting with an astronaut.  
I rustle as if inside a lonely trash.  
Next to transparent water and sand-colored graces.  
Burnt umber fire to my parched prize!  
When you mix seized like a cathedral.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the delicate affections?  
And the snow wonderful splattering its doors and drowning them full of  
archipeligos and lobster?  
The reasons for my respect  
are stood in my arm of bolt of diamond.
