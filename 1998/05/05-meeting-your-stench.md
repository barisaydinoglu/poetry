Meeting Your Stench
-------------------
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
Respect is gone, the subject has sought.  
Fewer and fewer  
imprison about another mode of wonder.  
I'd do it for the aroma in which you gather  
for the flutes of burnt umber you've began.  
Wave of wave of springtimes  
rolling down the sea.  
Multitude of smooth salts!  
In and out of the yellow the marine  
and the green  
our new landscape, our soft cathedral squares.  
The soft flower head gave it tiredness.  
You say, what is the bird feather waiting for in its burnt umber splendor?  
I tell you it is waiting for forest like you.  
From her mouth and her breath trust  
miracles of the earth.
