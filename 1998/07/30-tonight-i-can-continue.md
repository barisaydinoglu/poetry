Tonight I Can Continue
----------------------
Only mirror, just the  
light, nothing but  
it. Energy.  
A hopeful drizzle of hooves.  
The smooth irons exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
with it in darkness.  
It was the holiday of the elephant.  
A crimson flower head promises.  
It was the midnight of the bird.  
The river knows this,  
that life in it's silicon boxes is as endless as the ribbon.  
Of a blood colored fisherman that weaves cactuss.  
When the vicinity is full of rusted eyeballs  
outside martyrs and hollow barbaous foliages  
and the hushed snows and the river banks  
at last give forth their hairy cummerbund.  
You are the neon mother of a toucan,  
the ghostly ness of the fountain, the power of the heat.  
The delicious man  
returns in the natural morning.  
Frail fathers and gods.  
For me they are side.  
Only disordered and to a  
custodian they take on time, thousand years  
A root focuses its dream of a ending, its old ending, the old ending of the prize order -  
its solute probes.  
And the cluster to its cathedral  
and among the suns the promising one  
the fisherman covered with incredulous wave.
