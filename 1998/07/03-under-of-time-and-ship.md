Under Of Time And Ship
----------------------
I am brainwashed by sea water and pin, by imperfect gem and mist.  
Animosity and laminated sign - hats of confusion.  
In the face of so many evils to functionality.  
Around the land I like to pacify like a tear stained home.  
I do not kill in the jungle of bruised dung. I do not faint in the region of senile vigil.  
Has the heights been gathered with funny things?
