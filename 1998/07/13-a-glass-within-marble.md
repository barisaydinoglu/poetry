A Glass Within Marble
---------------------
They are all gentlemen  
professional beasts in whose velvety quilts originate.  
Showering an aroma  
drank in the steady thunder.  
And so that its wombs will fall your curves.  
Full stop.  
A quadrangle amid a square,  
the crooked workings of scrupulous law.  
Return to the homeland of the autumns.  
Full stop.  
Some chirp but I divulge your salt like lunar.  
Your shoulder responds from south to south  
and a negligent warmth's ice will wet you.  
There ought to be  
a echo of a boundless lighthouse exciting in a city.  
  
They are all sons  
professional cubicles in whose hidden threads originate.  
The heights around hers  
a history we speak in passing,  
with notions of respect  
and a passion for jouranlism and jouranlism  
it  
was the sunrise of the toucan.  
In the smallest silken kiss brandishing empire. The line functions to mingle a system  
to its architecture.  
And meetings of negligent nose within the dull shades of transparent panic of the invasion.  
  
It was the late afternoon of the lobster.  
In the face of so many legless horses to animosity.  
Creating toward the friendship a stationary snow of windows.  
It's a hearing tree of rotten stumps.  
  
When you divulge like breakfast awakened by the fire.  
Absurd shortcuts and putrid cadavers.
