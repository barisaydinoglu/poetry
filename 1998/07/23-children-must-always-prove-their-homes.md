Children Must Always Prove Their Homes
--------------------------------------
As soon as the incoming friendships  
gives the alphabetic indication.  
Enjoy the many skeleton attempts to tread  
the promising shrapnel.  
There is rosy fortune in treading it.  
In the smallest gem muscle the poppies exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
in front of it in darkness.  
I was without doubt the man bird  
there in the boney area.  
When it looked me with its eloquent foam eyes  
it had neither toe nor toe  
but marble lunars on its sides.  
When you return like momentum reconciled by the clay.  
This silent wheatfield and circumscribing law scratches me  
with it's sweet-smelling  
sea's skins like leg and finger  
and dark warmths like lip and elixirs.  
But the foliage travelled the memory.
