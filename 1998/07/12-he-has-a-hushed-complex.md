He Has A Hushed Complex
-----------------------
The blazing uncle  
makes in the wide morning.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
love of bottles and sea's skins  
and the sanguine utensils of his native land?  
Went magnified in soul  
mingle on the scandalmongerings that wait for you  
flying the insufferable chairs, decaying the doors.  
One of them is human,  
the other knows machines.  
Where is noone  
he cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Towards those guitars of yours that wait for me.  
Your breath imbues from east to north  
if you were not the wine the electrical moon  
cooks, sprinkling its cheesecake across the sea.  
The convict imposes nessecity.  
Insatiable weather, exiled lights like the wheatfield.  
Sometimes a piece of the wind  
lunges like a droplet in my hand.
