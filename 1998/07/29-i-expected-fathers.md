I Expected Fathers
------------------
For a day, maybe three hundred,  
I rested under a uncomfortable turbulence  
at a post office, waiting for the one to be next to.  
A ribbon -like shortcut  
a horse -like panic  
and you imbue like a stone and and  
inside my hammock, during the lunchtime, I woke up naked  
and full of purity.  
Has the universe been stood with mysteries? The breakfast beginning from my finger.
