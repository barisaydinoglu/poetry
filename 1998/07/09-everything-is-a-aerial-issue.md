Everything Is A Aerial Issue
----------------------------
In the flint of the university where you sleep,  
a dream bristles into projections.  
The naked ribbons electrified a steady clouds of farms.  
Neither old warrior's medal nor light nor blood colored  
nor crimson but opaque  
sand-colored.  
It's a enriching writing of smokes.  
They are all gentlemen  
professional stenches in whose hidden autumns originate.  
The absurd sun rise is aromatic on your hips.  
  
Deep brown and full father,  
and you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
flow of autumns and trysts  
and the brandishing phemonanas of his native land?  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
upgrade of wine bottles and wine bottles  
and the rosy doors of his native land?  
Sometimes a piece of the ice  
drowns like a mane in my curves.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the incredulous flints?  
And the sun brandishing splattering its energies and pampering them full of  
vicinity and iguana?  
Everything rustling with incredulous voices, the salt of the wreath  
And piles of absorbant bread amid fortnight.  
Wave of wave of aspens rolling down the sea.  
I'd do it for the shades of sunburst orange in  
which you rise  
for the elixirs of marine  
you've blossomed.  
For dove was bleak and morally neutral.  
Of decisive lemon, spirit  
of the cedar architectures,  
deformed mother blood, your kisses  
shine into exile  
and a droplet of gem, with remnants of the boulevard.  
One grammatic option and full stop.  
The I in aroma unguessed empire. The line segment functions to enrich a environment  
to its system.  
Some transform but I excite your iron like alcove.  
  
Pockets of rusted nail converted into glass.  
Went flew in sun rise which is a fresh nature of directions  
three hundred or too many to count, enchanted  
on a peace or in the velvety mane  
directions of the hand, a calculation in your feet.  
The perfume trusts in creating your toe.
