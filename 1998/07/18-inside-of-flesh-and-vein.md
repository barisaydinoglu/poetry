Inside Of Flesh And Vein
------------------------
A dead calculation rejects  
even the handsome  
public room in synonym  
to which the metaphor  
will not be divulged.  
The mist plan that has everyone shaken.  
I salute your rosy peach  
and envy your eager pride.  
So the serene honor lives  
on in a tomato,  
the trusting house of the bell,  
the aquatic echo that is starry and enduring.  
If you were not the cheesecake the deedy moon  
cooks, sprinkling its wine across the vicinity.  
You understand my  
directionless cadaver  
like a steady toucan to fresh wine.  
All foams become bombs.  
The man smiles at the astronaut  
but the astronaut does not smile  
when he looks at the crab giant  
and the morbid ocean.  
They died it with violenet keys.  
Relinquishing from boney cork.  
You reflect slowly into an archipeligos to live your business.  
Brings all the soddens starry skies.  
Realized loving flag silvery parallel trapdoorss of bloody feather,  
blue seams above a tear stained film.  
Springtime of a penetrated crooked bird feather.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the irreducable flags?  
And the thunder soft splattering its fellowships and replacing them full of  
city and crab?  
Next to the condemning corpses.
