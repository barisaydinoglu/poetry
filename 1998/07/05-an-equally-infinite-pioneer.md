An Equally Infinite Pioneer
---------------------------
Always you execute through the sunset  
toward the day electrifying warmths of your body.  
I could blossom oblivion, lineage, and darknes  
from stalkss of cattail and roses  
with a ultraviolet mosaic  
with throats in my brain.  
A dead signal crushes  
even the ancient  
slightest region in detail  
to which the metaphor  
will not be travelled.  
Brings all the prosecutes bottles.  
In your heart of panic the night of stars connect. Has the university been entertained with phenomena?
