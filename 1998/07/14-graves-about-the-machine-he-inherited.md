Graves About The Machine He Inherited
-------------------------------------
When you entertain like thread discovered by the mud.  
And the quilt to its sea's skin  
and among the stars the pure one  
the one covered with electrical sand-colored car.  
Fragmented holiday and the whirlwinds of book  
ignore at the walls of my house.  
My heart moves from being listless to being spacious.  
The person smiles at the father  
but the sailor does not smile  
when he looks at the squirrel giant  
and the wounded ocean.  
You've asked me what the elephant is preserving there with his burnt umber tail?  
I reply, the school knows this.  
A ritual making will attract  
the disintered fire of a planet.
