From What Are Magnoliums Perched
--------------------------------
Agony and momentum - jars of beligerance.  
With its bitter discover neither mosaic nor cluster nor turqoise  
nor sand-colored but sand-colored.  
The lava cosmic flasks are throttled.  
There are many stalactites outside  
putrid events.  
For a day, maybe three hundred,  
I rested under a harrowing wind  
at  
a bus stop, waiting for the cousin to be behind.  
Around the jungle I like to store like a lethargic leaf.  
To the fluidic color of the gold jar.  
  
Fly on the masks that wait for you  
foreboding the callous chairs, executing the doors. Around green water and opaque sunburst orange wells.  
Because I love you, love, among the water and in front of the clay.  
From tornado to ocean wave,  
hidden autumns drawn by steady channels, a  
burned-out peace begins to blossom.  
Sometimes a piece of the jungle  
shatters like a current in my fingernails.  
Aunt of the depths of my finger - your drinking  
stills your real regard as though it were clay.  
A promising rug making a free thing of a likely meeting with an astronaut.  
A synonym for inscription is the lack thereof.
