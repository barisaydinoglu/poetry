The Harsh Torrent
-----------------
Of naked lemon, spirit  
of the phemonanas,  
killed elder blood, your kisses  
perform into exile  
and a droplet of gold, with remnants of the city.  
I protect as if outside a dilute depth.  
From uncomfortable turbulence to pillow of fog,  
hidden old warrior's medals drawn by iridescent channels, a  
inaccessible eddy begins to blossom.  
I'd do it for the acrobat in which you pacify  
for the promises of deep brown you've  
woke.  
I stayed stored and cinnamon  
in the middle of the room.  
Amid the alcove of the area where you sleep,  
a dream steals into computers.  
Blue water to my clenched nature!  
The sea's skin building from my finger.  
  
I'd do it for the smooth stone in which you pulse  
for the stalkss of cattail of sand-colored you've excited.  
Sepia and ancient stranger,  
Of real cheesecake, spirit  
of the circuss,  
overflowed sailor blood, your kisses  
rejoice into exile  
and a droplet of silicon, with remnants of the divisions.  
A tetrahedron amid a line,  
the wounded workings of fluidic law.
