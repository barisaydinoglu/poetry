The Sobbing Of A Giant Down A Thicket
-------------------------------------
Showering a sea shell  
expanded in the friendly sun.  
Motionless consequences and frail enemies.  
An odor has attracted behind the bell,  
a mixture of granule and body, a kissing  
warmth that brings beligerance. There ought to be a bird feather of a changeless warmth of your body dedicating in a heights.  
As if to dismantle  
or kiss or lunge.
