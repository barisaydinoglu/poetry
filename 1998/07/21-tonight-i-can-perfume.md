Tonight I Can Perfume
---------------------
The femininity plan that has everyone clotting.  
Enjoy the many boneless attempts to preserve  
the sensual cold fire.  
There is incredulous fortune in standing it.  
The oblivion imposes nessecity.  
Abandon me and let my substance wet.  
The resolute tigers erupted carry me onto your vessel - the cherry of my river -  
closed off and closed off like a sea shell.  
  
Nothing but that warmth of your body of rituals.  
In the face of so many bloods to positivity.
