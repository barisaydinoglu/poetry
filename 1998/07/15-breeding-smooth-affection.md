Breeding Smooth Affection
-------------------------
You - the natural eyelids.  
They deluded it with calculating flutes.  
There are no clandenstines but  
rusted cycles of alcove and silvery  
doves of arcane neurotic sand.  
A loaf of bread baked  
with fragmented  
tiredness and salt.  
Silvery water to my atrocious moon!  
A curves and a foot  
breathing the area.  
In the middle of the boulevard like aluminum.  
Carry me onto your vessel - the orange of my foliage -  
on what hairy violences inherited with fire?  
Clocks of a lonely bicycle  
expanding in front of the boulevard with a rambunctious bicycle,  
parenthetical as a phosphorus bird.
