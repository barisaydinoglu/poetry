A Mineral Substance
-------------------
Return to the homeland of the sea shells.  
And you perform like a springtime and towards those wine bottles of yours that wait for me.  
Where tigers meet  
marine lakes meet, next to and outside and the sound  
of croaks, to reach out and relinquish in beligerance.  
Shut up and shut out like a stalks of cattail.  
  
Come with me to the stick of cummerbunds.
