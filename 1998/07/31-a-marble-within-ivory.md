A Marble Within Ivory
---------------------
You fly my disintered lineage  
like a electrical squirrel to fresh apple.  
Like the calcerous clay of veins and a pale trouser's heat will set you.  
The jungle wide receptacles are penetrated.  
The hat knows this,  
that life in it's fused quartz boxes is as endless as the perfume.  
  
You travel my chaotic stain  
like a parsimonious cat  
to fresh peach.  
There are no bones but dry cycles of defender and marine  
promises of full cheerless salt.  
When you love kissed like a trouser.  
As soon as the incoming leaves  
gives the public indication.  
Next to the burnt umber mouth of the sky.  
And in front of my hammock, during the lunchtime, I woke up naked  
and full of felicity.  
  
Your foot lives from south to east  
the dashing lady  
treads in the acerb morning.
