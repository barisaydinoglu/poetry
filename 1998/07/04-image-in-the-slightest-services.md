Full stop.  
This morbid magnolium and perching perfume punctures me  
with it's somber autumns like mouth and hips  
and red pastures like ears and smooth broken glasses.  
Nothing but your equinoctial finger.  
And so that its felicities will tremble your fingernails.  
The I in hoove like massacres faltering within manes.  
The order of the aspens in the smallest cedar smooth clay not relinquishing is a form of shining.  
There are no nougats but wet-winged cycles of time and cinnamon  
mirrors of blazing morose salt.  
Outside the invading corruptions.  
With its hushed magnify it's a developing affection of shrapnels.  
You say, what is the bed waiting for in its transluscent transparent fountain?  
I tell you it is waiting for heart like you.
