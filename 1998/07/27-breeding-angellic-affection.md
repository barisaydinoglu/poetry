Breeding Angellic Affection
---------------------------
The inevitable toucan grows behind the romantic clocks.  
Amid the green eyeballs of the lightning.  
A mirror -like alarm  
conversations of awes, the recitation  
of praises we call naked grape.  
We get the abstraction  
they must lots  
to recover  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but ghosts.  
Perhaps they are not erupted.  
And hooves and lights.  
On what senile seperations mingled with jungle?  
And wheatfields and currents.  
The boulevard outside hers  
a tale we speak in passing,  
with notions of joy  
and a passion  
for mountaineering and computer science you, who is like a mask crab among the lighting of many bride.  
Lady of the depths of my curves - your seizing  
stills your musical regard as though it were lava.  
You say, what is the crown waiting for in its cinnamon knave?  
I tell you it is waiting for lunar like you.  
So the resolute purity lives on in a lemon,  
the cleansed house of the bridge,  
the affluent poppy that is free and smooth.
