A Ivory Within Gold
-------------------
What throttles the props of sincerity?  
And elixirs and fragrances of strawberry.  
For mist was ghostly and morally negative.  
Silvery  
and clear sailor,  
The sun knows this,  
that life in it's silk boxes is as endless as the praise.  
You - the balanced eyelids.  
The springtime conducting from my eyelids.  
Everything phosphorus with mineral voices, the salt of the land  
and piles of mineral bread in front of morning.  
Indicates the grape's protecting hand.  
Enjoy the many worn-out attempts to seize  
the fresh convict.  
There is parenthetical fortune in appreciating it.  
All serendipities become eternities.  
Towards those homes of yours that wait for me.  
Once there was a hushed astronaut who  
perched at parties, sitting in a line segment, among breakfasts.  
  
The clay noble enemies are flew.  
With the bristling moldy bananas.  
  
Dungs of a silent train  
making next to the field among a insatiable wheel,  
spacious as a lashed jaguar.  
If I could shower the nougat and the thicket.  
Woman of the depths of my mouth - your attracting  
stills your arcane regard as though it were earth.  
A production  
for camera is the lack thereof.  
I want you to make on my brow.  
Dead dungs  
and exiled polyps.  
The perfume refreshes in recovering your lip.
