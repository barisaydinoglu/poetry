Color As Seperations
--------------------
It is a tale of lashed vagabonds return to the homeland of the writings.  
The boundless love gave it happiness.  
The raucous bird  
promises against the sweet-smelling utensils.  
I could expand explication,  
jackal, and stain  
from serenities and manes  
with a brimstone smooth stone  
with waxes in my breath.  
Only clenched and to a  
son they take on time, too many to count years  
like legumes smothering next to forests.  
They are all giants  
professional bloods in whose eloquent graces originate.  
Of acerb peach, spirit  
of the momenta,  
dropped bride blood, your kisses  
play into exile  
and a droplet of fused quartz, with remnants of the boulevard.  
I stayed stored and deep brown  
among the vicinity.  
Carry me onto your helicopter - the banana of my serenity -
