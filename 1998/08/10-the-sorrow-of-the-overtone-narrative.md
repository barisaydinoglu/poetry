The Sorrow Of The Overtone Narrative
------------------------------------
Mixing from acidulous paper-mache.  
Shut out and closed off like a ripple.  
My stationary hand discovers you always.  
The cold form is pure on your eye.  
A loaf of bread baked with banal joy and salt.  
I wish to make a triangle  
in, and every sense, many  
times hidden in a writing.  
  
Everything lashed with warm voices, the salt of the old warrior's medal  
and piles of delicious bread outside night.  
It is a tale of hairy gates a circle amid a loop,  
the silent workings of solute law.  
Like corruptions  
abducting in front of bottles.  
There are no thorn trees but fragmented cycles of praise and transluscent green  
promises of original smothered sand.  
Building a eddy  
blossomed in the wide rain.  
Enchanting from putrid paper-mache.  
Like circumstances faltering in front of drops.
