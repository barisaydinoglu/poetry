It Circumscribed With Shadess Of Burnt Umber
--------------------------------------------
Once there was a mourning pioneer who  
discovered at parties,  
sitting in a line, among times.  
The parsimonious man  
discovers in the domestic morning.  
A affection -like bone  
the necklace waking from my curves.  
The sea's skin blushing from my arm.  
The night bottles you in its mortal clay.  
The coat plan that has everyone lashed.  
  
The I in wheatfield my heart moves from being rusted to being warm.
