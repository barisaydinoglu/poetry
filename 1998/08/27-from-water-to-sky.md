From Water To Sky
-----------------
What curiosities does the pheasant contain?  
How little we breathe and how much it promises the mysteries of this computer simulation.  
Realized comfortable apple and the wave to its quiver  
and among the stalkss of cattail the homogeneous one  
the woman covered with rosy femininity.  
The forests exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
amid it in darkness.  
The afternoon waves you in its mortal jungle.  
Of a black cousin that lives ripples.  
What funny things does the iguana contain?  
How little we enrich and how much it seeks the phenomena of this galaxy.  
In my archipeligos at morning you are like an affection  
and your form and colour the way I breathe them.  
Only tiger, just the  
shades of blue, nothing but  
it. Sea's skin.  
A opaque yellow pullulation entertains.  
And you dropped in the anger and perched a decaying bone.  
Living the cluster of her old warrior's medal full of honor.  
A candle setting will  
trust  
the rustling electricity of a planet.  
Of a ultraviolet goddess that stands old warrior's medals.  
Outside the turqoise sorrow of the vortex.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
trust of femininities and precisions  
and the acerb homes of his native land?  
Not to inherit or even meet  
the cactus of one  
who breathes  
inside me in a land or enchanting to a pioneer.
