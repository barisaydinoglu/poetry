The Panic Of The Slightest Narrative
------------------------------------
When you protect wove like a river bank. Some pulse but I understand your broken glass like wreath.  
Wave of wave of muscles rolling down the sea.  
  
Fewer and fewer  
tremble about another mode of respect.  
Change me and let my substance rustle.
