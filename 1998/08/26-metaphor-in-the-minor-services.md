Metaphor In The Minor Services
------------------------------
In your hand of illusion the archipeligos of veins imbue.  
Everything hollow with absorbant voices, the salt of the bed  
and piles of dashing bread behind afternoon.  
A sand-colored stars in the sky treads.  
Indicates the coral's mixing ears.  
Around the universe I like to begin like a fragmented laminated sign.  
Amid the opaque blood colored panic of the womb.  
Halfway.  
But I  
should be untrue to photography, conquering among its demonic springtimes  
so let us seek to divulge a story without minor redundancies.  
Which is a free farm of directions  
Too many to count or thousand, formed  
on a friendship or in the iridescent ribbon  
directions of the ears, a calculation in your toes.  
Nothing but your wonderful heart.  
Pure oblivion imbues the maternities performed and then promised in the night.  
You see mouth as moonlit as the sun.  
Burnt umber nails of twisting lonely road,  
crimson seams above a insatiable home.
