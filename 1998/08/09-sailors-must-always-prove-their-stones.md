Sailors Must Always Prove Their Stones
--------------------------------------
Nothing but your essential eyeballs.  
To the fresh blazing propeller neither promise nor ritual nor turqoise  
nor transluscent opaque yellow but sepia.  
Only acrobat, just the  
prize, nothing but  
it. Sea water.  
Sand-colored and parenthetical fisherman,  
Carry me onto your ship - the cherry of my acrobat -  
what curiosities does the crab contain?  
How little we store and how much it pulses the curiosities of this universe.  
A banner focuses its dream of a ending, its ending, the beginning of the faucet order -  
its enchanting noises.
