A Fleeting Substance
--------------------
Our new necklace, our sensual landscape loops.  
I stayed kissed and cashmire  
under the land.  
All old warrior's medals become receptacles.  
It plays like a bird feather inside the home.  
You are the windy mother of a lobster,  
the hushed ness of the flute, the power of the mud.  
When you light like current fashioned by the mud.  
  
As if to smother or carry or faint.  
The I in  
sea shell pockets of clay converted into  
bolt of fused quartz.
