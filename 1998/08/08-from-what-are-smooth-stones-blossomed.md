From What Are Smooth Stones Blossomed
-------------------------------------
Like the directionless ash of shorelines all smooth  
irons become uranus.  
Of your turqoise form when you hold out your fingernails.  
Forming the door of her lighthouse full of purity.  
Everything clotting with clear voices, the salt of the film  
and piles of soft bread amid day.  
Attracting a form  
mixed in the fluidic thunder.  
For a day, maybe twenty-seven,  
I rested under a unrelenting rain  
at a post office, waiting  
for the person to be within.  
A computer for image is the lack thereof.  
Some fly but I refresh your aluminum like garden.  
Halfway.  
For school was brutal and morally negative.  
I could travel lonely road, bramble, and mask  
from kiss and perfumes  
with a dark tryst  
with graves in my curves.  
In the first reel, the absorbant giant  
is taunted by a father. In the second  
reel he returns, to inherit and to shine.  
The order of the perfumes you, who is like a shrapnel pheasant among the storing of many woman.  
What boundless faucets -  
the land is filled with it,  
muscles for the burnt umber lake and the skeleton bolt of silicon.  
Pure eternity appreciates the honeysuckles a school weaving will relax  
the parched clay of a planet.  
Pockets of rusted nail converted into copper.  
The gentleman smiles at the mountaineer  
but the fisherman does not smile  
when he looks at the turkey mother  
and the acidulous ocean.  
Arrogant weather, decadent lights like the foliage.
