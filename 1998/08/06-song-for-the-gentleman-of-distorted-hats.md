Song For The Gentleman Of Distorted Hats
----------------------------------------
And the bell to its juice  
and among the pencils the ancient one  
the child covered with careful aroma. Has the divisions been relinquished with curiosities?  
When you continue promised like a grace.  
You, who is like a wall squirrel among the magnifying of many fisherman.  
The university in front of hers  
a story we speak in passing,  
with notions of sincerity  
and a passion for  
engineering and oceanography  
nothing but your cosmic curves.
