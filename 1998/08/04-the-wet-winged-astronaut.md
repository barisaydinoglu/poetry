The Wet-winged Astronaut
------------------------
The reasons for my respect  
are rejoiced in my leg of wooden. A naked wood paneling making a unguessed thing of a likely meeting with a bride.  
The boulevard inside hers  
a tale we speak in passing,  
with notions of wonder  
and a passion for jouranlism and computer science  
A sun of currents yellow water to my smothered evening star!  
Not to make or even meet  
the aroma of one who chirps  
outside me in a boulevard or gathering to a uncle.
