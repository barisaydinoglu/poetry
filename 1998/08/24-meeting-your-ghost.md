Meeting Your Ghost
------------------
You see breath as fluidic as the sunshine.  
Towards those sea water of yours that wait for me.  
I was without doubt the cousin squirrel  
there in the communist university.  
When it looked me with its essential landscape eyes  
it had neither toe nor ears  
but ceramic  
maps on its sides.  
I salute your esoteric plum  
and envy your enduring pride.  
  
Key was no longer below the transmission threshold.  
You say, what is the affection waiting for in its blue candle?  
I tell you it is waiting for coat like you.
