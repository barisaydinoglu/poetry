The Illusion Of The Public Narrative
------------------------------------
It was the morning of the bird.  
Sorrow and mirror  
- knaves of sorrow.  
Fuming weather, rustling lights like the lake.  
  
It was the late afternoon of the crab.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
A identity for metaphor is the lack thereof.  
Holes of a explosive bicycle  
promising next to the jungle amid a shaken ship,  
natural as a inevitable pheasant.  
Only rusted and to a  
man they take on time, thousand years  
with its callous begin all forests become abyss.  
Noble empire. The line functions to crystallize a system  
to its system.  
The misunderstood oyster dedicates behind the moonlit waxes.  
And a bleak breakfast's ice will light you.  
  
Neither muscle nor telegraph nor rust colored  
Nor deep brown but silvery.
