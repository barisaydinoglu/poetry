Here I Hear You
---------------
I wish to make a triangle  
in front of, and every sense, many  
times hidden in a horse.  
There ought to be a ritual of a electric planetarium expanding in a universe.  
Enjoy the many morose attempts to reflect  
the delicate coal.  
There is sweet-smelling fortune in pulsing it.  
Hushed weather, phosphorus lights like the flesh.  
And kisses and beds.  
Draw from it the dilute  
projection of its own antenna.  
For a day, maybe too few to count,  
I rested under a harrowing wind  
at a bus stop, waiting for the god to be among.  
What is  
this camera but a memory twisted of its wells?  
  
I'm the pioneer to the railroad track of immediate serenity.  
The umbrellas exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
behind it in darkness.  
The momentum re-covering from my curves.  
A train is not enough to penetrate me and keep me  
from the heights of your human epiphany.  
  
Among the archipeligos like sand.
