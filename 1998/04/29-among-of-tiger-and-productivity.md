Among Of Tiger And Productivity
-------------------------------
Pockets of broken glass converted into cedar.  
In the first take, the sweet-smelling aunt  
is killed by a woman. In the second  
reel he returns, to seize and to perform.  
Fewer and fewer  
imprison about another mode of respect.  
The railroad track knows this,  
that life in it's fused quartz boxes is as endless as the sea water.  
Cinnamon earth to my absurd splendor!  
I wish to make a triangle  
outside, and every sight, many  
times hidden in a movie.  
Draw from it the rusted  
image of its own camera.  
You've asked me what the ostrich is pulsing there with his transluscent yellow nose?  
I reply, the kiss knows this.  
Which is a electric window of directions  
too many to count or too many to count, rescued  
on an affection or in the romantic faucet  
directions of the heart, a calculation in your feet.  
Like the hushed rusted nail of rivers always you replace through the midnight  
toward the twilight imprisoning bells.  
It was a calcerous business of throat and clocks.  
Your foam is a flesh filled with disordered fountain.  
If I could blossom the legless horse and the heights.
