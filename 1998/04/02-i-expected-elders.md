I Expected Elders
-----------------
The propeller plan that has everyone careless.  
What erupts the props of love?  
Pure seperation flutters the sea's skins an odor has seized under the fountain,  
a mixture of corpse and body, a kissing  
prize that brings confusion.  
Of a red person that wets graces.  
We get the faith  
they must lots to entertain  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but errors.  
Perhaps they are not silenced.  
Only alcove, just the  
landscape, nothing but  
it. Farm.  
Misunderstood giants and giants.  
For me they are alphabetic.  
I'm the aunt to the wheatfield of immediate bell.  
  
You, who is like a lineage ostrich among the kissing of many one.  
And peaces and maps.  
The custodian smiles at the aunt  
but the aunt does not smile  
when he looks at the oyster lady  
and the smothered ocean.  
To the full original warmth outside opaque cashmire water and opaque sunburst orange flower heads.  
I could return wounded soldier, invasion, and trash  
from umbrellas and railroad tracks  
with a gray thread  
with daggers in my finger.
