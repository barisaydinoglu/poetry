He Has A Insatiable Complex
---------------------------
Thirsty people and astronauts.  
For me they are alphabetic.  
Always you loiter through the twilight  
toward the holiday filtering wine bottles.  
Return to the homeland of the manes.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
enchant of leaves and flutes  
and the serene love of his native land?  
One of them is essential,  
the other knows techniques.  
Where is someone  
he exclaims, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Bitterest trashes and callous martyrs.  
Your tiger is a hoove filled with dead serendipity.  
Only listless and to a  
pioneer they take on time, too few to count years  
fewer and fewer  
drop about another mode of sincerity.  
An odor has continued under the shoreline,  
a mixture of bomb and body, a rescuing  
pencil that brings fear.  
They are all people  
professional panics in whose promising leaves originate.  
Cinnamon mud to my phosphorus film!  
Fewer and fewer  
twist about another mode of honor.  
Sometimes a piece of the lava  
mourns like a garden in my lip.  
Indicates the cluster  
's storing heart.  
Around the heights I like to pulse like a putrid laminated sign.
