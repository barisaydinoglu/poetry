How To Protest Man Mouths
-------------------------
The bloody feather swims on its disordered mare  
re-covering transluscent yellow rivers over the universe.  
The I in lighthouse like the hushed aluminum of smooth irons indicates the farm's seizing foot.  
You are the cherry of my chaotic brain.  
Nothing but that friendship of bird feathers.  
  
Excite on the polyps that wait for you  
hating the tear stained chairs, silencing the doors.  
The cosmic dignity of the wave!  
It relaxes like a mist behind the branch.
