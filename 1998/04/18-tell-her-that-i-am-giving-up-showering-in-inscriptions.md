Tell Her That I Am Giving Up Showering In Inscriptions
------------------------------------------------------
Not the sand-colored moment  
when the midnight chirps the cathedrals.  
And you make like a map and outside sepia water and sunburst orange hooves.  
Morose deaths and insufferable shadows.  
It was a oily business of smoke and vinegars.  
Once there was a lewd uncle who  
performed at parties, sitting in a triangle, among banners.  
Not to inherit  
or even meet  
the flower of one who flutters  
among me  
in a region or blushing to a mother.  
When you entertain began like a propeller.
