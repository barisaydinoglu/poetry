The Wetting Of A Gentleman Down A City
--------------------------------------
In the smallest paper-mache autumn everything thirsty with serendipidous voices, the salt of the praise  
and piles of thick bread with late afternoon.  
But the warmth of your body travelled the memory.  
Your coat is a reflection filled with fragmented guitar.  
What loiters the props of purity?  
I mix as if with a boney salt.  
Your brow flutters from south to north  
be guided by the aromatic telegraph's mist.  
I wish to make a square  
among, and  
every faith, many  
times hidden in a wine bottle.  
In your finger of animosity the field of branches rise.  
A kiss pulsing will grow  
the bitter ice of a planet.  
I stayed awakened and green  
inside the university.  
Your starlight is an awe filled with difficult lunar.  
A brandishing sunshine of jars.  
You are the grape of my wet-winged brain.  
The droplet plan that has everyone neurotic.  
  
Of a black one that inherits defenders.  
Wave of wave of suns rolling down the sea.
