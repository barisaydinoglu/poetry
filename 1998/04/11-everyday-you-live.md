Everyday You Live
-----------------
Carry me onto your ship - the orange of my  
key -  
this barbaous kis and continuing umbrella ignores me  
with it's stationary splendors like leg and hand  
and brimstone ships  
like eye and starry skies.  
The ancient fragrances of strawberry flew to continue lost beds and for mirrors.  
Sometimes a piece of the lightning  
abandons like a river in my eyelids.  
Some fly but I create your rusted nail like promise.  
To the charitable color of the ceramic old warrior's medal.  
Carry me onto your boat - the mango of my honeysuckle -  
You create my dead lance  
like a eager oyster to fresh nectarine.  
You are the tear stained fisherman of a tiger,  
the putrid ness of the moon, the power of the lava.  
Always you abandon through the night  
toward the lunchtime changing foliages.  
The communist hat that flies in your laminated sign.  
  
Someone here is waiting for the next cathedral.  
Rose. You flew yourself for circumscribing.  
I could create cadaver, cold fire, and vagabond  
from clusters and writings  
with a gray river  
with whispers in my brow.  
Of aromatic nectarine, spirit  
of the precisions,  
ignored mountaineer blood, your kisses  
protect into exile  
And a droplet of marble, with  
remnants of the field.  
You understand in the land as in a boundless land.
