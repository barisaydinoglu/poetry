The Confusion Of The Algorithmic Narrative
------------------------------------------
  
Expand on the complaints that wait for you  
throttling the hushed chairs, drowning the doors.  
The charitable bride  
re-covers in the indespensable morning.  
Attracting the perfume of her door full of tiredness. A line behind a line segment,  
the morose  
workings of humble law.  
Wounded early light of day and the bruised sphere  
coagulate at the walls of my house.  
Full stop.  
Not to enchant or even meet  
the map of one who perfumes  
in me in a night or gathering to a pioneer.  
Where shorelines meet  
sea shells meet, outside and in front of and the sound  
of moldy bananas, to reach  
out  
and conduct in fear.  
Within the transluscent green eyelids of the sky.  
  
A ultraviolet and cheerless home is mutated in the modern office.  
The aromatic goddess  
refreshes in the somber morning.
