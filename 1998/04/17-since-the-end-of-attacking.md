Since The End Of Attacking
--------------------------
The I in wreath but the cactus awakened the memory.  
The croak imposes nessecity.  
And meetings of melancholy shoulder pockets of broken glass converted into marble.  
They buried it with fire-tipped homes.  
  
You are the grape of my mourning fingernails.  
To seek another land come with me to the complaint of vagabonds.
