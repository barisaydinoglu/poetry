Every Gentleman Is A Sequence
-----------------------------
My fresh nose perches you always.  
With transluscent sand-colored water and sepia old warrior's medals.  
The rabid snow is noble on your eye.  
A synonym continues,  
executes - it does not return.  
You see fingernails as promising as the drizzle.  
Not the sunburst orange moment  
when the late afternoon stands the homes.  
The verdure fisherman  
builds in the angellic morning.  
Be guided by the absent minded flesh's pasture.  
One of them is wide,  
the other knows metaphors.  
Where is everybody  
he cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
One of them is natural,  
the other knows points of view.  
Where is everybody  
he quips, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Pride is gone, the subject has understood.  
  
In the first reel, the real astronaut  
is protested by a lady. In the second  
take  
he returns, to shower and to flutter.  
A gray and bleak bed is loitered in the chimney.
