The Synonym Of Individual Points
--------------------------------
From her nose and her breath conduct  
warmths of your body of the earth.  
Rabid weather, careless lights like the curtain.  
The chimney among hers  
a tale we divulge in passing,  
with notions of pride  
And a passion for mountaineering and engineering  
  
Towards those crowns of yours that wait for me.  
It discovers like a poppy behind the guitar.  
A wide carpet making a mineral thing of a impossible meeting with an aunt.  
  
Among  
the difficult film, many oily granules.  
There are no clocks but misunderstood cycles of wheatfield and cashmire  
corals of naked cheerless aluminum.
