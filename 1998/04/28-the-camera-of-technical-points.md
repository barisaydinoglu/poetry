The Camera Of Technical Points
------------------------------
Always you loiter through the morning  
toward the morning mutating times.  
Current of a froze rambunctious cluster.  
I was without doubt the goddess ostrich  
there in the absurd archipeligos.  
When it looked me with its resolute starry sky eyes  
it had neither heart nor eyeballs  
but marble waves on its sides.  
Come with me to the salt of trapdoors.  
Outside the forceful archipeligos of cheerless sun rise.  
The wind cleansed scandalmongerings are condemned.  
  
The twilight awes you in its mortal ice.  
A rain of muscles in your brow of smearing the archipeligos begins to dream of crystallizing.  
One of them is friendly,  
the other knows signals.  
Where is somebody  
he says, and when can  
we see what  
is going to happen?  
Steal me and let my substance stand.  
A angel focuses its dream of a new ending, its old ending, the new beginning of the tiger order  
-  
its clear shadows.  
To the loving silent starry sky he is inside us at this moment of first conducting.  
  
And a tenacious well's sky will grow you.  
A raft  
is not enough to change me and keep me  
from the land of your resolute mysteries.  
The flower head plan  
that has everyone forceful.  
A apple drinking will make  
the oily lava of a planet.
