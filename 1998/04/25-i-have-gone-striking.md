I Have Gone Striking
--------------------
A current of infinite quilt  
that does not know why it flows and magnifies.  
She is outside us at this moment of first making.  
I salute your handsome nectarine  
and envy your eloquent pride.  
There are no wounds but neon cycles of crimson lake and yellow  
bird feathers of deedy  
dry ash.
