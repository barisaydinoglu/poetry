Your Eyeballs Is Enough
-----------------------
I could carry serection, self-production, and city  
from fragrances of strawberry and writings  
with a blood colored book  
with belts in my brow.  
It was the morning of the elephant.  
Like the careless rusted nail of sea shells the sweetnes rescuing from my breath.  
We open the halves of a secrets and the  
impaling of darkness forms into the electrical divisions.  
What is this production but a memory taunted of its trousers?  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
conduct of angels and cactuss  
and the parenthetical trysts of his native land?  
In your foot of animosity the chimney of bottles perch.  
Of a ultraviolet astronaut that flies leaves.  
And you bristled in the anger and attracted a killing shadow.  
  
It was the late afternoon of the tiger.
