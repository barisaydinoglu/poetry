The Directionless Smoke
-----------------------
In your mouth of beligerance the moonlight evening of crowns set.  
A machine pulses,  
crushes - it does not return.  
Flag of a twisted torrential cluster.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the promising springtimes?  
And the sun cordial splattering its  
bird feathers and shattering them full of  
room and squirrel?  
In front of sepia water and sunburst orange flags.  
To seek another land I took on senile juices.  
I saw how sea's skins are breathed  
by the loving breakfast.  
Someone here is waiting for the next bird feather.  
Flint. You shone yourself for dedicating.  
They fell it with muzzled natures.  
And you mutated in the anger and drank a falling heart.  
Went trusted in serenity I took on boneless splendors.  
  
From pillow of fog to ray of sunlight,  
hidden angels drawn by eager channels, a  
hated phemonana begins to entertain.  
Outside the sand-colored curves of the water.  
The inaccessible sea shell is cosmic on your mouth.  
A mineral rug making a friendly thing of a lucky meeting with a custodian.
