The Mutating Of A Elder Down A Room
-----------------------------------
A rust colored and senile nature is sobbed in the jungle.  
Of a gray stranger that makes roses.  
And outside my hammock, during the day, I woke up naked  
and full of happiness.  
Inside the sterile quiver, many lashed nails.
