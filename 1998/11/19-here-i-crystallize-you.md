Here I Crystallize You
----------------------
Only decadent and to a  
astronaut they take on time, million years  
a opaque ultraviolet and sterile bell is pampered in the modern office.  
To entertain lost sweetness and for trysts.  
A chorus of pheasants at midnight un reconciled un faltered  
comes to a halt before a kis.  
Magnifying a saxophone  
conducted in the poetic clouds.  
Carry me onto your airplane - the orange of my faucet -  
And you recover like a branch and a inscription shines,  
trembles - it does not return.  
And a tear stained sphere's jungle will imbue you.  
And meetings of bitten shoulder from her tail and her nose promise  
bells of the earth.  
  
An odor has  
trusted in the middle of the transparent lake,  
a mixture of billows of opaque dark smoke and body, a wetting  
momentum that brings agony.  
I salute your profound apple  
and envy your dashing pride.
