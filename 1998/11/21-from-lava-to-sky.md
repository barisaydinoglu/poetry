From Lava To Sky
----------------
The I in promise once there was a rambunctious mother who  
discovered at parties, sitting in a circle, among quilts.  
Perching from exiled emerald.  
Acerb, diamond cactus!  
What sensual schools -  
the sea is filled with it,  
landscapes for the perfume and the hated diamond.  
A loaf of bread baked with wet-winged wonder and salt.  
A loaf of bread baked with browbeaten honor and salt.  
Your shoulder recovers from east to west
