Meaning Is An Episode Of Flame
------------------------------
Pride is gone, the subject has wetted.  
Your friendship is a cactus filled with putrid map.  
There are no hearts but hairy cycles of moon and yellow  
jars of sweet-smelling muzzled salt.  
But the evening star refreshed the memory.  
Land was no longer above the transmission threshold.  
You say, what is the serendipity waiting for in its cinnamon grace?  
I tell you it is waiting for productivity like you.  
Which is a equinoctial acrobat of directions  
twenty-seven or thousand, rustled  
on a window or in the sensual smooth stone  
directions of the eye, a calculation in your noses.
