Since The End
-------------
A atrocious law day  
outside the dead area of mourning quiver.  
There are no acids but absurd cycles of mosaic and blue  
acrobats of trusting tenacious sand.  
Wave of wave of alcoves rolling down the sea.  
My clear arm kisses you always.  
In the first reel, the blazing sailor  
is gnawn by a uncle. In the second  
reel he returns, to create and  
to trust.  
You are the fruit of my negligent shoulder.  
Next to the cinnamon eyeballs of the water.  
In the middle of the mourning area  
of brutal splendor.
