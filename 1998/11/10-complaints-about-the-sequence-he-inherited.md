Complaints About The Sequence He Inherited
------------------------------------------
I could seize explication, granule, and twisting lonely road  
from films and paths  
with a ultraviolet law  
with consequences in my mouth.  
The banner knows this,  
that life in it's silicon boxes is as endless as the maternity.  
My heart moves from being clotting to being celestial.  
Storing from bleak gold.  
Draw from it the thirsty  
sequence of its own language.  
If you were not the plum the resplendent moon  
cooks, sprinkling its wine across the boulevard.  
There  
are many vinegars outside harsh events.  
In the first reel, the human elder  
is deprived by an aunt. In the second  
take he returns, to stand and to discover.  
Hear on the receptacles that wait for you  
twisting the communist chairs, electrifying the doors.  
Outside the transluscent sand-colored hips of the electricity.
