I Expected Elders
-----------------
The sweet-smelling well gave it pride.  
Around the blue eyeballs of the fire.  
A brutal point of view changes  
even the moonlit  
public heights in point of view  
to which the metaphor  
will not be reconciled.  
Storing  
the juice of her sun full of respect.  
With the blood colored illusion of the torrent.  
Pure hound fashions the serendipities the lunar plan that has everyone lashed.
