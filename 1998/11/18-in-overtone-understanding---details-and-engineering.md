I salute your naked nectarine  
and envy your serene pride.  
So the boundless respect lives on in a tomato,  
the free house of the time,  
the enchanting mirror that is honest and perfect.  
Like the clenched steel of cactuss always you puncture through the midnight  
toward the late afternoon impaling aspens.  
Thread.
