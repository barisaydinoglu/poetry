Song For The Mother Of Guilt Evening Stars
------------------------------------------
Multitude of horses!  
In and out of the yellow the sand-colored and the burnt umber conversations of praises, the recitation  
of silences we call lyrical crown.  
Around the heights I like to begin like a nauesous flag.  
But I should be untrue to science, devouring among its explosive hooves  
so let us seek to speak a story without technical redundancies.  
What affluent warmths of your body -  
the city is filled with it,  
productivities for the tree and the fragmented copper.  
I salute your perfect lemon  
and envy your plumed pride.  
Not the crimson moment  
when the sunset hears the foliages.  
Outside the black illusion of the viola.  
The morning keys you in its mortal water.  
You re-cover slowly into a university to create your business.  
I was without doubt the child jaguar  
there in the sordid heights.  
When it looked me with its enduring starlight eyes  
it had neither heart nor curves  
but ivory femininities on its sides.  
Purity is gone, the subject has recovered.  
  
In your hand of animosity the jungle of starlights drink.  
In my universe at afternoon you are like a thread  
and your form and colour the way I perform them.  
Man of the depths of my heart - your mingling  
stills your decisive regard as though it were fire.  
Opaque sand-colored and spacious astronaut,  
because I love you, love, in front of the earth and next to the water.  
The dashing nature gave it respect.  
In your arm of dropping  
the chimney begins to dream of flying.  
Your finger seizes from north to south  
a vessel is not enough to electrify me and keep me  
from the divisions of your rosy funny things.
