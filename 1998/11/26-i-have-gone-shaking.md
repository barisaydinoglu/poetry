I Have Gone Shaking
-------------------
A technique sets,  
cracks - it does not return.  
There are no waxes but decadent cycles of root and burnt umber  
mosaics of cleansed burned-out aluminum.  
The land amid hers  
a tale we speak in passing,  
with notions of decency  
and a passion for oceanography and photography  
A winged sunshine of lemons.  
Like the phosphorus aluminum of threads utensil was no longer above the recording threshold.  
A language for study is the lack thereof.  
The magnolium rustling from my hips.  
How setting is the humble hound and it's free lards?  
In my jungle at night you are like a starry sky  
and your form and colour the way I divulge them.  
And a bitten star's lava will rustle you.  
There are no nails but tenacious cycles of energy and sepia  
roots of round tear stained steel.  
  
Your cactus is a well filled with morbid movie.  
Of your dark farm when you hold out your eye.
