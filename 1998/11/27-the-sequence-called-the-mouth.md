The Sequence Called The Mouth
-----------------------------
Rigid afternoon and the rotten horse  
pass at the walls of my house.  
When you carry lighted like a sea shell.  
With the cinnamon curves of the ice.  
All propellers become panics.  
Gathered and then appreciated in the city.  
To build lost times and for maps.  
I saw how railroad tracks are rose  
by the friendly mirror.
