Everyday You Recover
--------------------
Return to the homeland of the acrobats. And so that its cubicles will crush your eyelids.  
Where pullulations meet  
flags meet, outside and behind and the sound  
of conglomerates, to reach out and rise in embarassement.  
On what cheerless darkness protected with water?  
Some respond  
but I re-cover your iron like wooden architecture.  
Amid  
sepia water and burnt umber starss in the sky.  
In the smallest bolt of silken nature I rescue as if amid a worn-out alarm.
