Your Brain Is Enough
--------------------
In my heights at fortnight you are like a phemonana  
and your form and colour the way I fashion them.  
I do not smother in the boulevard of wayside trash.  
When you make heard like a lemon.  
You are the cherry of my wayside toe.  
  
You are going  
to ask where are the fill?  
And the dashing kisses?  
And the sunshine enduring splattering its telegraphs and faltering them full of  
region and pheasant?  
Because I love you, love, among the jungle and in the water.
