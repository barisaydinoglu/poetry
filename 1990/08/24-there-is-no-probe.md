There Is No Probe
-----------------
In the middle of the pale salt, many morbid vagabonds.  
As if to drown or perfume or deform.  
I wish to make a square  
inside, and every meaning, many  
times hidden in a stalks of cattail.  
So the noble love lives on in a kiwi,  
the somber house of the vein,  
the honest book that is iridescent and stationary.  
A foliage -like parallel walls  
a chorus of tigers at fortnight un fashioned un replaced  
comes  
to a halt before a transluscent burnt umber car.
