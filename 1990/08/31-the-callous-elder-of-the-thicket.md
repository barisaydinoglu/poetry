The Callous Elder Of The Thicket
--------------------------------
The celestial moon gave it sincerity. Brings all the ignores dews.  
The horse living from my hips.  
  
A study for metaphor is the lack thereof.  
A study promises,  
abducts - it does not return.  
Carry me onto your bicycle - the tomato of my sweetnes -  
Cinnamon walls of convict,  
transparent seams above a molested mosaic.  
The verdure bed gave it happiness.  
Carry me onto your airplane - the cherry of my wheatfield -  
I was without doubt the cousin ostrich  
there in the wayside field.  
When it looked me with its irreducable starlight eyes  
it had neither heart nor eye  
but silicon curtains on its sides.  
What is this image but a memory mutated of its manes?  
Some rejoice but I reflect your steel like foliage.  
Undulate me and let my substance enchant.  
A winged rug making a perfect thing of a likely meeting with a son.  
  
Nothing but that alcove of essences.  
The order of the drops as if to devour or dedicate or impale.
