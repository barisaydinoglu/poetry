Color As Brambles
-----------------
But the branch refreshed the memory.  
With its bitten travel indicates the sea water's blushing shoulder.  
Not rejoicing is a form of enchanting. Oblivions of a rusted wheel  
waking with the sea among a shady train,  
serendipidous as a clotting crab.  
Like acidulous  
tiger, gardens  
you - the solute shoulder.
