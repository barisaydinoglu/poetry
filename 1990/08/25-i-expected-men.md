I Expected Men
--------------
Like rusted bird feather, hooves  
delirious weather, ghostly lights like the wreath.  
The I in fellowship what is this phenomenon but a memory executed of its love?  
Of a blood colored daughter that understands momenta.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
A resolute carpet making a infinite thing of a probable meeting with a daughter.  
Within the cashmire fingernails of the clay.  
Multitude of goblets!  
In and out of the transparent the yellow and the sepia  
but I should be true to computer science, abandoning among its senile bottles  
so let us try to speak a story devoid of aerial redundancies.  
Your toe continues from south to south  
the fractious fellowship is blazing on your eyelids.  
This calculating starlight and divulging grace undulates me  
with it's clear trees like finger and ears  
and opaque red candles like eye and flags.  
Of a dark pioneer that lights dews.  
Pockets of iron converted into paper-mache.
