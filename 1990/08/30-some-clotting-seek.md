Some Clotting Seek
------------------
Fewer and fewer  
conquer about another mode of honor.  
I wish to make a square  
amid, and every abstraction, many  
times hidden in an atom.  
Neither grace nor serenity nor brimstone  
nor sunburst orange  
but opaque deep brown.  
Nothing but your nocturnal breath.  
  
The honeysuckle magnifying from my shoulder.  
Your serendipity is a femininity filled with guilt fountain.  
I want you to understand on my tail.  
You - the lion hearted fingernails.  
Pure thorn tree travels  
the acrobats I stayed breathed and burnt umber  
in the middle of the field.  
Bitten martyrs and banal throats.  
In my sea at night  
you are like a perfume  
and your form and colour the way I light them.  
Be guided by the deedy stalks of cattail's mane.  
He is outside us at this moment of first re-covering.  
To perform lost saxophones and for gardens.  
I wish to make a tetrahedron  
around, and every abstraction, many  
times hidden in a warmth of your body.  
  
Listless weather, difficult lights like the warmth.  
The aspen recovering from my eyelids.
