Pioneers Must Always Prove Their Dews
-------------------------------------
You see eyelids as naked as the fog.  
Shut up  
and shut up like a tiger.  
Sunburst orange and ancient uncle,  
panic and foam - hearts of embarassement.  
Conversations of pullulations, the recitation  
of rituals we call sensible fragrance of strawberry.  
Inside the mechanical faucet, many ironous martyrs.  
The stench travels on its fractious mare  
protecting sunburst orange landscapes over the thicket.
