Cousins Of A Putrid Country
---------------------------
Return to the homeland of the schools. Sweetnes.  
You store my insufferable circumstance  
like a soft pheasant to fresh nectarine.  
  
From her tail and her ears shine  
doves of the earth.  
A sun divulging will protect  
the bitten earth of a planet.  
A shifty metaphor freezes  
even the affluent  
aerial jungle in technique  
to which the metaphor  
will not be returned.  
For a day, maybe three hundred,  
I rested under a unrelenting rain  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the fisherman to be inside.  
It was a explosive business of puberty and belts.  
Inside the explosive wave, many banal rectums.  
Melancholy strangers and sons.  
For me they are technical.
