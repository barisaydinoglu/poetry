A Glass Within Gold
-------------------
From ray of sunlight to unrelenting rain,  
hidden peaces drawn by boundless channels, a  
melancholy shades of sand-colored begins to protect.  
A blue wine bottle entertains.  
For a day, maybe twenty-seven,  
I rested under a palm tree leaf  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the son to be amid.  
The hated crown is aquatic on your eyelids.  
It makes like a soul in front of the sphere.  
Fewer and fewer  
pass about another mode of respect.  
  
It develops like a bridge inside the rose.  
You - the eloquent fingernails.
