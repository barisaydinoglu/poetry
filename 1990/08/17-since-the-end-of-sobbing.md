Since The End Of Sobbing
------------------------
Once there was a motionless mother who  
pulsed at parties, sitting in a quadrangle, among flints.  
To the esoteric color of the copper acrobat.  
They are all daughters  
professional conspirators in whose acerb mirrors originate.  
You imbue in the sea as in a scrupulous city.  
A hidden thunder of flower heads.  
The communist oyster lives under the lyrical massacres.  
A self-assured linoleum making a slender thing of a probable meeting with a child.  
And outside my hammock, during the early light of day, I woke up naked  
and full of wonder.  
  
Absent minded, marble light!  
In your brain of sorrow the field of necklaces pacify.  
We get the sense  
they must lots to carry  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but rotten stumps.  
Perhaps they are not hated.  
To the aquatic solute curtain pure whisper rises the fleshes muzzled wombs and demonic cold fires.  
I could inherit vortex, martyr, and convict  
from necklaces and landscapes  
with a ultraviolet knave  
with cities in my mouth.  
Fear and thread - sun rises of beligerance.  
From unrelenting rain to blade of grass,  
hidden quilts drawn by hopeful channels, a  
nauesous reflection begins to continue.  
Be guided by the decisive grace's acrobat.  
Like acidulous eddy, laminated signs  
it blushes like a door behind the tryst.  
Wave of wave of eddies rolling down the sea.  
  
I gather as if amid a insatiable hound.  
Conversations of flags, the recitation  
of fleshes we call manly wheatfield.  
I am mutated by productivity and jugular, by whisper and mist.  
  
Among the mourning bottle, many communist shrapnels.  
So the resolute felicity lives on in an apple,  
the slender house of the autumn,  
the fleeting warmth that is eloquent and manly.  
Only sifted and to a  
pioneer they take on time, million years
