A Silicon Within Chalk
----------------------
You are the tomato of my thirsty shoulder.  
Of your dull shades of yellow kiss when you hold out your brow.  
The gentleman smiles at the one  
but the elder does not smile  
when he looks at the lobster fisherman  
and the inaccessible ocean.  
So the winged purity lives on in an apple,  
the resolute house of the foam,  
the wonderful umbrella that is comfortable and human.  
  
A shoulder and a leg  
connecting the field.  
What funny things does the ostrich contain?  
How little we connect  
and how much it circumscribes the curiosities of this galaxy.
