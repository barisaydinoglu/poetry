From Electricity To Fire
------------------------
Among the spoiled heights of nauesous sea's skin. A blood colored and crooked reflection is imprisoned in the divisions.  
You say, what is the soul waiting for in its blue utensil?  
I tell you it is waiting for hoove like you.  
As if to loiter or preserve or imprison.  
A kis treading will awaken  
the atrocious heat of a planet.
