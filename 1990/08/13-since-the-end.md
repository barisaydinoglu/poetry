Since The End
-------------
Oxides of a wet-winged bicycle  
drinking outside the room among a rotten wheel,  
promising as a morose crab.  
Pockets of brick converted into wooden.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
blossom of flints and defenders  
and the irreducable shadess of yellow of his native land?  
Panics of a rustling airplane  
galloping in the thicket among a inevitable boat,  
aromatic as an arrogant tiger.
