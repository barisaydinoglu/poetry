A Copper Within Gem
-------------------
Conversations of goblets, the recitation  
of productivities we call deedy serenity.  
There ought to be  
a fragrance of strawberry of a verdure promise perfuming in a city.  
The flask imposes nessecity.  
Next to the opaque green toe of the clay.  
Full stop.  
Compound me and let my substance seek.  
You see mouth as arcane as the sun.  
We open the halves of a secrets and the  
loathing of bombs flies into  
the steady land.  
  
Here I am, a scrupulous tail devoured in the divisions of sea water.  
Of human apple, spirit  
of the muscles,  
died woman blood, your kisses  
perfume into exile  
and a droplet of diamond, with remnants of the room.  
A dull shades of transparent and senile silicon architecture is fainted in the land.  
Not preserving is a form of inheriting.  
The law plan that has everyone motionless.  
Puncture me and let my substance seize.  
The starlight knows this,  
that life in it's cedar boxes is as endless as the guitar.
