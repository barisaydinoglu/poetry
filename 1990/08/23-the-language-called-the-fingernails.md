The Language Called The Fingernails

And trees and evening stars.  
A helicopter is not enough to smother me and keep me  
from the vicinity of your scrupulous curiosities.  
In my divisions at fortnight you are like a film  
and your form  
and colour the way I breathe them.  
Nothing but your musical brain.  
When you return discovered like a propeller.  
Convicts of an atrocious raft  
weaving next to the universe in a sterile wheel,  
sensible as a furious tiger.  
And you deformed in the beligerance and inherited a depriving lonely road.  
Enjoy the many shifty attempts to return  
the moonlit receptacle.  
There is honest fortune in transforming it.  
A bruised mist day  
the I in telegraph when you stand kissed like a lemon.  
  
A blood colored and bitterest planetarium is abolished in the night.  
One of them is honest,  
the other knows languages.  
Where is  
noone  
she cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Be guided by the essential ship's phemonana.  
Of resolute nectarine, spirit  
of the bridges,  
deprived astronaut blood, your kisses  
conduct into exile  
and a droplet of cedar, with remnants of the chimney.
