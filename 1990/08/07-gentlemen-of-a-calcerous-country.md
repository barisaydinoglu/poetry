Gentlemen Of A Calcerous Country
--------------------------------
A camera for metaphor is the lack thereof.  
When the room is full of lewd nose  
inside moths and chaotic hairy shorelines  
and the demonic rituals and the grapes  
at last give forth their bitter bloody feather.  
With  
its tenacious return what is this inscription but a memory hated  
of its pencils? Conducting the land of her dove full  
of happiness.  
You say, what is the planetarium waiting for in its blue garden?  
I tell you it is waiting for grace like you.
