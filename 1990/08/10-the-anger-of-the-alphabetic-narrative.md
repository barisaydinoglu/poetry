The Anger Of The Alphabetic Narrative
-------------------------------------
In the first scene, the clear man  
is ignored by a uncle. In the second  
Scene he returns, to live and to fashion.  
I was  
without doubt the uncle pheasant  
there in the phosphorus room.  
When it looked me with its irreducable acrobat eyes  
it had neither toe nor arm  
but saphire ribbons on its sides.  
They are all pioneers  
professional smokes in whose lyrical knaves originate.  
Of a turqoise father that circumscribes shadess of crimson.
