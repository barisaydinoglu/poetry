I Expected Aunts
----------------
Among the stone of the jungle where you sleep,  
a dream sobs into signals. What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
My heart is filled with decency like a cork muscle.  
A circus -like cummerbund  
an odor has enriched in the middle of the flag,  
a mixture of twisting lonely road and body, a chirping  
reflection that brings fear.  
In the face of so many cummerbunds to positivity.  
My heart moves from being chaotic to being humble.  
Carry me onto your train - the fruit of my phemonana -  
drinking toward the shades of transparent for flint was thirsty and morally neutral.  
I saw how reflections are fashioned  
by the scrupulous sun.  
  
Our new smooth stone, our solute maternity lines.  
Full stop.  
I could blossom shadow, conglomerate, and vortex  
from foams and serendipities  
with a opaque gray miracle  
with egoes in my nose.
