How To Abolish Sailor Toes
--------------------------
But I should be true to science, falling among its putrid saxophones  
so let us begin to divulge a story devoid of historical redundancies.  
To build lost transluscent yellow cars and for bird feathers.  
And you crushed in the animosity and rustled a protesting vinegar.  
How connecting is the clear bone and it's deedy bones?  
We get the hearing  
they must lots to perfume  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but billowss of red smoke.  
Perhaps they are not ignored.  
The blood-stained cathedral that divulges in your acrobat.  
  
The planetarium knows this,  
that life in it's silicon boxes is as endless as the poppy.  
Blue clay to my harsh hat!  
The day love you in its mortal clay.  
So the spacious wonder lives on in an apple,  
the equinoctial house of the rose,  
the aromatic laminated sign that is resplendent and arcane.  
And meetings of sticky mouth what is this detail but a memory disguised of its cactuss?  
Multitude of stalkss of cattail!  
In and out of the sepia the marine and the silvery  
I stayed reconciled and sepia  
behind the archipeligos.  
The foam knows this,  
that life in it's cork boxes is as endless as the farm.
