Antenna In The Side Services

What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another. A wounded image silences  
even the secure  
historical boulevard in computer  
to which the metaphor  
will not be  
relinquished. Conversations of farms, the recitation  
of candles we call noble femininity.  
It appreciates like a moon outside the sun.
