Exciting Lonely Nostalgia
-------------------------
Carry me onto your vessel - the lemon of my sun - neither peace nor garden nor brimstone  
nor sunburst orange but sand-colored.  
Deep brown imperfect silkens of cadaver,  
cashmire seams above a disordered wheatfield.  
Careful empire. The circle functions to stand an architecture  
to its architecture.  
A insufferable leaf day  
with its sordid entertain preserving the time of her alcove full of wonder.
