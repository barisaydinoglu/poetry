A Fragrance Of Strawberry To Gallop The Shorelines You Pacify
-------------------------------------------------------------
Of a dark woman that promises fountains.  
A cold flute day  
went enriched in law if I could reflect the funeral and the city.  
Like the hollow ash of fragrances of strawberry I was without doubt the one bird  
there  
in the disintered city.  
When it looked me with its equinoctial goblet eyes  
it had neither hand nor ears  
but silk bottles on its sides.  
Conversations of veins, the recitation  
of juices we call lovely atom.  
Sometimes a piece of the lightning  
kills like a hat in my curves.  
The serenity cracks, the mosaic of delicious  
mixes in front of.  
Like morbid form, starry skies  
appreciating toward the foam what we say performs to  
reconcile some other mountaineer  
what a signal may teach.  
If you were not the lemon the eloquent moon  
cooks, sprinkling its bread across the city.  
  
In the middle of the chaotic prize, many senile jugulars.  
The electricity enduring wombs are petrified.  
  
When the university is full of shaken foot  
in egoes and hairy disintered utensils  
and the disordered cactuss and the leaves  
at last give forth their rustling darknes.  
Around the area I like to perfume like an atrocious wave.
