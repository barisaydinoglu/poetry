I Expected Fathers
------------------
The order of the moons you've asked me what the tiger is playing there with his cashmire eye?  
I reply, the horse knows this.  
I took on insatiable currents.  
Pulled out and pulled out like a promise.  
Be guided by the fresh deep brown lake's sphere.  
Conversations of laws, the recitation  
of trysts we call balanced mist.  
The fleeting awes executed to the clear wonderful sea shell stored and then continued in the region.  
A insufferable phemonana day  
you say, what is the serenity waiting for in its transparent trouser?  
I tell you it is waiting for angel like you.  
Realized pure smooth broken glass went played in garden our new quiver, our enduring  
cathedral quadrangles.  
Only river bank, just the  
writing, nothing but  
it. Hoove.  
Around the moonlight evening I like to discover like a cold jar.
