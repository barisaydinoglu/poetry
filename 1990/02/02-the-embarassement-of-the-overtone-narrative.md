The Embarassement Of The Overtone Narrative
-------------------------------------------
Nothing but that lunar of pencils.  
I do not change in the jungle of wounded legume.  
A loaf of bread baked with rusted happiness and salt.  
Land.  
In your curves of anger the room of awes play.  
You relinquish in the land as in a naked archipeligos.  
Grace of a condemned rusted starry sky.
