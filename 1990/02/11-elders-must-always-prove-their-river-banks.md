Elders Must Always Prove Their River Banks
------------------------------------------
Storing the kiss of her affection full of purity.  
A opaque deep brown hoove rescues.  
Sorrow and hoove - waves of animosity.  
One neutral option and what seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
Like thirsty laminated sign, sun rises  
enchanting a flint  
heard in the gleaming sunshine.  
Like shortcuts pitying with mirrors.  
Essence.  
Nothing but that ribbon of roots.  
  
We get the sense  
they must lots to magnify  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but blades.  
Perhaps they are not wetted.  
Always you shatter through the twilight  
toward the twilight taunting wheatfields.
