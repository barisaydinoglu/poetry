Tell Them That I Am Giving Up Blossoming In Points Of View
----------------------------------------------------------
In the bitter smooth brick, many distorted circumstances.  
You relax headlong into an area to rejoice your business.  
A tetrahedron next to a circle,  
the chaotic workings of solute law.  
A fleeting fog of juices.  
Rose.  
There ought to be a serenity of a fluidic silence expanding in a land.  
A tree -like clock  
if you were not the lemon the musical moon  
cooks, sprinkling its lemon across the land.  
Only wave, just the  
stars in the sky, nothing but  
it. Acrobat.  
To seek another land I am compounded by prize and juice, by trash barge and mist.  
A sunshine of warmths pockets of metal converted into silken.  
As if to congeal or shine or hate.  
  
And a sifted fellowship's mud will  
enchant you.  
The great dignity of the serendipity!  
What phenomena does the turkey contain?  
How little we seize and how much it crystallizes the epiphany of this galaxy.  
And behind my hammock, during the midnight, I woke up naked  
and full of tiredness.  
  
I took  
on dry stars.  
When the divisions  
is full of mourning arm  
outside felicities and browbeaten lonely stones  
And the decadent breakfasts and the keys  
at last give forth their troubled wound.
