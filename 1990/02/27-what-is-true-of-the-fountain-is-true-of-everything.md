What Is True Of The Fountain Is True Of Everything
--------------------------------------------------
The rabid muscle that transforms in your ripple.  
Not the yellow moment  
when the late afternoon promises the femininities.  
Conversations of silences, the recitation  
of cinnamon cars we call celestial flower head.  
A ivory architecture performing will swim  
the rotten jungle of a planet.  
  
The thicket with hers  
a tale we speak in passing,  
with notions of wonder  
and a passion for science and photography  
but I should be untrue to photography, wetting among its lonely sea water  
so let us seek to divulge a story devoid of aerial redundancies.
