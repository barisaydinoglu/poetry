I Have Gone Overflowing
-----------------------
For bed was dead and morally positive.  
What we say wakes to  
fashion some other father  
what a signal may teach.  
And so that its yeasts will hate your foot. Fragmented day and the torrential dew  
falter at the walls of my house.  
Among the exiled area of clenched sweetnes.  
A eyelids and a curves  
mixing the archipeligos.  
Everything chaotic with infinite voices, the salt of the mist  
and piles of charitable bread next to fortnight.
