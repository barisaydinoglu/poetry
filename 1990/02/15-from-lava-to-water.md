From Lava To Water
------------------
Expanded and then began in the land.  
Nothing but that smooth broken glass of goblets.  
To re-cover lost sea water and for elixirs.  
Juice was no longer below the transmission threshold.  
  
The stars in the sky knows this,  
that life in it's copper boxes is as endless as the echo.  
Wetting the foam of her love full of joy.
