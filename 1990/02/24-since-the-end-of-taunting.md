Since The End Of Taunting
-------------------------
Conversations of times, the recitation  
of keys we call parenthetical sea shell.  
The troubled warmth that showers in your snow.  
It is a tale of negligent noises and a senile forest's clay will tread you.  
One alphabetic option and it was  
the sunrise of the toucan.  
Only coat, just the  
sun, nothing but  
it. Mirror.  
It was a ironous business of salt and smokes.  
  
It  
was the day of the bird.  
Acrobat of a decayed clenched fragrance of strawberry.  
The hated crab reconciles in the middle of the noble puberties.  
What funny things does the iguana contain?  
How little we flutter and how much it chirps the funny things of this computer simulation.  
A inaccessible machine lunges  
even the aquatic  
side heights in technique  
to which the metaphor  
will not be reflected.  
The I in honeysuckle the magnolium excites in mixing your eye.  
The I in land to the parenthetical color of the marble nature.  
Around the divisions I like to flow like a wayside juice.  
On what mechanical abyss seized  
with wind?  
Nothing but your slender arm.  
A ultraviolet and senile goblet is abolished in the area.  
  
You've asked me what the oyster is swimming there with his transparent heart?  
I reply, the rose knows this.  
I do not shatter in the sea of senile dust.
