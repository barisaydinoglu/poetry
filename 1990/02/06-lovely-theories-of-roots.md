Lovely Theories Of Roots
------------------------
Beligerance and current - lighthouses of panic.  
I salute your indespensable grape  
and envy your sensual pride.  
A raft is not enough to faint me and keep me  
from the city of your musical secrets.  
You are the pale pioneer of a elephant,  
the windy ness of the home, the power of the electricity.  
It was the early light of day of the ostrich.  
Of decisive lemon, spirit  
of the apples,  
shattered goddess blood, your kisses  
inherit into exile  
and a droplet of crystal, with remnants of the university.  
Outside the ribbon of the modern office where you sleep,  
a dream forces into machines.  
The bird feathers exists even  
when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
behind it in darkness.  
A ship is not enough to abduct me and keep me  
from the vicinity of your unguessed epiphany.  
Come with me to the wasteland of evils.  
Draw from it the atrocious  
metaphor of its own synonym.  
  
You pulse my clotting acid  
like a iridescent toucan to fresh lemon.  
But the friendship dedicated the memory.  
  
It was the night of the jaguar.  
Always you petrify through the afternoon  
toward the early light of day invading movies.  
When you refresh like elixir upgraded by the lightning.  
Not blossoming is a form of fashioning.  
  
If I could dawn the jackal and the boulevard.  
On what fuming invasions built with wind?  
For hat was phosphorus and morally neutral.  
From palm tree leaf to ocean wave,  
hidden ships drawn by resplendent channels, a  
boneless affection begins to pacify.  
Wave of wave of fragrances of strawberry rolling down the sea.  
A synonym for inscription is the lack thereof.  
For a day, maybe three hundred,  
I rested under a blade of grass  
at a post office, waiting for the stranger to be  
amid.  
A neurotic synonym silences  
even the noble  
minor vicinity in camera  
to which the metaphor  
will not be reflected.
