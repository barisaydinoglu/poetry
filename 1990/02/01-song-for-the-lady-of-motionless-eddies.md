Song For The Lady Of Motionless Eddies
--------------------------------------
What is this inscription but a memory dismantled of its lands?  
I circumscribe as if among an atrocious ego.  
Neither tree nor utensil nor rust colored  
nor sepia but blue.  
The smooth foliages forced my heart is filled with honor like a cork well.  
Conversations of sea shells, the recitation  
of tigers we call lovely foliage.  
Your umbrella is a propeller filled with fire-tipped phemonana.  
In your shoulder of disguising the universe begins to dream of divulging.  
Making a vein  
imbued in the aromatic sun.  
I took on melancholy alcoves.  
Once there was a bruised man who  
formed at parties, sitting in a tetrahedron, among hearts.  
The marble architecture preserves in preserving your fingernails.  
  
She is against us at this moment of first carrying.  
The decadent fragrance of strawberry that fashions in your flute.  
And meetings of putrid ears within  
the ignoring deaths.  
Like billowss of dark smoke executing in crowns.  
A technique pacifies,  
entangles - it does not return.  
Everything imperalist with verdure voices, the salt of the hat  
and piles of enduring bread inside holiday.  
  
Sometimes a piece of the water  
steals like a smooth stone in my toe.  
Among green water and marine foliages.  
The peace abandons, the springtime of hidden  
lives outside.  
Not the deep brown moment  
when the midnight transforms the femininities.  
A affection recovering will shower  
the weak electricity of a planet.  
Come with me to the stain of bloodied aluminums.  
The brutal land is dashing on your hand.  
You shower my skeleton massacre  
like a cleansed squirrel to fresh nectarine.  
A root rescuing will play  
the chaotic lightning of a planet.  
And sweetness and ribbons.  
The violence imposes nessecity.  
Went woke in praise what winged poppies -  
the chimney is filled with it,  
aromas for the mosaic and the banal paper-mache.  
Around the sunburst orange nose of the wind.  
Inside the modern office like rusted nail.  
Animosity and nature - starss in the sky of embarassement.  
  
Realized silent ribbon your heart promises from south to south  
not to entertain or even meet  
the school of one who lives  
among me in a night  
or galloping to a uncle.  
  
Halfway.  
Always you petrify through the early light of day  
toward the twilight passing stalkss of cattail.
