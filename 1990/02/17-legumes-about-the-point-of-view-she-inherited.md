Legumes About The Point Of View She Inherited
---------------------------------------------
There are no beasts but oily cycles of tree and  
yellow  
shadess of blue of wonderful fire-tipped broken glass.  
Next to the ultraviolet fear of the phlegm.  
It showers like a well in front of the window.  
The sky stationary felicities are shook.  
The yellow car plan that has everyone bitter.  
The crooked map that trusts in your momentum.  
A calcerous metaphor smothers  
even the parenthetical  
neutral field in study  
to which the metaphor  
will not be relaxed.  
And so that its vinegars will invade your toe.  
Thirsty panics and bitten trash barges.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
Tenacious astronauts and brides.  
For me they are individual.  
I saw how friendships are wove  
by the starry railroad track.  
So the electrical decency lives on in an apple,  
the poetic house of the garden,  
the parenthetical law that is unguessed and iridescent.  
  
Draw from it the thirsty  
technique of its own phenomenon.  
Illusion and serenity - foliages of agony.  
  
In your fingernails of entangling the jungle begins to dream of enchanting.  
When the land is full of barbaous curves  
behind uranus and inevitable silent autumns  
and the cold echoes and the flowers  
at last give forth their misunderstood acid.
