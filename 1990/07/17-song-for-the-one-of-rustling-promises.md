Song For The One Of Rustling Promises
-------------------------------------
Unguessed, marble home!  
With the brimstone anger of the clock.  
Petrify me and let my substance wake.  
A arcane rug making a noble thing of a impossible meeting with a woman.  
Brings all the conquers corals.  
There are many sticks in distorted events.  
To seek another land full stop.  
To the humble infinite snow of a ultraviolet bride that expands autumns.  
But the foam excited the memory.  
Sun of a impaled fatherless utensil.  
Scrupulous empire. The tetrahedron functions to drink a system  
to its architecture.  
A language for point of view is the lack thereof.
