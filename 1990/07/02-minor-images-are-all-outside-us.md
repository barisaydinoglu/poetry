Minor Images Are All Outside Us
-------------------------------
The arrogant echo that inherits in your breakfast.  
Nobody here is waiting for the next pencil.  
Goblet. You refreshed yourself for re-covering.  
And the drop to its wave  
and among the movies the cosmic one  
the mother covered with lion hearted flower head.  
I do not loiter in the chimney of callous lard.
