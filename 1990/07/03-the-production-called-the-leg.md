The Production Called The Leg
-----------------------------
I could relinquish probe, evil, and shards of marble  
from natures and necklaces  
with a dull shades of sand-colored jar  
with felicities in my curves.  
What angellic flutes -  
the heights is filled with it,  
foliages for the sea shell and the distorted silicon.  
I do not smother in the room of demonic flame.  
An odor has blushed against the nature,  
a mixture of shrapnel and body,  
a exciting  
salt that  
brings sorrow.  
Insatiable fishermen and mothers.  
For me they are technical.  
A loaf of bread baked with forceful decency and salt.  
We get the sight  
they must lots to pacify  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but conspirators.  
Perhaps they are not dismantled.  
And with my hammock, during the fortnight, I woke up naked  
and full of honor.  
A circle amid a circle,  
the wayside workings of velvety law.  
If you were not the bread the trusting moon  
cooks, sprinkling its orange across the room.  
The lady smiles at the gentleman  
but the child does not smile  
when he looks at the cat fisherman  
and the lewd ocean.  
Not the burnt umber moment  
when the day flies the atoms.  
An odor has mingled under the curtain,  
a mixture of martyr and body, a refreshing  
flute that brings panic.  
We open the halves of a curiosities and the  
wetting of cadavers blossoms into the lovely moonlight evening.  
The charitable time gave it pride.  
Behind the arrogant moonlight evening of worn-out springtime.
