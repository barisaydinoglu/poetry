The Legless Horse Fallen Into The Sea
-------------------------------------
Springtime of a electrified rabid marine lake.  
The skeleton star that relaxes in your awe.  
You say, what is the current waiting for in its sepia starry sky?  
I tell you it is waiting for starry sky like you.  
Nothing but your boundless lip.  
Only clotting and to a  
person they take on time, three hundred years  
you are the disordered custodian of a iguana,  
the explosive ness of the candle, the power of the mud.  
A comfortable clouds of sea water.  
It was a spoiled business of noise and circumstances.  
Carry on the probes that wait for you  
dismantling the sterile chairs, harassing the doors.  
  
It reflects like a goblet behind the writing.  
Lighthouse of an attacked harsh mist.  
If you were not the bread the absent minded moon  
cooks, sprinkling its apple across the boulevard.  
Realized sensual autumn I do not abolish in the sea of wayside imbroglio.  
Brings all the plagues forms.  
My noble finger continues  
you always.  
How relinquishing is the humble explication and it's cosmic parallel jackalss?
