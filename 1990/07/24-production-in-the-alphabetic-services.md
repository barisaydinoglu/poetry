The elixir knows this,  
that life in it's gold boxes is as endless as the horse. A muscle kissing will conduct  
the rambunctious electricity of a planet.  
Return to the homeland of the salts.  
There ought to be a sun  
rise of a solute mirror waking in a heights.  
A vertical rain of flowers.  
The winged stranger  
responds in the myriad morning.  
Pure saliva perches the bottles but I should be true to jouranlism, imprisoning among its shady doors  
so let us try to divulge a story without minor redundancies.  
This careless school and expanding momentum shatters me  
with it's perfect lakes like hips and eyelids  
and rust colored lunars like brow and serendipities.  
  
The heat rosy probes are deceived.  
Under the fractious chimney of weak smooth stone.
