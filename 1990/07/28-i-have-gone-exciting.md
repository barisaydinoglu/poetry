I Have Gone Exciting
--------------------
Deep brown vaginas of lineage,  
green seams above a lashed coral.  
Conversations of clusters, the recitation  
of starlights we call secure lemon.  
For a day, maybe twenty-seven,  
I rested under a ray of sunlight  
at a post office, waiting for the lady to be in.  
One of them is manly,  
the other knows languages.  
Where is somebody  
he quips, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
  
Full stop.
