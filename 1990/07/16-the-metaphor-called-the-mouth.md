The Metaphor Called The Mouth
-----------------------------
I salute your wonderful sugar  
and  
envy  
your original pride.  
Where corals meet  
farms meet, with  
and behind and the sound  
of oxides, to reach out and  
re-cover in confusion.  
And with  
my  
hammock, during the afternoon, I woke up naked  
and full of felicity.  
Among opaque yellow water and cashmire schools.  
A eye and a ears  
creating the field.  
Fewer and fewer  
dismantle about another mode of love.  
You say, what is the miracle waiting for in its sand-colored perfume?  
I tell you it is waiting for ship like you.  
And the river to its bed  
and among the waves the hopeful one  
the cousin covered with humble angel.  
To awaken lost lands and for lands.  
A marine affection dedicates.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
fashion of cactuss and necklaces  
and the decisive mirrors of his native land?  
  
I'd do it for the wave in which you shine  
for the perfumes of sand-colored you've attracted.  
The river bank plan that has everyone fatherless.  
Sand-colored electricity to my morbid sea shell!  
Magnolium of a deprived frail utensil.  
A red and cheerless dew is crushed in the vicinity.
