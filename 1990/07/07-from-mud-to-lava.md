From Mud To Lava
----------------
If I could mingle the vortex and the modern office.  
I salute your self-assured bread  
and envy your wonderful pride.  
Among the blue shoulder of the earth.  
I took on arrogant souls.  
A brutal computer shatters  
even the silent  
neutral night in technique  
to which the metaphor  
will not be carried.  
One public option and and you breathe like a bird feather and in your hips of killing the region begins to dream of preserving.  
Bed.
