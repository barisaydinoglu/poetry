A Flower To Gather The Serendipities You Set
--------------------------------------------
A chorus of jaguars at lunchtime un mingled un pitied  
comes to a halt before a serenity.  
I took on thirsty roses.  
All autumns become errors.  
Nothing but your boundless finger.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
Only ironous and to a  
one they take on time, million years
