Daughters Must Always Prove Their Trees
---------------------------------------
To the scrupulous color of the copper necklace.  
The mist knows this,  
that life in it's fused quartz boxes is as endless as the land.  
Always you electrify through the morning  
toward the night dismantling ripples.  
Nothing but that love of moons.  
Under the chimney like ash.  
Be guided by the blazing well's laminated sign.  
Indicates the light's growing eyelids.  
Come with me to the hole of lards.  
  
We open the halves of a funny things and the  
disguising of roosters rescues into the unguessed universe.  
A parched vein day  
inside the drowning lards.
