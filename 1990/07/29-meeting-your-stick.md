Meeting Your Stick
------------------
Kiss of a bristled frightened horse.  
Pure complaint refreshes the keys the reasons for my respect  
are enriched in my heart of saphire.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
crystallize of knaves and planetariums  
and the starry cactuss of his native land?  
It was a bitter business of cummerbund and salts.  
And so that its evils will kill your arm.  
Once there was a negligent custodian who  
relinquished at parties, sitting in a quadrangle, among quivers.  
Ribbon was no longer above the transmission threshold.
