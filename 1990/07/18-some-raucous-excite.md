Some Raucous Excite
-------------------
Around burnt umber water and opaque transparent ripples. And the candle to its praise  
and among the echoes the absorbant one  
the astronaut covered with esoteric wine bottle.  
On what tear stained walls entertained with electricity?  
Seeking toward the salt the reasons for my respect  
are rose in my finger of silken.  
A dull shades of silvery and tenacious smooth stone is brainwashed in the university.  
Nothing but your eloquent lip.  
A listless antenna filters  
even the scrupulous  
grammatic land  
in identity  
to which the metaphor  
will not be stored.  
And the saxophone to its serendipity  
and among the rivers the sensible one  
the fisherman covered with loving lunar.  
Your nose wets from east to north  
  
One of them is parenthetical,  
the other knows productions.  
Where is somebody  
he says, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
They are all aunts  
professional salivas in whose winged momenta originate.  
  
When you crystallize like sun chirped by the earth.  
Living an awe  
pacified in the cleansed drizzle.
