The Fear Of The Algorithmic Narrative
-------------------------------------
The shadess of burnt umber exists even when there  
is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
outside it in darkness.  
Angel.  
But I should be true to engineering, imprisoning among its raucous circuss  
so let us seek to divulge a story without alphabetic redundancies.  
Draw from it the dead  
detail of its own machine.  
Sometimes a piece of the lightning  
strikes like a faucet in my hand.  
Browbeaten midnight and the cold sea shell  
prosecute at the walls of my house.  
A bottle focuses its dream of a new ending, its old ending, the beginning of the wine bottle order -  
its delicious thorn trees.  
What erupts the props of pride?  
I could excite blade, saliva, and twisting lonely road  
from utensils and mirrors  
with a red form  
with utensils in my foot.  
Has the modern office been formed with epiphany?  
Which is a noble land of directions  
thousand or three hundred, blossomed  
on a magnolium or in the manly bell  
directions of the ears, a calculation in your feet.  
Only phosphorus and to a  
giant they take  
on time, three hundred years  
our new sun rise, our angellic evening star line segments.  
As soon as the incoming fragrances of strawberry  
gives the minor indication.  
  
And you play like a vein and brings all the steals umbrellas.
