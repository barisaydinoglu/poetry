Mingling Sordid Nostalgia
-------------------------
So the monastic respect lives on in an apple,  
the gleaming house of the smooth stone,  
the nocturnal time that is trusting and stationary.  
A line segment around a tetrahedron,  
the parched workings of domestic law.  
Not the crimson moment  
when the twilight dedicates the foliages.  
Of your gray green car when you hold out your toe.
