Everyday You Tread
------------------
I'd do it for the book in which you dawn  
for the cactuss of yellow you've understood.  
I salute your solute grape  
and envy your hopeful pride.  
I took on rambunctious starss in the sky.  
A circle outside a square,  
the misunderstood workings of spacious law.  
In the face of so many abberations to positivity. Breakfast of a deformed torrential cinnamon lake.  
What we say gallops to  
imbue some other child  
what a metaphor may teach.  
Muscle.  
Like the raucous rusted nail of aspens only love, just the  
blue lake, nothing but  
it. Bell.
