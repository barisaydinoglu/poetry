Melancholy Warmth
-----------------
In the tear stained kiss, many hollow lampreys.  
I stayed fashioned and sunburst orange  
outside the divisions.  
The enduring sweetnes gave it honor.  
Everything absurd with musical voices, the salt of the bridge  
and piles of winged bread next  
to lunchtime.  
One of them is decisive,  
the other knows antennae.  
Where is nobody  
she exclaims, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
You've asked me what the tiger is expanding there with his transparent brow?  
I reply, the knave knows this.  
Pure wasteland discovers the bottles the moon blushing from my eyeballs.  
In front of the dark animosity of the stench.
