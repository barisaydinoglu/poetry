The Trapdoor Fallen Into The Sea
--------------------------------
Once there was a calculating uncle who  
gathered at parties, sitting in a line, among salts.  
Shut out and closed off like a land.  
When you promise performed like a curtain.  
I saw how pencils are relinquished  
by the deedy law.  
Decay me and let my substance blush.  
Femininity.  
Violenet late afternoon and the lashed fragrance of strawberry  
loathe at the walls of my house.
