Tell Him That I Am Giving Up Living In Identities
-------------------------------------------------
Beginning a hat  
imbued in the esoteric drizzle. A silent drizzle of prizes.  
I took on furious hearts.  
Our new sweetnes, our infinite fused quartz architecture quadrangles.  
Enjoy the many torrential attempts to rejoice  
the sensible dagger.  
There is smooth fortune in forming it.  
Peace was no longer above the transmission threshold.  
Under the divisions like brick.  
Your planetarium is a laminated sign filled with sterile moon.  
  
As soon as the incoming breakfasts  
gives the overtone indication.  
My heart moves  
from being wet-winged to being trusting.
