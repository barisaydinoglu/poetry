The Panic Of The Overtone Narrative
-----------------------------------
Because I love you, love, around the wind and around the earth.  
Everything clotting with essential voices, the salt of the wheatfield  
And piles of handsome bread among afternoon.  
Browbeaten moldy bananas and dry invasions.  
What secrets does the turkey contain?  
How little we carry and how much it shines the funny things of this galaxy.  
For land was blood-stained and morally positive.  
Here I am, a fresh hips mutated in the modern office of lake.  
  
Not the sunburst orange moment  
when the day shines the warmths.
