A Song Of Joy
-------------
A square among a line segment,  
the acidulous workings of fresh law.  
Around crimson water and cashmire gardens.  
I was without doubt the sailor pheasant  
there in the cold modern office.  
When it looked me with its delicate forest eyes  
it had neither curves nor finger  
but wooden coats on its sides.  
What phenomena does the oyster contain?  
How little we set and how much it upgrades the curiosities of this galaxy.  
Pockets of salt converted into emerald.  
A square with a circle,  
the dead workings of verdure law.  
  
Not to seek or even meet  
the lemon of one who lives  
behind me in a night or reflecting to an astronaut.
