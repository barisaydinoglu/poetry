A Song Of Purity
----------------
A chorus of lobsters at midnight un enriched un bristled  
comes to a halt before a foliage.  
One of the depths of my fingernails - your drinking  
stills  
your full regard as though it were earth.  
Nothing but your profound leg.  
Preserving from shaken saphire.  
Wave of wave of mosaics rolling down the sea.  
A identity for camera is the lack thereof.  
A imperalist heart day  
opaque sunburst orange bloodied irons of moldy banana,  
marine seams above a phosphorus honeysuckle.  
The gentleman smiles at the one  
but the custodian does not smile  
when he looks at the oyster goddess  
and the tenacious ocean.  
Sometimes a piece of the clay  
undulates like a flint in my eye.  
Beligerance and grace - flower heads of beligerance.  
You are the sticky gentleman of a oyster,  
the atrocious ness of the perfume, the power of the heat.  
In your hips of abandoning the boulevard begins to dream of protecting.
