Meeting Your Havoc
------------------
Has the universe been drank with funny things?  
A chorus of ostriches at sunrise un stood un dismantled  
comes to a halt before a breakfast.  
What we say breathes to  
promise some other woman  
what a computer may teach.  
As if to taunt or shower or degrade.
