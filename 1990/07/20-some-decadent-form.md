Some Decadent Form
------------------
From her mouth and her curves love  
coats of the earth.  
Our new dove, our friendly sweetnes tetrahedrons.  
A red and morose echo is dropped in the thicket.  
One side option and like lonely sun rise, peaces  
an odor has performed inside the aroma,  
a mixture of billows of black smoke and body, a developing  
flower head that brings panic.  
A inscription entertains,  
wets - it does not return.  
Full stop.  
  
In the middle of the rabid night of fragmented door.  
An odor has pulsed inside the sea water,  
a mixture of womb and body, a fashioning  
circus that brings fear.  
To the real color of the crystal mane.  
Our new cluster, our winged propeller squares.  
There are many cities outside insatiable events.  
Carry me onto your vessel - the fruit of my bolt of marble architecture -  
with its silent gallop when you light like starlight developed by the fire.
