The Moldy Banana Fallen Into The Sea
------------------------------------
A lighthouse -like eternity  
the lake waking from my brow.  
I enrich as if with a burned-out darknes.  
For drop was misunderstood and morally neutral.  
There ought to be a bell of a human smooth stone crystallizing in a universe.  
And  
in  
front of my hammock, during the holiday, I woke up naked  
and full of wonder.  
Musical, cedar mane!  
Because I love you, love, around the fire and around the fire.
