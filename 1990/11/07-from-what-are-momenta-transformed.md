From What Are Momenta Transformed
---------------------------------
One of them is absorbant,  
the other knows points of view.  
Where is noone  
she cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Enjoy the many lashed attempts to conduct  
the slender grave.  
There is hopeful fortune in wetting it.  
I stayed continued and crimson  
behind the divisions.  
Developing toward the starry sky the fresh coats sobbed boney weather, shifty lights like the essence.  
My heart is filled with decency like a copper lighthouse.  
Draw from it the sticky  
detail of its own technique.  
Loving empire. The triangle functions to preserve a system  
to its environment.  
Fewer and fewer  
protest about another mode of tiredness.  
I breathe as if around a listless explication.
