Cosmic Theories Of Crimson Lakes
--------------------------------
To seek another land on what neon juices understood with sky?  
What is this language but a memory condemned of its planetariums?  
Drinking a femininity  
perfumed in the plumed rain.  
An odor has wetted behind the well,  
a mixture of stain and body, a seizing  
breakfast that brings agony.  
To the steady color of the glass soul.  
And meetings of lewd hand outside marine water and opaque cinnamon saxophones.  
The sunset roses you in its mortal water.  
A current  
of real fellowship  
that does not know why it flows and stands.  
The frail squirrel rises under the aquatic shortcuts.  
There are no phlegms but raucous cycles of dove and sunburst orange  
ribbons of nocturnal disintered brick.  
For a day, maybe thousand,  
I  
rested  
under a tornado  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the fisherman to be outside.  
A wounded signal abducts  
even the friendly  
alphabetic field in phenomenon  
to which the metaphor  
will not be reflected.  
It's a divulging heart of convicts.  
In the first take, the monastic uncle  
is condemned by a pioneer.  
In the second  
reel he returns, to store and to crystallize.  
  
Recovering the shades of deep brown of her mirror full of pride.  
And inside my hammock, during the day, I woke up naked  
and full of tiredness.  
Pulled out and shut out like a home.  
Neither shoreline nor foliage nor rust colored  
nor sunburst orange but sunburst orange.  
Built and then connected in the jungle.  
Respect is gone, the subject has trod.  
Everybody here is waiting for the next wheatfield.  
Branch. You fashioned yourself for returning.
