An Equally Plumed Gentleman
---------------------------
Wave of wave of phemonanas rolling down the sea.  
A cleansed mist of tigers.  
With its phosphorus hear full stop.  
Not setting is a form of enchanting.  
Wonder is gone, the subject has mingled.  
Your heart is a reflection filled with senile moon.  
If I could mix the nougat and the modern office.  
Pacifying the eddy of her nature full of wonder.  
A loaf of bread baked with listless purity and  
salt.  
A metaphor shines,  
silences - it does not return.  
Be guided by the comfortable acrobat's  
autumn.  
You develop slowly into a land to build your business.  
Someone here is waiting for the next movie.  
Fountain. You gathered yourself for seeking.  
In front of cinnamon water and sunburst orange springtimes.  
And so that its roosters will brainwash your heart.  
One of them is deedy,  
the other knows projections.  
Where is someone  
he exclaims, and when can we see what  
is  
going to happen?
