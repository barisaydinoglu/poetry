Rabid Defender
--------------
A chorus of oysters at holiday un preserved un lunged  
comes to a halt before a river bank.  
I took on decadent wheatfields.  
Communist morning and the insatiable heart  
disguise at the walls of my house.  
Some perfume but I inherit your metal like dove.  
  
Not to rescue or even meet  
the silence of one who mixes  
inside me in a city or reflecting to a stranger.  
They are all children  
professional phlegms in whose wonderful umbrellas originate.
