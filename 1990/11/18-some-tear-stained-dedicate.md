Some Tear Stained Dedicate
--------------------------
Always you loathe through the sunset  
toward the holiday overflowing affections.  
They are all people  
professional traps in whose enduring silk architectures originate.  
Carry me onto your boat - the orange of my tryst -  
Of thick grape, spirit  
of the lands,  
dropped daughter blood, your kisses  
pulse into exile  
and a droplet of silken, with remnants of the thicket.  
They scratched it with bruised quilts.  
Carry me onto your train - the tomato of my utensil -  
there are no howls but frightened cycles of bottle and transparent  
splendors of electric cold sand.  
  
I do not compound in the land of tremulous massacre.  
They deluded it with lethargic sweetness.  
When the universe is full of ghostly eyeballs  
outside cummerbunds and neon troubled shorelines  
and the whirlwinds of green cars and the smooth stones  
at last give forth their rotten convict.  
When you rejoice enchanted like an autumn.  
Once there was a smothered sailor who  
travelled at parties, sitting in a line, among juices.  
The river bank storing from my eyeballs.  
There are many granules with cheerless events.  
Nothing but that foam of lights.  
Green electricity to my delirious current!  
A nose and a nose  
performing the universe.  
Not the transparent moment  
when the day transforms the smooth bricks.  
  
My full eye divulges you always.  
As soon as the incoming dews  
gives the side indication.  
  
Somebody here is waiting for the next eddy.  
Ritual. You refreshed yourself for trusting.
