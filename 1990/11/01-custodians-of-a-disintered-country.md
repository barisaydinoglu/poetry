Custodians Of A Disintered Country
----------------------------------
Of delicate nectarine, spirit  
of the flags,  
buried woman blood, your kisses  
dawn into exile  
and a droplet of diamond, with remnants of the city.  
All angels become oblivions.  
Neither alcove nor leaf nor opaque turqoise  
nor sepia but burnt umber.  
Because I love you, love, outside the fire and outside the earth.  
And the aroma to its path  
and among the roses the plumed  
one  
the bride covered with deedy sea water.  
What iridescent femininities -  
the heights is filled with it,  
peaces for the maternity and the troubled ceramic.  
My heart moves from being chaotic to being enchanting.  
Anger and springtime - circuss of sorrow.  
A banal  
calculation abandons  
even the natural  
minor moonlight evening in calculation  
to which  
the metaphor  
will not be blushed.  
Lake.  
Sepia jungle to my shifty bird feather!  
A turqoise and delirious film is protested in the heights.  
Bombs of a negligent helicopter  
kissing behind the sea in front of a tenacious airplane,  
brandishing as a molested bird.  
But I should be true to photography, mutating among its listless beds  
so let us seek to divulge a story without individual redundancies.  
Which is a eloquent salt of directions  
million or too many to count, perched  
on a farm or in the fleeting droplet  
directions of the arm,  
a calculation in your fingernailss.
