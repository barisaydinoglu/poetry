From What Are Bells Breathed
----------------------------
The morning circuss you in its mortal earth.  
For a day, maybe too many to count,  
I rested under a palm tree leaf  
at a bus stop, waiting for the father to be next to.  
Only mist, just the  
flint, nothing but  
it. Book.  
Your tail seeks from west to west  
And inside my hammock, during the early light of day, I woke up naked  
and full of joy.  
Full stop.  
If I could enchant the imperfect cork and the boulevard.  
Pockets of iron converted into glass.  
Deaths of a phosphorus airplane  
waking amid the jungle within a wayside train,  
affluent as a clenched toucan.  
So the vertical sincerity lives on in a fruit,  
the naked house of the door,  
the lion hearted mane that is trusting and perfect.
