The Neon Wounded Soldier
------------------------
Not the burnt umber moment  
when the late afternoon inherits the serenities.  
In the first scene, the incredulous woman  
is deformed by a gentleman. In the second  
scene he returns, to drink and to tread.  
What we say mingles to  
relax some other god  
what a technique may teach.  
Neither sea water nor bell nor opaque black  
nor silvery but transparent.  
  
They killed it with bruised breakfasts.  
In the middle of the moonlight evening like salt.
