I Expected Children
-------------------
There are no trapdoors but torrential cycles of apple and burnt umber  
lemons of lyrical blood-stained metal.  
I was without doubt the giant oyster  
there in the raucous chimney.  
When it looked me with its plumed foam eyes  
it had neither lip nor tail  
but paper-mache lemons on its sides.  
Because I love you, love, among the jungle and amid the water.  
Always you crack through the afternoon  
toward the holiday freezing poppies.  
I'm the person to the sun rise of immediate poppy.  
The banal shoreline is angellic on your nose.  
Your eyelids discovers from north to north
