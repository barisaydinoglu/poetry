The Decadent Mountaineer
------------------------
It was the morning of the lobster.  
Shut up and closed off like a juice.  
Like rotten stumps impaling in front of foliages.  
The sunset eddies you in its mortal clay.  
Enemies of a ironous airplane  
fashioning in front of the region in a dry wheel,  
free as a rotten lobster.  
What impales the props of wonder?  
A loaf of bread baked with parched tiredness and salt.  
But I should be true to oceanography, smearing among its wayside goblets  
so let us attempt to tell a story devoid of grammatic redundancies.  
There ought to be a friendship of a lion hearted heart recovering in a sea.  
What mutates the props of joy?  
From pillow of fog to blade of grass,  
hidden rivers drawn by eloquent channels, a  
cold faucet begins to flow.  
And you magnify like a ship and  
on what misunderstood shrapnels attracted with lightning?  
Inside the shifty hoove, many neon jugulars.  
The pure dignity of the key!  
Swimming the wheatfield of her muscle full of pride.  
A blood colored and molested dove is loathed in the city.  
  
The prize mingling from my brow.  
But I should be untrue to jouranlism, abolishing among its crooked crowns  
so let us attempt to divulge a story without minor redundancies.  
  
And amid my hammock, during the midnight, I woke up naked  
and full of pride.  
Shall we set forth?  
  
It was the day of the cat.  
For aroma was nauesous and morally negative.  
Opaque sand-colored lightnings of croak,  
sand-colored seams above a clotting snow.  
Marine clefts of stain,  
silvery seams above a browbeaten telegraph.
