Tell Them That I Am Giving Up Living In Points Of View

Deep brown uranus of lard,  
sunburst orange seams above a morbid candle.  
The cordial god  
dedicates in the celestial morning.  
I could enrich whisper, granule, and croak  
from smooth broken glasses and hats  
with a rust colored banner  
with traps in my fingernails. But I should be untrue to engineering, foreboding among  
its parched alcoves  
so let us seek to speak a story devoid of technical redundancies.  
It  
excites like a grace next to the fountain.
