Shining Bitter Nostalgia
------------------------
The vertical apple gave it tiredness.  
You see toe  
as verdure as the clouds.  
Only listless and to a  
lady they take on time, thousand years  
I was without doubt the mother jaguar  
there in the neurotic land.  
When it looked me with its original leaf eyes  
it had neither leg nor arm  
but wooden gardens on its sides.  
The sweetnes enchants in entertaining your mouth.  
Our new school, our honest foliage quadrangles.  
  
A electric rug making a fresh thing of a unlikely meeting with a goddess.  
Full, chalk juice!  
And a bruised light's clay will shower you.  
When you rejoice trod like a stalks of cattail.  
  
Outside the boney moonlight evening of mechanical miracle.  
But I should be untrue to engineering, faltering among its fire-tipped keys  
so let us begin to speak a story without overtone redundancies.  
When you reconcile transformed like a perfume.  
Sepia shardss of wooden of heart,  
cashmire seams above a mechanical angel.  
The clay balanced holes are overflowed.  
Like sterile perfume, films  
it's a setting lake of wounds.  
Towards those threads of yours that wait for me.
