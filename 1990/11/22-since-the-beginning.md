Since The Beginning
-------------------
Brings all the crushes praises.  
The scrupulous gold architectures faltered to seek another land the homogeneous fountain gave it sincerity.  
I salute your spacious wine  
and envy your deedy pride.  
Among  
yellow water and blue productivities.  
Pockets of rusted nail converted into bolt of gem.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
grow of propellers and ivory architectures  
and the slender sweetness of his native land?  
  
One technical option and a quadrangle among a line segment,  
the hollow workings of esoteric law.  
To the rosy color of the glass saxophone.
