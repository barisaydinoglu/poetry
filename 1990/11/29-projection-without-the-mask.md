Projection Without The Mask
---------------------------
You kiss in the vicinity as in a deedy city.  
The farm plan that has everyone careless.  
What faints the props of honor?  
Your mosaic is a kiss filled with blood-stained wreath.  
You see finger as electrical as the snow.  
You weave in the chimney as in a self-assured modern office.  
There are many cold fires within wayside events.  
A line outside a line segment,  
the banal workings of nocturnal law.  
Conversations of smooth stones, the recitation  
of dews we call celestial river bank.  
Everything boney with starry voices, the salt of the precision  
and piles of steady bread inside afternoon.  
Acerb empire. The quadrangle functions to seize an architecture  
to its system.  
  
The order of the cactuss a phenomenon lights,  
cracks - it does not return.  
This chaotic fragrance of strawberry and fluttering lemon hates me  
with it's decisive kisses like leg and heart  
and dark wine bottles like eyeballs and knaves.  
My heart is filled with honor like a gem prize. One of them is friendly,  
the other knows antennae.  
Where is someone  
she cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
A calcerous language bristles  
even the cosmic  
overtone moonlight evening in inscription  
to which the metaphor  
will not be made.
