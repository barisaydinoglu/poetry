The Morbid Gate
---------------
A careful linoleum making a friendly thing of a unlikely meeting with a man. In my room at holiday you are like a sea's skin  
and your form and colour the way I mingle them.  
What bristles the props  
of pride?  
  
Always you tremble through the holiday  
toward the afternoon fainting smooth broken glasses.  
As if to bury or pulse or coagulate.
