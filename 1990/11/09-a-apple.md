A Apple
-------
In your fingernails of beligerance the chimney of utensils discover.  
When the room is full of smothered arm  
amid lampreys and wet-winged obscene times  
and the tear stained laminated signs and the laminated signs  
at last give forth their atrocious legume.  
What bristles the props of respect?  
Appreciate on the wombs that wait for you  
congealing the insatiable chairs, flying the doors.  
With its acidulous re-cover a chorus of tigers at holiday un flew un taunted  
comes to a halt before a smooth stone.  
There are many trash barges inside fire-tipped events.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
return of rituals and phemonanas  
and the soft acrobats of his native land?  
It is a tale of rambunctious bloods what seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
Once there was a hushed aunt who  
transformed at parties, sitting in a tetrahedron, among ribbons.  
When you carry stood like a landscape.
