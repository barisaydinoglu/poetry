Tell Her That I Am Giving Up Setting In Cameras
-----------------------------------------------
Here I am, a celestial toe died in the field of star. The gentleman smiles at the giant  
but the fisherman does not smile  
when he looks at the tiger stranger  
and the sifted ocean.  
Of a blood colored son that  
recovers mists.  
  
The atrocious leaf is indespensable on your arm.
