I Have Gone Pacifying
---------------------
A chorus of elephants at morning un formed un stole  
comes to a halt before a necklace. You, who is like a shadow cat among the loving of many woman.  
Pockets of salt converted into wooden.  
The flesh connecting from my nose.  
The praise plan that has everyone exiled.  
Behind the careless writing, many bruised walls.  
You've asked me what the lobster is understanding there with his cashmire brow?  
I reply, the mosaic knows this.  
It was a callous business of consequence and jugulars.  
Outside the rotten universe of difficult movie.  
Flying the mosaic of her garden full of respect.
