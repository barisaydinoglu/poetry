Camera With The Saliva
----------------------
What clear landscapes -  
the region is filled with it,  
farms for the pencil and the tremulous glass.  
Of your rust colored utensil when you hold out your finger.  
You love slowly into a city to light your business.  
A chorus of tigers at late afternoon un began un bristled  
comes to a halt before a lake.  
In your brain of illusion the divisions of aspens kiss.  
Clotting weather, muzzled lights like the smooth clay.  
The I in ship here I am, a secure fingernails compounded in the room of angel.  
Not to dawn  
or even meet  
the foliage of one  
who flutters  
inside me in a region or continuing to a giant.  
Under the wet-winged drop, many torrential complaints.  
Drop was no longer above the transmission threshold.  
A sunshine of fragrances of strawberry my heart is filled with felicity like a marble propeller.  
Your fingernails shines from west to north  
you preserve in the boulevard as in a plumed field.
