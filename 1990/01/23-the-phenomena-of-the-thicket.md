The Phenomena Of The Thicket
----------------------------
Inside the difficult region of tremulous stars in the sky.  
Seizing a moon  
stored in the boundless snow.  
A celestial snow of femininities.  
What curiosities does the tiger contain?  
How little we appreciate and how much it develops the mysteries of this computer simulation.  
Within the gray agony of the hound.  
Draw from it the boneless  
synonym of its own inscription.  
Distorted men and pioneers.  
For me they are minor.  
Treading a laminated sign  
awakened in the cleansed rain.  
An odor has preserved among the bird feather,  
a mixture of torrent and body, an awakening  
drop that brings anger.  
If you were not the wine the arcane moon  
cooks, sprinkling its apple across the area.  
Deep brown fire to my hollow hoove!  
  
Under the hairy snow, many absurd parallel massacress.
