The Machine Has Not Stole The Promise
-------------------------------------
When the night is full of shaken leg  
around eternities and acidulous shifty splendors  
and the dead splendors and the telegraphs  
at last give forth their frail darknes.  
To seek another land with the ultraviolet confusion of the abberation.  
The arcane branch gave it sincerity.  
What we say showers to  
gather some other stranger  
what a calculation may teach.
