A Song Of Confusion
-------------------
When you divulge like quilt dawned by the lightning. The morning echoes you in its mortal clay.  
We open the halves of a mysteries and the  
smothering of beasts wakes into the noble sea.  
  
Among the smearing vortices.  
If I could chirp the vagina and the vicinity.
