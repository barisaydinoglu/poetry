Here I Dawn You
---------------
The lake plan that has everyone ghostly. I am abducted by heart and havoc, by dominion and mist.  
The natures exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
among it in darkness.  
I do not hate in the heights of skeleton twisting lonely road.  
It's a fashioning prize of conspirators.  
There are no howls but putrid cycles of rose and burnt umber  
umbrellas of handsome boney salt.  
Shall we proceed?  
You are the banana of my brutal breath.  
Like vigils coddling amid utensils.
