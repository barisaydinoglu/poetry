Hearing Is An Episode Of Stalactite
-----------------------------------
A bicycle is not enough to scratch me and keep me  
from the city of your equinoctial funny things.  
Return to the homeland of the echoes.  
I took on hollow banners.  
Where laws meet  
faucets meet, inside and outside and the sound  
of croaks, to reach out and respond in agony.  
Of charitable apple, spirit  
of the flints,  
undulated father blood, your kisses  
chirp into exile  
and a droplet of paper-mache, with remnants of the city.  
When the land is full of dry eyeballs  
in imbroglios  
and calcerous demonic love  
and the parched fellowships and the flints  
at last give forth their disintered depth.  
Outside the bleak heights of rambunctious shades of crimson.  
You enrich slowly into a night to circumscribe your business.  
Fly me and let my substance circumscribe.  
Which is a lovely breakfast of directions  
too many to count or twenty-seven, made  
on a vein or in the irreducable phemonana  
directions of the finger, a calculation in your hipss.  
I could relinquish ghost, conglomerate, and abys  
from hats and sweetness  
with a brimstone mirror  
with abyss in my ears.  
Of your dark kis when you hold out your shoulder.  
They loitered it with dead stalkss of cattail.  
But the saxophone sought the memory.  
Rejoicing toward the root I salute your vertical bread  
and envy your infinite pride.  
To crystallize lost peaces and for poppies.
