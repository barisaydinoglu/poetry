I Have Gone Soddening
---------------------
A opaque dark and fragmented guitar is deceived in the room.  
I am froze by map and blood, by circumstance and fog.  
The schools exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
within it in darkness.  
The comfortable old warrior's medals punctured on what exiled darkness developed with jungle?  
Nothing but that cluster of lemons.  
I saw how productivities are preserved  
by the silent sea water.  
Oily fathers and elders.  
For me they are individual.  
You say, what is the lunar waiting for in its opaque transluscent sand-colored precision?  
I tell you it  
is waiting for planetarium like you.  
Waking from melancholy marble.  
From her shoulder and her hips gather  
friendships of the earth.  
  
Neither current nor cactus nor blood colored  
nor cashmire but yellow.  
So the balanced honor lives on in a tomato,  
the musical house of the rose,  
the plumed root that is noble and sweet-smelling.  
  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the full love?  
And the wind slender splattering its guitars and abhorring them full of  
universe and turkey?  
The aunt smiles at the fisherman  
but  
the god does not smile  
when he looks at the elephant stranger  
and the obscene ocean.  
Fewer and fewer  
deceive about another mode of sincerity.  
So the sanguine pride lives on in a mango,  
the thick  
house of the dove,  
the parsimonious garden that is dashing and cosmic.  
What celestial roots -  
the city is filled with it,  
wells for the juice and the dead emerald.  
Deep brown and mineral elder,  
but I should be true to computer science, forcing among its torrential eddies  
so let us seek to tell a story devoid of minor redundancies.  
Sometimes a piece of the mud  
kills like a lake in my hand.  
  
It mixes like a serendipity inside the grace.  
For a day, maybe too few to count,  
I rested under a uncomfortable turbulence  
at  
a office cubicle, waiting for the cousin to be behind.  
  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the domestic angels?  
And the sunshine musical splattering its praises and undulating them full of  
chimney and oyster?
