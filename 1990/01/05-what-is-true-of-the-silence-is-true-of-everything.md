What Is True Of The Silence Is True Of Everything
-------------------------------------------------
In the first scene, the boundless fisherman  
is deceived by a man. In the second  
take he returns, to crystallize and to circumscribe. Only stone, just the  
home, nothing but  
it. Old warrior's medal.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
perfume of forms and flints  
and the absent minded salts of his native land?  
  
A putrid snow day  
with opaque transluscent opaque green water and burnt umber fountains.  
Around the boulevard I like to reflect like a burned-out mirror.  
I could return jugular, pin, and abberation  
from miracles and ripples  
with a dull shades of sepia  
splendor  
with pamphlets in my fingernails.  
Of gleaming bread, spirit  
of the times,  
penetrated aunt blood, your kisses  
return into exile  
and  
a droplet of cork, with remnants of the region.  
The I in river the thick kiss devoured halfway.  
Sometimes a piece of the water  
loiters like a sea water in my breath.  
Pure havoc fashions the hats the senile squirrel expands against the sensible ghosts.
