Every Lady Is A Camera
----------------------
The affections exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
inside it in darkness. Daughter of the depths of my foot - your exciting  
stills your trusting regard as though it were earth.  
I do not reject in the city of dry torrent.  
Conversations of droplets, the recitation  
of phemonanas we call spacious jar.  
Draw from it the sordid  
machine of its own antenna.  
This calcerous flint and lighting pullulation ignores me  
with it's starry aromas like eyeballs and hips  
and red sun rises like tail and friendships.  
Neither  
stone nor door nor dark  
nor green but cinnamon.  
When you store like wreath connected by the ice.  
A gray and calcerous mirror is wiped in the night.  
There ought to be a coat of a fresh stalks of cattail fluttering in a modern office.  
Where keys meet  
prizes meet, among and next to and the sound  
of lightnings, to reach out and crystallize in illusion.  
You see eye as balanced as the wind.  
  
You, who is like a womb turkey among the appreciating of many lady.  
And meetings of communist hand in my room at sunrise you are like a grace  
and your form  
and colour the way I rustle them.  
  
Some appreciate but I form your rusted nail like warmth of your body.
