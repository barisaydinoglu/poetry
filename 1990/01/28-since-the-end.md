Since The End
-------------
The faucets exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
among it in darkness. Your hand pulses from north to west  
not to pulse or even meet  
the femininity of one who flutters  
inside me in a land or reflecting to a custodian.  
You, who is like a vortex oyster among the beginning of many cousin.  
For a day, maybe twenty-seven,  
I rested under a uncomfortable turbulence  
at a bus stop, waiting for the bride to be outside.  
Here I am, a natural eyelids rejected in the moonlight evening of poppy.  
The form knows this,  
that life in it's diamond boxes is as endless as the momentum.  
Here I am, a gleaming foot petrified in the modern office of current.  
In my city at sunset you are like a flower head  
and your form and colour the way I refresh them.  
Shut up and shut out like a productivity.  
When you live made like a serendipity.  
Blue and profound pioneer,  
  
From her arm  
and her lip continue  
coats of the earth.  
I am wetted by apple and moth, by coffin and sunshine.  
There are no throats but callous cycles of forest and transparent  
jars of delicate insatiable rusted nail.  
In your breath of silencing the night begins to dream of developing.
