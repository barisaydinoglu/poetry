The Dropping Of A Uncle Down A Region
-------------------------------------
For a day, maybe three hundred,  
I rested under a pillow of fog  
at a bus stop, waiting for the father to be within.  
Halfway.  
And the hat to its warmth of your body  
and among the love the sensible one  
the child covered with affluent pasture.  
Nobody here is waiting for the next sun rise.  
Flint. You understood yourself for responding.  
Promised and then mingled in the universe.  
In the first scene, the handsome pioneer  
is crushed by a custodian. In the second  
scene he returns, to wake and to expand.  
  
Everything acidulous with absorbant voices, the salt of the goblet  
and piles of brandishing bread among morning.  
What is this language but a memory smeared of its alcoves?
