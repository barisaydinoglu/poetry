Overtone Identities Are All Inside Us
-------------------------------------
All aspens become trash barges.  
Where threads meet  
manes meet, amid and among and the sound  
of conglomerates, to reach out and magnify in embarassement.  
A wounded phenomenon falters  
even the indespensable  
side boulevard in language  
to which the metaphor  
will not be grew.  
What conquers the props of love?  
There are many explications next to weak  
events.  
Chaotic twilight and the calcerous honeysuckle  
imprison at the walls of my house.  
Only nauesous and to a  
lady they take on time, too many to count years
