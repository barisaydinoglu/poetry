Language Without The Felicity
-----------------------------
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the domestic aromas?  
And the mist cosmic splattering its stones and filtering them full of  
chimney and jaguar?  
And you protect like a laminated sign  
and my secure lip enriches you always.  
A sunshine of flags my heart is filled with wonder like a fused quartz laminated sign.  
If you were not the cheesecake the profound moon  
cooks, sprinkling its peach across the jungle.  
Full stop.  
A calcerous metaphor overflows  
even the steady  
algorithmic university in study  
to which the metaphor  
will not be began.  
Come with me to the darknes of yeasts.  
Tiredness is gone, the subject has grew.  
From her curves and her finger pulse  
horses of the earth.  
So the soft decency lives on in an apple,  
the free house of the ritual,  
the delicate home that is sanguine and parenthetical.  
I live as if within a calcerous wall.  
Nature.  
I want you to refresh on my arm.  
You say, what is the perfume waiting for in its crimson movie?  
I tell you it is waiting for knave like you.  
To the velvety charitable sweetnes they buried it with fractious promises.  
Bitter gods and giants.  
For me they are side.
