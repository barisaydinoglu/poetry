Since The End
-------------
Shall we proceed?  
And meetings of hushed tail the inevitable turkey mixes under the homogeneous flasks.  
Imbroglios of a difficult bicycle  
blushing outside the archipeligos in an acidulous boat,  
incredulous as a lewd ostrich.  
I wish to make a circle  
within, and every color, many  
times hidden in a ship.
