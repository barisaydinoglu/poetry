Since The End Of Smothering
---------------------------
Neither curtain nor faucet nor black  
nor sand-colored but crimson.  
What we say blossoms to  
pacify some other bride  
what a study may teach.  
Multitude of flints!  
In and out of the opaque opaque crimson the sand-colored and the sand-colored  
so the iridescent decency lives on in a grape,  
the incredulous house of the magnolium,  
the monastic guitar that is spacious and verdure.  
Once there was a frightened aunt who  
flowed at parties, sitting in a triangle, among springtimes.  
For a day, maybe twenty-seven,  
I rested under a pillow of fog  
at a bus stop, waiting for the giant to be around.  
  
The river banks exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
Amid it in darkness.  
To seek another land lethargic consequences and decadent lineages.  
Banner.  
Sometimes a piece of the sky  
shatters like a love in my eyelids.  
As soon as the incoming  
faucets  
gives the individual indication.  
And a ironous phemonana's ice will protect you.  
  
To the human great kiss my heart moves from being violenet to being vertical.  
Multitude of corals!  
In and out of the crimson the deep brown and the cinnamon
