She Has A Dead Complex
----------------------
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
Around the night I like to set like a guilt opaque crimson lake.  
The nocturnal pioneer  
transforms in the brandishing morning.  
The verdure mane gave it sincerity.  
  
Which is  
a silent bell of directions  
too few to count or three hundred, reconciled  
on a love or in the enduring mosaic  
directions of the brain, a calculation in your curvess.
