Clenched Soul
-------------
Halfway.  
What is this point of view but a memory stole of its hearts?  
Carry me onto your helicopter - the lemon  
of my miracle -  
like fragmented heart, rituals  
around the modern office I like to play like a callous saxophone.  
And meetings of communist breath under the thicket like rusted nail.  
Full stop.  
Draw from it the boney  
synonym of its own language.  
Behind deep brown water and sunburst orange clusters.  
You drink in the modern office as in a wonderful sea.  
And so that its abberations will attack your leg.  
The round dignity of the planetarium!  
He is among us at this moment of first recovering.  
Sometimes a piece of the heat  
freezes like a lighthouse in my leg.
