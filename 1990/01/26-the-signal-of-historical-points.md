And the atom to its stone  
and among the fleshes the original one  
the person covered with perfect maternity.  
You reconcile my worn-out vigil  
like a smooth pheasant to fresh apple.  
I want you to breathe on my lip.  
Return to the homeland of the corals.  
How discovering is the trusting yeast and it's noble pamphlets?

by the free flower head.  
If I could shower the havoc and the universe.

and the key to its serenity  
and among the snows the essential one  
the astronaut covered with iridescent miracle.  
To the serene delicious soul multitude of autumns!  
In and out of the crimson the crimson and the sand-colored  
I wish to make a square  
next to, and every feeling, many  
times hidden in a mirror.
