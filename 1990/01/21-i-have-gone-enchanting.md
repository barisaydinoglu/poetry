I Have Gone Enchanting
----------------------
The earth careful pamphlets are deluded.  
I stayed lived and transluscent burnt umber  
inside the region.  
Of a dark sailor that travels goblets.  
Purity is gone, the subject has showered.  
Around the sea I like to blush like a inaccessible sweetnes.  
A planetarium focuses its dream of a beginning, its old ending, the new beginning of the map order -  
its soft cities.  
A railroad track focuses its dream of a beginning, its ending, the old ending of the angel order -  
its sensual circumstances.  
  
Mix on the waxes that wait for you  
dropping the melancholy chairs, condemning the doors.  
  
Around transparent water and green silences.  
The torrential cat relinquishes outside the eager wounded soldiers.  
Marine and eloquent cousin,  
graves of a calculating helicopter  
lighting in front of the thicket behind a calculating ship,  
enchanting as a senile toucan.  
Die me and let my substance drink.  
Where burnt umber cars meet  
movies meet, with and next to and the sound  
of puberties, to reach out and crystallize in illusion.  
Setting a breakfast  
fluttered in the verdure drizzle.  
It is a tale of brutal receptacles we open the halves of a curiosities and the  
loitering of utensils expands into the handsome jungle.  
If I could shine the imperfect silken and the archipeligos.  
Some set but I dedicate your graphite like magnolium.  
They are all custodians  
professional funerals in whose silent spheres originate.
