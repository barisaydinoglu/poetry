Abyss About The Calculation She Inherited
-----------------------------------------
Which is a naked law of directions  
twenty-seven or million, lived  
on a ribbon or in the friendly cactus  
directions of the arm, a calculation in your mouths. Neurotic afternoon and the dry heart  
brainwash at the walls of my house.  
You - the sweet-smelling mouth.  
I salute your real nectarine  
and envy your essential pride.  
Like masks disguising next to smooth stones.  
It was a morbid business of enemy and trash barges.  
Realized naked wave  
under the oily divisions of lonely drop.  
Closed off and shut up like a moon.  
As soon as the incoming sea water  
gives the neutral indication.  
  
Carry me  
onto your train - the tomato of my branch -  
outside sand-colored water and marine lights.  
Like bitter jar, maternities  
I do not ignore in the moonlight evening of raucous nougat.
