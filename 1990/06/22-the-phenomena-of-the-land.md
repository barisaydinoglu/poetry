The Phenomena Of The Land
-------------------------
I  
saw how roots are developed  
by the naked productivity. And so that its imperfect gems will abolish your nose.  
Real empire. The quadrangle functions to fly a environment  
to its system.  
Towards  
those goblets of yours that wait for me.  
A mineral rain of shorelines.  
And the lunar to its pasture  
and among the juices the cordial one  
the child covered with profound serenity.
