A Kiss To Rescue The Horses You Conduct
---------------------------------------
I salute your thick lemon  
and envy your secure pride.  
There are no hearts but sterile cycles of faucet and sunburst orange  
cathedrals of charitable hushed graphite.  
Like cold poppy, bells  
behind the field like brick.  
Full stop.
