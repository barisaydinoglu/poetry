How To Drop Aunt Arms
---------------------
What we say travels to  
continue some other mountaineer  
what a production may teach.  
I wish to make a tetrahedron  
next to, and every abstraction, many  
times hidden in a curtain.  
Come with me to the belt of trapdoors.  
A study for signal is the lack thereof.  
  
A chorus of iguanas at sunrise un expanded un twisted  
comes to a halt before a femininity.  
Like the skeleton broken glass of circuss the perfume abducts, the productivity of aquatic  
hears outside.
