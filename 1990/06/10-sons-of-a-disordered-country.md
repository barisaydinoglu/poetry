Sons Of A Disordered Country
----------------------------
I do not deprive in the area of worn-out beast.  
Halfway.  
Always you conquer through the day  
Toward the twilight electrifying stones.  
I'd do it for the serenity in which you mingle  
for the lighthouses of opaque sepia you've showered.
