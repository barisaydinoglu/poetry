A Song Of Decency
-----------------
You see fingernails as great as the sun.  
And meetings of clotting brain sordid fishermen and gods.  
For me they are technical.  
The putrid bottle that pacifies in your trouser.  
They soddened it with raucous ships.  
  
Wounded mountaineers and giants.  
For me they are public.  
From uncomfortable turbulence to ocean wave,  
hidden clusters drawn by sensible channels, a  
oily droplet begins to shine.
