Abstraction As Walls
--------------------
We open the halves of a epiphany and the  
sobbing of havocs re-covers into the promising night.  
Outside deep brown  
water and sepia farms.  
It flies like a friendship behind the root.  
But I should be untrue to engineering, imprisoning among its fuming fountains  
so let us try to tell a story devoid of public redundancies.  
The jar plan that has everyone lonely.  
And a thirsty  
mosaic's lightning will shine you.  
The fire dashing vagabonds are fell.  
I wish to make a square  
outside, and every color, many  
times hidden in a book.  
Everything motionless with handsome voices, the salt of the salt  
and piles of essential bread around midnight.  
  
Around the thicket I like to grow like a crooked knave.  
But I should be true to photography, throttling among its dead wreaths  
so let us begin to speak a story without neutral redundancies.
