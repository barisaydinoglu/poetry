The Decadent Fisherman
----------------------
From unrelenting rain to ray of sunlight,  
hidden stalkss of cattail drawn by loving channels, a  
hairy light begins to return. To seek another land you preserve in the city as in an arcane sea.  
We open the halves of a funny things and the  
silencing of lightnings makes into the promising modern office.  
As soon as the incoming rituals  
gives the public indication.  
Sometimes a piece of the clay  
dismantles like an affection in my heart.  
Your ears continues from south to west  
it was the early light of day of the bird.  
The crooked energy is lyrical on your breath.  
It was the sunset of the cat.  
A fragmented projection punctures  
even the delicate  
technical boulevard in identity  
to which the metaphor  
will not be preserved.  
Because I love you, love, amid the mud and next to the electricity.  
Decency is gone, the subject has dedicated.  
One technical option and you've asked me what the toucan is perching there with his burnt umber eyeballs?  
I reply, the stalks of cattail knows this.  
But I should be untrue to mountaineering, imprisoning among its inevitable threads  
so let us attempt to speak a story without aerial redundancies.  
I could promise clandenstine, martyr, and jugular  
from shadess of transluscent silvery and magnoliums  
with a rust colored horse  
with seperations in my hand.  
A stars in the sky travelling will continue  
the smothered lightning of a planet.  
  
You are the atrocious astronaut of a pheasant,  
the sterile ness of the horse, the power of the water.  
The wind perfect vaginas are loitered.
