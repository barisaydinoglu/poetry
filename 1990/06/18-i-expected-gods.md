I Expected Gods
---------------
Conversations of coats, the recitation  
of kiss we call fluidic coral.  
A leg and a hips  
creating the heights.  
As if to erupt or wet or abduct.  
The dust continues on its rusted mare  
reconciling opaque yellow honeysuckles over the field.  
Weak ones and ones.  
For me they are technical.  
Outside the sea like iron.  
I love as if in a parched corpse.
