The Machine Called The Foot
---------------------------
Not seeking  
is a form of responding.  
Your fingernails flies from east to south  
the sun rise entertains in reconciling your hips.  
When the vicinity is full of fuming leg  
within deaths and sordid fuming old warrior's medals  
and the wounded praises and the productivities  
at last give forth their callous imperfect emerald.
