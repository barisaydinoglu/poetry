A Atom To Stand The Trysts You Fashion
--------------------------------------
When the night is full of browbeaten curves  
in front of vaginas and fractious careless utensils  
and the boneless fountains and the ripples  
at last give forth their communist yeast.  
Around the congealing dominions.  
And you mingle like a burnt umber lake and I am devoured by awe and lineage, by rotten stump and sunshine.  
In my land at late afternoon you are like a tiger  
and your form and colour the way I carry them.  
A fingernails and a brain  
storing the thicket.  
Of perfect bread, spirit  
of the paths,  
conquered man blood, your kisses  
kiss into exile  
and a droplet of glass, with remnants of the university.  
Halfway.  
Flying a bed  
drank in the lyrical snow.  
  
Nothing but that angel of aromas.  
A brimstone and ironous grape is throttled in the sea.  
The thick telegraph gave it wonder.  
From pillow of fog to harrowing wind,  
hidden roses drawn by warm channels, a  
dilute starlight begins to circumscribe.  
The knaves exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
within it in darkness.  
In front of sepia water and blue maternities.  
  
The human dignity of the shoreline!
