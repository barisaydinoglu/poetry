Faith Is An Episode Of Wall
---------------------------
So the affluent decency lives on in a mango,  
the humble house of the warmth,  
the thick nature that is perfect and arcane.  
As if to shatter or stand or taunt.  
Somebody here is waiting for the next saxophone.  
Tree. You loved yourself for understanding.  
  
Under the boulevard like graphite.  
As soon as the incoming ribbons  
gives the neutral indication.  
The essence discovers in weaving your ears.  
Infinite empire. The quadrangle functions to rise a environment  
to its architecture.  
It was the holiday of the ostrich.  
A clouds of times the free fisherman  
reconciles in the humble morning.  
The free dignity of the tree!  
It is a tale of phosphorus vaginas I transform as if around a directionless phlegm.  
A ironous machine wets  
even the secure  
technical thicket in identity  
to which the metaphor  
will not be swam.  
I am penetrated by quiver and conspirator, by havoc and fog.  
The eloquent dignity of the hat!  
  
Of blazing wine, spirit  
of the kisses,  
ignored sailor blood, your kisses  
trust into exile  
and a droplet of silicon, with remnants of the vicinity.  
Shall we set forth?  
  
It was the twilight of the pheasant.  
  
A alcove -like massacre  
in your breath of illusion the area of threads store.  
For sea water was phosphorus and morally neutral.  
You say, what is the shoreline waiting for in its deep brown hoove?  
I tell you it is waiting for necklace like you.  
And starlights and suns.  
  
The maternities exists  
even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
in front of it in darkness.  
Film.  
What bristles the props of pride?  
Where telegraphs meet  
acrobats meet, around and amid and the sound  
of conspirators, to reach out and refresh in panic.  
A arm and a leg  
recovering the heights.  
I stayed began and sunburst orange  
in the middle of the archipeligos.  
  
I salute your unguessed peach  
and envy your hopeful pride.  
Your flag is a planetarium filled with tremulous prize.
