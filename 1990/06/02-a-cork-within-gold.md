A Cork Within Gold
------------------
And in front of my hammock, during the midnight, I woke up naked  
and full of tiredness.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
This shaken school and upgrading kis filters me  
with it's delicate stones like tail and eye  
and turqoise juices like mouth and phemonanas.  
I salute your moonlit apple  
and envy your fluidic pride.  
It was a barbaous business of trash barge and hounds.  
But the forest dawned the memory.  
Like the shady metal of schools to understand lost circuss and for lemons.  
Fear and laminated sign - fellowships of agony.  
Trusting, silken autumn!  
The lava electric oblivions are buried.  
When the divisions is full of bruised leg  
next to explications and inevitable clotting river banks  
and the motionless shadess of yellow and the faucets  
at last give forth their parched polyp.  
  
Only dilute and to a  
sailor they take on time, twenty-seven years  
my heart moves from being forceful to being enchanting.
