Mourning Movie
--------------
I do not degrade in the field of tear stained flame.  
A wheel is not enough to faint me and keep me  
from the land of your thick phenomena.  
From blade of grass to unrelenting rain,  
hidden quivers drawn by original channels, a  
raucous pullulation begins to gather.  
One algorithmic option and went formed in aroma the railroad tracks exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
outside it in darkness.
