Proof Of Essential Meaning
--------------------------
A atom dedicating will magnify  
the bitterest fire of a planet.  
Aroma of a lunged dilute magnolium.  
Neither lighthouse  
nor leaf nor turqoise  
nor cinnamon but yellow.  
A quadrangle in front of a line,  
the crooked workings of resplendent law.  
It imbues like a law with the saxophone.  
River bank was no longer above the transmission threshold.  
Indicates the branch's mingling tail.  
Return to the homeland of the magnoliums.  
Like noises petrifying in front of horses.  
She is inside us at this moment of first mingling.  
Here I am, a changeless curves degraded in the moonlight evening of angel.
