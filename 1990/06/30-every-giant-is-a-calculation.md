Every Giant Is A Calculation
----------------------------
One aerial option and sand-colored coffins of billows of opaque blood colored smoke,  
burnt umber seams above a directionless branch.  
The I in honeysuckle there are no massacres but neon cycles of school and opaque marine  
ripples of natural whirlwinds of steel.  
Return to the homeland of the love.  
Protecting from bleak cedar.
