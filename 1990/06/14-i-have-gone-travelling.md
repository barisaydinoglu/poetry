I Have Gone Travelling
----------------------
A current of infinite well  
that does not know why it flows and lights.  
Appreciating from bruised emerald.  
Our new awe, our indespensable aspen triangles.  
The full dignity of the hoove!  
Illusion and smooth aluminum - wine bottles of fear.  
They are all sons  
professional clocks in whose real bird feathers originate.  
The brutal writing is resplendent on your shoulder.
