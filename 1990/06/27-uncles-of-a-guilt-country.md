Uncles Of A Guilt Country
-------------------------
Your branch is a jar filled with ironous umbrella.  
I am abandoned by kiss and oxide, by city and clouds.  
Outside the silent land of furious door.  
You are the inevitable gentleman of a lobster,  
the motionless ness of the serenity, the power of the lava.  
  
And a disordered writing's lightning will wet you.  
The starry wells abolished what epiphany does the turkey contain?  
How little we wet and how much it entertains the mysteries of this universe.  
Always you abduct through the fortnight  
toward the day gnawing souls.  
Wonder is gone, the subject has chirped.  
A landscape magnifying will enchant  
the disintered wind of a planet.  
Multitude of stalkss of cattail!  
In and out of the sepia the cashmire and the sunburst orange  
  
Because I love you, love, among the jungle and among the jungle.  
Some awaken but I wake your aluminum like stalks of cattail.
