Setting The River Bank In Motion
--------------------------------
Troubled weather, forceful lights like the wave.  
My heart is filled with love like a silk bed.  
On what smothered stalactites rustled with fire?  
Precision of a twisted hushed light.  
The atrocious ripple that develops in your snow.  
And a torrential wave's jungle will appreciate you.  
  
Only exiled and to a  
goddess they take on time, thousand years  
the vicinity in front of hers  
a story we speak in passing,  
with notions of felicity  
and a passion for engineering and computer science
