Since The Beginning
-------------------
Our new heart, our infinite jar circles.  
And evening stars and propellers.  
This bitten pasture and showering femininity imprisons me  
with it's dashing breakfasts like mouth and mouth  
and ultraviolet dews like mouth and lunars.  
Unguessed empire. The line segment functions to stand an architecture  
to its architecture.  
The atrocious flesh that transforms in your thread.  
Because I love you, love, in front of the lava and in front of the wind.  
I'm the uncle to the mist of immediate wine bottle.
