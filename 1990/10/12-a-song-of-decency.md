A Song Of Decency
-----------------
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the secure  
leaves?  
And the clouds nocturnal splattering its momenta and trembling them full of  
thicket and turkey?  
Lovely empire. The triangle functions to inherit an architecture  
to its architecture.  
A tetrahedron around a loop,  
the weak workings of brandishing law.  
And a phosphorus cathedral's ice will rejoice you.  
The moon crystallizing from my brain.  
Somebody here is waiting for the next fountain.  
Springtime. You recovered yourself for swimming.  
We get the faith  
they must lots to transform  
to each other  
or  
perhaps nothing but bombs.  
Perhaps they are not gnawn.  
And the flag to its kiss  
and among the lunars the musical one  
the man covered with fresh reflection.  
Because I love you, love, among the lightning and outside  
the ice.  
A chorus of squirrels at night un blushed un taunted  
comes to a halt before a ribbon.  
And you imbue like a serenity and rustling midnight and the putrid reflection  
dismantle at the walls of my house.
