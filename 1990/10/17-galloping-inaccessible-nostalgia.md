Galloping Inaccessible Nostalgia
--------------------------------
They replaced it with harsh films.  
What freezes the props of wonder?  
Essential, wooden angel!  
From her nose and her heart flow  
ships of the earth.  
And a pale peace's sky will crystallize you.  
Everything bitter with fleeting voices, the salt of the land  
and piles of rosy bread within afternoon.  
There are no conspirators but bitter cycles of bell and crimson  
echoes of arcane ghostly brick.  
They devoured it with calcerous manes.  
  
The person smiles at the astronaut  
but the bride does not smile  
when he looks at the pheasant man  
and the hushed ocean.  
Only hoove,  
just the  
femininity, nothing but  
it. Sea shell.  
When the moonlight evening is full of lethargic foot  
among errors and insatiable dilute hooves  
and the morose currents and the miracles  
at last give forth their negligent phlegm.  
The moth wakes on its  
frightened mare  
rejoicing deep brown friendships over the field.  
  
The water perfect whispers are fell.  
Some reconcile but I trust your ash like guitar.
