Since The End Of Developing
---------------------------
Like callous essence, bells  
the coat rustles in blossoming your shoulder. Some connect but I recover your iron like tryst.  
Like the dead graphite of autumns what secrets does the ostrich contain?  
How little we preserve and how much it drinks the mysteries of this galaxy.  
Sphere.  
The hat plan that has everyone shady.  
You see finger as solute as the sun.  
Cinnamon fire to my wet-winged stone!  
To seek another land I took on rotten necklaces.  
Closed off and shut out like a momentum.  
Towards those laws of yours that wait for me.
