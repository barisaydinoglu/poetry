A Song Of Illusion
------------------
I was without doubt the woman elephant  
there in the oily heights.  
When it looked me with its equinoctial necklace eyes  
it had neither eye nor toe  
but paper-mache flutes on its sides.  
When you light like river bank magnified by the water.  
It appreciates like a kiss  
in the soul.  
A plumed carpet making a lion hearted thing of a lucky meeting with a pioneer.  
Shall we keep going?  
Honor is gone, the subject has rescued.  
Nobody here is waiting for the next ritual.  
Bird feather. You carried yourself for re-covering.
