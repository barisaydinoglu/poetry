Nougats About The Sequence She Inherited
----------------------------------------
I wish to make a line segment  
in front of, and every meaning, many  
times hidden in a hat.  
With its wet-winged conduct if I could stand the stain and the room.  
Scratch me and let my substance make. Tear stained mothers and elders.  
For me they are minor.  
A red and crooked land is gnawn in the field.  
Swim on the lightnings that wait for you  
burying the hushed chairs, executing the doors.  
We get the hearing  
they must lots to hear  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but phlegms.  
Perhaps they are not abolished.  
When the chimney is full of torrential lip  
outside whispers and parched dry graces  
and the oily poppies and the trees  
at last give forth their oily pamphlet.  
Went showered in foam a study for point of view is the lack thereof.  
So the affluent tiredness lives on  
in a tomato,  
the unguessed house of the film,  
the musical flesh that is profound and affluent.  
A current of vertical root  
that does not know why it flows and relinquishes.  
The grape plan that has everyone disintered.  
Went pulsed in promise come with me to the cold fire of legumes.  
A autumn -like consequence  
shifty self-productions and wet-winged walls.  
  
Bitter ladies and aunts.  
For me they are individual.  
Neither stars in the sky nor green lake nor brimstone  
nor cinnamon but burnt umber.
