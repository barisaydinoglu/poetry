The Depriving Of A Gentleman Down A Thicket
-------------------------------------------
Wave of wave of foams rolling down the sea. You rejoice in the heights as in a iridescent region.  
I salute your aromatic grape  
and envy your infinite pride.  
Brings all the falls old warrior's medals.  
They are all cousins  
professional extinctions in whose irreducable alcoves originate.  
Carry me onto your boat - the kiwi of my flesh -  
I salute your absorbant nectarine  
and envy your full pride.  
Among the region like broken glass.  
  
A oily projection passes  
even the hidden  
grammatic sea in image  
to which the metaphor  
will not  
be crystallized.
