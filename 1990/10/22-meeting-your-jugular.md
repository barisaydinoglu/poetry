Meeting Your Jugular
--------------------
Conversations of goblets, the recitation  
of beds we call sweet-smelling saxophone.  
They scratched it with listless railroad tracks.  
So the full respect lives on in a cherry,  
the solute house of the love,  
the absorbant river that is infinite and nocturnal.  
Of your black goblet when you hold out your fingernails.  
  
When you play stood like a shades of sepia.
