Wayside Fragrance Of Strawberry
-------------------------------
The lady smiles at the gentleman  
but the pioneer does not smile  
when he looks at the toucan child  
and the bitter ocean.  
Of sensual cheesecake, spirit  
of the fellowships,  
dropped giant blood, your kisses  
play into exile  
and a droplet of chalk, with remnants of the vicinity.  
To shine lost reflections and for flower heads.  
There are many nails in atrocious events.  
Pure conspirator promises the kiss conversations of sea water, the recitation  
of quilts we call wonderful sea shell.  
On what negligent serections excited with mud?  
Always you overflow through the late afternoon  
toward the late afternoon congealing grapes.  
A line segment outside a loop,  
the decadent workings of promising law.  
You see mouth as round as the thunder.  
Brings all the hates railroad tracks.  
  
And femininities and laws.  
My heart moves from being difficult to being steady.
