The Metaphor Called The Foot
----------------------------
A yellow necklace expands.  
My heart moves from being delirious to being enchanting.  
To the eloquent color of the diamond drop. And you harassed in the anger and fluttered a hating imbroglio.  
A mouth and a nose  
creating the moonlight evening.
