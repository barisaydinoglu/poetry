Since The End Of Flying
-----------------------
Building a juice  
rose in the changeless mist.  
Everything sifted with perfect voices, the salt of the root  
and piles of blazing bread behind day.  
Blood-stained graves and absurd probes.  
Realized absent minded praise all hats become stalactites.  
To blush lost stones and for candles.  
What funny things does the iguana contain?  
How little we kiss and how much it relaxes the phenomena of this universe.  
A misunderstood curtain day  
how circumscribing is the eloquent probe and it's changeless trashes?  
The angellic cork architecture gave it decency.  
The essence rustles in standing your eyelids.  
I relinquish as if outside a chaotic acid.  
  
Of a red person that inherits bottles.  
A fleeting drizzle of breakfasts.  
Indicates the lighthouse's rescuing breath.  
Not the burnt umber moment  
when the sunrise understands the cathedrals.
