Swimming Decadent Nostalgia
---------------------------
Burnt umber felicities of wounded soldier,  
transparent seams above a guilt ivory architecture.  
Like abberations dying in front of lighthouses.  
You make slowly into a jungle to breathe your business.  
Built and then carried in the divisions.  
The horse plan that has everyone misunderstood.  
If I could enrich the acid and the region.  
  
Pockets of salt converted into crystal.  
I could recover granule, pigeon hole, and cleft  
from pencils and wreaths  
with a rust colored pasture  
with cities in my brow.
