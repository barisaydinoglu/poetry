I Have Gone Mixing
------------------
Next to the book of the night where you sleep,  
a dream electrifies into details.  
My heart moves from being exiled to being  
naked.  
A fluidic wood paneling making an aquatic thing of a unlikely meeting with a daughter.  
Not to live or even meet  
the fragrance of strawberry of one who crystallizes  
outside  
me in a boulevard or upgrading to a fisherman.  
The burned-out lobster inherits in the middle of the rosy egoes.  
For movie was wayside and morally neutral.  
They dismantled it with parched gardens.  
And the magnolium to its bridge  
and among the ripples the hopeful one  
the custodian covered with vertical key.  
A current of humble writing  
that does not know why it flows and carries.  
There ought to be a femininity of a mineral goblet galloping in a field.
