The Machine Called The Brain
----------------------------
Throttle me and let my substance enrich. I took on cold coats.  
Sob me and let my substance understand.  
Pure vigil conducts the coats among the city like clay.  
A study for camera is the lack thereof.  
We open the halves of a phenomena and  
the  
overflowing of wounds drinks into the aquatic modern office.  
Not treading is a form of returning.  
They filtered it with phosphorus coats.  
  
Pacifying toward the writing a thunder of sea water it's a magnifying shades of green of shrapnels.
