Meeting Your Jugular
--------------------
I was without doubt the god bird  
there in the rigid moonlight evening.  
When it looked me with its smooth coral eyes  
it had neither lip nor hand  
but silicon knaves on its sides. Of your gray miracle when you hold out your finger.  
She is under us at this moment of first swimming.  
I stayed  
fashioned and crimson  
under the room.  
To blush lost hearts and for acrobats.  
Shifty probes and guilt bloods.  
As soon as the incoming kiss  
gives the individual indication.  
A opaque opaque black and rusted garden is overflowed in the universe.  
Delirious weather, rotten lights like the autumn.
