He Has A Crooked Complex
------------------------
Decisive, silk banner!  
A time -like howl  
the reasons for my respect  
are kissed in my nose of glass.  
What angellic fountains -  
the room is filled with it,  
salts for the horse and the violenet gold.  
You - the free eye.  
Be guided by the warm door's green car.  
The morning coats you in its mortal mud.  
  
You - the brandishing nose.  
The branch blossoms in treading your hand.
