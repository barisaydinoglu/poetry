The Directionless Pioneer Of The Jungle
---------------------------------------
From uncomfortable turbulence to ray of sunlight,  
hidden farms drawn by free channels, a  
whirlwinds of smooth salt begins to dedicate.  
There are many howls next to windy events.  
Shall we go forward?  
There are many throats with clenched events.  
I took on insufferable coats.  
Shut out and closed off like a knave.  
You say, what is the flesh waiting for in its opaque yellow sea shell?  
I tell you it is waiting for nature like you.
