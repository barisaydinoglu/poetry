The Smothered Pamphlet
----------------------
In the face of so many roosters to functionality.  
Taunt me and let my substance carry.  
Like cadavers prosecuting in kiss.  
Within the guitar of the thicket where you sleep,  
a dream loiters into machines.  
Sunburst orange legless horses of moldy banana,  
blue seams above a wayside fellowship.  
I'd do it for the mirror in which you circumscribe  
for the wine bottles of green you've pulsed.  
And within my hammock, during the early light of day, I woke up naked  
and full of joy.  
I took on guilt spheres.  
Around the sea I like to refresh like a mechanical reflection.  
She is in the middle of us at this moment of first wetting.
