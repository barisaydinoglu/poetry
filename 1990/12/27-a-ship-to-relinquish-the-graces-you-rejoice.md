A Ship To Relinquish The Graces You Rejoice
-------------------------------------------
Not expanding is a form of re-covering.  
Sometimes a piece of the wind  
coagulates like a hoove  
in my eyeballs.  
We get the sight  
they must lots to pulse  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but flames.  
Perhaps they are not crushed.  
The electric daughter  
excites in the smooth morning.  
Friendly, cedar foliage!  
My mineral  
eye blossoms you always.  
Sometimes a piece of the clay  
buries like a productivity in my foot.  
But I should be untrue to photography, executing among its rusted poppies  
so let us try to speak a story devoid of grammatic redundancies.  
  
Around the sun of the room where you sleep,  
a dream forces into calculations.  
They are all strangers  
professional belts in whose secure droplets originate.  
My heart is filled with purity like a paper-mache saxophone.  
A square next to a triangle,  
the atrocious workings  
of celestial law.  
  
Mountaineer of the depths of my breath - your dedicating  
stills your dashing regard as though it were ice.  
The elder smiles at the pioneer  
but the one does not smile  
when he looks at the turkey fisherman  
and the misunderstood ocean.  
I want you to enrich on my leg.  
Fewer and fewer  
tremble about another mode of tiredness.
