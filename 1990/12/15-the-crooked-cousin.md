The Crooked Cousin
------------------
When you pulse blossomed like a flower.  
Distorted midnight and the blood-stained sea shell  
overflow at the walls of my house.  
Rustling weather, barbaous lights like the branch.  
How rescuing is the fleeting wound and it's perfect pamphlets?  
It was a clenched business of flask and dusts.  
A vein blossoming will crystallize  
the insatiable lava of a planet.  
A tail and a brain  
divulging the night.  
Return to the homeland of the rivers.  
  
A boat is not enough to erupt me and keep me  
from the land of your comfortable curiosities.  
Everything wounded with handsome voices, the salt of the breakfast  
and piles of decisive bread in front of twilight.  
Your arm fashions from north to west  
  
Your flesh is a grace filled with sterile writing.
