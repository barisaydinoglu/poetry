Song For The One Of Imperalist Sun Rises
----------------------------------------
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
Some expand but I love your sand like starry sky.  
Travelled and then wetted in the divisions.  
A tetrahedron with a tetrahedron,  
the rotten workings of celestial law.  
One historical option and you are the forceful cousin  
of a crab,  
the atrocious ness of the hoove, the power of the lightning.  
I do not smother in the chimney of cold oxide.  
In the smallest gold tiger and you rescue like a crown and melancholy sticks and mourning consequences.
