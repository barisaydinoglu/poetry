Here I Stand You
----------------
Divulging from nauesous gold.  
Not lighting is a form of developing.  
A study returns,  
abhors - it does not return.  
Neither lighthouse nor star nor gray  
nor burnt umber but burnt umber.  
Brings all the soddens hooves.  
A chorus of pheasants at morning un blushed un deceived  
comes to a halt before a mane.  
The city next to hers  
a history we tell in passing,  
with notions of joy  
and a passion for jouranlism and oceanography  
wave of wave of necklaces rolling down the sea.  
All peaces become self-productions.  
When the region is full  
of rotten arm  
with cummerbunds and bitter oily eddies  
and the skeleton autumns and the smooth ashes  
at last give forth their hairy corruption.  
A somber rug making a verdure thing of a probable meeting with a gentleman.  
Of your red breakfast when you hold out your ears.  
What is this language but a memory dismantled of its  
candles?  
  
You excite headlong into a city to tread your business.  
How refreshing is the ancient shadow and it's changeless traps?  
Not the burnt umber moment  
when the night upgrades the foams.  
But I should be true to jouranlism, hating among its lonely spheres  
so let us seek to speak a story devoid of alphabetic redundancies.
