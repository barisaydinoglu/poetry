The Confusion Of The Algorithmic Narrative
------------------------------------------
Enjoy the many rustling attempts to shine  
the hopeful heart.  
There is steady fortune in attracting it.  
And you dropped in the beligerance and recovered a throttling oxide.  
Listless weather, tenacious lights like the kis.  
I took on neon manes.  
Enjoy the many guilt attempts to preserve  
the human lineage.  
There is changeless fortune in dawning it.  
A rust colored and banal awe is protested in the land.  
For a day, maybe million,  
I rested under a tornado  
at a bus stop, waiting for the person to be outside.
