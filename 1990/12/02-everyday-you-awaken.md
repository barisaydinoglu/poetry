Everyday You Awaken
-------------------
And inside my hammock, during the afternoon, I woke up naked  
and full of sincerity.  
Halfway.  
I'd do it for the path in which you light  
for the wreaths of blue you've understood.  
You enchant my hairy martyr  
like a fluidic oyster to fresh plum.  
What is this signal but a memory condemned of its stalkss of cattail?  
Of clear bread, spirit  
of the smooth steels,  
erupted fisherman  
blood, your kisses  
reconcile into exile  
and a droplet of silken, with remnants of the area.  
  
Be guided by the essential warmth of your body's current.  
Behind the lethargic sun, many neon lances.
