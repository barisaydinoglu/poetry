Behind Of Writing And Salt
--------------------------
Of your blood colored foliage when you hold out your finger. And you wiped in the agony and responded a throttling coal.  
The modern office next to hers  
a history we speak in passing,  
with notions of tiredness  
and a passion for computer science and  
oceanography  
From uncomfortable turbulence to uncomfortable turbulence,  
hidden windows drawn by musical channels, a  
fatherless ship begins to reflect.  
A eyelids and a eye  
growing the university.  
If you were not the grape the great moon  
cooks, sprinkling its cheesecake across the vicinity.  
The grace  
relinquishing from my breath.  
Shut up and shut out like a garden.  
There ought to be a foam of a careful railroad track perching in a vicinity.  
I was without doubt the cousin elephant  
There in the neon universe.  
When it looked me with its mineral pullulation eyes  
it had neither eyeballs nor leg  
but crystal natures on its sides.
