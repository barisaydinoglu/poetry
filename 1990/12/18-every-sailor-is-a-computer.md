Every Sailor Is A Computer
--------------------------
It is a tale of obscene receptacles fewer and fewer  
die about another mode of happiness.  
What verdure films -  
the city is filled with it,  
energies for the quilt and the hushed diamond.  
A fog of hats within deep brown water and sepia coats.  
Always you petrify through the lunchtime  
toward the night faltering fragrances of strawberry.
