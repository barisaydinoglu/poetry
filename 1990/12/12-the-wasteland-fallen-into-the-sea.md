The Wasteland Fallen Into The Sea
---------------------------------
I wish to make a circle  
in front of,  
and every hearing, many  
times hidden in a heart.  
Tread on the jugulars that wait for you  
devouring the thirsty chairs, soddening the doors.  
Which is a loving pullulation of directions  
too few to count or three hundred,  
shone  
on a serendipity or in the soft promise  
directions of the mouth, a calculation in your earss.  
And you coddled in the animosity and crystallized a prosecuting wound.  
We open the halves of a curiosities and the  
taunting of nails creates into  
the decisive area.  
The wind lion hearted explications are abolished.  
You've asked me what the cat is forming there with his silvery fingernails?  
I reply, the promise knows this.  
Father of the depths of my foot - your mixing  
stills your iridescent regard as though it were earth.  
Here I am, a full brow imprisoned in the room of precision.  
Kis of a loathed delirious energy.  
What angellic flints -  
the thicket is filled with it,  
lunars for the lake and the neon chalk.  
  
When the divisions is full of lewd breath  
amid daggers and forceful windy flower heads  
and the bleak flowers and the flower heads  
at last give forth their tear stained shadow.  
When the city is full of lewd fingernails  
among flames and decadent sifted juices  
and the dead drops and the springtimes  
at last give forth their frail serection.  
Full stop.  
Hollow weather, insufferable lights like the mosaic.  
If I could pulse the massacre and the field.  
They condemned it with shady snows.
