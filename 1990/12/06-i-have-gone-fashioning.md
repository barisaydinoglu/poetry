I Have Gone Fashioning
----------------------
Realized sweet-smelling alcove a bell focuses its dream of a old ending, its old ending, the new ending of the dove  
order -  
its trusting trapdoors.  
Worn-out  
children and goddesses.  
For me they are aerial.  
But the phemonana expanded the memory.  
Behind the turqoise panic of the rotten stump.  
The sordid phemonana is noble on your eyelids.  
So the serene wonder lives on in an apple,  
the moonlit house of the nature,  
the comfortable film that is unguessed and celestial.  
The electricity hopeful cadavers are shattered.
