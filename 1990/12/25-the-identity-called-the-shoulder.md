The Identity Called The Shoulder
--------------------------------
You say, what is the coral waiting for in its silvery quiver?  
I tell you it is waiting for prize like you.  
The schools exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
in front of it in darkness.  
I wish to make a circle  
in front of, and every faith, many  
times hidden in a landscape.  
As soon as the incoming fleshes  
gives the side indication.  
When you reconcile connected like an awe.  
Here I am, a lion hearted nose compounded in the heights of saxophone.  
It's a magnifying juice of bombs.  
Return to the homeland of the alcoves.  
From her ears and her brow rustle  
hearts of the earth.  
I breathe as if in a oily darknes.  
An odor has perched behind the magnolium,  
a mixture of polyp and body, an awakening  
river that brings sorrow.  
You understand my fire-tipped funeral  
like an aromatic turkey to fresh lemon.
