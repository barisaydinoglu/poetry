In The Middle Of Of River And Lemon
-----------------------------------
In the first reel, the careful mother  
is attacked by a gentleman. In the second  
take he returns, to store and to stand.  
And you mutated in the anger and connected a cracking cubicle.  
Everything dry with noble voices, the salt of the smooth brick  
and piles of charitable bread behind lunchtime.  
Wave of wave of movies rolling down the sea.  
In the face of so many darkness to positivity.  
Brings all the throttles hearts.  
  
What lion hearted waves -  
the university is filled with it,  
phemonanas for the alcove and the motionless gold.  
Nothing but your naked nose.  
Performed and then fashioned in the archipeligos.  
Abolish me and let my substance light.  
Skeleton twilight and the bitten smooth stone  
loathe at the walls of my house.  
And meetings of bitten brow an odor has seized outside the apple,  
A mixture of womb and body, a transforming  
pullulation that brings sorrow.  
Noone here is waiting for the next door.  
Grace. You promised yourself for imbuing.  
This rambunctious faucet and magnifying leaf scratches me  
with it's secure sweetness like brain and lip  
and black ripples like brow and ripples.  
Shall we move on?  
And within my hammock, during the night, I woke up naked  
and full of sincerity.  
Full stop.
