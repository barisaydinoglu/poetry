Meeting Your Bomb
-----------------
Because I love you, love, behind the clay and in the lava.  
A thunder of roses nocturnal empire. The square functions to return an architecture  
to its architecture.  
Full stop.  
And meetings of chaotic eye inside the trembling complaints.  
Your light is a wreath  
filled with tremulous soul.  
A inscription kisses,  
congeals - it does not return.  
Where honeysuckles meet  
umbrellas meet, amid and outside and the sound  
of salts, to reach out and set in confusion.  
It is a tale of rotten hounds it was a mourning business of mask and salts.  
One of them is angellic,  
the other knows synonyms.  
Where is nobody  
she says, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?
