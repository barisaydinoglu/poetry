Every One Is A Language
-----------------------
Wave of wave of rivers rolling down the sea. The ripple plan that has everyone fragmented.  
You say, what is the snow waiting for in its sepia door?  
I tell you it is waiting for essence like you.  
Exiled gates and acidulous shrapnels.  
To the arcane color of the copper sea shell.  
Here I am, an aquatic  
hand protested in the region of serenity.  
Like the wayside clay of flowers they are all mothers  
professional serections in whose velvety defenders originate.  
Magnifying the film of her reflection full of felicity.  
And you coagulated in the agony and gathered a coagulating serection.
