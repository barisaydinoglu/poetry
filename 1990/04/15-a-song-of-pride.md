A Song Of Pride
---------------
From her mouth and her eyelids flutter  
magnoliums of the earth.  
Which is a fluidic muscle of directions  
thousand or million, set  
on a sea's skin or in the manly leaf  
directions of the arm, a calculation in your tails.  
A ultraviolet and wayside heart is abolished in the thicket.  
Among the brimstone panic of the night.  
And a harsh prize's heat will reflect you.
