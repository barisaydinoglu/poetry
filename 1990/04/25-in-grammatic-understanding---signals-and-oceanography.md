In Grammatic Understanding - Signals And Oceanography
-----------------------------------------------------
You - the poetic brow.  
I'm the fisherman to the mane of immediate snow.  
Sand-colored salivas of trap,  
sunburst orange seams above  
a ghostly flint.  
What we say dawns to  
pulse some other aunt  
what an antenna may teach.  
Only atrocious  
and to a  
person they take on time, too many to count years  
it rescues like a starry sky in the sunburst orange car.  
  
And you deluded in the sorrow and wove a throttling martyr.  
Illusion and salt - ships of embarassement.
