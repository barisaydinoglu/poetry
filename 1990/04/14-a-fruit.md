A Fruit
-------
Everything muzzled with comfortable voices, the salt of the moon  
and piles of free bread within afternoon.  
Realized verdure crown in the first reel, the humble aunt  
is loathed by a father. In the second  
take he returns, to promise and to expand.  
Ripple was no longer above the recording threshold.  
A loving wood paneling making a musical thing of a unlikely meeting with a stranger.
