Tell Them That I Am Giving Up Magnifying In Phenomena
-----------------------------------------------------
Crack me and let my  
substance seek.  
Everything  
banal with lovely voices, the salt of the bird feather  
and piles of promising bread in midnight.  
This chaotic perfume and dedicating mirror hates me  
with it's eloquent aspens like tail and eyeballs  
and opaque dull shades of transluscent deep brown lights like nose and serendipities.  
A root standing will return  
the weak clay of a planet.  
Rejoiced and then transformed in the archipeligos.  
So the incredulous felicity  
lives on in a orange,  
the boundless house of the quilt,  
the enchanting quiver that is perfect and fluidic.  
There are no evils but hushed cycles of bell and sand-colored  
beds of velvety rigid brick.
