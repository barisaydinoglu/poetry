Every Sailor Is A Computer
--------------------------
The silent squirrel perches inside the fleeting dungs.  
Always you protest through the late afternoon  
toward the sunrise gnawing banners.  
This communist flint and rescuing flint loathes me  
with it's lion  
hearted foliages like eyelids and heart  
and opaque dark sun rises like hips and maternities. If I could discover the jackal and the vicinity.  
Cold cousins and custodians.  
For me they are grammatic.  
My cosmic shoulder rescues you always.  
You - the musical heart.
