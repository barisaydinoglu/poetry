Your Toe Is Enough
------------------
A necklace focuses its dream of a ending, its beginning, the ending of the law order -  
its homogeneous pins.  
And the form to its awe  
and among the telegraphs the noble one  
the mountaineer covered with acerb landscape.  
You say, what is the wave waiting for in its transluscent crimson alcove?  
I tell you it is waiting for evening star like you.  
Not flying is a form of inheriting.  
Anger and bridge - lands of embarassement.  
Everything dead with self-assured voices, the salt of the flesh  
and piles of aquatic bread with midnight.  
Indicates the root's crystallizing hand.
