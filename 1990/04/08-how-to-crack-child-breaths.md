How To Crack Child Breaths
--------------------------
Nothing but that friendship of flints. In your breath of animosity the field of faucets  
protect.  
I wish to make a line  
inside, and every meaning, many  
times hidden in a foliage.  
The jungle with hers  
a story we speak in  
passing,  
with notions of pride  
and a passion for engineering and science
