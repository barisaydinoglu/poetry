Thick Theories Of Precisions
----------------------------
In your hand of animosity the divisions of jars travel.  
The productivities exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
in front of it in darkness.  
The day perfumes you in its mortal jungle.  
Ribbon.  
The order of the praises pockets of rusted nail converted into saphire.  
Appreciating from directionless marble.  
This communist fragrance of strawberry and perching sea water taunts me  
with it's noble miracles like eyelids and heart  
and opaque opaque turqoise awes like foot and wheatfields.  
Sea shell of a fell cheerless flag.  
The reasons for my respect  
are swam in my foot of diamond.  
Once there was a misunderstood cousin who  
fashioned at parties, sitting in a line segment, among miracles.  
What secure dews -  
the moonlight evening is filled with it,  
evening stars for the serenity and the fire-tipped cork.  
I'd do it for the momentum in which you reconcile  
for the quivers of deep brown you've wetted.  
Happiness is  
gone, the subject has seized.  
Fewer and fewer  
undulate about another mode of decency.  
A mourning phemonana day  
not the sunburst orange moment  
when the morning wets the doors.  
Towards those eddies of yours that wait for me.  
Here I am, a great fingernails ignored in the boulevard of root.  
Neither key nor pasture nor red  
nor sepia but green.
