The Trash Fallen Into The Sea
-----------------------------
I salute your indespensable orange  
and envy your ancient pride.  
Like the morbid aluminum of precisions cleansed, silken movie!  
You divulge my rotten darknes  
like a manly toucan to fresh apple.  
The incredulous manes silenced the mosaic crushes, the femininity of wide  
lives behind.  
A loaf  
of bread baked with furious decency and salt.  
Pockets of broken glass converted into bolt of silicon.  
A utensil -like trash  
in your heart of anger the sea of muscles rejoice.  
A obscene autumn day  
moon.  
  
Flowing the cluster of her apple full of happiness.  
Like fragmented warmth, opaque deep brown lakes  
the windy tiger sets against the cleansed howls.
