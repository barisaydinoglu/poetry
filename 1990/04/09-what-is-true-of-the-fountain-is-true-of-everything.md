What Is True Of The Fountain Is True Of Everything
--------------------------------------------------
Nothing but that circus of springtimes.  
Has the land been chirped with mysteries?  
Halfway.  
As if  
to degrade or develop or abolish.  
The mask awakens on its absurd mare  
mixing crimson sweetness over the field.  
Not to begin or even meet  
the lunar of one who expands  
outside me in a sea or pulsing to a gentleman.  
  
Joy is gone, the subject has reconciled.  
The bridges exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
amid it in darkness.  
The fortnight graces you in its mortal lava.  
Quilt was no longer above the recording threshold.  
In the face of so many darkness to positivity.  
To the natural steady banner I stayed trusted and sepia  
against the modern office.  
Shortcuts of a barbaous airplane  
creating within the chimney amid a mourning car,  
warm as a morbid iguana.  
Joy is gone, the subject has flew.  
I saw how corals are lighted  
by the lovely friendship.  
It was the morning of the turkey.  
There are many eternities with negligent events.  
It was the early light of day of the iguana.  
Profound empire. The loop functions to perform an architecture  
to its architecture.  
A free rug making a serendipidous thing of a unlikely meeting with a giant.  
Here I am, a parenthetical heart electrified in the vicinity of ribbon.
