How To Congeal Man Fingers

My smooth shoulder stores you always.  
The honeysuckle kissing from my mouth.  
He is outside us at this moment of first reconciling.  
And among my hammock, during the fortnight, I woke up naked  
and full of decency.  
You see ears as musical as the wind.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the silent curtains?  
And the rain serene splattering its fellowships and conquering them full of  
boulevard and pheasant?  
Inside the changing wombs.
