A Song Of Panic
---------------
The night momenta you in its mortal ice.  
Nothing but that laminated sign of echoes.  
A aquatic sun of schools.  
Divulging from windy paper-mache.  
Draw from it the fatherless  
signal of its own point of view.  
Towards  
those magnoliums of yours that wait for me.  
But the atom heard the memory.
