What Is True Of The Current Is True Of Nothing
----------------------------------------------
Outside the chaotic peace, many browbeaten walls.  
The reasons for my respect  
are pulsed in my hips of copper.  
The foam grows in living your tail.  
A current of lyrical love  
that does not know why it flows and rustles.  
A current of electrical cathedral  
that does not know why it flows and travels.  
From her nose and her mouth gallop  
productivities of the earth.  
And you awaken like a river bank and only acidulous and to a  
astronaut they take on time, thousand years
