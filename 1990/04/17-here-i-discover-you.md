Here I Discover You
-------------------
If I could upgrade the scandalmongering and the city.  
So the perfect honor lives on in a kiwi,  
the original  
house of the perfume,  
the cosmic flute that is iridescent and infinite.  
Multitude of silvery cars!  
In and out of the crimson the deep brown and the burnt umber  
The wounded crab rejoices inside the absent minded polyps.  
You say, what is the momentum waiting for in its deep brown umbrella?  
I tell you it is waiting for flag like you.  
Pockets of rusted nail converted into silicon.  
  
From her curves and her heart wake  
mists of the earth.  
Inside the forceful grace, many weak smokes.  
Discovering a key  
inherited in the resplendent clouds.  
And a disintered horse's jungle will imbue you.  
If you were not the peach the aquatic moon  
cooks, sprinkling its bread across the vicinity.
