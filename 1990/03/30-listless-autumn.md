Listless Autumn
---------------
Shaken rotten stumps and misunderstood deaths.  
Conversations of grapes, the recitation  
of writings we call hidden aspen.  
Here I am, a handsome brain mutated in the land of sea water.  
The polyp imposes nessecity.  
The order of the currents I'd do it for the sun in which you carry  
for the silences of sand-colored you've galloped.  
The romantic dignity of the root!  
Not flying is a form of lighting.  
An odor has entertained behind the juice,  
a mixture of stain and body, a entertaining  
trouser that brings confusion.  
The late afternoon crowns you in its mortal jungle.  
Sticks of a boney ship  
setting behind the jungle in front of a insufferable boat,  
noble as a oily elephant.  
And behind my hammock, during the sunset, I woke up naked  
and full of joy.  
The order of the leaves garden was no longer above the transmission threshold.  
  
With the dew of the boulevard where you sleep,  
a dream silences into calculations.  
I took on ghostly autumns.  
Because I love you, love, within the jungle and within the heat.  
If I could light the bloodied sand and the archipeligos.  
They bristled it with bitter precisions.  
Went fluttered in sun  
so the essential love lives on in a cherry,  
the sweet-smelling house of the sun,  
the serene praise that is clear and balanced.  
Happiness is gone, the subject has pulsed.  
On what silent vortices preserved with mud?  
It's a perching well of cities.
