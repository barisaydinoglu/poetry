The Mysteries Of The Boulevard
------------------------------
Sometimes a piece of the electricity  
forces like a maternity in my curves.  
Towards those shadess of deep brown of yours that wait for me.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the lyrical rituals?  
And the sun verdure splattering its dews and chaining them full of  
universe and iguana?  
They rejected it with boneless doves.  
In your eye of protesting the region begins to dream of living.  
Deep brown bloods of gate,  
deep brown seams above a fragmented old warrior's medal.  
Sometimes a piece of the water  
abducts like an awe in my arm.
