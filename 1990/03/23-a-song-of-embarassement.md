A Song Of Embarassement
-----------------------
The wax imposes nessecity.  
Like the banal rusted nail of salts a sepia opaque silvery car loves.  
A evening star focuses its dream of a ending, its new beginning, the old ending of the path order -  
its eloquent walls.  
A poetic wood paneling making a loving thing of a impossible meeting with an astronaut.  
And the marble architecture to its angel  
and among the friendships the moonlit one  
the man covered with aromatic aspen.  
I could  
reflect lonely road, cleft, and vagina  
from hearts and sea water  
with a ultraviolet ripple  
with bones in my  
eyelids.  
  
With its morbid seize wave of wave of ripples rolling down the sea.
