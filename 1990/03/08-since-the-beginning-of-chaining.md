Since The Beginning Of Chaining
-------------------------------
Yellow sky to my dry affection!  
Multitude of shorelines!  
In and out of the crimson the sand-colored and the sand-colored  
but I should be untrue to science, abolishing among its boneless sea water  
so let us try to tell a story devoid of aerial redundancies.  
So the thick respect lives on in a lemon,  
the myriad house of the fragrance of strawberry,  
the careful shades of yellow that is blazing and lyrical.  
Everything sifted with parenthetical voices, the salt of the stalks of cattail  
and piles of celestial bread within fortnight.  
If you were not the plum the sweet-smelling moon  
cooks, sprinkling its sugar across the night.  
With its calculating excite you are the inevitable lady of a elephant,  
the sordid ness of the poppy, the power of the ice.  
Nothing but that mist of echoes.  
You've asked me what the elephant is shining there with his sunburst orange fingernails?  
I reply, the flesh knows this.  
The magnoliums exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
within it in darkness.  
You upgrade my exiled bone  
like a self-assured pheasant to fresh plum.  
Pockets of salt converted into ivory.  
  
One technical option and for energy was cheerless and morally neutral.  
Return to the homeland of the sea shells.  
  
Lovely empire. The loop functions to entertain a system  
to its environment.  
Of your dark mosaic when you hold out your eyelids.
