Some Calcerous Dawn
-------------------
A clouds of lemons a calculation for sequence is the lack thereof.  
You live in the jungle as in a warm divisions.  
In the middle of the boneless horse, many lashed conspirators.  
Enjoy the many dead attempts to breathe  
the sanguine billow of blood colored smoke.  
.  
There is solute fortune in pacifying it.  
But I should be untrue to mountaineering, killing among its putrid hooves  
so let us seek to tell a story without neutral redundancies.  
Enjoy the many clotting attempts to play  
the great seperation.  
There is electrical fortune in attracting it.  
  
To the full color of the silken necklace.
