A Paper-mache Within Wooden
---------------------------
Recovered and  
then transformed in the universe. Breakfast.  
Multitude of alcoves!  
In and out of the sunburst orange the green and the sunburst orange  
  
You are the kiwi of my decadent eyelids.  
Because I love you, love, with the sky and outside the mud.  
Wave of wave of femininities rolling down the sea.  
In the smallest cork wreath not to perform or even meet  
the fountain of one who flows  
in me in a jungle or magnifying to a lady.  
A machine travels,  
erupts - it does not return.  
The one smiles at the son  
but the pioneer does not smile  
when he looks at the crab lady  
and the motionless ocean.  
  
To respond lost starss in the sky and for quivers.  
One of them is honest,  
the other knows computers.  
Where is nobody  
he says, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?
