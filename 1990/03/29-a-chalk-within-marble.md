A Chalk Within Marble
---------------------
  
Travel on the extinctions that wait for you  
coddling the senile chairs, shattering the doors. The vertical defender gave it tiredness.  
When the field is full of phosphorus eyelids  
outside egoes and morbid rambunctious shadess of sand-colored  
and the disintered roots and the perfumes  
at last give forth their fuming viola.  
What cleansed echoes -  
the heights is filled with it,  
beds for the circus and the neurotic gem.  
In the first scene, the manly person  
is taunted by a father. In the second  
reel he returns, to relinquish and to rejoice.
