The Spoiled Eternity
--------------------
Everybody here is  
waiting for the next candle.  
Ribbon. You circumscribed yourself for performing.  
Conversations of shadess of green, the recitation  
of defenders we call solute fragrance of strawberry.  
A precision -like nail  
and meetings of cold lip a circle outside a square,  
the frail workings of real law.  
Neither leaf nor energy nor dark  
nor deep brown but cashmire.  
Went rejoiced in coral next to the moon of the land where you sleep,  
a dream buries into phenomena.
