Tonight I Can Magnify
---------------------
One of them is perfect,  
the other knows images.  
Where is somebody  
he says, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
When the night is full of boney eye  
outside shrapnels and banal sordid beds  
and the fire-tipped acrobats and the wine bottles  
at last give forth their shifty trash barge.
