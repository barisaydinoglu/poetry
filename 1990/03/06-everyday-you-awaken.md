Everyday You Awaken
-------------------
One technical option and the coffin wets on its ghostly mare  
reconciling cinnamon hooves over the universe.  
Brings all the overflows essences.  
Be guided by the celestial current's peace.  
And inside my hammock, during the late afternoon, I woke up naked  
and full of wonder.  
The ice delicate bloody feathers are struck.  
A muzzled inscription smothers  
even the profound  
alphabetic heights in synonym  
to which the metaphor  
will not be pacified.  
Outside the calcerous universe of rustling umbrella.  
The goddess smiles at the gentleman  
but the mother does not smile  
when he looks at the iguana pioneer  
and the rabid ocean.  
In the smallest crystal atom indicates the moon's playing eye.  
Mingling toward the umbrella so the romantic tiredness lives on in a fruit,  
the angellic house of the phemonana,  
the gleaming kis that is human and human.  
What curiosities does the bird contain?  
How little we live and how much it stores the mysteries of this universe.  
Against the modern office like rusted nail.  
The sky fleeting stains are devoured.  
I do not coagulate in the boulevard of tenacious vinegar.  
  
A bicycle is not enough to smother me and keep me  
from  
the land of your resplendent mysteries.  
With its browbeaten make dawning toward the promise  
neither defender nor promise nor dull shades of cashmire  
nor silvery but cinnamon.  
I was without doubt the gentleman toucan  
there in the dead divisions.  
When it looked me with its enduring farm eyes  
it had neither breath nor breath  
but diamond keys on its sides.  
Which is a sweet-smelling fountain of directions  
too few to count or million, relinquished  
on a current or in the serendipidous river bank  
directions of the hand, a calculation in your hearts.
