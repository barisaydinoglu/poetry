Fathers Must Always Prove Their Schools
---------------------------------------
Of your turqoise grace when you hold out your brain.  
I'd do it for the smooth stone in which you flutter  
for the pullulations of sand-colored you've perfumed.  
The soul plan that has everyone sordid.  
Pure juice mingles the necklaces neither foam nor grace nor black  
nor yellow but yellow.  
Inside the inevitable sea of parched moon.  
You've asked me what the lobster is flying there with his cinnamon mouth?  
I reply, the cathedral knows this.  
Against the bleak rose, many ghostly hearts.  
Of your rust colored current when you hold out your hips.  
  
And so that its shardss of ceramic will wet your eyelids.  
But the snow mixed the memory.  
Because I love you, love, next to the heat and outside the ice.  
Wave of wave of prizes rolling down the sea.
