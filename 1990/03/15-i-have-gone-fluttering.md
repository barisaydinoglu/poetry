I Have Gone Fluttering
----------------------
Only boney and to a  
daughter they take on time, too few to count years  
what promising gardens -  
the jungle is filled with it,  
old warrior's medals for the praise and the lonely emerald.  
Woman of the depths of my arm - your galloping  
stills your absorbant regard as though it were mud.  
Condemn me and let my substance carry.  
You are the obscene one of a tiger,  
the careless ness of the salt, the power of the water.
