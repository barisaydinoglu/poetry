Since The End Of Abhorring
--------------------------
On what sordid massacres crystallized with  
water?  
Of moonlit orange, spirit  
of the maps,  
abducted astronaut blood, your kisses  
respond into exile  
and a droplet of silicon, with remnants of the jungle.  
I stayed heard and transluscent sunburst orange  
against the archipeligos.  
Sand-colored jungle to my bruised shoreline!  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
In my field at late afternoon  
you are like a femininity  
and your form and colour the way I fashion them.  
Lethargic fortnight and the whirlwinds of river  
silence at the walls of my house.  
I'm the child to the telegraph  
of immediate awe.
