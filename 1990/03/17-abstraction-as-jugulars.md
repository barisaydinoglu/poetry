Abstraction As Jugulars
-----------------------
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
I was without doubt the elder elephant  
there in the hairy sea.  
When it looked me with its fresh window eyes  
it had neither mouth nor lip  
but ceramic atoms on its sides.  
How creating is the wonderful receptacle and it's affluent shrapnels? Treading the curtain of her awe full of honor.  
The heart swims in dawning your breath.
