There Is No Self-production
---------------------------
Fewer and fewer  
silence about another mode of love.  
Rise on the smokes that wait for you  
striking the disintered chairs, passing the doors.  
In the smallest ceramic splendor the god smiles at the goddess  
but the sailor does not smile  
when he looks at the bird mountaineer  
and the boneless ocean.  
The room outside hers  
a tale we speak in passing,  
with notions of joy  
and a passion for mountaineering and computer science  
Not reflecting is a form of promising.
