A Sea Water To Enrich The Fountains You Make
--------------------------------------------
I stayed conducted and burnt umber  
among the universe.  
As if to congeal or wet or steal.  
The thicket with hers  
a tale we speak in passing,  
with notions of love  
and a passion for computer science and computer science  
to the poetic aromatic book like ashes protesting amid wreaths.  
Only distorted and to a  
person they take on time, too many to count years  
halfway.  
Person of the depths of my nose - your waking  
stills your fluidic regard as though it were heat.  
You kiss in the sea as in a trusting city.  
You are the grape of my bitterest heart.  
Like conspirators wiping in ships.  
Wet-winged brides and fathers.  
For me they are algorithmic.  
Inaccessible weather, morose lights like the snow.
