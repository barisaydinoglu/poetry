Since The Beginning Of Degrading
--------------------------------
To the solute friendly promise  
barbaous goddesses and fathers.  
For me they are technical.  
With its skeleton flutter always you protest through the early light of day  
toward the twilight erupting wheatfields.  
Of your blood colored sea shell when you hold out your nose.  
Full stop.  
And around  
my hammock, during the midnight, I woke up naked  
and full of respect.  
The late afternoon love you in its mortal electricity.  
A chorus of elephants at midnight un flew un taunted  
comes to a halt before a maternity.  
To seek another land so the infinite tiredness lives on in a grape,  
the comfortable house of the essence,  
the scrupulous soul that is great and vertical.  
And around my hammock, during the twilight, I woke up naked  
and full of felicity.  
You - the free tail.  
You are the lemon of my insufferable breath.  
Which is a handsome bottle of directions  
three hundred or too many to count, rejoiced  
on a writing or in the fleeting time  
directions of the tail, a calculation in  
your fingers.
