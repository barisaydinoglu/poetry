The Insufferable Mountaineer Of The Vicinity
--------------------------------------------
Outside the cashmire leg of the earth. Pure alarm showers the praises what is this detail but a memory drowned of its phemonanas? As soon as the incoming poppies  
gives the aerial indication.  
The lunchtime telegraphs you in its mortal lava.  
Multitude of wheatfields!  
In and out of the sand-colored the transparent and the crimson  
Towards those propellers of yours that wait for me.  
The hopeful dignity of the love!  
He is outside us at this moment of first rejoicing.  
Pure dagger flutters the flags among the heights like iron.
