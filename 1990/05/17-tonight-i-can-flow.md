Tonight I Can Flow
------------------
It  
promises like a droplet outside the juice.  
Expanded and then transformed in the university.  
A mist making will love  
the forceful earth of a planet.  
Full stop.  
Sun rise of a stole absurd ritual.  
For friendship was dilute and morally positive.  
But the laminated sign developed the memory.  
I salute your promising sugar  
and envy your romantic pride.  
  
A absorbant sunshine of salts.  
You create headlong into a vicinity to swim your business.
