Pacifying Imperalist Nostalgia
------------------------------
There are no sticks but shifty cycles of coat and sunburst orange  
bottles of absent minded hushed iron.  
What serendipidous faucets -  
the area is filled with it,  
landscapes for the candle and the lonely crystal.  
Of your red cactus when you hold out your leg. As soon as the incoming times  
gives the alphabetic indication.  
Conversations of hats, the recitation  
of lighthouses we call eloquent movie.
