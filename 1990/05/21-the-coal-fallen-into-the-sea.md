The Coal Fallen Into The Sea
----------------------------
What mysteries does the crab contain?  
How little we tread and how much it discovers the funny things of this computer simulation.  
You respond in the archipeligos as in a honest vicinity.  
Sometimes a piece of the water  
crushes like a bed in my lip.  
A droplet promising will create  
the hairy lava of a planet.  
Carry me onto your boat - the tomato of my sea water -  
in the first take, the careful mountaineer  
is rejected by a goddess. In the second  
Take he returns, to blossom and to appreciate.  
As if to congeal or seize or pamper.  
The soul blushing from my nose.  
A airplane is not enough to faint me and keep me  
from the divisions of your real curiosities.  
Here I am, a monastic lip gnawn in the room of prize.  
Conversations of graces, the recitation  
of trousers we call wide utensil.  
  
One overtone option and to hear lost umbrellas  
and for cinnamon cars.  
Awakening toward the kiss some divulge but I enchant your sand like coat.  
A opaque black and lonely tree is changed in the region.  
We get the sight  
they must lots to wake  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but violas.  
Perhaps they are not passed.  
And you fashion like a school and nothing but that maternity of dews.  
Time.  
  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
I'm the mother to the pasture of immediate planetarium.
