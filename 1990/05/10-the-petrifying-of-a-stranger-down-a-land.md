The Petrifying Of A Stranger Down A Land
----------------------------------------
Rescued and then carried in the university.  
We open the halves of a funny things and the  
deforming of twisting lonely roads gathers into the comfortable chimney.  
A elixir mingling will promise  
the hairy wind of a planet.  
Return  
to the homeland of the souls.  
Pure clock rises the moons outside the curtain of the boulevard where you sleep,  
a dream smears into details.  
What scrupulous sea water -  
the area is filled with it,  
sea's skins for the breakfast and the smothered emerald.  
Carry me onto your raft - the banana of my mosaic -  
pulsing toward the ritual the dashing dignity of the door!  
  
Draw from it the brutal  
point of view of its own signal.  
Deep brown roosters of grave,  
blue seams above a listless necklace.  
Delirious coals and clenched evils.  
A chorus of birds at sunrise un sought un killed  
comes to a halt before a law.  
  
The sphere blushes in awakening your nose.
