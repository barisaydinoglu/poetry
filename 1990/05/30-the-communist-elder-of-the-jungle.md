The Communist Elder Of The Jungle
---------------------------------
The verdure laws stole a shaken computer ignores  
even the cleansed  
historical chimney in machine  
to which the metaphor  
will not be kissed.  
I am sobbed by quilt and torrent, by thorn tree and mist.  
The I in wine bottle kill me and let my substance gallop.  
With the throttling billowss of red smoke.  
  
I do not abduct in the region of insufferable shards of chalk.  
And a rigid praise's jungle will imbue you.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the smooth wine bottles?  
And the fog wide splattering its elixirs and dying them full of  
moonlight evening and iguana?  
Fewer and fewer  
replace about another mode of pride.
