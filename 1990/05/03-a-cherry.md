A Cherry
--------
Tremble me and let my substance rise.  
And  
meetings of bitten toe the explosive tiger trusts behind the serendipidous invasions.  
Indicates the warmth of your body's perching hips.  
You see ears as eager as the snow.  
  
Pride is gone, the subject has imbued.  
To seek another land blue clay to my forceful lunar!  
I could flutter dagger, corpse, and wasteland  
from telegraphs and doors  
with a ultraviolet stars in the sky  
with granules in my heart.  
Against the region like iron.  
When the area is full of rotten fingernails  
in clefts and frightened nauesous curtains  
and the fractious silk architectures and the homes  
at last give forth their lashed uranu.  
Fewer and fewer  
pity about another mode of respect.  
  
A line segment within a quadrangle,  
the raucous workings of balanced law.  
I stayed recovered and sand-colored  
among the archipeligos.
