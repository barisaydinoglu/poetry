Sight As Ghosts
---------------
The I in window expanded and then built in the university.  
Of your rust colored wine bottle when you hold out your mouth.  
Closed off and shut out like a coral.  
A chorus of iguanas at morning un enriched un forced  
comes to a halt before a movie.  
In the smallest gem drop a image makes,  
electrifies - it does not return.  
You - the slender eyelids.  
  
Nothing but that writing of acrobats.  
Which is a gleaming  
home of directions  
too many to count or thousand, lived  
on a sea's skin or in the affluent prize  
directions of the shoulder, a calculation in your noses.  
The fresh dignity of the leaf!  
Return to the homeland of the forms.  
It is a tale of mechanical lards the inaccessible hat is spacious on your eyelids.  
Among the marine eyeballs of the electricity.  
  
From her breath and her foot drink  
jars of the earth.  
The flame imposes nessecity.
