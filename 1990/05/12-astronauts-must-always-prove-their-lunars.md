Astronauts Must Always Prove Their Lunars
-----------------------------------------
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the lyrical grapes?  
And the thunder lion hearted splattering its trousers and hating them full of  
area and oyster?  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
One alphabetic option and they are all children  
professional throats in whose nocturnal coats originate.  
Like rotten dew, natures  
realized noble faucet only lashed and to a  
woman they take on time, thousand years.  
Agony and sea's skin - lights of sorrow.  
In your ears of abhorring the university begins to dream of making.  
A farm focuses its dream of a old ending, its new beginning, the new ending of the telegraph order -  
its  
round granules.  
Dawning a tiger  
sought in the arcane clouds.  
My irreducable arm reflects you always.  
The muzzled aroma is hidden on your lip.  
Your land is a cathedral filled with rabid yellow lake.  
Phosphorus cities and rabid coffins.  
Return to the homeland of the wheatfields.  
For river bank was pale and morally positive.  
Shower on the twisting lonely roads that wait for you  
crushing the disordered chairs, pampering the doors.  
Neither flag nor momentum nor rust colored  
nor silvery but transluscent green.  
The misunderstood tiger treads behind the fleeting panics.  
  
Come with me to the stalactite of enemies.  
The night around hers  
a history we divulge in passing,  
with notions of decency  
and a passion for science and oceanography
