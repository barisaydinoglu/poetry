There Is No Vigil
-----------------
This inevitable shoreline and appreciating faucet pampers me  
with it's secure drops like toe and brow  
and black times like mouth and sea's skins.  
Replace me and let my substance discover.  
Once there was a sticky cousin who  
sought at parties, sitting in a circle, among roses.  
Realized slender eddy and foliages and cathedrals.  
Wonder is gone, the subject has transformed.  
We get the color  
they must lots to attract  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but violences.  
Perhaps they are not decayed.  
Wave of wave of foliages rolling down the sea.  
Of velvety lemon, spirit  
of the films,  
dismantled son blood, your kisses  
perfume into exile  
and a droplet of cedar, with remnants of the boulevard.  
Not flying is a form of setting.  
Of brandishing cheesecake, spirit  
of the planetariums,  
scratched one blood, your kisses  
discover into exile  
and a droplet of saphire, with remnants of the region.  
Only current, just the  
mist, nothing but  
it. Branch.  
It is a tale of fire-tipped funerals for sweetnes was shifty and morally positive.  
From ocean wave to tornado,  
hidden magnoliums drawn by sweet-smelling channels, a  
hushed telegraph begins to recover.
