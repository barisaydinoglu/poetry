How To Devour Custodian Arms
----------------------------
When you pacify like shoreline rescued by the water.  
Expanded and then developed in the night.  
Purity is gone, the subject has wove.  
The disordered mosaic that divulges in your quilt.  
This fractious map and refreshing flower abandons me  
with it's equinoctial mists like finger and heart  
and opaque blood colored acrobats like hips and muscles.  
In my moonlight evening at holiday you are like a planetarium  
and your form and colour the way I fly them.  
Vagabonds of a weak vessel  
blushing within the thicket in a thirsty wheel,  
natural as a fractious oyster.  
Precision was no longer above the transmission threshold.  
Towards those cactuss of yours that wait for me.  
Sand-colored stains of vinegar,  
transparent seams above a parched echo.
