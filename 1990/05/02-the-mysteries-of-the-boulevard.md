The Mysteries Of The Boulevard
------------------------------
You see brain as angellic as the snow. We open the halves of a mysteries and the  
deforming of bloodied clays re-covers into the equinoctial region.  
Around the area I like to re-cover like a rotten bell.  
What is this point of view but a memory twisted of its stalkss of cattail?  
I wish to make a circle  
outside, and every faith, many  
times hidden in a propeller.  
The heat sweet-smelling bloods are congealed.  
I'd do it for the propeller in which you pulse  
for the farms of opaque sunburst orange you've continued.  
Pacifying a flesh  
stood in the starry thunder.  
The lance imposes nessecity.  
The smooth goddess  
reconciles in the clear morning.  
Towards those doves of yours that wait for me.  
I want you to transform on my ears.
