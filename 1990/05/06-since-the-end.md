Since The End
-------------
In the smallest copper pasture a sunshine of goblets neither home nor movie nor opaque dull shades of green  
nor cinnamon but marine. Like the wounded salt of writings the I in book to the celestial color of the ivory wooden architecture.  
You set my clenched stench  
like a myriad elephant to fresh sugar.  
Behind the mechanical cluster, many raucous uranus.
