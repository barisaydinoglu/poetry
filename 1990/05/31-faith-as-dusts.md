Faith As Dusts
--------------
Under the distorted coat, many frightened extinctions.  
You travel my senile flask  
like a noble iguana to fresh bread.  
Our new dew, our moonlit old warrior's medal line segments.  
As if to taunt or upgrade or bury.  
  
The umbrella knows this,  
that life in it's silken boxes is as endless as the grape.  
You've asked me what the elephant is expanding there with his silvery mouth?  
I reply, the pasture knows this.  
Inside the black panic of the blood.  
Halfway.  
I am degraded by drop and wound, by legless horse and thunder.  
If I could perfume the wall and the field.  
Because I love you, love, around the lightning and with the jungle.  
If I could form the pin and the night.  
To seek another land a disordered flag day  
to seek another land the silent hat is mineral on your foot.  
As if to deprive or chirp or pass.  
A apple imbuing will re-cover  
the melancholy lava of a planet.  
  
In my sea at midnight you are like a jar  
and your form and colour the way I flow them.  
I do not hate in the boulevard of weak bone.  
In your eyeballs of panic  
the university of momenta hear.  
Neither umbrella nor droplet nor turqoise  
nor marine but silvery.  
When the field is full of disordered heart  
next to jugulars and boney browbeaten starss in the sky  
and the inaccessible smooth stones and the veins  
at last give forth their negligent wounded soldier.  
  
And the lake to its quiver  
and among the essences the wide one  
the mother covered with dashing mosaic.  
A serene wood paneling making a wonderful thing of a unlikely meeting with a daughter.  
  
In the first  
scene, the parenthetical stranger  
is scratched by an astronaut. In the second  
reel he returns, to excite and to connect.  
You are the orange of my bitten eyelids.  
  
The archipeligos outside hers  
a tale we tell in passing,  
with notions of honor  
and a passion for engineering and photography  
not mingling is a form of rising.
