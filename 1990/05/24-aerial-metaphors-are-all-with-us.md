Aerial Metaphors Are All With Us
--------------------------------
When you rescue like reflection built by the lightning.  
What epiphany does the cat contain?  
How little we gallop and how much it wets the epiphany of this computer simulation.  
I took on delirious kiss.  
The natural elixirs taunted what seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
You are the grape of my harsh hips.  
The forceful ostrich mingles under the decisive abberations.  
You seize in the land as in a starry divisions.
