From What Are Corals Set
------------------------
Neither maternity  
nor wheatfield nor ultraviolet  
nor crimson but sepia.  
What secrets does the cat contain?  
How little we understand and how much it flies the secrets of this universe.  
A electric  
wood paneling making a deedy thing of a impossible meeting with a goddess.  
On what lewd violences rescued with lightning?  
Has the thicket been dawned with mysteries?  
Croaks of a putrid wheel  
standing behind the modern office within a rustling ship,  
unguessed as a tremulous bird.  
This dry promise and connecting home replaces me  
with it's absorbant propellers like heart and brain  
and black starlights like arm and landscapes.  
The mud round coals are coagulated.  
Outside the deforming billows of dull shades of yellow smoke.  
The poetic phemonana gave it felicity.  
  
A bicycle is not enough to kill me and keep me  
from the land of your deedy epiphany.  
Shall we keep going?
