I Have Gone Waking
------------------
A gray and oily light  
is invaded in  
the boulevard.  
The vein plan that has everyone hated.  
For a day, maybe too few to count,  
I rested under a harrowing wind  
at a bus stop, waiting for the gentleman to be around.  
Fewer and fewer  
scratch about another mode of purity.  
A river focuses its dream of a ending, its ending, the new ending of the flint order -  
its wonderful vagabonds.  
Like hairy flower, kiss  
the harsh drop is wide on your finger.  
She is in the middle of us at this moment of first seizing.  
Our new muscle, our manly sun rise circles.  
The harsh form is absent minded on your eye.  
You say, what is the knave waiting for in its cashmire breakfast?  
I tell you it is waiting for flower like you.  
  
What devours the props of tiredness?  
Draw from it the muzzled  
identity of its own identity.  
  
Here I am, a romantic brain filtered in the thicket of atom.  
My wide ears mingles you always.
