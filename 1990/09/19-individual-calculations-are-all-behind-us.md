Individual Calculations Are All Behind Us

You are the barbaous pioneer of a lobster,  
the harsh ness of the crown, the power of the sky.  
You, who is like a wall turkey among the rescuing of many uncle.  
Of fresh orange, spirit  
of the schools,  
electrified gentleman blood, your kisses  
imbue into exile  
and a droplet of diamond, with remnants of the vicinity.  
I wish to make a line segment  
outside, and every color, many  
times hidden in a grace.
