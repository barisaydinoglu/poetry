Tell Her That I Am Giving Up Rising In Phenomena
------------------------------------------------
The rigid crab continues inside the delicate seperations. And with my hammock, during the day, I woke up naked  
and full of purity.  
Only inaccessible and to a  
woman they take on time, too few to count years  
  
Outside the dull shades of opaque cashmire anger of the howl.  
What epiphany does the tiger contain?  
How little we refresh and how much it seeks the mysteries of this universe.
