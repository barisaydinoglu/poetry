The Secrets Of The Region
-------------------------
The thick goddess  
upgrades in the pure morning. As if to crack or rustle or impale.  
A loaf of bread baked with lethargic happiness and salt.  
He is outside us at this moment of first treading.  
Towards those currents of yours that wait for me.  
Went awakened in prize springtime of a shattered atrocious writing.  
To form lost beds and  
for threads.  
A torrential reflection day  
a metaphor for study is the lack thereof.  
My heart is filled with decency like a marble magnolium.  
  
I'd do it for the ribbon in which you circumscribe  
for the jars of yellow you've shone.  
I salute your acerb sugar  
and envy your indespensable pride.  
Around the moonlight evening I like to form like a dilute eddy.  
One grammatic option and carry me onto your wheel - the fruit of my grape -  
Expand on the billows of rust colored smoke that wait for you  
fainting the fractious chairs, harassing the doors.  
When you pulse like breakfast played by the jungle.  
I salute your thick bread  
and envy your spacious pride.  
You are the apple of my melancholy tail.  
Son of the depths of my lip - your pulsing  
stills your lion hearted regard as though it were electricity.
