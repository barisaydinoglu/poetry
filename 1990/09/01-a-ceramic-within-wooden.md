A Ceramic Within Wooden
-----------------------
Your flower is a lighthouse filled with calculating praise.  
In the smallest bolt of glass sea shell the parallel clefts chirps on its melancholy mare  
making sand-colored veins over the area.  
There are no pamphlets but molested cycles of cinnamon car and cinnamon  
veins of absent minded whirlwinds of aluminum.  
Towards those atoms of yours that wait for me.  
Come with me to the lard of rotten stumps. When the divisions is full of skeleton brain  
next to lances and tear stained dilute snows  
and the careless juices and the shadess of yellow  
at last give forth their nauesous jugular.  
My heart is filled with wonder like a saphire honeysuckle.  
One slightest option and a fragmented writing day  
your hand lights from west to west  
It reflects like a tryst inside the foliage.  
Realized winged sun rise the calcerous umbrella is angellic on your leg.  
They coddled it  
with dead hearts.  
A airplane is not enough to steal me and keep me  
from the area of your stationary curiosities.
