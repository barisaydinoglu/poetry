Outside Of Dove And Coat
------------------------
Towards those kiss of yours that wait for me.  
A sunburst orange pencil stores.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
excite of cathedrals and love  
and the monastic leaves of his native land?  
Somebody here is waiting for the next lighthouse.  
Perfume. You drank yourself for mingling.  
Where evening stars meet  
momenta meet, in front of and within and the sound  
of whispers, to reach out and develop in sorrow.  
This rigid perfume and performing telegraph twists me  
with it's absent minded mirrors like eye and eye  
and brimstone droplets like finger and hooves.  
I salute your sweet-smelling plum  
and envy your iridescent pride.  
But I should be true to science, degrading among its cheerless roses  
so let us attempt to speak a story without individual redundancies.  
Around the sea I like to create like a hushed root.  
Closed off and shut up like a landscape.  
  
I salute your wonderful apple  
and envy your electric pride.  
Once there was a wayside sailor who  
attracted at parties, sitting in a square, among stones.  
  
A brutal metaphor deceives  
even the honest  
grammatic sea in inscription  
to which the metaphor  
will not be mixed.  
Everybody here is waiting for the next breakfast.  
Wine bottle. You awakened yourself for mingling.  
The breakfasts exists even  
when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
around it in darkness.  
With its bleak hear brings all the bristles warmths of your body.  
Neither momentum nor garden nor blood colored  
nor silvery but opaque cashmire.  
Our new goblet, our sensual door loops.  
Green sky to my nauesous serendipity!  
The I in defender the order of the muscles inside the land like broken glass.  
The sensible honeysuckle gave it respect.  
  
Illusion and lunar - curtains of anger.  
You - the romantic fingernails.
