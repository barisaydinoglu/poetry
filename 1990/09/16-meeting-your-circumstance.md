Meeting Your Circumstance
-------------------------
Some light but I refresh your steel like crown.  
The sunrise springtimes you in its mortal electricity.  
In the middle of the sea like metal.  
I salute your ancient wine  
and envy your warm pride.  
The senile transluscent sepia lake is promising on your breath.  
Wave of wave of friendships rolling down the sea.  
When you chirp like prize kissed by the sky.  
Your hand discovers from north to east  
So the indespensable decency lives on in a kiwi,  
the smooth house of the faucet,  
the ancient hat that is lovely and thick.  
To the delicious irreducable writing the drop coagulates, the wine bottle of deedy  
imbues in front of.  
Divulging toward the momentum the nature rises in perfuming your eyelids.  
Everything tremulous with moonlit voices, the salt of the window  
and piles of natural bread inside early light of day.
