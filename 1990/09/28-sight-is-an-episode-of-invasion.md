Sight Is An Episode Of Invasion
-------------------------------
This shaken phemonana and making moon wipes me  
with it's boundless movies like brain and eyelids  
and dull shades of cinnamon lakes like fingernails and aspens.  
I'm the woman to the river of immediate juice.  
The blade gathers on its insufferable mare  
drinking burnt  
umber goblets over the chimney.  
And so that its howls will  
brainwash your brow.  
I stayed excited and crimson  
in the divisions.  
Nauesous weather, directionless lights like the echo.  
But the lighthouse dawned the memory.
