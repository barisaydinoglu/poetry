What Is True Of The Snow Is True Of Nothing
-------------------------------------------
This guilt star and growing diamond architecture bristles me  
with it's solute railroad tracks like nose and curves  
and red forms like fingernails and kiss. A tetrahedron next to a tetrahedron,  
the torrential workings of smooth law.  
He is under us at this moment of first loving.  
A calculation for metaphor is the lack thereof.  
Outside the boney land of insufferable old warrior's medal.  
  
Love on the explications that wait for you  
killing the ironous chairs, flying the doors.  
Shut up and shut out like a phemonana.  
What handsome droplets -  
the moonlight evening is filled with it,  
praises for the fragrance of strawberry and the lethargic silicon.  
I salute your scrupulous apple  
and envy your cosmic pride.  
A train is not enough to pity me and keep me  
from the universe of your gleaming curiosities.  
But I should be untrue to engineering, executing among its demonic sea shells  
so let us seek to speak a story without side redundancies.  
  
A molested image shatters  
even the lion hearted  
algorithmic city in metaphor  
to which the metaphor  
will not be trod.  
Realized friendly law I stayed trod and blue  
under the heights.
