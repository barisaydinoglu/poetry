Gleaming Theories Of Warmths Of Your Body
-----------------------------------------
Of a gray god that inherits graces.  
Pockets of brick converted into marble.  
To mingle lost cashmire cars and for warmths of your body.  
In the smallest paper-mache dove kissing from absurd ceramic.  
  
Inaccessible women and ladies.  
For me they are grammatic.  
Fewer and fewer  
fall about another mode of purity.
