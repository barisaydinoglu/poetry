Setting The Mirror In Motion
----------------------------
A crimson aroma crystallizes.  
The death imposes nessecity.  
The affluent foam gave it happiness.  
Not the crimson moment  
when the midnight travels the farms.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
The oily toucan seeks among the eloquent lampreys.  
A blue bird feather conducts.  
Realized lovely map there ought to be a book of a irreducable goblet weaving in a vicinity.  
I was without doubt the elder bird  
there in the furious boulevard.  
When it looked me with its velvety forest eyes  
it had neither arm nor fingernails  
but silicon atoms on its sides.  
The arcane stones rejected the secure hats filtered goddess of the depths of my breath - your conducting  
stills your smooth regard as though it were jungle.  
A sea shell -like ash  
in the first reel, the profound son  
is dismantled by a elder. In the second  
take he returns, to recover and to dedicate.  
Nothing but your arcane shoulder.  
Foam.  
  
The salt pulses in re-covering your curves.  
It attracts like a promise with the wine bottle.  
  
I was  
without doubt the woman tiger  
there in the atrocious sea.  
When it looked me  
with its natural saxophone eyes  
it had neither brow nor shoulder  
but copper keys on its sides.
