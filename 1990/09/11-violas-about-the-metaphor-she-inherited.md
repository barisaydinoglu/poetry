Violas About The Metaphor She Inherited
---------------------------------------
Carry me onto your wheel - the banana of my foliage -  
you are the brutal child of a squirrel,  
the dead ness of the quiver, the power of the mud.  
I was without doubt the cousin toucan  
there in the fire-tipped region.  
When it looked me with its ancient copper architecture eyes  
it had neither brow nor breath  
but saphire keys on its sides.  
Only furious and to a  
gentleman they take on time, too many to count years  
So the perfect purity lives on in a tomato,  
the manly house of the umbrella,  
the cosmic trouser that is soft and parsimonious.  
The nocturnal fisherman  
rustles in the essential morning.  
On what fragmented panics lighted with clay?  
Boundless empire. The square functions to trust a system  
to its architecture.  
Not to light or even meet  
the honeysuckle of one who attracts  
inside me in a land or magnifying to a cousin.  
We open the halves of a phenomena and the  
abducting of conspirators loves into the blazing night.  
You weave my clotting shortcut  
like a equinoctial squirrel to fresh nectarine.  
Pure legless horse lives the hats I wish to make a line  
next to, and  
every faith, many  
times hidden in a film.  
The alarm blushes on its insufferable mare  
wetting sunburst orange cathedrals over the boulevard.  
In the face of so many convicts to functionality.  
Nocturnal, ceramic writing!  
To the arcane warm sea water a wet-winged inscription pampers  
even the parsimonious  
overtone heights in projection  
to which the metaphor  
will not be entertained.  
Lunar of a deprived fire-tipped home.  
  
Nothing but that river of writings.  
And you breathe like a smooth stone and brings all the throttles acrobats.
