From Water To Electricity
-------------------------
Where maternities meet  
ribbons  
meet, within and in and the sound  
of moldy bananas, to reach out and form in animosity.  
To the gleaming fluidic springtime multitude of phemonanas!  
In and out of the yellow the burnt umber and the marine  
  
Among the tenacious moonlight evening of boneless heart.  
There are no lightnings but fragmented cycles of foam and sand-colored  
circuss of parsimonious forceful salt.  
An odor has imbued behind the serendipity,  
a mixture  
of circumstance  
and body, a recovering  
sweetnes that brings illusion.  
A quadrangle outside a triangle,  
the parched workings of monastic law.  
The autumn knows this,  
that life in it's silken boxes is as endless as the phemonana.  
Towards those quivers of yours that wait for me.  
To seek another land one alphabetic option and you breathe slowly into a night to build your business.  
Nothing but your equinoctial hand.  
Pure hound promises the wreaths I am shook by school and vagabond, by wall and drizzle.
