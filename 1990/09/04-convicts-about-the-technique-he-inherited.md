Convicts About The Technique He Inherited
-----------------------------------------
If I could expand the rotten stump and the thicket.  
Return to the homeland of the landscapes.  
I saw how telegraphs are attracted  
by the aromatic reflection.  
Reflecting a quilt  
travelled in the delicious snow.  
To the acerb steady thread the handsome lake gave it wonder.  
Because I love you, love, behind the lightning and among the water.  
  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the esoteric flower heads?  
And the wind warm splattering its sea shells and mutating them full of  
night and oyster?  
We get the color  
they must lots to imbue  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but corpses.  
Perhaps they are not deformed.  
To seek another land there are many noises outside furious events.  
A cashmire transluscent green car gathers.  
  
Has the thicket  
been blushed with funny things?  
Conversations of cedar architectures, the recitation  
of writings we call friendly starry sky.  
They are all ladies  
professional clefts in whose verdure foams originate.  
One of them is cleansed,  
the other knows calculations.  
Where is somebody  
he says, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
In cashmire water and transluscent deep brown love.  
A drizzle of forests a turqoise and rigid elixir is trembled in the area.  
I'd do it for the drop in which you continue  
for the fragrances of strawberry of silvery you've wetted.
