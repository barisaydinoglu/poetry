A Absorbant Substance
---------------------
Has the room been rose with phenomena?  
So the self-assured wonder lives on in a mango,  
the fleeting house of the juice,  
the gleaming bottle that is self-assured and secure.  
A angel focuses its dream of a old ending, its new ending, the ending of the flesh order -  
its plumed trash barges.  
The daughter smiles at the pioneer  
but the mountaineer does not smile  
when he looks at the bird pioneer  
and the silent ocean.  
My heart moves from being absurd to being homogeneous.  
I do not die in the field of banal twisting lonely road.  
Raucous elders and cousins.  
For me they are individual.
