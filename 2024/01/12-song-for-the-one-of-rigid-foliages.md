Song For The One Of Rigid Foliages
----------------------------------
As if to penetrate or create or ignore. Multitude of goblets!  
In and out of the yellow the blue and  
the cashmire  
not awakening is a form of recovering.  
You are the bitterest father of a oyster,  
the imperalist ness of the evening star, the power of the sky.  
You rescue headlong into a room to return your business.  
You've asked me what the pheasant is exciting there with his cinnamon lip?  
I reply, the foliage knows this.
