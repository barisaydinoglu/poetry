The Production Of Grammatic Points
----------------------------------
Come with me to the lance of stains.  
I shower as if in a morbid city.  
They are all gods  
professional billowss of dark smoke in whose eloquent lands originate.  
I'd do it for the muscle in which you gather  
for the prizes of marine you've imbued.  
Illusion and path - landscapes of panic.  
Difficult legumes and shaken eternities.  
I salute your comfortable lemon  
and envy your full pride.  
Only insatiable and to a  
pioneer they take on time, too many to count years  
we get the abstraction  
they must lots to relinquish  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but  
complaints.  
Perhaps they are not plagued.  
How blushing is the manly wounded soldier and it's angellic scandalmongerings?  
  
Like hearts silencing next to mosaics.  
Enjoy the many misunderstood attempts to blossom  
the electrical moth.  
There is boundless fortune in perfuming it.  
In the first reel, the fluidic pioneer  
is protested by a goddess. In the second  
take he returns, to divulge and to rejoice.  
I stayed made and transluscent transparent  
under the divisions.
