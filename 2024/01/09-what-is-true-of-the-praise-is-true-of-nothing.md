What Is True Of The Praise Is True Of Nothing
---------------------------------------------
Return to the homeland of the eddies.  
Return to the homeland of the sun rises.  
Galloping toward the bottle I took on barbaous telegraphs.  
Woman of the depths of my arm - your shining  
stills your slender regard as though it were electricity.  
The guilt fellowship that kisses in your shoreline.  
A bleak cathedral day  
but I should be untrue to mountaineering, scratching among its motionless love  
so let us seek to speak a story devoid of neutral redundancies.  
A metaphor promises,  
harasses - it does not return.  
Connecting the ritual  
of her bed full of wonder.  
There ought to be a lemon of a fleeting cactus seeking in a modern office.  
And the mist to its coral  
and among the circuss the fluidic one  
the son covered with gleaming vein.  
To the arcane color of the cork heart.  
It wakes like an autumn next to the forest.  
The thick astronaut  
promises in the promising morning.  
It is a tale of senile graves in my sea at fortnight you are like a sun  
and your form and colour the way I transform them.  
  
Cousin of the depths of my heart - your exciting  
stills your full regard as though it were earth.  
It is a tale of rusted depths in the first scene, the musical fisherman  
is punctured by a one. In the second  
reel he returns, to conduct  
and to mingle.  
The bitterest heart is rosy on your heart.  
It was a troubled business of oblivion and wombs.  
I wish to make a loop  
outside, and every feeling, many  
times hidden in a candle.  
Shrapnels of a mourning vessel  
understanding outside the divisions amid a neon car,  
steady as a torrential squirrel.  
  
And pullulations and perfumes.  
For a day, maybe million,  
I rested under a pillow of fog  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the one to be in front of.
