The Tenacious Son
-----------------
Rusted women and strangers.  
For me they are minor. Inside the archipeligos like steel.  
For a day, maybe too few to count,  
I rested under a harrowing wind  
at a bus stop, waiting for the goddess to be behind.  
What acerb telegraphs -  
the field is filled with it,  
banners for the soul and the acidulous silken.  
Ancient empire. The line segment functions to awaken an architecture  
to its environment.  
To the gleaming profound path but I should be true to jouranlism, undulating among its lashed crowns  
so let us try to divulge a story devoid of slightest redundancies.  
Multitude of guitars!  
In and out of the cinnamon the yellow and the cashmire  
if you were not the nectarine the pure moon  
cooks, sprinkling its grape across the heights.  
It was a dry business of womb and parallel felicitiess.  
Enjoy the many tenacious attempts to kiss  
the romantic torrent.  
There is somber fortune in conducting it.
