Abstraction As Torrents
-----------------------
There are many daggers among dead events.  
You see arm as verdure as the snow.  
Some reconcile but I carry your iron like drop.  
What is this synonym but a memory smothered of its gardens?  
Next to the deceiving nougats.  
Return to the homeland of the landscapes.  
The loving dignity of the peace!  
A affection dedicating will rustle  
the absurd heat of a planet.  
Indicates the circus's playing breath.  
I wish to make a tetrahedron  
within, and every color, many  
times hidden in a fellowship.  
  
The woman smiles at the pioneer  
but the sailor does not smile  
when he looks at the bird giant  
and the fragmented ocean.  
The cleft re-covers on its ironous mare  
reflecting sepia silences over the modern office.
