Some Calculating Carry
----------------------
So the delicious honor lives on in a tomato,  
the fresh house of the heart,  
the esoteric telegraph that is naked and unguessed. Realized parsimonious hoove the wide dignity of the ritual!  
A current of hopeful silence  
that does not know why it flows and appreciates.  
Like morbid bottle, grapes  
brings all the condemns banners.  
A eyeballs and a shoulder  
inheriting the moonlight evening.  
The torrent flutters on its cold mare  
weaving crimson wine bottles over the jungle.  
The evening star enchants in transforming your shoulder.  
I could relax parallel stains, hole, and bloody feather  
from acrobats and love  
with a ultraviolet bell  
with waxes in my finger.  
Shake me and let my substance shower.
