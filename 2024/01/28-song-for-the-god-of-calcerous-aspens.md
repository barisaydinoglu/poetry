Song For The God Of Calcerous Aspens
------------------------------------
What brainwashes the props of joy?  
Went expanded in evening star only eddy, just the  
mane, nothing but  
it. Muscle.  
From her lip and her eyeballs gather  
wreaths of the earth.  
Of a brimstone god that rustles precisions.  
A jar -like lard  
in your brain of wetting the archipeligos begins to dream of flying.  
A momentum pacifying will continue  
the bitterest fire of a planet.  
  
Towards those farms of yours that wait for me.  
In the first reel, the cleansed stranger  
is impaled by a god. In the second  
take he returns, to circumscribe and to dawn.
