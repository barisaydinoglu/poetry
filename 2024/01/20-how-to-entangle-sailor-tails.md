How To Entangle Sailor Tails
----------------------------
And the ribbon to its bridge  
and among the suns the angellic one  
the giant covered with irreducable magnolium.  
Starry empire. The circle functions to upgrade a environment  
to its system.  
Of a black giant that sets saxophones.  
And femininities and grapes.  
Of a turqoise father that gathers precisions.  
Around the room I like to make like a sordid root.  
Beligerance and tiger - bridges of anger.  
My heart moves from being sticky to being winged.  
Upgrading a ribbon  
responded in the mineral clouds.  
Nothing but your lovely eye.  
Fuming night and the fuming faucet  
condemn at the walls of my house.  
From harrowing wind to ocean wave,  
hidden salts drawn by starry channels, a  
melancholy forest  
begins to promise.  
The sea water knows this,  
that life in it's cedar boxes is as endless as the sun rise.  
Perfuming from difficult wooden.  
Daughter of the depths of my breath - your continuing  
stills your lion hearted regard as though it were clay.  
Like cubicles dismantling next to wheatfields.  
One of them is secure,  
the other knows productions.  
Where is everybody  
she quips, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
The son smiles at the woman  
But the uncle does not smile  
when he looks at the elephant custodian  
and the ironous ocean.
