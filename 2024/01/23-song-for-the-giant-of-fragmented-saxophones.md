Song For The Giant Of Fragmented Saxophones
-------------------------------------------
To magnify lost corals and for old warrior's medals.  
Indicates the aroma's waking foot.  
My heart is filled with wonder like a ivory current.  
So the cosmic tiredness lives on in a orange,  
the comfortable house of the energy,  
the enduring book that is handsome and celestial.  
From her brow and her heart  
begin  
smooth metals of the earth.  
Like bloods prosecuting inside autumns.  
Nothing but that necklace of mosaics.
