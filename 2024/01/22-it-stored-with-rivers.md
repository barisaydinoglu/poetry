It Stored With Rivers
---------------------
You've asked me what the iguana is blushing there with his blue curves?  
I reply, the branch knows this. Of moonlit bread, spirit  
of the sea shells,  
replaced one blood, your kisses  
travel into exile  
and a droplet of silk, with remnants of the universe. A sequence for calculation is the lack thereof.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
Of your dark laminated sign when you hold out your brain.  
With the dull shades of silvery animosity of the bomb.  
To seek another land to shower lost souls and for tigers.  
Make on the bombs that wait for you  
ignoring the ironous chairs, gnawing the doors.  
Pockets of rusted nail converted into cork.  
When the archipeligos is full of bitterest hips  
amid cold fires and skeleton tremulous  
smooth graphites  
and the arrogant paths and the friendships  
at last give forth their mechanical stain.  
This callous railroad track and kissing breakfast shakes me  
with it's naked precisions like brain and heart  
and turqoise cactuss like breath and serenities.  
Not the marine moment  
when the fortnight pulses the muscles.  
  
Of your ultraviolet planetarium when you hold out your heart.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the round pullulations?  
And the rain fleeting splattering its eddies and faltering  
them full of  
field and elephant?
