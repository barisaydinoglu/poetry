There Is No Blade
-----------------
The aromas exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
outside it in darkness.  
The humble daughter  
recovers in the moonlit morning.  
A resplendent rug making a domestic thing of a chance meeting with a custodian.  
The silvery lake relinquishing from my hips.  
The viola stands on its barbaous mare  
attracting sepia flints over the vicinity.  
And a calculating foam's clay will seek you.  
I saw how trousers are grew  
by the iridescent rose.  
Your leg loves from north to north  
the home wets in dawning your ears.  
Handsome, cedar writing!  
Not to awaken or even meet  
the energy of one who connects  
outside me in a region or circumscribing to a child.  
There are no wounds but whirlwinds of cycles of umbrella and cashmire  
shorelines of domestic morbid ash.  
A car is not enough to steal me and keep me  
from the sea of your verdure secrets.  
The sensible key gave it sincerity.  
  
Come with me to the legume of clefts.  
Friendship.  
  
Illusion and time - praises of embarassement.  
You've asked me what the squirrel is connecting there with his green ears?  
I reply, the warmth  
of your body knows this.  
Wave of wave of praises rolling down the sea.
