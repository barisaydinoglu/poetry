The Absurd Jugular
------------------
Full stop. The night faucets you in its mortal jungle.  
Once there was a directionless person who  
pacified at parties, sitting in a quadrangle, among ribbons.  
In the fragmented region of clotting muscle.  
Dawn on the hounds that wait for you  
wiping the troubled chairs, pampering the doors.  
  
The shards of cedar trusts on its cold mare  
lighting blue tigers over the field.  
Our new atom, our hidden star loops.
