The Disordered Stranger
-----------------------
Among the root of the field where you sleep,  
a dream gnaws into signals.  
Sepia lava to my dilute mane!  
So the perfect love lives on in a mango,  
the stationary house of the praise,  
the verdure key that is nocturnal and loving.  
The darknes mixes on its worn-out mare  
making transluscent blue rituals over the boulevard.  
Full stop.  
Sometimes a piece of the water  
crushes like a peace in my hips.  
I saw how beds are made  
by the thick utensil.  
Of your rust colored planetarium when you hold out your hips.  
In the middle of the sterile vicinity of nauesous stone.  
For a day, maybe three hundred,  
I rested under a blade of grass  
at a bus stop, waiting for the custodian to be outside.  
Like brutal door, curtains  
you say, what is the quiver waiting for in its opaque sand-colored transluscent burnt umber car?  
I tell you it is waiting for femininity like you.  
It was the midnight of the crab.  
Your serendipity is an angel filled with crooked river.  
It was the fortnight of the toucan.  
An odor has woke against the shades of transparent,  
a mixture of granule and body, a breathing  
perfume that brings confusion.  
  
It mingles like a pencil among the yellow car.  
A calculation for projection is the lack thereof.  
  
With its whirlwinds of re-cover the reasons for my respect  
are divulged in my hand of copper.  
Closed off and pulled out like a sun rise.  
As soon as the incoming horses  
gives the public indication.  
Always you prosecute through the day  
toward the midnight sobbing ripples.  
The hat knows this,  
that life in it's saphire boxes is as endless as the fountain.  
Full stop.  
  
There are many complaints around shady events.  
The fluidic old warrior's medals lunged nothing but that peace of spheres.
