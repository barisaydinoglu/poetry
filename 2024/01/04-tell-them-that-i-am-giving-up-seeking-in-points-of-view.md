Tell Them That I Am Giving Up Seeking In Points Of View

You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the delicious shadess of deep brown?  
And the drizzle delicious splattering its river banks and changing them full of  
jungle and bird?  
When you light showered like a mane.  
Pockets of aluminum converted into gem. And telegraphs and peaces.
