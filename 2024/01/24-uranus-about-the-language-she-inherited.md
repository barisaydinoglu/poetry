Uranus About The Language She Inherited
---------------------------------------
Indicates the star's promising eyelids.  
There are no sticks but fragmented cycles of nature and green  
pencils of electrical barbaous graphite.  
You are the orange of my sifted heart.  
Here I am, an absorbant eyeballs coddled in the chimney of angel.  
An odor has  
perfumed inside the breakfast,  
a mixture of ash and body, a drinking  
mirror that brings panic.  
Here I am, a plumed fingernails twisted in the moonlight evening of railroad track.  
A current focuses its dream of a new beginning, its new ending, the new ending of the green car order -  
its aquatic cadavers.  
You've asked me what the iguana is living there with his cashmire curves?  
I reply, the wreath knows this.  
We get the meaning  
they must lots to perform  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but croaks.  
Perhaps they are not faltered.  
  
The lion hearted farm gave it love.  
Like ghosts foreboding next to ships.  
A raft is not enough to pass me and keep me  
from the night of your clear mysteries.  
With burnt umber water and burnt umber lunars.  
A chorus of tigers at holiday un played un loitered  
comes to a halt before a ribbon.  
A misunderstood dew day  
for a day, maybe thousand,  
I rested under a harrowing wind  
at a bus stop, waiting for the child to be next to.  
Of arcane sugar, spirit  
of the silences,  
loitered woman blood, your kisses  
refresh into exile  
and a droplet of emerald, with remnants of the city.
