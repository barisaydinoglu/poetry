The Self-production Fallen Into The Sea
---------------------------------------
For tree was troubled and morally neutral.  
Among crimson water and green necklaces.  
I saw how friendships are grew  
by the absorbant key.  
We get the feeling  
they must lots to perform  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but waxes.  
Perhaps they are not lunged.  
You - the pure eye.  
I stayed played and yellow  
against the divisions.  
In your finger of panic the thicket of bridges attract.  
You say, what is the coral waiting for in its cinnamon movie?  
I tell you it is waiting for silence like you.  
Respond on the errors that wait for you  
killing the sterile chairs, chaining the doors.  
I salute your indespensable grape  
and envy your self-assured pride.
