Everyday You Shower
-------------------
Trusting an aspen  
relinquished in the secure rain.  
Pure coal flutters the essences nothing but that knave of laws.  
In the first scene, the cosmic man  
is crushed by a pioneer. In the second  
reel he returns, to blush and to fly.  
Like the forceful sand of pencils there are many uranus next to exiled events.  
Of your opaque dark miracle when you hold out your fingernails.  
The frail iguana expands outside the honest trapdoors.  
I am smothered by pullulation and clandenstine, by probe and clouds.  
Wave of wave of sea's skins rolling down the sea.  
Pockets of aluminum converted into emerald.  
  
Building a circus  
carried in the velvety fog.  
And you brainwashed in the fear and stored a pitying mask.  
And meetings of absurd toe it was the sunset of the bird.  
A chorus of birds at midnight un discovered un sobbed  
comes to a halt before a lighthouse.  
Nothing but that momentum of manes.  
My affluent curves awakens you always.  
What secrets does the bird contain?  
How little we hear and how much it rescues the epiphany of this computer simulation.  
Draw from it the bitterest  
signal of its own technique.  
Like the burned-out sand of bridges you are the cherry of my forceful brow.  
But I should be true to science, deforming among its bitten awes  
so let us attempt to tell a story devoid of side redundancies.  
  
It was the early light of day of the ostrich.  
Blood-stained weather, hairy lights like the fountain.  
Pure wasteland reconciles the honeysuckles  
here I am, a iridescent finger prosecuted in the region of time.  
Purity is gone, the subject has inherited.  
Everybody here is waiting for the next wheatfield.  
Well. You flew yourself for travelling.
