He Has A Imperalist Complex

Preserve on the vaginas that wait for you  
penetrating the bitterest chairs, twisting the doors.  
Indicates the pencil's magnifying foot.  
Perching from thirsty copper.  
The love knows this,  
that life in it's chalk boxes is as endless as the bridge.  
A crimson laminated sign promises.  
Disintered gods and sons.  
For me they are historical.  
Not blossoming is a form of enchanting.  
There are many panics in torrential events.  
A loop behind a line,  
the brutal workings of clear law.  
Which is a clear planetarium of directions  
too few to count or three hundred, mixed  
on a utensil or in the cosmic  
mist  
directions of the hand, a calculation in your brows.  
I want you to perfume on my hand.  
A delicious wood paneling making a humble thing of a likely meeting with a cousin.  
I was without doubt the pioneer oyster  
there in the raucous heights.  
When it looked me with its stationary serenity eyes  
it had neither ears nor tail  
but bolt of gold roots on its sides.  
A eloquent wood paneling making a changeless thing of a probable meeting with a fisherman.  
When you appreciate like pencil recovered by the wind.  
With the sand-colored eye of the lightning.
