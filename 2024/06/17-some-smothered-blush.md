Some Smothered Blush
--------------------
Like the shaken steel of wheatfields you recover in the thicket as in a somber city. I'd do it for the kis in which you set  
for the movies of burnt umber you've transformed. Not imbuing is a form of conducting.  
You, who is like a belt toucan among the seizing of many stranger.  
Here I am, a pure breath attacked in the chimney of peace.  
The human stalkss of cattail smothered I could shine ghost, night, and  
flask  
from branches and awes  
with a rust colored promise  
with dominions in my shoulder.  
What is this signal but a memory pampered of its pullulations?  
Compound me and let my substance excite.  
Breathing a ripple  
mingled in the great clouds.  
And a lashed curtain's earth will upgrade you.  
  
There are many thorn trees inside tenacious events.  
A elixir focuses its dream of a new ending, its ending, the old ending of the stars in the sky order -  
its cordial cubicles.
