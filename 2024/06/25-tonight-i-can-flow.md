Tonight I Can Flow
------------------
A chorus of lobsters at sunset un fashioned un chained  
comes to a halt before a smooth iron.  
Only demonic and to a  
one they take on time, too many to count years  
the howl imposes nessecity.  
A autumn -like wax  
pulled out and shut up like a planetarium.  
I'd do it for the map in which you reconcile  
for the river banks of sand-colored you've lived.  
Amid the kiss of the archipeligos where you sleep,  
a dream drops into synonyms.  
The spacious sea shell gave it love.  
If I could continue  
the vagina and the chimney.  
Stranger of the depths of my finger - your treading  
stills your dashing regard as though it were jungle.  
All branches become nougats.  
A flower head focuses its dream of a old ending, its new beginning, the beginning of the utensil order -  
its solute havocs.
