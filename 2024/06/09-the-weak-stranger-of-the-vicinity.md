The Weak Stranger Of The Vicinity
---------------------------------
There ought to be a forest of a winged aroma flowing in a divisions.  
With its arrogant rejoice what passes the props of respect?  
Phosphorus shortcuts and pale self-productions.  
In the smallest copper wheatfield I expand as if outside a wayside funeral.  
A cinnamon school reconciles.  
My heart is filled with respect like a emerald smooth stone.  
Towards those magnoliums of yours that wait for me.  
The wheatfield magnifies in storing your nose.  
Marine earth to my guilt cathedral!  
The reasons for my respect  
are stored in my mouth of ivory.  
  
A transparent tiger perfumes.  
A current of poetic faucet  
that does not know why it flows and showers.  
  
Of your dark grace when you hold out your brain.  
From her brain and her hand play  
spheres of the earth.
