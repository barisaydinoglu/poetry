The Cheerless Custodian
-----------------------
For a day, maybe too many to count,  
I rested under a harrowing wind  
at a bus stop, waiting for the aunt to be in.  
And meetings of skeleton lip and the ship to its cluster  
and among the splendors the loving one  
The pioneer covered with ancient heart.
