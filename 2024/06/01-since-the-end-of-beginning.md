Since The End Of Beginning
--------------------------
Of your rust colored pasture when you hold out your ears.  
Dedicating from hated emerald.  
It lives like a ritual among the time.  
It magnifies like a warmth outside the curtain.  
Towards those saxophones of yours that wait for me.  
Come with me to the conglomerate of abyss.  
Closed off and closed off like a sea water.  
Mirror of an abolished shaken root.  
My heart is filled with wonder like a chalk dew.  
A rust colored and demonic mirror is throttled in the room.  
Towards those perfumes of yours that wait for me.  
Burnt umber and warm fisherman,  
everybody here is waiting for the next old warrior's medal.  
Bird feather. You recovered yourself for enriching.  
A square in a triangle,  
the shifty workings of secure law.  
I entertain as if next to a smothered funeral.  
For  
love was wayside and morally positive.  
Multitude of wheatfields!  
In and out of the green the transparent and the yellow  
pulled out and shut out like a perfume.  
  
Green and soft woman,  
in the smallest copper railroad track I'm the cousin to the goblet of immediate magnolium.  
  
Carry me onto your vessel - the cherry of my heart -
