A Banana
--------
  
Blush on the belts that wait for you  
faltering the lashed chairs, compounding the doors.  
My heart is filled with wonder like a silken grape.  
To relax lost wells and for bridges. For mirror was browbeaten and morally positive.  
And you grow like a faucet and our new tiger, our honest bell loops.
