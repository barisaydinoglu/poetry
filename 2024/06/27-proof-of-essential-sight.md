Proof Of Essential Sight
------------------------
In the transluscent cashmire fingernails of the lava.  
He is in us at this moment of first travelling.  
A drizzle of banners in your fingernails of stealing the area begins to dream of preserving.  
What is this phenomenon but a memory lunged of its graces?  
For kiss was dead and morally negative.  
I want you to inherit  
on my leg.  
Crimson deaths of cleft,  
blue seams above a nauesous key.  
Towards those paths of yours that wait for me.  
Everything sticky with aquatic voices, the salt of the hoove  
and piles of lyrical bread outside twilight.  
Of a dark father that lives moons.
