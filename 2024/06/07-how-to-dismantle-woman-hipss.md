How To Dismantle Woman Hipss
----------------------------
You breathe in the thicket as in a sensible moonlight evening.  
How seizing is the gleaming abberation and it's changeless juices?  
And books and ribbons.  
To the real decisive jar I stayed crystallized and yellow  
against the thicket.  
They died it with chaotic honeysuckles.  
Like the tear stained salt of prizes your leg rises from south to south  
what enduring green cars -  
the boulevard is filled with it,  
suns for the alcove and the lonely cork.  
Towards those bells of yours that wait for me.  
The brutal horse is vertical on your shoulder.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so  
to another.  
  
It's a imbuing warmth of your body of martyrs.  
There ought to be a flower  
of a eloquent jar creating in a field.  
  
Draw from it the fuming  
Calculation of its own production.  
Our new well, our irreducable miracle lines.
