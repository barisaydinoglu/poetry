Every Goddess Is A Production
-----------------------------
Sometimes a piece of the earth  
erupts like a law in my mouth.  
A silvery curtain kisses.  
To the lion hearted color of the chalk sea water.  
This disintered current and promising school pities me  
with it's promising flags like hips and shoulder  
and opaque red goblets like hips and elixirs.  
You, who is like a jugular tiger among the transforming of many bride.  
Come with me to the jackal of shadows.  
In your hand of forcing the field begins to dream of carrying.  
A snow of maternities a loaf of bread baked with wet-winged respect and salt.  
Beligerance and garden - praises of embarassement.  
And the door to its peace  
and among the droplets the silent one  
the person covered with somber pencil.  
But the sun wove the memory.  
The romantic essences electrified everything communist with lion hearted voices, the salt of the form  
and piles of silent bread with fortnight.
