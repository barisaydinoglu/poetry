From Fire To Heat
-----------------
And you refresh like a poppy and in your toe of mourning the city begins to dream of treading.  
Sometimes a piece of the sky  
cracks like a lemon in my brow.  
What is this synonym but a memory wetted of its alcoves?  
And you trust like a ripple and a ears and a foot  
preserving the vicinity.  
A plumed rug making a nocturnal thing of a lucky meeting with a pioneer.  
To dedicate lost candles and for forms.  
You are the apple of my frightened brow.  
A foot and a ears  
connecting the region.  
Not flowing is a form of rescuing.  
A sea water focuses its dream of a beginning, its beginning, the new beginning of the forest order -  
its promising circumstances.  
Marine and sweet-smelling bride,  
you are the orange of my mourning brain.
