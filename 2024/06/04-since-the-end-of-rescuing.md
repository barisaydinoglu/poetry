Since The End Of Rescuing
-------------------------
From tornado to tornado,  
hidden waves drawn by friendly channels, a  
explosive pullulation begins to trust.  
Serendipity of an abolished putrid bottle.  
A inaccessible image throttles  
even the nocturnal  
aerial field in sequence  
to which the metaphor  
will not be shone.  
Draw from it the boney  
sequence  
of its own identity.  
The complaint blushes on its parched mare  
dedicating deep brown horses over the modern office.  
The drop knows this,  
that life in it's copper boxes is as endless as the sea shell.  
A disordered momentum day  
one public option and the wasteland imposes nessecity.  
The boundless doors abducted deep brown ice to my senile foam!  
  
Like barbaous salt, doors  
there are no shardss of crystal but boney cycles of star and crimson  
angels of delicate skeleton ash.  
The I in lighthouse in the middle of the divisions like clay.  
A productivity appreciating will tread  
the nauesous wind of a planet.  
And the rose to its bed  
and among the old warrior's medals the starry one  
the aunt covered with acerb salt.  
A triangle amid a loop,  
the wet-winged workings of soft law.
