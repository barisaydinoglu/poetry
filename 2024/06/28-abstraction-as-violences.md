Abstraction As Violences
------------------------
There are no stalactites but dead cycles of garden and sepia  
banners of cordial callous sand.  
A raft is not enough to drown me and keep me  
from the area of your starry secrets.  
There ought to be a echo of an absent minded starry sky standing in a city.  
As if to forebode or make or filter.  
Only dry and to a  
lady they take on time, too many to count years  
nothing but that sea water of laws.  
A kiss -like serection  
nothing but that cathedral of shadess of transparent.  
My noble fingernails  
inherits you always.  
Be guided by the manly femininity's breakfast.  
Multitude of flowers!  
In and out of the blue the transparent and the cinnamon  
  
Troubled weather, lonely lights like the ritual.  
From palm tree leaf to uncomfortable turbulence,  
hidden flower heads drawn by ancient channels, a  
putrid fellowship begins to seek.  
Around the field I like to blush like a disintered dove.  
The musical farm gave it purity.  
And within my hammock, during the late afternoon, I woke up naked  
and full of love.  
The friendly  
love gave it joy.  
All productivities become circumstances.  
Dry gentlemen and fathers.  
For me they are grammatic.  
  
Closed off and pulled out like a form.  
Around transparent water and cashmire maps.
