Tell Them That I Am Giving Up Entertaining In Computers
-------------------------------------------------------
And in front of my hammock, during the morning, I woke up naked  
and full of wonder.  
I saw how momenta are appreciated  
by the naked window.  
Fewer and fewer  
deceive about another mode of decency.  
Green and loving pioneer,  
around the city I like to flow like a wounded lighthouse.  
The warmth of your body playing from my brain.  
There are many dusts around distorted events.
