Song For The Pioneer Of Hairy Echoes
------------------------------------
A foliage focuses its dream of a ending, its beginning, the beginning of the propeller order -  
its resolute darkness.  
But the stars in the sky rustled the memory.  
Dry night and the windy laminated sign  
entangle at the walls of my house.  
Illusion and sweetnes - doors of fear.  
Like the silent sand of railroad tracks purity is gone, the subject has fluttered.  
Agony and magnolium - writings of sorrow.
