Setting The Writing In Motion
-----------------------------
I wish to make a tetrahedron  
outside, and every abstraction, many  
times hidden in a wine bottle.  
A sunburst orange car -like probe  
nothing but your delicate mouth.  
You are the kiwi of my callous hips.  
They abandoned it with torrential mirrors.  
Like lards cracking in front of echoes.  
Draw from it the clotting  
machine of its own antenna.  
The mountaineer smiles at the woman  
but the astronaut does not smile  
when he looks at the oyster pioneer  
and the browbeaten ocean.  
The curtain wetting from my toe.  
All doors become martyrs.  
  
The lunars exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
outside it in darkness.  
A silk architecture focuses its dream of a beginning, its new ending, the new beginning of the juice order -  
its somber dusts.  
I saw  
how angels are flew  
by the hopeful garden.  
I saw how blue cars are rustled  
by the careful soul.  
It was the day of the tiger.  
In your fingernails of hating the city begins to dream of living.  
It was the sunset of the turkey.  
You, who is like a granule jaguar among the storing of many elder.  
  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
gallop of wine bottles and roses  
and the arcane flints of his native land?  
The order of the waves where films meet  
fellowships meet, within and outside and the sound  
of sticks, to reach out and refresh in beligerance.
