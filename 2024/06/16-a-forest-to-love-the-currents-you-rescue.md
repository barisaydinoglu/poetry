A Forest To Love The Currents You Rescue
----------------------------------------
Of eager grape, spirit  
of the old warrior's medals,  
died  
lady blood, your kisses  
gather into exile  
and a droplet of cedar, with remnants of the night.  
Against the boney thicket of chaotic lunar.  
  
Nights of a insatiable boat  
transforming outside the night among a rustling bicycle,  
lion hearted as a hairy pheasant.  
Full stop.  
Amid the rust colored illusion of the lard.  
Throats of a hollow train  
circumscribing outside the city in front of a disordered vessel,  
winged as a harsh tiger.
