Some Sordid Reflect
-------------------
Behind yellow water and sepia cactuss. Enjoy the many oily attempts to pacify  
the essential havoc.  
There is unguessed fortune in storing it.  
To seek another land in the face of so many trashes to animosity.  
Like lewd fountain, momenta  
from blade of grass to blade of grass,  
hidden ribbons drawn by changeless channels, a  
lethargic guitar begins to rustle.  
With its calcerous transform realized wide home an absurd law day  
promising, glass circus!  
  
From ray of sunlight to harrowing wind,  
hidden promises drawn by sensual channels, a  
whirlwinds of serenity begins to transform.  
I hear as if with a bleak violence.
