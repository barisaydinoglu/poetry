I Have Gone Trembling
---------------------
I was  
without doubt the pioneer tiger  
there in the phosphorus divisions.  
When it looked me with its unguessed dew eyes  
it had neither brain nor brain  
but gem homes on its sides.  
Halfway.  
I took on burned-out umbrellas.  
Kiss of a smeared inaccessible angel.  
You see brow as lovely as the sunshine.  
All paths become shrapnels.  
Realized human serenity our new curtain, our secure ship line segments.  
You see foot as esoteric as the wind.
