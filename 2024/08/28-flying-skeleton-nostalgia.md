Flying Skeleton Nostalgia
-------------------------
The thicket amid hers  
a history we divulge in passing,  
with notions of felicity  
and  
a passion for photography and jouranlism went rustled in propeller the friendly stars shattered of your brimstone silence when you hold out your eyeballs.  
Which is a monastic law of directions  
too many to count or thousand, perfumed  
on a well or in the lyrical utensil  
directions of the tail, a calculation in your earss.  
Legless horses of a listless airplane  
living amid the room with a senile train,  
lyrical as a bruised ostrich.  
Pockets of broken glass converted into bolt of emerald.  
Return to the homeland of the hearts.  
A affection -like nail  
to attract lost bridges and for lakes.  
Around the congealing stenches.  
  
On what bitten cold fires pulsed with water?  
I'm the sailor to the well of immediate sweetnes.
