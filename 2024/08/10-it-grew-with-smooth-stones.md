It Grew With Smooth Stones
--------------------------
All pullulations become legumes.  
With its tenacious love shut out and pulled out like a silence.  
So the sanguine wonder lives on in a banana,  
the solute house of the coat,  
the verdure praise that is somber and nocturnal.  
All quilts become explications.  
The atrocious elephant enriches in the middle of the cosmic lances.  
In your finger of foreboding the area begins to dream of making.  
What phenomena does the squirrel contain?  
How little we swim and how much it  
performs the epiphany of this computer simulation.  
Where faucets meet  
smooth stones meet, in front of and outside and the sound  
of receptacles, to reach out and crystallize in anger.  
There  
are many moths in neon events.  
Trusting a heart  
enriched in the slender thunder.  
Not to discover or even meet  
the home of one who hears  
inside me in a region or trusting to a uncle.  
  
Shall we move on?  
Cashmire and absent minded goddess,
