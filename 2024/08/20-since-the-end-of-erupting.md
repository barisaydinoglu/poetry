Since The End Of Erupting
-------------------------
From her fingernails and her mouth enrich  
love of the earth.  
Come with me to the stick of salts.  
You wake my sticky puberty  
like a profound crab to fresh plum.  
Where love meet  
roses meet, behind and amid and the sound  
of ghosts, to reach out and enrich in embarassement.  
  
One of them is secure,  
the other knows inscriptions.  
Where is everybody  
she says, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
The free prizes chained but I should be untrue to mountaineering, striking among its sticky rituals  
so let us try to tell a story without side redundancies.
