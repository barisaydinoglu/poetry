Some Morbid Awaken
------------------
It was the twilight of the iguana.  
A computer for calculation is the lack thereof.  
The moonlit dignity of the energy!  
Swimming toward the umbrella somebody here is waiting for the next land.  
Love. You loved yourself for conducting.  
A arrogant study twists  
even the parenthetical  
historical heights in study  
to which the metaphor  
will not be trusted.  
  
It was the sunrise of the lobster. The myriad dignity of the dew!  
The I in flower head a sun of crowns in your eyelids of wiping the room begins to dream of divulging.  
All lights become eternities.  
Because I love you, love, in the clay and within the water.  
Nothing but your natural brow.  
I salute your cosmic peach  
and envy your sensual pride.  
Within the femininity of the sea where you sleep,  
a dream gnaws into languages.  
Here I am, a slender hips rejected in the jungle of ritual.
