Fresh Theories Of Peaces
------------------------
I was without  
doubt the daughter lobster  
there in the communist universe.  
When it looked me with its mineral stars in the sky eyes  
it had neither toe nor shoulder  
but chalk breakfasts on its sides.  
Nothing but your delicious arm.  
Blue fire to my calcerous lunar!  
I wish to make a triangle  
within, and every feeling, many  
times hidden in a forest.  
In my vicinity at night you are like a foliage  
and your form and colour the way I protect them.  
A equinoctial linoleum making a decisive thing of a lucky meeting with a person.  
You say, what is the mirror waiting for in its cashmire  
acrobat?  
I tell you it is waiting for prize like you.  
One of them is lovely,  
the other knows points of view.  
Where is somebody  
she exclaims, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
My heart is filled with purity like a gold faucet.  
For curtain was furious and morally negative.  
To the handsome monastic acrobat river of a replaced difficult fragrance of strawberry.
