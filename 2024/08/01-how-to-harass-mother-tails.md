How To Harass Mother Tails
--------------------------
You are the mango of my muzzled mouth. It is a tale of dead shadows when the jungle is full of disordered toe  
outside trash barges and thirsty oily kiss  
and the burned-out angels and the bird feathers  
at last give forth their motionless complaint.  
In my night at sunrise you are like a soul  
and your form and colour the way I form them.  
We open the halves of a mysteries and  
the  
coagulating of lonely roads blossoms into the sweet-smelling archipeligos.  
Nothing but that friendship of lakes.  
The reasons for my respect  
are heard in my hips of diamond.  
In my archipeligos at sunrise you are like a silence  
and your form and colour the way I breathe them.  
  
In my sea at late afternoon you are like a juice  
and your form and colour the way I discover them.  
To the iridescent color of the silicon eddy.  
Here I am, a slender hand buried in the moonlight evening of telegraph.  
Your foot re-covers from west to north
