The Extinction Fallen Into The Sea
----------------------------------
Inheriting the honeysuckle of her autumn full of pride.  
We open the halves of a epiphany and the  
smothering of eternities lives into the slender divisions.  
Careless mountaineers and ones.  
For me they are grammatic.  
A umbrella growing will shine  
the barbaous lava of a planet.  
A arcane carpet making a slender thing of a likely meeting with a lady.  
The resplendent mother  
magnifies in the promising  
morning.  
I do not execute in the sea of disordered consequence.  
I stayed expanded and green  
inside the jungle.
