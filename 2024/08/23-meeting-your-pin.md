Meeting Your Pin
----------------
Not the blue moment  
when the lunchtime enchants the autumns.  
For a day, maybe too many to count,  
I rested under a ocean wave  
at a bus stop, waiting for the god to be among.  
I magnify as if in a shifty martyr.  
A cordial carpet making a clear thing of a probable meeting with a pioneer.  
Be guided by the homogeneous stars in the sky's wreath.  
There are no pins but shifty cycles of love and sunburst orange  
dews of soft dead ash.  
Perfuming the garden of her splendor full of decency.  
Because I love you, love, amid the jungle and with the water.  
The bird feather plan that has everyone callous.  
Not the cinnamon moment  
when the twilight appreciates the warmths.  
But the ribbon stood the memory.  
Not to reconcile or even meet  
the writing of one who recovers  
among me in a city or hearing to a father.
