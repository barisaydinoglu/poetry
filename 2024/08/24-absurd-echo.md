Absurd Echo
-----------
For autumn was boney and morally negative.  
Cluster was no longer above the recording threshold.  
There are no vaginas but violenet cycles of maternity and sepia  
friendships of cordial distorted steel.  
To seek another land has the vicinity been perfumed with epiphany?  
Your juice is a curtain filled with brutal peace.  
A metaphor for phenomenon is the lack thereof.  
What seems simultaneous to one  
will not seem so to another.  
The pioneer smiles at the uncle  
but the child does not smile  
when he looks at the ostrich fisherman  
and the distorted ocean.  
For a day, maybe too many to count,  
I rested under a tornado  
at a bus stop, waiting for the astronaut to be among.  
Halfway.  
Here I am, a verdure ears congealed in the city of old warrior's medal.  
  
A ship is not enough to puncture me and keep me  
from the field of your promising epiphany.  
The great laminated sign gave it joy.  
Of your red leaf when you hold out your heart.  
A opaque dark and blood-stained wreath is fell in the room.
