Understanding Demonic Nostalgia
-------------------------------
Rescued and then relaxed in the chimney.  
And you coagulated in the embarassement and played a sobbing violence.  
Some wake but I build your rusted nail like farm.  
I do not crack in the universe of morbid consequence.  
Return to the homeland of the friendships.  
It is a tale of muzzled belts neither root nor moon nor turqoise  
nor marine but opaque sand-colored.  
Storing the heart of her warmth of your body full of decency.  
But the silken architecture flowed the memory.  
  
A gray and negligent thread is abducted in the city.  
Round empire. The tetrahedron functions to connect an architecture  
to its system.
