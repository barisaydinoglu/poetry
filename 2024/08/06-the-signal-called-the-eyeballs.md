The Signal Called The Eyeballs
------------------------------
What is this computer but a memory erupted of its circuss? Among the barbaous moonlight evening of fragmented leaf.  
It is a tale of demonic bones recovering the prize of her burnt umber car full of happiness.  
With its difficult dawn nobody here is waiting for the next sphere.  
Muscle. You set yourself for perching.  
There are no cubicles but rigid cycles of fellowship and burnt umber  
movies of romantic hairy metal.
