A Song Of Agony
---------------
Come with me to the dominion of convicts.  
In sepia water and sand-colored manes.  
You flutter slowly into a field to love your business.  
Lunar was no longer below the transmission threshold.  
An odor has crystallized in the middle of the soul,  
a mixture of ash and body, a making  
splendor that brings confusion.  
What we say travels to  
travel some other daughter  
what a computer may teach.  
The nocturnal serenity gave it pride.
