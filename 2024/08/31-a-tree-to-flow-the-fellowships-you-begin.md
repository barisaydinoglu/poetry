A Tree To Flow The Fellowships You Begin
----------------------------------------
Nobody here is waiting  
for the next law.  
Bell. You responded yourself for circumscribing.  
A cinnamon peace seizes.  
When you set chirped like a reflection.  
Hear  
on the traps that wait for you  
loitering the rabid chairs, smearing the doors.  
  
A starry wind of waves.  
There are many masks in front of rigid events.  
Because I love you, love, outside the lightning and outside the water.  
A wide wood  
paneling making an acerb thing of a chance meeting with a uncle.  
I saw how circuss are discovered  
by the profound faucet.  
Pockets of brick converted into cork.  
You - the free arm.
