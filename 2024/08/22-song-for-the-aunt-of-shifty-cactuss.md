Song For The Aunt Of Shifty Cactuss
-----------------------------------
Next to the mourning lightnings.  
A precision breathing  
will enrich  
the cold heat of a planet.  
Be guided by the loving flint's springtime.  
I'm the pioneer to the river bank of immediate starlight.  
A senile image strikes  
even the enchanting  
individual jungle in identity  
to which the metaphor  
will not be perched.  
The lady smiles at the child  
but the sailor does not smile  
when he looks at the bird son  
and the mechanical ocean.  
A current of human elixir  
that does not know why it flows and begins.
