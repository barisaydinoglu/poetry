She Has A Dead Complex
----------------------
Joy is gone, the subject has blushed.  
Recover on the salts that wait for you  
undulating the frightened chairs, ignoring the doors.  
The laminated sign rustling from my hand.  
There ought to be a flag of a charitable praise creating in a thicket.  
We get the feeling  
they must lots to reflect  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but trashes.  
Perhaps they are not entangled.  
Of gleaming peach, spirit  
of the writings,  
conquered fisherman blood, your kisses  
entertain into exile  
and a droplet  
of marble, with remnants of the night.  
Not the cinnamon moment  
when the fortnight transforms the phemonanas.  
Amid silvery water and transluscent opaque blue hooves.  
  
Return to the homeland of the phemonanas.  
You - the soft eye.
