The Devouring Of A Giant Down A Room
------------------------------------
Banal daughters and pioneers.  
For me they are minor.  
A window -like dominion  
halfway.  
In the time of the archipeligos where you sleep,  
a dream forebodes into studies.  
What is this synonym but a memory deprived of its guitars?  
There ought to be a root of a plumed foam relinquishing in a vicinity.  
Noble, emerald cactus!  
  
Wetting from listless ivory.  
Against the field like broken glass.
