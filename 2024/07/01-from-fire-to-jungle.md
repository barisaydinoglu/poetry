From Fire To Jungle
-------------------
A bicycle is not enough to filter me and keep me  
from the city of your winged funny things.  
And next to my hammock, during the early  
light of day, I woke up naked  
and full of wonder.  
I took on thirsty fleshes.  
And meetings of lashed hand and curtains and silvery cars.  
A loaf of bread baked with wounded sincerity and salt.  
You see brain as blazing as the thunder.  
Multitude of rituals!  
In and out of the sand-colored the marine and the burnt umber
