Every Daughter Is A Sequence
----------------------------
A loaf of bread baked with arrogant pride and salt.  
In your arm of illusion the boulevard of mosaics grow.  
What is this metaphor but a memory harassed of its elixirs?  
The distorted flesh that weaves in your evening star.  
  
The morning ripples you in its mortal heat.
