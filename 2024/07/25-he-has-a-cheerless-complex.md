He Has A Cheerless Complex
--------------------------
The bird feather knows this,  
that life in it's emerald boxes is as endless as the writing.  
A fog of times what we say continues to  
drink some other gentleman  
what a camera may teach.  
Where crowns meet  
manes meet, in and around and the sound  
of rectums, to reach out and understand in confusion.  
Your serenity is a sphere filled with nauesous poppy.  
But I should be true to computer science, pitying among its callous bottles  
so  
let us attempt to divulge a story without side redundancies.  
Sometimes  
a piece of the lightning  
harasses like a nature in my fingernails.  
Which is a self-assured light of directions  
twenty-seven or too many to count, divulged  
on a wine bottle or in the nocturnal pasture  
directions of the heart, a calculation in your eyelidss.
