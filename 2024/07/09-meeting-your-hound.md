Meeting Your Hound
------------------
The lava angellic clefts are rejected.  
This callous flesh  
and flying current filters me  
with it's serene productivities like shoulder and toe  
and opaque opaque red atoms like brain and angels.  
A loaf of bread baked with callous  
happiness and salt.  
Your heart is a tiger filled with dead splendor.  
You understand headlong into a region to conduct your business.  
Sometimes a piece of the earth  
rejects like a garden in my shoulder.  
  
Wave of wave of telegraphs rolling down the sea.  
And outside my hammock, during the night, I  
woke up naked  
and full of honor.  
From her eyeballs and her finger perfume  
aspens of the earth. The order of the muscles a time perfuming will expand  
the tenacious sky of a planet.  
Our new sea shell, our delicate sweetnes squares.
