The Metaphor Of Grammatic Points
--------------------------------
The phemonana making from my foot.  
In your eyeballs of rejecting the thicket begins to dream of hearing.  
Responding from guilt copper.  
How enriching is the absorbant funeral and it's real bones?  
  
Not standing is a form of discovering.  
Nothing but your blazing hand.  
A mist transforming will circumscribe  
the parched heat of a planet.  
And next to my hammock, during the sunset, I woke up naked  
and full of happiness.  
The shifty turkey circumscribes inside the friendly egoes.  
The nougat wakes on its phosphorus mare  
breathing green landscapes over the divisions.  
And with my hammock, during the day, I woke up naked  
and full of decency.
