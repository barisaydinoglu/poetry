A Banana
--------
You set in the night as in a lyrical field.  
Pure hole divulges the guitars our new peace, our myriad laminated sign triangles.  
In the first take, the lyrical goddess  
is died by a fisherman. In the second  
scene he returns, to blossom and to understand.  
Here I am, a blazing eye deceived in the modern office of juice.
