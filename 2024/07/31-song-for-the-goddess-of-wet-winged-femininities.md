Song For The Goddess Of Wet-winged Femininities
-----------------------------------------------
Of verdure nectarine, spirit  
of the hearts,  
hated person blood, your kisses  
respond into exile  
and a droplet of ceramic, with remnants of the thicket.  
I stayed carried and silvery  
inside the sea.  
The lightning loves on its smothered mare  
breathing yellow sea's skins over the city.  
A heart relaxing will trust  
the dead sky of a planet.
