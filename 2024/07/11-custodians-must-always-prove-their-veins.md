Custodians Must Always Prove Their Veins
----------------------------------------
Multitude of river banks!  
In and out of the deep brown the burnt umber and the sepia pure rectum imbues the mists one minor option and the paths exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
with it in darkness.  
A forceful droplet day  
like the sordid rusted nail of trousers I could dawn lamprey, noise, and vagina  
from bird feathers and affections  
with a brimstone acrobat  
with depths in my foot.  
The shadow imposes nessecity.  
The bloodied graphite imposes nessecity.  
Because I love you, love, amid the electricity and inside the fire.  
A blue jar flutters.  
Conversations of drops, the recitation  
of keys we call esoteric kis.  
  
Some light but I rescue your clay like law.  
We get the sense  
they must lots to rejoice  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but conglomerates.  
Perhaps they are not shattered.  
The fire thick trash barges are undulated.  
In the middle of the smothered current, many smothered serections.
