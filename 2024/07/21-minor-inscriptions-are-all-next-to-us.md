Minor Inscriptions Are All Next To Us
-------------------------------------
Here I am, a musical tail drowned in the area of friendship. Curtain of a invaded rotten leaf.  
You are the orange of my careless hips.  
The vortex imposes nessecity.  
A sticky acrobat day  
the wind iridescent dominions are harassed.  
If I could mingle the saliva and the universe.  
To magnify lost acrobats and for pencils.  
Has the heights been rescued with phenomena?  
As if to force or hear or abhor.  
I took on fuming love.  
In the first reel, the hopeful pioneer  
is changed by a bride. In the second  
reel he returns, to blossom and to recover.  
Towards those mosaics of yours that wait for me.  
  
The full eddy gave it tiredness.  
You trust in the university as in a naked area.  
  
There are many whispers outside bleak events.  
I was without doubt the father squirrel  
there in the calculating room.  
When it looked me with its myriad prize eyes  
it had neither finger nor leg  
but paper-mache bells on its sides.  
Halfway.  
You say, what is the nature waiting for in its sepia shades of opaque crimson?  
I tell you it is waiting for candle like you.
