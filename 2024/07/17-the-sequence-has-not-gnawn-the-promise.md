The Sequence Has Not Gnawn The Promise
--------------------------------------
You play in the sea as in an affluent universe.  
Like the pale ash of wheatfields to the eloquent somber thread our new perfume, our serendipidous candle loops.  
  
Wake on the shortcuts that wait for you  
shattering the obscene chairs, mourning the doors.  
Full stop.  
  
The fleeting dignity of the mosaic!
