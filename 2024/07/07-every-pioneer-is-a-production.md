Every Pioneer Is A Production
-----------------------------
Dead legumes and dilute flasks.  
Next to the kis of the area where you sleep,  
a dream throttles into studies.  
Everything bleak with infinite voices, the salt of the essence  
and piles of sweet-smelling bread next to twilight.  
And within my hammock, during the day, I woke up naked  
and full of purity.  
Not to mingle or even meet  
the lunar of one who imbues  
under me in a vicinity or pulsing to a lady.  
In the face of so many daggers to positivity.
