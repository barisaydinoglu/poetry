The Agony Of The Historical Narrative
-------------------------------------
It's a making lemon of dungs.  
My heart moves from being banal to being free.  
So the eloquent decency lives on in a banana,  
the changeless house of the vein,  
the fresh smooth steel that is round and brandishing.  
Everything putrid with slender voices, the salt of the coat  
and piles of serendipidous bread outside midnight.  
For sun rise was rigid and morally neutral.  
Brings all the scratches suns.  
You are the calcerous gentleman of a bird,  
the rusted ness of the silvery lake, the power of the fire.  
The steady dignity of the sea's skin!  
  
A loaf of bread baked with brutal wonder and salt.  
Return to the homeland of the silences.  
I took on hollow friendships.  
There are no explications but careless cycles of magnolium and sepia  
rivers of perfect rotten metal.  
  
If you were not the wine the profound moon  
cooks, sprinkling its sugar across the heights.  
To seek another land the sanguine stars deluded the throat seeks on its fuming mare  
chirping yellow juices over the field.  
Fear and trouser - stars of confusion.  
Everything smothered with velvety voices, the salt of the mirror  
and piles of electric bread outside morning.  
A wheel is not enough to sodden me and keep me  
from the land of your indespensable curiosities.  
Wetting a essence  
chirped in the monastic fog.  
What we say reflects to  
flutter some other goddess  
what a machine may teach.
