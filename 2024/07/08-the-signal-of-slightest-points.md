The Signal Of Slightest Points
------------------------------
Illusion and sun - hats of embarassement.  
Your mouth performs from east to west  
the phosphorus window that perfumes in your sun rise.  
Wave of wave of friendships rolling down the sea.  
A loaf of bread baked with rigid honor and salt.  
Copper architecture of an attacked violenet starry sky.  
  
Coffins of a tear stained wheel  
magnifying among the modern office within a tremulous vessel,  
verdure as a chaotic elephant.  
A sticky farm day  
there are no clocks but sordid cycles of serendipity and opaque marine  
drops of stationary calculating ash.
