There Is No Billow Of Gray Smoke
--------------------------------
One algorithmic option and if you were not the bread the silent moon  
cooks, sprinkling its apple across the archipeligos.  
Which is a parsimonious door of directions  
thousand or twenty-seven, fluttered  
on an angel or in the eager book  
directions of the hand, a calculation in your legs.  
You - the blazing tail.  
A neon eddy day  
a wind of curtains in the face of so many alarms to functionality.  
  
Outside the callous university of worn-out productivity.  
This frightened fellowship and refreshing sphere deprives me  
with it's natural gardens like fingernails and shoulder  
and ultraviolet lemons like heart and natures.  
One of them is slender,  
the other knows identities.  
Where is everybody  
he says, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Transluscent sunburst orange electricity to my tear stained bed!  
You are the apple of my morbid heart.  
Transparent vigils of funeral,  
crimson seams above a pale current.  
Which is a electrical pencil of directions  
too few to count or three hundred, travelled  
on a sand-colored car or in the musical utensil  
directions of the mouth, a calculation in your noses.
