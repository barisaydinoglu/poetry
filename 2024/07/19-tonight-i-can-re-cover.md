Tonight I Can Re-cover
----------------------
I took on mourning ribbons.  
On what rigid roosters recovered with mud?  
  
Come with me to the coffin of utensils.  
I am devoured by love and invasion, by receptacle and thunder.  
Not divulging is a form of appreciating.  
They are all gentlemen  
professional belts in whose gleaming fragrances of strawberry originate.  
You've asked me what the bird is developing there with his opaque marine fingernails?  
I reply, the praise knows this.  
In front of the springtime of the boulevard where you sleep,  
a dream smears into identities.  
Pockets of steel converted into  
saphire.  
Realized romantic hat an odor has blushed under the ripple,  
a mixture of grave and body, a continuing  
thread that brings confusion.
