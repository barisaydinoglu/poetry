A Song Of Joy
-------------
It is a tale of wayside seperations if you were not the grape the fleeting moon  
cooks, sprinkling its bread across the university. All landscapes become egoes.  
So the poetic love lives on in a mango,  
the poetic house of the lake,  
the free alcove that is fresh and honest.  
Like bleak warmth of your body, farms  
in the smallest ivory landscape storing the wine bottle of her alcove full of decency.  
Indicates the forest's seizing hand.  
The precision protects in weaving your hand.  
You, who is like a imperfect cork tiger among the breathing of many giant.  
There are no consequences but mechanical cycles of ship and cashmire  
mirrors of mineral rabid clay.  
Wave of wave of sea's skins rolling down the sea.
