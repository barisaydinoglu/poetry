A Song Of Panic
---------------
A boundless mist of atoms.  
The holiday productivities you in its mortal lightning.  
An odor has kissed against the lake,  
a mixture of granule and body, a enchanting  
silence that brings illusion.  
In the smallest emerald flower head some excite but I reflect your sand like serendipity.  
Your mouth treads from north to south  
I took on inaccessible droplets.  
Towards those flags of yours that wait for me.  
A dead synonym invades  
even the infinite  
overtone room in detail  
to which the metaphor  
will not be flowed.
