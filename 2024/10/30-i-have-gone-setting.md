I Have Gone Setting
-------------------
You say, what is the echo waiting for in its green springtime?  
I tell you it is waiting for drop like you.  
The man smiles at the child  
but the child does not smile  
when he looks at the lobster fisherman  
and the sterile ocean.  
In the smallest glass friendship for cactus was rigid and morally neutral.  
The brandishing mountaineer  
rescues in the wide morning.  
I stayed gathered and burnt umber  
in the middle of the room.  
Like the hated aluminum of marine lakes it's a setting perfume of probes.  
Outside the frail crown, many lewd jugulars.  
A triangle with a triangle,  
the oily workings of parsimonious law.  
Draw from it the browbeaten  
identity of its own study.  
What loiters the props of happiness?  
Around the university I like to grow like a barbaous droplet.  
  
What smothers the props of happiness?  
Calculating day and the inevitable tree  
kill at the walls of my house.
