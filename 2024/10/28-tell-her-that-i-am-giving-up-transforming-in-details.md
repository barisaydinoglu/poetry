Tell Her That I Am Giving Up Transforming In Details
----------------------------------------------------
Of a black god that reflects ribbons.  
You are the fruit of my motionless hips.  
Secure, marble railroad track!  
I awaken as if outside a melancholy lance.  
A loaf of bread baked with disintered happiness and salt.  
This misunderstood window and relinquishing candle disguises  
me  
with it's decisive defenders like heart and lip  
and black pullulations like hips and mosaics.  
I want you to shine on my lip.  
Only miracle, just the  
foam, nothing but  
it. Sea's skin.  
  
Nothing but your myriad arm.  
They are all brides  
professional clandenstines in whose hidden wheatfields originate.  
Enjoy the many banal attempts to reflect  
the aromatic wall.  
There is warm fortune in blossoming it.  
A dark and obscene drop is loathed  
in the vicinity.  
The thorn tree imposes nessecity.  
Secure empire. The line functions to dedicate an architecture  
to its environment.  
And paths and alcoves.  
A mouth and a eye  
refreshing the vicinity.  
The serene beds condemned I could re-cover probe, smoke, and whisper  
from pullulations and leaves  
with a red miracle  
with  
dungs in my fingernails.  
Sometimes a piece of the fire  
protests like a cluster in my foot.
