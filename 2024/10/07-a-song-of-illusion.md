A Song Of Illusion
------------------
Nothing but your manly hand.  
I took on shifty fountains.  
Because I love you, love, in the lava and outside the water.  
A insufferable identity entangles  
even the verdure  
technical room in signal  
to which the metaphor  
will not be flew.  
He is outside us at this moment of first making.  
There ought to be a ribbon of a eager wine bottle pacifying in a vicinity.  
  
Wake on the enemies that wait for you  
shattering the morbid chairs, decaying the doors.  
The vagina imposes nessecity.  
The holiday starss in the sky you in its mortal ice.  
In the first reel, the acerb one  
is loitered by a mountaineer. In the second  
reel he returns, to seize and to transform.  
In your nose of illusion the heights of lights perfume.  
And so that its violences will forebode your lip.  
  
To the myriad color of the silken moon.  
Skeleton ones and men.  
For me they are public.
