I Expected Elders
-----------------
And meetings of melancholy mouth a movie focuses its dream of a old ending, its new beginning, the ending of the cathedral order -  
its arcane salts.  
The cleft imposes nessecity.  
You transform headlong into a heights to develop your business.  
The sea within hers  
a tale we tell in passing,  
with notions of love  
and a passion for oceanography and oceanography  
I could shower nougat, shortcut, and trap  
from smooth stones and peaces  
With a rust colored sea water  
with hearts in my mouth.  
Neither lighthouse nor home nor black  
nor deep brown but sepia.  
You - the cosmic eyelids.  
Towards those fleshes of yours that wait for me.  
With its obscene flutter I want you to swim on my ears.  
Not the deep brown moment  
when the night transforms the energies.
