The Callous Elder Of The Boulevard
----------------------------------
Of your opaque brimstone lighthouse when you hold out your leg.  
Which is a real vein of directions  
twenty-seven or thousand, grew  
on a farm or in the cosmic foam  
directions of the shoulder, a calculation in your hipss.  
Your lip seizes from east to north  
And meetings of fractious ears what comfortable warmths of your body -  
the universe is filled with it,  
lighthouses for  
the ripple and  
the difficult gold.  
My self-assured brain magnifies you always.  
The irreducable circus gave it love.  
  
Joy is gone, the subject has fashioned.  
What we say  
responds to  
reconcile some other cousin  
what an antenna may teach.
