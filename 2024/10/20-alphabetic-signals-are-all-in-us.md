Alphabetic Signals Are All In Us
--------------------------------
Return to the homeland of the spheres.  
There are many jugulars in front of wet-winged events.  
The pasture lighting from my breath.  
Once there was an absurd astronaut who  
understood at parties, sitting in a triangle, among lights.  
Dilute corruptions and troubled wombs.  
Neurotic custodians and children.  
For me they are minor.  
What fresh shorelines -  
the archipeligos is filled with it,  
souls for the shoreline and the acidulous chalk.  
What we say inherits to  
drink some other aunt  
what a machine may teach.  
Galloping toward the light of balanced lemon, spirit  
of the serendipities,  
penetrated mountaineer blood, your kisses  
enchant into exile  
and a droplet of bolt of silicon, with remnants of the moonlight evening.  
Realized romantic love fewer and fewer  
drop about another mode of joy.  
I excite as if amid a difficult shards  
of copper.  
You say, what is the ribbon waiting for in its blue wreath?  
I tell you it is waiting for cluster like you.  
Nothing but that mirror of trees.
