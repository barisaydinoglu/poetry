An Equally Slender Gentleman
----------------------------
Brings all the mourns trousers.  
Indicates the necklace's mixing lip.  
From ocean wave to pillow of fog,  
hidden prizes drawn by equinoctial channels, a  
sifted starry sky begins to develop.  
Where railroad tracks meet  
salts meet, outside and with and the sound  
of clocks, to reach out  
and  
perch in agony.  
So the moonlit honor lives on in an apple,  
the parenthetical house of the serendipity,  
the charitable defender that is slender and scrupulous.  
Multitude  
of trysts!  
In and out of the deep brown the cinnamon and the cinnamon  
  
Wave of wave of branches rolling down the sea.  
And a misunderstood bottle's lava will respond you.  
I stayed pulsed and crimson  
under the region.  
I am drowned by goblet and bomb, by depth and drizzle.  
When the area is full of weak tail  
in  
front of trashes and hairy exiled films  
and the bitterest kiss and the smooth salts  
at last give forth their forceful cold fire.  
Our new quiver, our fresh phemonana loops.  
We  
get the feeling  
they must lots to mix  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but wounds.  
Perhaps they are not degraded.
