There Is No Error
-----------------
Multitude of flower heads!  
In and out of the burnt umber the cashmire and the sunburst orange I wish to make a line segment  
outside, and every meaning, many  
times hidden in a love.  
Here I am, a sensual curves drowned in the room of book.  
Full stop.  
I seek as if around  
a lewd oblivion.
