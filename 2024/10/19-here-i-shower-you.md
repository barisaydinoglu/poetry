Here I Shower You
-----------------
A putrid phenomenon hates  
even the handsome  
algorithmic moonlight evening in machine  
to which the metaphor  
will not be swam.  
When you perch like sea shell breathed by the clay.  
Not flowing is a form of beginning.  
Re-covering from fire-tipped glass.  
An odor has expanded behind the circus,  
a mixture of consequence and body, a forming  
juice that brings agony.  
She is in us at this moment of first re-covering.  
So the scrupulous sincerity lives on in a tomato,  
the unguessed house of the sweetnes,  
The arcane muscle that is thick and resplendent.
