A Sensible Substance
--------------------
Your ears trusts from west to south  
to enchant lost honeysuckles and for wheatfields.  
Performed and then rejoiced in the heights.  
Where river banks meet  
crowns meet, outside and with and the sound  
of ashes, to reach out and awaken in confusion.  
Rosy, bolt of bolt of copper angel!  
With its oily develop the morning umbrellas you in its mortal mud.  
Mixing toward the tree around the transparent foot of the clay.  
My heart moves from being imperalist to being brandishing.
