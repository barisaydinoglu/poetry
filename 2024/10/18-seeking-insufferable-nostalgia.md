Seeking Insufferable Nostalgia
------------------------------
Around the moonlight evening I like to make like a wet-winged hoove.  
If you were not the grape the nocturnal moon  
cooks, sprinkling its plum across the region.  
I could appreciate error, corpse, and corruption  
from windows and pencils  
with a gray sea's skin  
with utensils in my leg.  
A deep brown cactus returns.  
Not to rejoice or even meet  
the elixir of one who gathers  
behind me in a city or rejoicing to a pioneer.  
A hairy sea's skin day  
of your brimstone hoove when you hold out your hips.  
Atrocious sunrise and the negligent reflection  
brainwash at the walls of my house.  
You are the grape of my acidulous leg.  
One of them is cosmic,  
the other knows details.  
Where is everybody  
she quips, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
You are the cherry of my worn-out finger.  
Come with me to the throat of beasts.  
Behind the thirsty echo, many banal oxides.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the lion hearted jars?  
And the fog smooth splattering its railroad tracks and mutating them full of  
universe and bird?  
Enjoy the many imperalist attempts to fly  
the solute rooster.  
There is fresh fortune in rescuing it.  
I want you to rustle on my fingernails.
