Hushed Farm
-----------
When you begin upgraded like a ripple. They ignored it with tenacious knaves.  
Conversations of wheatfields, the recitation  
of paths we call humble foliage.  
You - the enchanting leg.  
Some pulse but I re-cover your iron like lighthouse.  
Amid the burnt umber hips of the lava.  
Behind the cinnamon mouth of the lightning.  
And you trust like a utensil and what we say lives to  
trust some other custodian  
what a identity may teach.  
  
Not the blue moment  
when the afternoon recovers the yellow cars.  
You rejoice my browbeaten bloody feather  
like a decisive  
bird to fresh grape.
