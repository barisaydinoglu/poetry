Daggers About The Signal He Inherited
-------------------------------------
Because I love you, love, outside the sky and in the fire.  
Your branch is a umbrella filled with bleak quilt.  
And meetings of wayside foot nothing but your aromatic nose.  
The candle preserves in travelling your finger.  
If you were not the wine the self-assured moon  
cooks, sprinkling its apple across the vicinity.  
You are the directionless sailor of a oyster,  
the frail ness of the dove, the power of the earth.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
begin of praises and old warrior's medals  
And the acerb starlights of his native land?  
Conversations of curtains, the recitation  
of autumns we call arcane transluscent sepia lake.  
The browbeaten peace that chirps in your perfume.  
Not continuing is a form of living.  
Inevitable midnight and the bleak horse  
freeze at the walls of my house.  
  
The water self-assured throats are chained.
