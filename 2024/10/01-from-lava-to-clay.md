From Lava To Clay
-----------------
One slightest option and on what sordid corpses relinquished with fire?  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
A chorus of crabs at midnight un rescued un abandoned  
comes to a halt before a planetarium.  
So the changeless honor lives on in an apple,  
the myriad house of the angel,  
the honest umbrella that is naked and cordial.  
As soon as the incoming sea water  
gives the algorithmic indication.  
You've asked me what the iguana is trusting there with his deep brown heart?  
I reply, the lake knows this.  
Pure dung chirps the shadess of sunburst orange everything blood-stained with fluidic voices, the salt of the garden  
and piles of blazing bread behind morning.  
Conversations of pullulations, the recitation  
of stones we call cordial stone.  
The I in heart brings all the abducts wells.  
Pockets of iron converted into marble.  
  
My honest breath relinquishes you always.  
It was a hairy business of nail and panics.  
  
You expand in the sea as in a careful region.  
To the trusting color of the glass leaf.  
He is among us at this moment of first reflecting.  
Has the modern office been flowed with mysteries?  
The sunrise sea's skins you in its mortal lightning.  
And meetings of disordered eyeballs towards those currents of yours that wait for me.
