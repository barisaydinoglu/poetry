A Celestial Substance
---------------------
It is a tale of tear stained legless horses the I in lunar your breath awakens from south to north  
how standing is the charitable flask and it's romantic bombs?  
A study gallops,  
conquers - it does not return.  
To the boundless color of the cedar book.  
The I in ship noone here is waiting for the next wheatfield.  
Guitar. You mingled yourself for perching.  
Time.  
From unrelenting rain to ocean wave,  
hidden souls drawn by thick channels, a  
shady muscle begins to drink.  
Cashmire lava to my explosive bell!  
  
Once there was a disintered child who  
fluttered at parties, sitting in a triangle, among flutes.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
Morose weather, bitter lights like the flag.  
Not the crimson moment  
when the fortnight pacifies the atoms.  
A wind of doves the field amid hers  
a history we tell in passing,  
with notions of decency  
and a passion for mountaineering and oceanography  
the field in front of hers  
a story we divulge  
in passing,  
with notions of happiness  
and a passion for computer science and jouranlism  
of a dark aunt that dedicates salts.  
Indicates the dew's carrying breath.  
The ironous flag that fashions in your faucet.  
Because I love you, love, within the ice and among the ice.  
I rejoice as if next to a exiled shortcut.
