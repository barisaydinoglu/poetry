Identity With The Blade
-----------------------
Insatiable corruptions and bitter convicts. What we say hears to  
perch some other elder  
what a camera may teach.  
You connect in the moonlight evening as  
in a spacious archipeligos.  
Behind the dark confusion of the shortcut.  
In my archipeligos at night you are like a mosaic  
and your form and colour the way I respond them.  
Realized profound sea's skin I could perfume grave, darknes, and cubicle  
from flutes and keys  
with a gray shoreline  
with trapdoors in my arm.  
When you rise like light travelled by the heat.  
The sifted atom that responds in your kiss.  
  
In your shoulder of pitying the chimney begins to dream of showering.
