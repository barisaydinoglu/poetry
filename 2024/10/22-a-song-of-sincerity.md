A Song Of Sincerity
-------------------
The troubled silence is fluidic on your heart.  
The stars in the sky plan that has everyone delirious.  
In my divisions at morning you are like a thread  
and your form and colour the way I dedicate them.  
Multitude of forms!  
In and out of the blue the sepia and the yellow
