I Have Gone Killing
-------------------
Inside the umbrella of the city where you sleep,  
a dream smears into phenomena.  
It was a bitter business of dominion and  
egoes.  
If I could awaken the smoke and the heights.  
Draw from it the cold  
metaphor of its own synonym.  
Return to the homeland of the writings. You, who is like a serection crab among the lighting of many lady.  
In the smallest emerald flint when the archipeligos is full of ironous breath  
next to jackals and cold mourning flags  
and the obscene foliages and the laws  
at last give forth their tear stained cleft.
