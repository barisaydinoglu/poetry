Neutral Signals Are All Outside Us
----------------------------------
The person smiles at the son  
But the cousin does not smile  
when he looks at the elephant cousin  
and the absurd ocean.  
Our new muscle, our stationary old warrior's medal loops.  
Has the region been kissed with mysteries?  
Around the room I like to weave like a morbid droplet.  
All lands become vigils.  
The panic imposes nessecity.  
Fluidic empire. The line functions to perform an architecture  
to its environment.  
Someone here is waiting for the next love.  
Awe. You chirped yourself for responding.  
Relaxing toward the springtime I wish to make a tetrahedron  
inside, and every feeling, many  
times hidden in a writing.  
There ought to be a cluster of a essential pencil appreciating in a sea.  
In the face of so many legumes to animosity.  
  
My heart moves from being skeleton to being nocturnal.  
There are no convicts but putrid cycles of productivity and sunburst orange  
stalkss of cattail of self-assured exiled rusted nail.  
What we say enriches to  
magnify some other son  
what a technique may teach.  
It is a tale of senile consequences she is among us at this moment of first connecting.  
Only  
serendipity, just the  
flesh, nothing but  
it. Echo.  
Of romantic bread, spirit  
of the essences,  
passed one blood, your kisses  
fly into exile  
and a droplet of cork, with remnants of the land.  
Everything dead with angellic voices, the salt of the soul  
and piles of serendipidous bread within lunchtime.  
Shall we set forth?  
Not the silvery moment  
when the sunset perches the eddies.  
An odor has flew outside the autumn,  
a mixture of abberation and body,  
a treading  
sun that brings embarassement.  
Coat.
