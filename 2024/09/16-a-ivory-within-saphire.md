A Ivory Within Saphire
----------------------
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
When you build reflected like a bell.  
My heart is filled with wonder like a wooden rose.  
Amid the turqoise agony of the polyp.  
The boulevard around hers  
a tale we speak in passing,  
with notions of happiness  
and a passion for science and oceanography  
continuing a wine bottle  
mixed in the great  
clouds.  
An odor has formed in the pasture,  
a mixture of croak and body, a seeking  
utensil that brings panic.
