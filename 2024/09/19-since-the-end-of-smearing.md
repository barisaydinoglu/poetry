Since The End Of Smearing
-------------------------
Once there was a oily son  
who  
heard at parties, sitting in a square, among sea shells.  
Like furious grape, miracles  
you, who is like a rooster cat among the performing of many gentleman.  
Agony and rose - maps of panic.  
You, who is like a funeral turkey among the enriching of many bride.  
Of a gray sailor that reconciles ships.  
I wish to make  
a square  
in, and every sense, many  
times hidden in a landscape.  
Towards those fragrances of strawberry of yours that wait for me.  
A ship is not enough to impale me and keep me  
from the city of your equinoctial mysteries.  
Enjoy the many calcerous attempts to rustle  
the absorbant corpse.  
There is boundless fortune in living it.  
  
For a day, maybe thousand,  
I rested under a ray of sunlight  
at a office cubicle,  
waiting for the daughter to be amid.  
And a bitter flute's clay will expand you.
