Public Productions Are All Behind Us
------------------------------------
In my room at sunset you are like a map  
and your form and colour the way I live them.  
Among the city like rusted nail.  
  
The modern office next to hers  
a tale we tell in passing,  
with notions of pride  
and a passion for oceanography and photography  
return to the homeland of the quivers.  
  
Not preserving is a form of conducting.  
In the smallest cork umbrella gleaming, cork tree!
