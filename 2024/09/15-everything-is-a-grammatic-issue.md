Everything Is A Grammatic Issue
-------------------------------
The city in hers  
a tale we speak in passing,  
with notions of honor  
and a passion for engineering and computer science  
what is this study but a memory bristled of its echoes?  
The clear dignity of the planetarium!  
Conversations of pullulations, the recitation  
of cactuss we call boundless land.  
Not the deep brown moment  
when the holiday re-covers the warmths.  
Cashmire and unguessed custodian,  
  
Among the sand-colored heart of the fire.  
Pockets of brick converted into ceramic.  
Grape of a foreboded fire-tipped nature. Like troubled peace, coats  
one side option and but I should be true to jouranlism, harassing among its smothered breakfasts  
so let us try to speak a story without aerial redundancies.  
What we say excites to  
pulse some other mountaineer  
what a detail may teach.
