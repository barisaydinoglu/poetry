I Expected Fathers
------------------
Not the yellow moment  
when the day chirps the wheatfields.  
We open the halves of a epiphany and the  
passing of conspirators rustles into the loving city.  
The midnight love you in its mortal ice.  
Within the black confusion of the martyr.  
There are no clandenstines but tremulous cycles of magnolium and cashmire  
warmths of your body of round oily iron. Springtime of a mutated wayside pencil.  
When you magnify like elixir enriched by the fire.  
It gathers like a mosaic with the mosaic.  
The absorbant man  
wets in the noble morning.  
A rust colored and neurotic hoove is fainted in the heights.  
I want you to conduct on my ears.  
Of incredulous grape, spirit  
of the natures,  
bristled sailor blood, your kisses  
dedicate into exile  
and a droplet of silken, with remnants of the area.
