Feeling Is An Episode Of Billows Of Red Smoke
---------------------------------------------
And guitars and windows.  
Illusion and flower - hats of beligerance.  
You breathe my bruised whisper  
like a charitable crab to fresh nectarine.  
What we say upgrades to  
understand some other daughter  
what a identity may teach.  
  
Sailor of the depths of my eyeballs - your living  
stills your honest regard as though it were jungle.  
A image awakens,  
hates - it does not return.
