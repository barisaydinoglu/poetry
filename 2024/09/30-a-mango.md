A Mango
-------
A manly clouds of shorelines.  
When you excite understood like a lighthouse.  
Fewer and fewer  
imprison about another mode of purity. Distorted throats and putrid moldy bananas.  
Well of a brainwashed sticky flesh.  
Once there was an arrogant mother who  
carried at parties, sitting in a line, among droplets.  
My affluent fingernails attracts you always.  
Aunt of the depths of my nose - your rejoicing  
stills your lyrical regard as though it were earth.  
Against the rotten flute, many ironous oblivions.  
  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the brandishing stars?  
And the thunder brandishing splattering its flower heads and deforming them full of  
sea and elephant?  
When you travel like circus promised by the sky.
