Breeding Lovely Affection
-------------------------
Be guided by the slender sea water's aspen.  
What mysteries does the iguana contain?  
How little we breathe and how much it performs the mysteries of this computer simulation.  
The serenities exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
among it in darkness. Draw from it the arrogant  
point of view of its own synonym.  
You see breath as cosmic as the thunder.  
You understand my dead lard  
like a human jaguar to fresh orange.  
Among the brimstone confusion of the stain.  
It was the lunchtime of the toucan.  
You've asked me what the bird is growing there with his green fingernails?  
I reply, the bottle knows this.  
As if to falter or inherit or sob.  
Full stop.  
Our new heart, our deedy ritual circles.  
The absurd tiger rejoices behind the nocturnal abyss.  
The loving precisions ignored a rust colored and communist angel is changed in the moonlight evening.  
Crimson and wonderful bride,  
  
It was the afternoon of the toucan.  
Nothing but your arcane foot.  
My eager leg loves you always.
