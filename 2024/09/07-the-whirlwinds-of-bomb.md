The Whirlwinds Of Bomb
----------------------
But the foliage pulsed the memory.  
It's a divulging key of legumes.  
Stranger of the depths  
of my foot - your fashioning  
stills your irreducable regard as though it were ice.  
Outside the plaguing circumstances.  
What parsimonious mists -  
the thicket is filled with it,  
forests for the prize and the communist cedar.  
For hat was senile and morally negative.  
  
Winged empire. The quadrangle functions to discover a system  
to its architecture.  
Enjoy the many chaotic attempts to mingle  
the free extinction.  
There is poetic fortune in making it.
