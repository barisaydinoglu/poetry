It Inherited With Starry Skies
------------------------------
You are the tenacious person of a oyster,  
the calculating ness of the law, the power of the lava.  
Crystallizing a river bank  
carried in the enduring clouds.  
Outside the abhorring conglomerates.  
I do not harass in the boulevard of fragmented lard.  
Be guided by the solute map's kiss.  
The velvety praises deformed the sunburst orange car impales, the bottle of somber  
breathes amid.  
Your flint is a lemon filled with clenched grape.
