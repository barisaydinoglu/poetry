A Silk Within Diamond
---------------------
Your wheatfield is a shades of crimson filled with bruised saxophone.  
You - the angellic ears.  
In your shoulder of beligerance the chimney of pencils recover.  
To seek another land return to the homeland of the wheatfields.  
In the first scene, the smooth man  
is degraded by an astronaut. In the second  
reel he returns, to reconcile and to imbue.  
And you blossom like a nature and performing from ghostly fused quartz.  
Of a brimstone mountaineer that reflects manes.  
It was the lunchtime of the elephant.  
Like the insufferable iron of quilts what seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
It was the day of the squirrel.  
Not to dawn or even meet  
the sea's skin of one who perfumes  
behind me in a heights or rising to a stranger.  
Towards those magnoliums of yours that wait for me.  
But I should be untrue to jouranlism, silencing among its pale graces  
so let us try to tell a story devoid of side redundancies.  
  
I'm the custodian to the phemonana of immediate peace.  
What is this antenna but a memory deprived of its crowns?
