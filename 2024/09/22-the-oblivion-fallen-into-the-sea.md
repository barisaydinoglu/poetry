The Oblivion Fallen Into The Sea
--------------------------------
A current of brandishing map  
that does not know why it flows and mingles.  
You stand in the archipeligos as in a handsome sea.  
To magnify lost serendipities and for salts.  
The reasons for my respect  
are appreciated in my ears of marble.  
The poppy knows this,  
that life in it's marble boxes is as endless as the hat.  
The cathedral rises in weaving your lip.  
To the somber color of the wooden tree.
