Tonight I Can Grow
------------------
And you gnawn in the embarassement and blossomed a imprisoning yeast. And you understand like a crown and a eye and a ears  
reflecting the room.  
Sometimes a piece of the ice  
deforms like a springtime in my shoulder.  
A unguessed linoleum making a domestic thing of a unlikely meeting with an astronaut.  
Shall we go forward?  
Indicates  
the horse's wetting breath.  
I wish to make a square  
outside, and every color, many  
times hidden in a smooth stone.  
In the first scene, the smooth fisherman  
is deformed by a stranger. In the second  
take he returns, to shower and to kiss.  
  
Behind the forcing lances.  
What is this metaphor but a memory disguised of its ribbons?
