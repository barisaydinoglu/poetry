Relaxing Phosphorus Nostalgia
-----------------------------
To the absent minded color of the wooden magnolium.  
My trusting hand divulges you always.  
A loaf of bread baked with burned-out sincerity and salt.  
All utensils become lightnings.  
A shifty time day  
to develop lost saxophones and for honeysuckles.  
Neither quiver nor evening star nor dull shades of deep brown  
nor cashmire but deep brown.  
This putrid dew and connecting autumn gnaws me  
with it's infinite bridges like brow and brow  
and rust colored bottles like eyelids and defenders.  
A parched praise day  
and you inherit like a drop and imperfect golds of a dry helicopter  
inheriting behind the vicinity in a forceful airplane,  
delicate as a hushed ostrich.  
My heart is filled with honor like a cork flint.  
Always you tremble through the fortnight  
toward the early light of day undulating sun rises.
