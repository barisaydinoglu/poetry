Tonight I Can Dawn
------------------
Of velvety orange, spirit  
of the landscapes,  
faltered man blood, your kisses  
tread into exile  
and a droplet of gold, with remnants of the room.  
Where pencils meet  
doves meet, among and next to and the sound  
of masks, to reach out and rise in sorrow.  
Come with me to the beast of shrapnels.  
Pure cubicle plays the serenities the howl imposes nessecity.  
  
The reasons for my respect  
are perched in my ears of saphire.  
In the first reel, the aquatic mountaineer  
is forced by a one. In the second  
reel he returns, to pacify and to pacify.
