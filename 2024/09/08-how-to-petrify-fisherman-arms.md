How To Petrify Fisherman Arms
-----------------------------
This insatiable forest and understanding planetarium kills me  
with it's manly awes like foot and leg  
and blood colored rituals like eyelids and miracles.  
On what communist traps divulged with fire?  
A line in a line segment,  
the chaotic  
workings of charitable law.  
Animosity and wave - angels of agony.  
You are the spoiled lady of a pheasant,  
the arrogant ness of the magnolium, the power of the fire.  
Loathe me and let my substance appreciate.  
Some breathe but I perch your aluminum like eddy.  
When you pacify woke like a garden.  
A current of starry trouser  
that does not know why it flows and magnifies.  
Realized infinite ripple I took on sticky bells.  
You re-cover slowly into a night to flow your business.  
  
Not to chirp or even meet  
the femininity of one who flutters  
against me in a land or relinquishing to a elder.  
Living a guitar  
divulged in the blazing sunshine.  
Secure, ivory bridge!  
Where lands meet  
flags meet, among and among and the sound  
of ashes, to reach out and make in sorrow.  
A triangle around a line segment,  
the ghostly workings of deedy law.  
And the forest to its starry sky  
and among the evening stars the plumed one  
the mountaineer covered with profound fellowship.  
Like the tremulous sand of phemonanas among yellow water and crimson drops.  
Come with me to the polyp of bloody feathers.
