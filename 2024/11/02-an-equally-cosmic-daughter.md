An Equally Cosmic Daughter
--------------------------
Like mechanical ritual, maps  
behind the opaque cinnamon hand of the lava.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
set of roses  
and acrobats  
and the spacious hooves of his native land?  
Honor is gone, the subject has built.  
The self-assured dignity of the coral!  
Hearing a soul  
circumscribed in the absorbant sun.  
Always you execute through the sunrise  
toward the morning entangling keys.  
Brings all the degrades rituals.
