Tell Them That I Am Giving Up Continuing In Productions
-------------------------------------------------------
In the first scene, the vertical child  
is pampered by an aunt. In the second  
take he returns, to respond and to play.  
Around opaque marine water and deep brown smooth salts.  
Around the thicket I like to trust like a listless ribbon.  
Towards those shorelines of yours that wait for me.  
The astronaut smiles at the pioneer  
but the child does not smile  
when he looks at the iguana god  
and the wet-winged ocean.  
An odor has galloped in the middle of the momentum,  
a mixture of wounded soldier and body, a building  
serendipity that brings animosity.
