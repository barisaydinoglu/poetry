Point Of View With The Cubicle
------------------------------
Indicates the fellowship's treading fingernails.  
Indicates the miracle's perfuming hips.  
Opaque green ice to my bleak necklace!  
Behind the acidulous jungle of shaken book.  
You magnify my fuming scandalmongering  
like a myriad cat to fresh grape.  
This calculating foliage and pacifying sun rise bristles me  
with it's unguessed horses like hand and mouth  
and brimstone ribbons like brain and juices.  
Happiness is gone, the subject has shone.  
  
Multitude of wine bottles!  
In and out of the sand-colored the yellow and the cinnamon  
here I am, a cordial toe struck in the archipeligos of coral.  
It fashions like a wreath in front of the marble architecture.  
Realized rosy grace your pencil is a tiger filled with tear stained foliage.  
A raft is not enough to protest me and keep me  
from the thicket of your wide funny things.  
A current of eager current  
that does not know why it flows and gathers.  
Carry me onto your airplane - the lemon of my mirror -  
  
I saw how stalkss of cattail are transformed  
by the essential mirror.  
But I should be untrue to mountaineering, puncturing among its ghostly energies  
so let us seek to speak a story without grammatic redundancies.
