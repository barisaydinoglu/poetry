I Have Gone Executing
---------------------
I salute your brandishing peach  
and envy your charitable pride.  
The delicious times pampered a technique for camera is the lack thereof.  
The reasons for my respect  
are began in my hips of marble.  
A wounded production sobs  
even the noble  
minor modern office in inscription  
to which the metaphor  
will not be developed.  
A finger and a tail  
treading the region.  
As if to ignore or pacify or invade.  
Nothing but that bird feather of kiss.  
You - the solute leg.  
Fewer and fewer  
brainwash about another mode of felicity.  
A loaf of bread baked with troubled felicity and salt.  
I took on fatherless productivities.  
And bottles and curtains.  
  
In your mouth of conquering the field begins to dream  
of lighting.  
Which is a pure law of directions  
thousand or million, loved  
on a knave or in the perfect quiver  
directions of the eye, a calculation  
in your breaths.  
  
Some transform but I shower your ash like kiss.  
For a day, maybe thousand,  
I rested under a pillow of fog  
at a bus stop, waiting for  
the elder  
to be with.
