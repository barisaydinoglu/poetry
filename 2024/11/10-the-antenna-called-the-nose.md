The Antenna Called The Nose
---------------------------
I was without doubt the custodian toucan  
there in the exiled night.  
When it looked me with its equinoctial autumn eyes  
it had neither eyelids nor brain  
but saphire waves on its sides. Come with me to the depth of explications.  
And the crown to its stalks of cattail  
and among the laminated signs the cleansed one  
the elder covered with celestial well.  
The knave carries in drinking your brow.  
And meetings of bleak finger a chorus of lobsters  
at twilight un  
carried un plagued  
comes to a halt before a faucet.  
Sticky early light of day and the chaotic lighthouse  
mutate at the walls of my  
house.  
When you relax awakened like a bottle.  
One of them is delicious,  
the other knows languages.  
Where is someone  
he quips, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
  
What balanced beds -  
the boulevard is filled with it,  
lemons for the sun rise and the wet-winged fused quartz.  
One overtone option and  
deceive me and let my substance crystallize.
