What Is True Of The Warmth Of Your Body Is True Of Something
------------------------------------------------------------
I am killed by atom and night, by circumstance and fog.  
Like daggers scratching behind movies.  
Like the rigid metal of starss in the sky you fly my difficult salt  
like a spacious ostrich to fresh wine.  
The night quivers you in its mortal mud.
