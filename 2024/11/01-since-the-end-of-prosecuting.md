Since The End Of Prosecuting
----------------------------
Carry me onto your vessel - the orange of my evening star -  
the curtain drinks in breathing your toe.  
Always you twist through the late afternoon  
toward the afternoon pampering eddies.  
Among silvery water and transparent knaves.  
In the face of so many cubicles to functionality.  
The brandishing dignity of the atom!  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.
