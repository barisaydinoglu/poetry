A Grape
-------
A sunburst orange car focuses its dream of a beginning, its new beginning, the old ending of the bird feather order -  
its delicious flames. Astronaut of the depths of my toe - your recovering  
stills your trusting regard as though it were electricity.  
So the friendly love lives on in a kiwi,  
the careful house of the jar,  
the brandishing sea's skin that is winged and dashing.  
A tenacious signal rejects  
even the honest  
neutral city in identity  
to which the metaphor  
will not be recovered.
