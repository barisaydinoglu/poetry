Somber Theories Of Precisions
-----------------------------
In the smallest glass river bank wave of wave of propellers rolling down the sea.  
Nothing but your rosy tail.  
There are many pigeon holes behind lashed events.  
It is a tale of dilute billowss of turqoise smoke nothing but your eager eyeballs.  
In front of transparent water and yellow umbrellas.  
Which is a fresh horse of directions  
too few to count or million, seized  
on a sea water or in the lion hearted pullulation  
directions of the eye, a calculation in your legs.  
Inside the delirious dew, many demonic abyss.  
Here I am, a somber brow compounded in the field of form.  
Full stop.  
Enchanting the sun rise of her curtain full of tiredness.  
I could  
begin blade, jackal, and havoc  
from schools and roots  
with a turqoise cedar architecture  
with probes in my heart.  
  
You've asked me what the squirrel is loving there with his blue tail?  
I reply, the light knows this.  
Petrify me and let my substance connect.  
Nothing but that energy of hearts.  
The parsimonious tiger gave it pride.  
The reasons for my respect  
are dawned in my eye of saphire.  
If I could grow the bomb and the boulevard.  
With its hushed entertain the horse entertains in transforming your curves.
