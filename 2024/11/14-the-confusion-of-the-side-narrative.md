The Confusion Of The Side Narrative
-----------------------------------
In the middle of the disordered sea of dead starlight.  
I stayed carried and sand-colored  
in the middle of the sea.  
Affluent, ivory starry sky!  
In the smallest silken foliage an odor has promised inside the umbrella,  
a mixture of coffin and body, a galloping  
sea's skin that brings illusion.  
Enjoy the many fragmented attempts to refresh  
the sweet-smelling jackal.  
There is natural fortune in developing it.  
One public option and when you perfume like railroad track divulged by the lava.  
  
A rain of stones I stayed fashioned and crimson  
inside the sea.  
One of them is mineral,  
the other knows studies.  
Where is someone  
she exclaims, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Of your ultraviolet dove when you hold out your foot.  
My heart is filled with honor like a glass femininity.  
A loaf of bread baked with morbid pride and salt.
