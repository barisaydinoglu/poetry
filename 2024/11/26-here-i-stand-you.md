Here I Stand You
----------------
Of mineral bread, spirit  
of the momenta,  
lunged stranger blood, your kisses  
flow into exile  
and a droplet of saphire, with remnants of the modern office.  
Your mouth shines from east to south  
draw from it the shady  
antenna of its own study.  
The movie mixing from my tail.  
Sorrow and moon - hooves of sorrow.  
Somebody here is waiting for the next awe.  
River. You travelled yourself for continuing.  
  
I wish to make a quadrangle  
in, and every color, many  
times hidden in a propeller.  
Like the troubled salt of dews in the first scene, the myriad one  
is cracked by a lady. In the second  
reel he returns, to relinquish and to drink.
