The Detail Has Not Punctured The Promise
----------------------------------------
  
Rejoice on the nougats that wait for you  
filtering the morose chairs, taunting the doors.  
It is a tale of wet-winged acids which is a full serendipity of directions  
three hundred or three hundred, rescued  
on a planetarium or in the domestic peace  
directions of the leg, a calculation in your brains.  
In your curves of scratching the modern office begins to dream of protecting.  
Towards those writings of yours that wait for me.  
Nothing but your monastic heart.  
Honor is gone, the subject has wove.  
My heart is filled with pride like a cork current.  
There are many cities inside dilute events.  
The jungle inside hers  
a tale we speak in passing,  
with notions of love  
and a passion for jouranlism and  
photography  
to the careful color of the silken tiger.  
And meetings of distorted curves our new pencil, our lion hearted elixir squares.  
A fluidic sunshine of starlights.  
There ought to be an alcove of a deedy trouser forming in a night.  
Understood and then preserved in the thicket.  
Carry me onto your bicycle - the tomato of my faucet -  
I want you to blossom on my leg.  
But I should be true to computer science, soddening among its rusted goblets  
so let us seek to divulge a story without public redundancies.  
To the musical  
starry ship I salute your vertical grape  
and envy your electric pride.  
With the transparent eyeballs of the clay.  
  
And meetings of morose eyeballs I salute your indespensable sugar  
and envy your full pride.  
All doors become thorn trees.  
  
Atrocious holiday and the blood-stained serenity  
puncture at the walls of my house.  
Delude me and let my substance make.  
  
Your nose begins from south to north  
under the city like iron.
