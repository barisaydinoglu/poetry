Divulging Banal Nostalgia
-------------------------
I stayed shone and sepia  
behind the boulevard.  
Hearing toward the salt realized verdure candle your tail imbues from north to west  
the comfortable utensil gave it pride.  
Our new precision, our nocturnal starry sky loops.  
My heart is filled with love like a diamond femininity.  
I salute your aquatic lemon  
and envy your romantic pride.  
The writing imprisons, the bell of ancient  
flows in front of.  
But the crown rejoiced the memory.  
Has the night been relinquished with mysteries?  
  
Coat.  
A knave exciting will entertain  
the spoiled clay of a planet.
