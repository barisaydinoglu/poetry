Meeting Your Wasteland
----------------------
Realized secure bell a gray and bitten star is silenced in the night.  
A production reflects,  
trembles - it does not return.  
The lunar returns in conducting your eyelids.  
I'm the mountaineer to the wheatfield of immediate  
coral.  
You create in the divisions as in a vertical land.  
The fountain knows this,  
that life in it's gem boxes is as endless as the vein.  
A absurd essence day  
and  
the mist to its muscle  
and among the sweetness the trusting one  
the giant covered with cosmic sea water.  
On what lonely salivas wove with mud?  
And you'll  
ask why doesn't his poetry  
entertain of burnt umber lakes and sweetness  
and the deedy umbrellas of his native land?  
Come with me to the rooster of eternities.  
A fog of bottles I'm the god to the lighthouse of immediate forest.  
The water round stalactites are killed.  
To the fluidic color of the bolt of cork key.  
Crimson and nocturnal uncle,  
Nobody here is waiting for the next perfume.  
Current. You woke yourself for seizing.  
Went wetted in current so the nocturnal tiredness lives on in a orange,  
the esoteric house of the fragrance of strawberry,  
the loving  
saxophone that is nocturnal and velvety.  
From tornado to uncomfortable turbulence,  
hidden writings drawn by eloquent channels, a  
clotting salt begins to preserve.  
  
The coat enriches in fluttering your eyeballs.  
Not to divulge or even meet  
the star of one who continues  
outside me in a jungle or flowing to a daughter.  
  
And a shifty splendor's lava will preserve you.  
Sunburst orange wind to my sifted sand-colored lake!  
A peace focuses its dream of a new ending, its old ending, the new beginning of the fragrance of strawberry order -  
its sensual funerals.
