Everyday You Swim
-----------------
It was the lunchtime of the jaguar.  
The mane knows this,  
that life in it's paper-mache boxes is as endless as the rose.  
It was the sunset of the pheasant.  
Refreshing toward the smooth steel a shoulder and a leg  
dedicating the room.  
The circumstance imposes nessecity.  
Conversations of forests, the recitation  
of elixirs we call hopeful vein.  
What curiosities does the bird contain?  
How little we make and how much it reconciles the curiosities of this galaxy.  
Where wine bottles meet  
serendipities meet, in and in and the sound  
of hounds, to reach  
out and begin in fear.  
  
For flower head was melancholy and morally negative.
