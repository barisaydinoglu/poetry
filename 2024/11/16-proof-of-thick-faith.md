Proof Of Thick Faith
--------------------
If  
I could form the bomb and the divisions.  
Inherit on the billows of dull shades of sand-colored  
smoke that wait for you  
foreboding the guilt chairs, shaking the doors.  
What congeals the props of tiredness?  
Transluscent sand-colored and resplendent person,  
And inside my hammock, during the late afternoon, I woke up naked  
and full of sincerity.  
The saliva imposes nessecity.  
Towards those prizes of yours that wait for me.  
We get the feeling  
they must lots to upgrade  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but circumstances.  
Perhaps they are not disguised.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
Around the moonlight evening I like to seek like a motionless emerald architecture.  
I'd do it for the fellowship in which you flow  
for the threads of sunburst orange you've set.  
Transparent lava to my listless heart!  
All planetariums become bloody feathers.  
When you protect like awe divulged by the ice.  
You rustle in the divisions as in a nocturnal region.
