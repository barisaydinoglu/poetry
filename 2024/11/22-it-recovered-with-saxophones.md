It Recovered With Saxophones
----------------------------
Some weave but I gallop your brick like path.  
There are no cities but hushed cycles of kiss and opaque blue  
warmths of your body of unguessed rambunctious brick.  
Full stop.  
When you create like pencil sought by the lava.  
And the home to its kiss  
and among the stalkss of cattail the dashing one  
the mother covered with spacious shades of silvery.  
Inside sunburst orange water and transluscent yellow acrobats.  
In the face of so many juices to positivity.  
We get  
the feeling  
they must lots to inherit  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing  
but noises.  
Perhaps they are not rejected.  
Return to the homeland of the serendipities.  
  
Has the chimney been galloped with phenomena?
