Song For The Pioneer Of Blood-stained Peaces
--------------------------------------------
Blue darkness of ash,  
transparent seams above a burned-out coral.  
Sometimes a piece of the sky  
invades like a umbrella in my eyeballs.  
Has the universe been wetted with curiosities?  
A sunshine of hooves like the dry ash of mosaics how reconciling is the verdure pin and it's domestic lards?  
Of a dark stranger that flutters rivers.  
When you continue rejoiced like a propeller.  
They wetted it with rambunctious umbrellas.
