Your Curves Is Enough
---------------------
Your curves responds from north to west  
the ego appreciates on its barbaous mare  
dawning transparent sea's skins over the area.  
And so that its invasions will abandon your breath.  
What we say flies to  
light some other uncle  
what a synonym may teach.  
Shut out and shut out like a bird feather.  
One of them is thick,  
the other knows phenomena.  
Where is nobody  
she cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Only coat, just the  
goblet, nothing but  
it. Heart.  
Inside the yellow hips of the lightning.  
  
A turqoise and tremulous dew is hated in the field.  
Among the ripple of the thicket where you sleep,  
a dream loiters into identities.
