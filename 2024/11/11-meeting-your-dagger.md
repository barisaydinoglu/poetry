Meeting Your Dagger
-------------------
Sometimes a piece of the lava  
dies like a ripple in my heart.  
And you trust like a breakfast and the molested essence that excites in your grape.  
In the smallest bolt of gem foliage neither dew nor precision nor dark  
nor transluscent green but yellow.  
I do not steal in the divisions of raucous shrapnel.  
You - the eloquent mouth.  
The cheerless ostrich blossoms against the pure moldy bananas.  
A current of aquatic serendipity  
that does not know why it flows and flies.
