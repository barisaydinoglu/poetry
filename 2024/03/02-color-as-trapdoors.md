Color As Trapdoors
------------------
A loaf of bread baked with careless tiredness and salt.  
Green and arcane son,  
A nature focuses its dream of a ending, its ending, the new ending of the mane order -  
its rosy explications.  
I saw how river banks are breathed  
by the thick serenity.  
  
The sunrise manes you in its mortal water.  
Animosity and snow - ripples of sorrow.
