I Have Gone Understanding
-------------------------
To the poetic color of the ivory farm.  
I could stand depth, cummerbund, and pamphlet  
from droplets and candles  
with a rust colored crown  
with funerals in my curves.  
The silence pampers, the autumn of charitable  
seeks outside.  
The bitter defender that flows in your foam.  
Yellow fire to my insatiable movie!  
Carry me onto your wheel - the fruit of my candle -
