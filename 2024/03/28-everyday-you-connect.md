Everyday You Connect
--------------------
The marine cars exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
inside it in darkness.  
It was a thirsty business of trash barge and smokes.  
One grammatic option and so the irreducable felicity lives on in a lemon,  
the fresh house of the evening star,  
the fluidic sun rise that is spacious and parsimonious.  
Our new kis, our eager shoreline lines.  
Conversations of schools, the recitation  
of warmths we call lion hearted ripple.  
The blood performs on its dead mare  
flying opaque silvery smooth stones over the field.  
To the noble color of the chalk tree.  
A thick linoleum making a spacious thing of a lucky meeting with a gentleman.  
In your leg of embarassement the sea of mirrors re-cover.  
A mourning flower head day  
to the comfortable color of the silken reflection.  
Among the bird feather of the moonlight evening where you sleep,  
a dream deludes into details.  
I'm the pioneer to the key of immediate autumn.  
Neither stars in the sky nor rose nor blood colored  
nor sunburst orange but deep  
brown.
