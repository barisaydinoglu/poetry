An Equally Electric Pioneer
---------------------------
The banner enriches in hearing your hand.  
A drizzle of knaves outside sand-colored water and opaque blue sweetness.  
So the wide love lives on in a lemon,  
the sensual house of the grace,  
the warm autumn  
that is clear and iridescent.  
This absurd dove and imbuing mosaic executes me  
with  
it's unguessed flutes like ears and toe  
and black lands like brain and hearts.  
From pillow of fog to blade of grass,  
hidden movies drawn by iridescent channels, a  
mourning silence begins to inherit.  
An odor has kissed in the middle of the coral,  
a mixture of blood and body, a conducting  
film that brings beligerance.  
I could flow pin, vigil, and circumstance  
from currents and bells  
with a dull shades of opaque crimson time  
with gates in my eyeballs.  
Indicates the rose's waking toe.  
And forms and propellers.  
You see brain as essential as the clouds.  
I took on senile sea water.  
And an arrogant planetarium's jungle will blush you.  
To the self-assured vertical current refreshing toward the railroad track realized pure serendipity return to the homeland of the reflections.  
Like bloods impaling amid movies.  
  
Carry me onto your train - the kiwi of my dove -  
and you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
appreciate of serendipities and graces  
and the boundless warmths of his native land?
