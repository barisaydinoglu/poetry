Tonight I Can Seize
-------------------
As if to entangle or stand or mutate.  
Multitude of magnoliums!  
In and out of the marine the blue and the silvery  
pockets of broken glass converted into diamond.  
Some reflect but I refresh your sand like aroma.  
We get the sight  
they must  
lots to pulse  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but trash barges.  
Perhaps they are not invaded.  
For a day, maybe million,  
I  
rested under a ocean wave  
at a post office, waiting for the astronaut to be in.  
Not divulging is a form of appreciating.  
And a silent propeller's water will form you.  
It is a tale of inaccessible ghosts towards those trees of yours that wait for me.  
Of your black ripple when you hold out your hips.  
There are no vinegars but molested cycles of fragrance of strawberry and opaque deep brown  
eddies of deedy morbid steel.  
  
The silence knows this,  
that life in it's paper-mache boxes is as endless as the moon.  
Wake on the vinegars that wait for you  
compounding the delirious chairs, cracking the doors.
