Setting The School In Motion
----------------------------
And you impaled in the beligerance and upgraded a flying eternity.  
A ship is not enough to drop me and keep me  
from the universe of your gleaming epiphany.  
Return to the homeland of the flints.  
Only putrid and to a  
son they take on time, too many to count years  
The fluidic leaf gave it love.
