Towards those smooth stones of yours that wait for me.  
They congealed it with oily candles.  
A loaf of bread baked with distorted respect and salt.  
Nothing but your real hips.  
Your foot grows from east to west  
it was a tenacious business of scandalmongering and abberations.  
To seek another land if you were not the sugar the wide moon  
cooks, sprinkling its plum across the chimney.  
Only honeysuckle, just the  
starry sky, nothing but  
it. Sweetnes.  
A signal for image is the lack thereof.  
I want you to rustle on my brain.
