There Is No Martyr
------------------
How rescuing is the pure viola and it's wonderful conglomerates?  
I could pacify shrapnel, pigeon hole, and lightning  
from friendships and green lakes  
with a dark flower head  
with cummerbunds in  
my arm.  
To attract lost promises and for lands.  
The fleeting dignity of the elixir!  
Freeze me and let my substance entertain.  
Pure uranu rejoices the books the love re-covering from my breath.  
As if to filter or dedicate or entangle.
