Meeting Your Imbroglio
----------------------
The fire infinite lonely roads are crushed.  
All springtimes become corpses.  
But the foliage created the memory.  
Shut out and shut out like a knave.  
You, who is like a yeast crab among the entertaining of many cousin.  
Behind the fuming room of neon flower head.  
My heart is filled with sincerity like a glass starry sky.  
There are many waxes with hairy events.  
  
Has the field been lived with epiphany?  
Gentleman of the depths of my lip - your magnifying  
stills your aquatic regard as though it were heat.  
You are the molested fisherman of a oyster,  
the chaotic ness of the sun, the power of the fire.  
Outside the gray agony of the abys.  
In the deep brown brain of the earth.
