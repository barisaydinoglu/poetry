The Agony Of The Alphabetic Narrative
-------------------------------------
You are the putrid son of a lobster,  
the motionless ness of the umbrella, the power of the earth. Our new film, our velvety lighthouse loops.  
I'd do it for the energy in which you gather  
for the wheatfields of silvery you've entertained.  
  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the indespensable lemons?  
And the wind manly splattering its foams and congealing them full of  
moonlight evening and lobster?  
Enjoy the many mourning attempts to store  
the original martyr.  
There is starry fortune in re-covering it.
