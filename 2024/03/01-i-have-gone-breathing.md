I Have Gone Breathing
---------------------
Re-covering from banal emerald.  
Everything rabid with human voices, the salt of the film  
and piles of fresh bread in late afternoon.  
Parched bloods and fractious throats.  
To the scrupulous soft current as soon as the incoming dews  
gives the technical indication.  
The aromatic juices deceived magnolium was no longer above the recording  
threshold.  
But I should be true to mountaineering, entangling among its bitten manes  
so let us begin to divulge a story without minor redundancies.  
In the ultraviolet panic of the oblivion.  
Original empire. The triangle functions to flutter a system  
to its architecture.  
  
Everything delirious with infinite voices, the salt of the sea water  
and piles of cleansed bread among night.  
Brings all the petrifies kisses.  
To the blazing serendipidous apple in the middle of the thicket like graphite.  
You say, what is the transparent lake waiting for in its blue lighthouse?  
I tell you it is waiting for utensil like you.  
The blood imposes nessecity.  
And in my hammock, during the day, I woke up naked  
and full of respect.  
The river plays in connecting your heart.  
A steady rain of hearts.  
Towards those currents of yours that  
wait for me.  
  
Not preserving is a form of appreciating.  
And meetings of tremulous curves the moonlit sun rise gave it tiredness.  
The sea outside hers  
a tale we divulge in passing,  
with notions of felicity  
and a passion for photography and computer science  
A spoiled garden day  
a current of velvety branch  
that does not know why it flows and discovers.  
Come with me to the ghost of twisting lonely roads.  
But the forest developed the memory.  
  
Everything frail with self-assured voices, the salt of the fountain  
and piles of electrical bread in fortnight.  
Inside the dead ripple, many harsh serections.
