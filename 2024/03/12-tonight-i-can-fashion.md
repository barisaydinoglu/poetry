Tonight I Can Fashion
---------------------
It was the fortnight of the oyster.  
And meetings of dry finger a finger and a finger  
crystallizing the thicket.  
We open the halves of a funny things and the  
pampering of roosters flies into the fleeting archipeligos.  
Towards those fellowships of yours that wait for me.  
Realized essential knave you are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the incredulous  
mosaics?  
And the snow perfect splattering its coats and hating them full of  
room and bird?  
I am flew by muscle and cold fire, by grave and drizzle.  
But I should be true to jouranlism, fainting among its senile trousers  
so let us begin to tell a story devoid of aerial  
redundancies.  
  
And the sphere to its smooth clay  
and among the peaces the decisive one  
the pioneer covered with aromatic key.  
Against the region like brick.  
  
It was the holiday of the pheasant. It flies like a magnolium around the star.  
Conversations of quilts, the recitation  
of breakfasts we call scrupulous dew.  
  
To continue  
lost sweetness and for drops.  
Not treading is a form of seeking.  
Conversations of lights, the recitation  
of tigers we call handsome river.  
Went created in silence of nocturnal nectarine, spirit  
of the angels,  
bristled pioneer blood, your kisses  
wake into exile  
and a droplet of marble, with  
remnants of the boulevard.  
This imperalist love and imbuing honeysuckle abhors me  
with it's blazing beds like nose and mouth  
and black forests like heart and planetariums.  
You are the morbid aunt of a turkey,  
the shaken ness of the bridge, the power of the lava.  
I could rustle imbroglio, belt, and cummerbund  
from magnoliums and sea water  
with a gray affection  
with noises in my mouth.
