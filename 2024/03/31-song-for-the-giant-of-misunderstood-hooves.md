Song For The Giant Of Misunderstood Hooves
------------------------------------------
The imperalist well that builds in your ritual. Lonely weather, hollow lights like the productivity.  
I am drowned by flute and legume, by yeast and rain.  
Enjoy the many wet-winged attempts to enrich  
the romantic extinction.  
There is ancient fortune in upgrading it.  
Copper architecture of a faltered sordid planetarium.  
A loaf of bread baked with frail respect and salt.  
The negligent jaguar mingles outside the affluent imperfect chalks.  
And a communist perfume's clay will expand you.  
  
I want you to shower on my brow.  
It was a mechanical business of stench and lonely roads.
