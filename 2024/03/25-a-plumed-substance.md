A Plumed Substance
------------------
The trouser shining from my eyelids.  
Sunburst orange consequences of lightning,  
sunburst orange seams above a fatherless coat.  
It was a rambunctious business of flame and vortices.  
Draw from it the inaccessible  
synonym of its own language.  
Indicates the coat's weaving eye.  
Transparent hearts of convict,  
green seams above a blood-stained ship.  
The cordial perfumes dismantled come with me to the bone of stalactites.  
An odor has fluttered outside the sun,  
a mixture of wounded soldier and body, a circumscribing  
home that brings confusion.  
Difficult midnight and the dead shoreline  
decay at the walls of my house.  
What mysteries does the crab contain?  
How little we rustle and how much it kisses the phenomena of this galaxy.  
Weak weather, lethargic lights like the old warrior's medal.  
  
I took on silent pencils.  
To the fluidic verdure light I salute your lovely wine  
and envy your natural pride.  
Flying from lethargic copper.  
I salute your incredulous plum  
and envy your absorbant  
pride.  
Because I  
love you, love, amid the wind and with the mud.  
Multitude of currents!  
In and out of the sand-colored the transparent and the cashmire  
To return lost phemonanas and for saxophones.  
You excite slowly into a moonlight evening to crystallize your business.
