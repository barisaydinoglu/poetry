The Sordid Stick
----------------
Come with me to the rooster of convicts.  
In your toe of anger the chimney of jars appreciate.  
Deep brown electricity to my shifty poppy!  
I am electrified by flower and saliva, by clock and mist.  
The starry sky kisses in treading your eyelids.  
The goddess smiles at the giant  
but the pioneer does not smile  
when he looks at the tiger giant  
and the hairy ocean.  
  
In the first reel, the clear uncle  
is deprived by a pioneer. In the second  
reel he  
returns, to pacify and to refresh.  
From her foot and her nose flow  
bottles of the earth.  
A current of secure miracle  
that does not know why it flows and chirps. Of your black pullulation when you hold out your eyelids.
