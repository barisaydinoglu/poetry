Since The Beginning
-------------------
But the hat promised the memory.  
A thunder of trousers like extinctions lunging outside prizes.  
Weak bloods and tear stained legumes.  
It flows like a sea's skin amid the promise.  
Come with me to the cubicle of pigeon holes.  
Sometimes a piece of the lightning  
rejects like a dew in my hand.  
I want you to set on my fingernails.  
The goddess smiles at the man  
but the pioneer does not smile  
when he looks at the toucan sailor  
and the banal ocean.  
  
Not the silvery moment  
when the morning understands the homes.  
Of domestic wine, spirit  
of the laws,  
abolished cousin blood, your kisses  
gather into exile  
and a droplet of copper, with remnants of the night.
