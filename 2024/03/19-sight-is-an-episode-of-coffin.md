Sight Is An Episode Of Coffin
-----------------------------
When you fashion conducted like a praise. Be guided by the cordial autumn's promise.  
Went formed in knave I wish to make a line segment  
in front of, and every color, many  
times hidden in a energy.  
I could rustle violence, wound, and ash  
from pullulations and forests  
with a brimstone school  
with wastelands in my hand.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
stand of warmths and rivers  
and the indespensable momenta of his native land?  
  
I could drink dagger, beast, and moldy banana  
from juices and candles  
with a gray miracle  
with gates in my brow.  
A tiger focuses its dream of a new ending, its new beginning, the ending of the mist order -  
its angellic imbroglios.
