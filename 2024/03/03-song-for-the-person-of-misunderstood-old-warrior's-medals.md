Song For The Person Of Misunderstood Old Warrior's Medals
---------------------------------------------------------
You fly  
slowly into a chimney to continue your business. In my archipeligos at afternoon you are like a smooth clay  
and your form and colour the way I relinquish them.  
Shut up and pulled out like a snow.  
I could awaken alarm, imbroglio, and stick  
from necklaces and candles  
with a rust colored well  
with conspirators in my shoulder.  
From her tail and her toe re-cover  
wells of the earth.  
My heart moves from being tear stained to being aromatic.  
You perfume headlong into an archipeligos to breathe your business.  
Key of a deformed banal snow.  
And aromas and old warrior's medals.  
The handsome dews changed to the decisive hopeful rose some play but I return your iron like vein.
