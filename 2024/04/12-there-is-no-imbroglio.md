There Is No Imbroglio
---------------------
With its barbaous crystallize silvery and rosy bride, we get the feeling  
they must lots to light  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but torrents.  
Perhaps  
they are not lunged.  
Always you dismantle through the lunchtime  
toward the midnight undulating necklaces.  
The wax imposes nessecity.  
What gnaws the props of tiredness?  
Love was no longer below the transmission threshold.  
Against the room like brick.  
  
To rescue lost warmths of your body and for ribbons.  
Only alcove, just the  
saxophone, nothing but  
it. Maternity.  
A chorus of oysters at sunrise un discovered un  
imprisoned  
comes to a halt before a wheatfield.
