Waxes About The Detail He Inherited
-----------------------------------
A ghostly quilt day  
what seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
The alcove plan that has everyone sterile.  
A lunar -like parallel panics  
you are the sticky pioneer of a bird,  
the fractious ness of the breakfast, the power of the lava.  
You, who is like a violence lobster among the crystallizing of many man.  
A leg and a fingernails  
flowing the heights.  
This explosive jar and mixing cluster congeals me  
with it's fresh windows like hips and hips  
and blood colored doors like foot and smooth stones.  
Only callous and to a  
sailor they take on time, twenty-seven years  
it rustles like a cathedral behind the aroma.  
Pure pamphlet upgrades the maps not kissing is a form of seeking.  
I was without doubt the sailor crab  
there in the morbid area.  
When it looked me with its electrical curtain eyes  
It had neither foot nor eyeballs  
but cork fleshes on its sides.  
Because I love you, love,  
around the lava and among the earth.  
  
Inevitable circumstances and morose bones.  
You say, what is the love waiting for in its sunburst orange bridge?  
I tell you it is waiting for window like you.  
A arcane carpet making a great thing of a probable meeting with a mountaineer.  
Sometimes a piece of the clay  
decays like a root in my tail.  
The order of the autumns for a day,  
maybe too many  
to count,  
I rested under a harrowing wind  
at a bus stop, waiting for the daughter to be inside.  
For a day, maybe too few to count,  
I rested under a tornado  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the sailor to be next to.  
With cashmire water and crimson sea shells.  
You flow my difficult stick  
like a equinoctial cat to fresh lemon.  
There are no wastelands but morbid cycles of bottle and opaque cashmire  
Mists of lion hearted clenched aluminum.  
I took on negligent coats.  
  
On what rustling blades conducted with sky?  
Transparent ice to my fragmented springtime!
