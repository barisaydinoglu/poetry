A Unguessed Substance
---------------------
Not to swim or even meet  
the phemonana of one who transforms  
behind me in a vicinity or swimming to a stranger.  
Only transluscent blue lake, just the  
bed, nothing but  
it. Trouser.  
You - the secure breath.  
Here I am, a rosy eyelids punctured in the city of old warrior's medal.  
Inside the red beligerance of the flame.  
Like the rambunctious iron of flowers a ironous ritual day  
in the first scene, the rosy daughter  
is undulated by an astronaut. In the second  
scene he returns, to wake and to relinquish.  
And atoms and acrobats.  
Precision.  
  
How gathering is the enduring dominion and  
it's spacious roosters?  
In my chimney at fortnight you are like an aspen  
and your form and colour the way I chirp them.  
A aspen focuses its dream of a new beginning, its new ending, the beginning of the heart order  
-  
its natural explications.  
When you pacify like key rescued by the jungle.
