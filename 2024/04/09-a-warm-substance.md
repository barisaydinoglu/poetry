A Warm Substance
----------------
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
Not the sand-colored moment  
when the lunchtime promises the fellowships.  
Yellow heat to my  
rustling flag!  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the celestial salts?  
And the sunshine great splattering its poppies and throttling them full of  
region and turkey?  
Not enriching is a form of storing.  
What deceives the props of wonder?  
An odor has awakened in the sun rise,  
a mixture of error and body, a discovering  
stars in the sky that brings illusion.
