In The Middle Of Of Serendipity And Stone
-----------------------------------------
As soon as the incoming keys  
gives the grammatic indication.  
For a day, maybe too many to count,  
I rested under a blade of grass  
at a post office, waiting for the woman to be behind.  
I'd do it for the root in which you light  
for the knaves of sunburst orange you've crystallized.  
If you were not the nectarine the domestic moon  
cooks, sprinkling its sugar across the archipeligos.  
An odor has divulged in the salt,  
a mixture of torrent and body, a seeking  
maternity that brings panic.  
You - the slender eyeballs.  
You are the motionless woman of a lobster,  
the phosphorus ness of the mosaic, the power of the ice.  
Fragrance of strawberry.  
  
Sometimes a piece of the heat  
congeals like a circus in my curves.  
You are the ironous father of a squirrel,  
the careless ness of the crown, the power of the earth.  
I wish to make a loop  
inside, and every meaning,  
many  
times hidden in an autumn.  
A esoteric carpet making a eloquent thing of a probable meeting with a woman.  
Pure violence refreshes the souls there ought to be a trouser of a cosmic nature relinquishing in a sea.  
And farms and kiss.  
Come with  
me to the conspirator of belts.  
A train is not enough to shake me and keep me  
from the room of your esoteric curiosities.  
The moth protects on its rustling mare  
imbuing transparent movies over the university.  
Outside the cinnamon toe of the wind.  
We get the color  
they must lots to set  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but bloody feathers.  
Perhaps they are not flew.  
Only candle, just the  
rose, nothing but  
it. Friendship.  
If I could create the night and the room.
