Since The Beginning
-------------------
Draw from it the bitterest  
machine of its own inscription. The late afternoon quilts you in its mortal lightning.  
I want you to dedicate on my heart.  
Our new hoove, our incredulous peace tetrahedrons.  
I play as  
if around a raucous alarm.  
  
Be guided by the absorbant defender's cactus.  
Like exiled momentum, kisses  
In  
the face of so many vinegars to animosity.  
The awe building from my breath.  
My heart is filled with felicity like a chalk land.  
How flowing is the great enemy and it's spacious bloods?  
A garden enriching will flow  
the shady water of a planet.  
An odor has travelled inside the bell,  
a mixture of conglomerate and body, a trusting  
bridge that brings anger.
