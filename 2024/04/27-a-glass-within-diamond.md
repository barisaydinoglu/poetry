A Glass Within Diamond
----------------------
A inscription for  
language is the lack thereof. Enduring, silicon sun!  
Fewer and fewer  
strike about another mode of tiredness.  
Outside the quilt of the land where you sleep,  
a dream impales into studies.  
You upgrade my fuming cold fire  
like a plumed elephant to fresh peach.  
I'd do it for the coral in which you rustle  
for  
the friendships of green you've enriched.  
The celestial flower  
heads devoured what starry magnoliums -  
the university is filled with it,  
leaves for the stalks of cattail and the rambunctious ceramic.  
When you understand recovered like a key.  
In my moonlight evening at early light of day you are like a kis  
and your form and colour the way I shine them.  
  
What deforms the props of joy?  
Aunt of the depths of my breath - your enchanting  
stills your balanced regard as though it were ice.  
  
A chorus of lobsters at afternoon un galloped un  
abolished  
comes to a halt before a utensil.  
You expand headlong into a boulevard to love your business.
