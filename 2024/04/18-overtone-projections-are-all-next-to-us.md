Overtone Projections Are All Next To Us
---------------------------------------
I wish to make a quadrangle  
within, and every hearing, many  
times hidden in a sea shell.  
Making toward the bed  
shower on the cadavers that wait for you  
imprisoning the phosphorus chairs, burying the doors.
