Tell Them That I Am Giving Up Kissing In Phenomena
--------------------------------------------------
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the free river banks?  
And the thunder blazing splattering its kiss and fainting them full of  
city and ostrich?  
Once there was a bitterest one who  
woke at parties, sitting in a tetrahedron, among sea water.  
Towards those schools of yours that wait for me.  
A study for camera is the lack thereof.  
I do not devour in the divisions  
of sticky bone.  
A boat is not enough to coddle me  
and keep me  
from the boulevard of your angellic funny things.  
There are no coals but muzzled cycles of crown and blue  
doves of cosmic burned-out clay.
