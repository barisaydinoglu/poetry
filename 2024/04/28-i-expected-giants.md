I Expected Giants
-----------------
Transforming the sea's skin of her star full of honor.  
As if to deform or fly or fall.  
The reasons for my respect  
are conducted in my curves of saphire.  
A identity for calculation is the lack thereof.  
Full stop.  
Be guided by the romantic hoove's propeller.  
For bird feather was guilt and morally negative.
