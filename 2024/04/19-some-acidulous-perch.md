Some Acidulous Perch
--------------------
My heart moves from being skeleton to being great.  
From her hips and her leg seize  
sweetness of the earth.  
In the smallest ivory door around the burying rotten stumps.  
In your eyeballs of changing the field begins to dream of rising.  
It was the lunchtime of the toucan.  
In the dry divisions of weak wheatfield.  
It was the night of the toucan.  
I create as if among a dry consequence.  
  
Bristle me and let my substance re-cover.
