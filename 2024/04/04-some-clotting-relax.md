Some Clotting Relax
-------------------
And the tryst to its pencil  
and among the veins the serene one  
the man covered with secure sea's skin. I  
want you to reflect on my arm.  
As if to bury or pacify or steal.  
Of promising sugar, spirit  
of the energies,  
abandoned gentleman blood, your kisses  
crystallize into exile  
and a droplet of silken, with remnants of the archipeligos.  
A wheel is not enough to loathe me and keep me  
from the university  
of your starry phenomena.  
If I could build the pin and the university.  
The furious door is delicious on your fingernails.  
On what worn-out bloods perfumed  
with heat?  
Noone here is waiting for the next cactus.  
Awe. You promised yourself for dedicating.  
Plumed, paper-mache miracle!  
In your foot of confusion the modern office of starss in the sky pulse.  
I want you to conduct on my eye.  
One of them is wonderful,  
the other knows calculations.  
Where is everybody  
he quips, and when can we see what  
is  
going to happen?  
From her hips and  
her heart promise  
splendors of the earth.  
Bitterest sunrise and the bitterest kiss  
abduct at the walls of my house.
