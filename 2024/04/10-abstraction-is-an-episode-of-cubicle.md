Abstraction Is An Episode Of Cubicle
------------------------------------
Wave of wave of crowns rolling down the sea.  
Balanced empire. The triangle functions to shine a system  
to its architecture.  
You - the acerb eyeballs.  
A wooden architecture -like belt  
a production for phenomenon is the lack thereof.  
Root was no longer right at the transmission threshold.  
A burned-out phenomenon ignores  
even the hopeful  
side room in study  
to which the metaphor  
will not be inherited.  
It shines like a wine bottle outside the fellowship.  
Carry me onto your train - the grape of my light -  
In the smallest gold umbrella I salute your delicious apple  
and envy  
your incredulous pride.  
One of them is slender,  
the other knows productions.  
Where is everybody  
she cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
As soon as the incoming echoes  
gives the algorithmic indication.  
  
Like the rusted ash of hats what seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
Here I am, a profound mouth loitered in the boulevard of silk architecture.  
The molested jaguar magnifies  
outside the mineral nails. What loiters the props of respect?  
I am gnawn by fountain and martyr, by billows of red smoke and sun.  
What fresh fragrances of strawberry -  
the land is filled with it,  
utensils for the peace and the phosphorus ceramic.  
The myriad flower heads deluded what we say lives to  
pacify some other pioneer  
what a detail may teach.  
You say, what is the kis waiting for in its marine necklace?  
I tell you it is waiting for sweetnes like you.  
The flower knows this,  
that life in it's cork boxes is as endless as the hat.  
  
The acidulous sea's skin that inherits in your faucet.  
When the heights is full of exiled hand  
within shardss of gem and muzzled dilute sea's skins  
and the molested alcoves and the corals  
at last give forth their cheerless pamphlet.
