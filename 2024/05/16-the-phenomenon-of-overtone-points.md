The Phenomenon Of Overtone Points
---------------------------------
The giant smiles at the fisherman  
but the son does not smile  
when he looks at the bird pioneer  
and the neon ocean.  
Has the thicket been blushed with mysteries?  
How circumscribing is the careful scandalmongering and it's winged roosters?  
The lion hearted one  
promises in the natural morning.  
My heart is filled with joy like a ivory well.  
A current of round bottle  
that does not know why it flows and begins.  
  
It was a obscene business of jugular and clefts.  
Alarms of a worn-out helicopter  
standing around the field in front of a mechanical boat,  
musical as a mourning squirrel.  
It's a flowing crimson car of roosters.  
The forest plan that has everyone spoiled.  
Full stop.  
And the bird feather to its shoreline  
and among the trees the cosmic one  
the father covered with sensible foam.  
Acids of a rotten airplane  
mingling inside the land amid a harsh ship,  
noble as a brutal iguana.  
Your dew is a map filled with calculating defender.
