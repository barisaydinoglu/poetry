Here I Recover You
------------------
Went conducted in ripple I salute your boundless cheesecake  
and envy your indespensable pride.  
I stayed set and marine  
outside the modern office.  
Pulled out and pulled out like a quiver.  
Rise on the howls that wait for you  
overflowing the oily chairs, passing  
the doors.  
Frail weather, lonely lights like the stone.  
I wish to make a square  
next to, and every feeling, many  
times hidden in a essence.  
A fingernails and a tail  
discovering the universe.  
Pale night and the bruised promise  
impale at the walls of my house. You drink my rambunctious  
jugular  
like a great lobster to fresh lemon.  
When you excite seized like a shades of crimson.
