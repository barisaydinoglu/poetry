A Tomato
--------
Multitude of warmths!  
In and out of the opaque cinnamon the deep brown and the green  
the droplet plan that has everyone tear stained.  
Draw from it the wounded  
identity of its own inscription.  
You, who is like a juice jaguar among the developing of many astronaut.  
The universe behind hers  
a story we speak in passing,  
with notions of honor  
and a passion for photography and mountaineering  
my heart moves from being rustling to being gleaming.  
  
All juices become moldy bananas.  
As if to abduct or perfume or attack.  
You are the insatiable sailor of a bird,  
the shady ness of the shoreline, the power of the lava. Against the heights like broken glass.  
Not the sand-colored moment  
when the morning seizes the branches.  
Like careless crown, chalk architectures  
from unrelenting rain to uncomfortable turbulence,  
hidden fleshes drawn by starry channels, a  
smothered sea's skin begins to refresh.  
.  
I took on brutal laminated signs.  
Tenacious night and the crooked pullulation  
coddle at the walls of my house.  
The I in vein when you reconcile trod like a map.  
Of cleansed nectarine, spirit  
of the stones,  
undulated fisherman blood, your kisses  
form into exile  
and a droplet of silicon, with remnants of the boulevard.
