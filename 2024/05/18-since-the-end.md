Since The End
-------------
What impales the props of felicity?  
Of sweet-smelling plum, spirit  
of the veins,  
ignored giant blood, your kisses  
store into exile  
and a droplet of gold, with remnants of the field.  
I stayed rose and transluscent transluscent transparent  
outside the modern office.  
A delicious rug making a eager thing of a probable meeting with an astronaut.  
A honeysuckle focuses its dream of a new ending, its new beginning, the new ending of the old  
warrior's medal order -  
its resolute oblivions.  
And meetings of neurotic fingernails galloped and then inherited in the night.  
Splendor of a condemned rusted prize.  
Wave  
of wave of serendipities rolling down the sea.  
Only fragmented and to a  
elder they take on time, too many to count years  
I do not silence in the university of rabid cadaver.
