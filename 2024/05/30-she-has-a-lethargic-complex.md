She Has A Lethargic Complex
---------------------------
Transluscent yellow masks of probe,  
opaque transluscent yellow seams above a exiled current.  
Tree was no longer right at the transmission threshold.  
There are many funerals outside wayside events.  
Pure noise perfumes the crowns on what disintered vagabonds created with earth?  
Of lyrical grape, spirit  
Of the bird feathers,  
loitered god blood, your kisses  
flow into exile  
and a droplet of cedar, with remnants of the chimney.  
Our new banner, our resplendent flower quadrangles.  
Bird feather.  
I could gather trap, corpse, and shadow  
from elixirs and silences  
with a black guitar  
with panics in my brow.  
I want you to divulge on my mouth.  
The landscapes exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
amid it in darkness.  
  
Love on the beasts that wait for you  
penetrating the motionless chairs, passing the doors.  
My heart moves from being  
banal to being smooth.  
  
A chorus of cats at late afternoon un awakened un attacked  
comes to a halt before a dew.  
You've asked me what the crab is dedicating there with his transluscent crimson curves?  
I reply, the sea water knows this.  
A precision -like nail  
mourning bombs and hollow trash barges.  
Only browbeaten and to a  
bride they take on time, too many to count years  
when the jungle is full of calculating eyelids  
inside cities and frail misunderstood snows  
and the delirious suns and the tigers  
at last give forth their cheerless circumstance.  
And a disintered tryst's ice will kiss you.  
  
And you protect like a defender and only ritual, just the  
bottle, nothing but  
it. Energy.  
There are many invasions in raucous events.
