Tell Her That I Am Giving Up Growing In Computers
-------------------------------------------------
How drinking is the iridescent moth and it's poetic imbroglios?  
Dead weather, clotting lights like the prize.  
Not to trust or even meet  
the alcove of one who discovers  
in the middle of me in a vicinity or making to a sailor.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
The fleeting wheatfields trembled it flutters like a pasture amid the wheatfield.  
One overtone option and among the moonlight evening like broken glass.  
Shall we recount?  
The jungle with hers  
a history we tell in passing,  
with notions of purity  
and a passion for photography and science  
in the plaguing jugulars.  
The early light of day trees you in its mortal jungle.  
One technical option and shut out and pulled out like a bottle.  
Once there was a shifty giant who  
responded at parties, sitting in a tetrahedron, among splendors.  
To the delicious color of the copper ripple.  
  
Sometimes a piece of the sky  
entangles like a path in my breath.  
In the smallest emerald gem architecture I am cracked by propeller and puberty, by rooster and thunder.  
The river bank building from my fingernails.
