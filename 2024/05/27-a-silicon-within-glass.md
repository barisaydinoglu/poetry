A Silicon Within Glass
----------------------
Pockets of iron converted into wooden.  
Only morose and to a  
person they take on time, too few to count years  
Wave of wave of bridges rolling down the sea. Your foot chirps from east to east  
a phenomenon recovers,  
chains - it does not return.
