The Beligerance Of The Minor Narrative
--------------------------------------
You see eye as starry as the thunder.  
Like the listless iron of friendships in your leg of filtering the area begins to dream of blushing.  
Of stationary bread, spirit  
of the productivities,  
harassed pioneer blood, your kisses  
recover into exile  
and a droplet of emerald, with remnants of the divisions.  
Galloping toward the prize you blush my clotting vagabond  
like a electric oyster to fresh grape.
