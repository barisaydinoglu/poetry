Breeding Delicate Affection
---------------------------
Conversations of wine bottles, the recitation  
of juices we  
call pure love.  
All sea's skins become clandenstines.  
You see finger as real as the drizzle.  
A car is not enough to sodden me and keep me  
from the region of your cleansed curiosities.  
And so that its errors will abduct your nose.  
If you were not the wine the deedy moon  
cooks, sprinkling its wine across the boulevard.  
I took on whirlwinds of honeysuckles.  
It dawns like a kiss within the muscle.  
The poetic stranger  
relinquishes in the spacious morning.  
The threads exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
outside it in darkness.  
As soon as the incoming wreaths  
gives the overtone indication.  
Full stop.
