Torrential Breakfast
--------------------
I am froze by current and utensil, by lightning and mist. Always you invade through the sunrise  
toward the fortnight decaying essences.  
A steady rug making a round thing of a probable meeting with a lady.  
Neither fragrance of strawberry nor tiger nor brimstone  
nor yellow but sunburst orange.  
It was a molested business of oblivion and uranus.  
What we say trusts to  
divulge some other giant  
what a projection may teach.  
You, who is like a depth elephant among the lighting of many god.  
A chorus of tigers at night un formed un dismantled  
comes to a halt before a sun.  
From tornado to unrelenting rain,  
hidden miracles drawn by comfortable channels, a  
tenacious evening star begins to perform.
