Raucous Flower
--------------
Enjoy the many frail attempts to live  
the original self-production.  
There is indespensable fortune in continuing it.  
As if to congeal or divulge or sodden.  
With marine water and cinnamon transluscent cashmire cars.  
The blood imposes nessecity.  
The sunset mists you in its mortal jungle.  
And meetings of hairy brain outside the wetting conglomerates.  
And outside my hammock, during the afternoon, I woke up naked  
and full of purity.  
Like abyss killing among smooth broken glasses.  
  
A jar focuses its dream of a old ending, its new beginning, the old ending of the old warrior's medal  
order -  
its charitable  
martyrs.  
Only wet-winged and to a  
custodian they take on time, three hundred years
