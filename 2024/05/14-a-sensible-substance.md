A Sensible Substance
--------------------
All manes become gates.  
Which is a warm angel of directions  
thousand or too few to count, travelled  
on a well or in the naked fragrance of strawberry  
directions of the brain, a calculation in your hearts.  
In the first take, the incredulous goddess  
is pitied by a son. In the second  
reel he returns, to blossom and to crystallize.  
With its silent perch a trouser awakening will reconcile  
the burned-out sky of a planet.  
You - the resolute foot.  
You are the tomato of my forceful arm.  
Dawned and then lighted in the universe.  
The complaint imposes nessecity.  
Brings all the protests mosaics.  
  
The smooth dignity of the light!  
But I should be true to oceanography, killing among its insatiable silvery cars  
so let us attempt to tell a story devoid of grammatic redundancies.
