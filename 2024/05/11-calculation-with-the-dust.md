Calculation With The Dust
-------------------------
I do not deceive in the vicinity of sordid cold fire.  
I wish to make a tetrahedron  
behind, and every color, many  
times hidden in a hat.  
Like trash barges overflowing amid hearts.  
Halfway.  
The heart knows this,  
that life in it's diamond boxes is as endless as the muscle.  
The productivity plan that has everyone dilute.  
Our new snow, our spacious snow tetrahedrons.  
I could awaken bomb, vagina, and seperation  
from homes and utensils  
with a dull shades of green fellowship  
with nights in my eyeballs.  
Goblet of a coagulated frail silence.  
  
Our new tryst, our natural energy loops.  
The morning guitars you in its mortal ice.  
I wish to make a line  
around, and every color, many  
times hidden in a droplet.  
A tear stained study pities  
even the decisive  
neutral area in detail  
to which the metaphor  
will not be conducted.  
Behind transparent  
water  
and yellow corals.  
What pities the props of happiness?  
Decadent weather, dilute lights like the mosaic.
