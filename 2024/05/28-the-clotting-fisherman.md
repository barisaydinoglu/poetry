The Clotting Fisherman
----------------------
Warmth was no longer above the recording threshold.  
The angellic woman  
seeks in the human morning.  
Conversations of goblets, the recitation  
of apples we call boundless dew.  
Sand-colored ghosts of vagabond,  
deep brown seams above a sordid lake.  
Dead parallel bloody featherss and rotten rectums.  
To carry lost threads and for maternities.  
A computer circumscribes,  
entangles - it does not return.  
A triangle inside a tetrahedron,  
the tenacious workings of honest law.  
One of them is parenthetical,  
the other knows techniques.  
Where is nobody  
she quips, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?
