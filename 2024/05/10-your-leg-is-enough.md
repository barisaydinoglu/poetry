Your Leg Is Enough
------------------
There are many waxes within oily events.  
Everybody here is waiting for the next hoove.  
Dove. You wove yourself for pacifying.  
Only echo, just the  
root, nothing but  
it. Utensil.  
To the myriad dashing silence I do not pamper in the jungle of exiled cummerbund.  
Went reflected in time solute, gem moon!  
Went discovered in autumn and meetings of disintered lip and starry skies and drops.  
  
Wake on the coffins that wait for you  
fainting the barbaous chairs, petrifying the doors.  
Once there was a harsh woman who  
continued at parties, sitting in a circle, among atoms.  
One of them is sweet-smelling,  
the other knows languages.  
Where is someone  
she quips, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Carry me onto your car - the orange of my wreath -  
neither atom nor nature nor ultraviolet  
nor opaque sepia but cashmire.  
Enjoy the many disordered attempts to mingle  
the enchanting enemy.  
There is electric fortune in loving it.  
  
Some flutter but I reflect your metal like stalks of cattail.  
You enrich in the vicinity as in a hidden land.  
To the humble color of the saphire goblet.  
As if to die or transform or filter.  
What mysteries does the jaguar contain?  
How little we understand and how much it flutters the phenomena of this computer simulation.  
I want you to relax on my eyelids.  
And currents and sea's skins.
