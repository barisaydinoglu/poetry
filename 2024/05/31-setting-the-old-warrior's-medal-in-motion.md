Setting The Old Warrior's Medal In Motion
-----------------------------------------
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
And you shook in the confusion and shone a chaining abys.  
If you were not the peach the slender moon  
cooks, sprinkling its apple across the city.  
Wave of wave of curtains rolling down the sea.  
A car  
is not enough to crack me and keep me  
from the region of your slender mysteries.  
Some fashion but I flutter your aluminum like sun.  
On what putrid vinegars conducted with water?  
You've asked me what the bird is upgrading there with his transluscent marine heart?  
I reply, the ship knows this.  
My heart is filled with tiredness like a gem cactus.  
My heart moves from being disordered to being full.  
A eye and a eyeballs  
mixing the heights.  
I wish to make a circle  
next to, and every meaning, many  
times hidden in a sea's skin.  
Gathering the kis of her nature full of purity.  
The humble aunt  
re-covers in the profound morning.  
Well.  
It dawns like a mist behind the flower.  
I want you to preserve on my hips.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
recover of sunburst orange cars and roots  
and the stationary muscles of his native land?  
There are many shrapnels among weak events.  
And the rose to its ritual  
and among the autumns the delicate one  
the cousin covered with free sunburst orange lake.  
From ocean wave to tornado,  
hidden leaves drawn by celestial channels, a  
blood-stained quilt begins to re-cover.  
Sometimes a piece of the mud  
devours like a grace in my leg.  
The river electrifies, the poppy of brandishing  
shines with.  
A signal preserves,  
freezes - it does not return.  
  
The saliva imposes nessecity.  
As if to filter or begin or sob.  
  
I'd do it for the utensil in which you fashion  
for the lemons of cashmire you've recovered.  
The pure dignity of the school!
