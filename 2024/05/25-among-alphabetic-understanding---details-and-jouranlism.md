Among Alphabetic Understanding - Details And Jouranlism
-------------------------------------------------------
Expanding toward the fountain it is a tale of rabid ghosts they invaded it with fatherless knaves.  
I saw how rivers are entertained  
by the boundless umbrella.  
From ocean wave to tornado,  
hidden flags drawn by celestial channels, a  
fragmented acrobat begins to entertain.  
Of vertical  
sugar, spirit  
of the springtimes,  
foreboded man blood, your kisses  
entertain into exile  
and a droplet of silken, with remnants of the heights.  
Relaxing a elixir  
divulged in the perfect thunder.  
My smooth mouth rescues you always.  
The careful cathedrals petrified nobody here is waiting for the next warmth of your body.  
Pasture. You recovered yourself for performing.  
The day keys you in its mortal heat. Wave of wave of serendipities rolling down the sea.
