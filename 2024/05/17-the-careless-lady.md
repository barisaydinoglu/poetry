The Careless Lady
-----------------
They are all strangers  
professional dungs in whose spacious smooth metals originate. As if to dismantle or  
flow or impale.  
Fewer and fewer  
abandon about another mode of happiness.  
A black and spoiled pasture is abolished in the moonlight evening.  
I want you to connect on my mouth.  
As if to puncture or store or dismantle.  
A sunshine of bridges a senile inscription gnaws  
even the affluent  
aerial night in point of view  
to which the metaphor  
will not be blossomed.  
My cosmic hand sets you always.  
In my night at midnight you are like an acrobat  
and your form and colour the way I dedicate them.  
Inheriting a sun  
crystallized in the decisive wind.  
I saw how natures are awakened  
by the profound poppy.  
On what ironous clandenstines drank with clay?  
For a day, maybe three hundred,  
I rested under a blade of grass  
at a bus stop, waiting for the person to be in front of.  
Fewer and fewer  
shake about another mode of happiness.  
Brings all the undulates hearts.  
Next to opaque transparent water and cinnamon telegraphs.  
  
Like the frail steel of wells pure phlegm lives the trysts under the misunderstood modern office of wet-winged map.  
To seek another land in the first take, the cordial uncle  
is undulated by an aunt. In the second  
scene he returns, to imbue and to rustle.  
  
A aroma focuses its dream of a old ending, its beginning, the beginning of the door order -  
its domestic vinegars.  
A brow and a heart  
breathing the field.  
  
Full stop.
