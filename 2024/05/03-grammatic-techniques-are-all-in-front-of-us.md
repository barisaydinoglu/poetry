Grammatic Techniques Are All In Front Of Us
-------------------------------------------
But I should be true to computer science, pitying among its shifty salts  
so let us try to divulge a story devoid of alphabetic redundancies.  
Draw from it the shaken  
sequence of its own production.  
Travelling a landscape  
dedicated in the silent fog. It was the midnight of the toucan.  
You are the orange of my bitterest hips.  
It was the late afternoon of the bird.  
Rigid daggers and raucous  
dominions.  
Marine blades of dominion,  
sand-colored seams above a morose door.  
Halfway.  
The night with hers  
a story we speak in passing,  
with notions of sincerity  
and a passion for computer science and computer science  
it was the holiday of the oyster.  
You, who is like a corpse lobster among the trusting of many stranger.  
When the jungle is full of inevitable breath  
within legumes and weak hollow horses  
and the tremulous umbrellas and the wheatfields  
at last give forth their phosphorus cubicle.  
A loop amid a circle,  
the chaotic workings of original  
law.  
It's a living garden of seperations.  
Return to the homeland of the warmths.  
The billows of dull shades of cinnamon smoke mingles on its putrid mare  
dedicating sand-colored pastures over the boulevard.  
Discovering the flint of her landscape full of decency.  
In my region at afternoon you are like a bed  
and your form and colour the way I divulge them.  
In the face of so many bones to functionality.  
This melancholy mane and crystallizing tryst forces me  
with it's myriad moons like heart and eyeballs  
and ultraviolet bird feathers like tail and hearts.  
Behind the apple of the modern office where you sleep,  
a dream protests into synonyms.  
  
Indicates the horse's waking eyeballs.  
In the utensil of the sea where you sleep,  
a dream coagulates into phenomena.  
  
It was the midnight of the crab.  
My heart moves from being rustling to being loving.  
Realized warm root from palm tree leaf to tornado,  
hidden hooves drawn by domestic channels, a  
dry quilt begins to divulge.  
What we say kisses to  
form some other son  
what a point of view may teach.  
I stayed perched and blue  
among the boulevard.  
What we say understands to  
pacify some other god  
what a study may teach.  
  
Brings all  
the prosecutes veins.  
Sometimes a piece of the electricity  
disguises like a magnolium in my mouth.
