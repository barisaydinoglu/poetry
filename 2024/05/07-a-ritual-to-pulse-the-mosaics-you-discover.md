A Ritual To Pulse The Mosaics You Discover
------------------------------------------
I gather as if around a muzzled twisting lonely road.  
Reject me and let my substance re-cover.  
The hat relaxes in inheriting your brain.  
Pockets of metal converted into wooden.  
You preserve in the thicket as in a cosmic city.  
Pockets of salt converted into diamond.  
  
We get the sense  
they must lots to swim  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but belts.  
Perhaps they are not fainted.  
Cold scandalmongerings and ghostly vinegars.
