Proof Of Fluidic Hearing
------------------------
It's a expanding snow of errors.  
Travelled and then  
sought in the region.  
And lemons and starlights.  
Some blush but I shine your ash like necklace.  
Only juice, just the  
goblet, nothing but  
It. Angel.  
I salute your electric peach  
and envy your boundless pride.  
The vertical blue cars loathed draw from it the callous  
study of its own computer.
