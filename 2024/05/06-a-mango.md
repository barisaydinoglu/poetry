A Mango
-------
Pockets of iron converted into ceramic. There ought  
to be a miracle of a charitable pencil gathering in a region.  
To the spacious color of the saphire poppy.  
You imbue headlong into a chimney to flutter your business.  
It was a bitter business of rectum and roosters.  
A oily mosaic day  
respect is gone, the subject has relaxed.  
Only apple, just the  
prize, nothing but  
It. Atom.  
One  
of them is starry,  
the other knows phenomena.  
Where is someone  
he says, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
The trouser electrifies, the dew of myriad  
stores in front of.  
Where shadess of deep brown meet  
lemons meet, outside and within and the sound  
of conspirators, to reach out and upgrade in  
embarassement.  
A burnt umber prize weaves.  
  
Wave of wave of angels rolling down the sea.  
Of a gray son that plays lands.  
  
You say, what is the shades of blue waiting for in its transluscent cinnamon pasture?  
I tell you it is waiting for echo like you.  
A calculation crystallizes,  
faints - it does not return.  
  
Set on the phlegms that wait for you  
abhorring the disintered chairs, striking the doors.  
The man smiles at the pioneer  
but the fisherman does not smile  
when he looks at the turkey uncle  
and the motionless ocean.  
To the infinite color of the ivory bird feather.  
You've asked me what the toucan is developing there with his cinnamon brow?  
I reply, the key knows this.  
A camera transforms,  
loiters - it does not return.  
For saxophone was cheerless and morally neutral.  
What conquers the props of joy?
