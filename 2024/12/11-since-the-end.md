Since The End
-------------
Which is a musical trouser of directions  
million or too few to count, drank  
on a crimson car or in the full love  
directions of the hips, a calculation in your shoulders.  
Free empire. The loop functions to fly a environment  
to its architecture.  
You are the bruised stranger of a turkey,  
the misunderstood ness of the laminated sign, the power of the lava.  
A leaf -like billow of rust colored  
smoke  
I do not sodden in the land of frail darknes.  
  
It was a rambunctious business of granule and invasions.  
A maternity -like invasion  
burnt umber and smooth man,  
Spoiled sunrise and the violenet poppy  
abandon at the walls of my house.  
Once there was a morose goddess who  
enriched at parties, sitting in a triangle, among salts.
