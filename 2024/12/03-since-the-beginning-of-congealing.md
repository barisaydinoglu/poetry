Since The Beginning Of Congealing
---------------------------------
Of your black angel when you hold out your ears.  
You fashion in the thicket as in a boundless area.  
A ultraviolet and rambunctious cinnamon lake is passed in the vicinity.  
Went promised in acrobat when the archipeligos is full of sordid brain  
in front of howls and lewd dead tigers  
and the sterile river banks and the awes  
at last give forth their bruised probe.  
Which is a changeless promise of directions  
million or too many to count, formed  
on a essence or in the decisive forest  
directions of the curves, a calculation in your fingernailss.  
A current of musical splendor  
that does not know why it flows and relaxes.  
  
Sometimes a piece of the electricity  
drowns like a wreath in my shoulder.  
I saw how eddies are woke  
by the eager flower.  
I was without doubt the god bird  
there in the barbaous room.  
When it looked me with its velvety phemonana eyes  
it had neither eyeballs nor hips  
but glass pullulations on its sides.  
Because I love you, love, among the lightning and inside the clay.  
Only aspen, just the  
drop, nothing but  
it. Salt.  
What electric coats -  
the land is filled with it,  
friendships for the productivity and the harsh gold.  
  
I took on shifty bolts of marble architecture.  
Return to the homeland of the stalkss of cattail.
