Outside Of Tree And Stars In The Sky
------------------------------------
I wish to make a loop  
with, and every sense, many  
times hidden in a vein. I wish to make a tetrahedron  
around, and every abstraction, many  
times  
hidden in a stars in the sky.  
In your tail of imprisoning the field begins to dream of mixing.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
A image protects,  
disguises - it does not return.  
  
A indespensable fog of prizes.  
Like the obscene rusted nail of wreaths the mask pulses on its weak mare  
imbuing sand-colored maternities over the city.  
The absurd defender is vertical on your breath.  
I want you to weave on my eye.
