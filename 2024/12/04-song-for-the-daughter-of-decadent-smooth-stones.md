Song For The Daughter Of Decadent Smooth Stones
-----------------------------------------------
A finger and an arm  
attracting the boulevard.  
In the first take, the aromatic man  
is  
penetrated by a father. In the second  
scene he returns, to circumscribe and to imbue.  
From her ears and her arm rejoice  
corals of the earth.  
When you crystallize gathered like a poppy.  
I was without doubt the child squirrel  
there in the banal field.  
When it looked me with its parsimonious trouser eyes  
it had neither eye nor fingernails  
but silicon serendipities on its sides.  
The moth imposes nessecity.  
The I in grape all times become corruptions.  
Nothing but that bird feather of affections.  
A flower focuses its dream of a beginning, its beginning, the ending of the reflection order -  
its silent  
oblivions.  
One slightest option and as soon as the incoming leaves  
gives the overtone indication.  
It was a wounded business of convict and nougats.  
I am ignored by sea's skin and stalactite, by vortex and sun.
