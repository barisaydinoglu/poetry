I Expected Goddesses
--------------------
There are many conspirators behind wet-winged events.  
I fly as if within  
a chaotic wounded soldier.  
I could pulse death, cummerbund, and billow of opaque ultraviolet smoke  
From productivities and silences  
with a turqoise shades of cashmire  
with invasions in my tail.  
I want you to seek on my arm.  
You are the difficult goddess of a squirrel,  
the banal ness of the movie, the power of the lava.  
The order of the femininities a chorus of elephants at fortnight un rescued un stole  
comes to a halt before a goblet.  
The love knows this,  
that life in it's fused quartz boxes is as endless as the time.  
Shower on the shardss of gold that wait for you  
pampering the disordered chairs, gnawing the doors.  
In cashmire water and green hearts.  
It loves like a salt outside the flower head.  
It seizes like a sun rise around the horse.  
The reasons for my respect  
are trusted in my finger of wooden.  
Return to the homeland of the cathedrals.
