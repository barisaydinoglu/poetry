Song For The Person Of Harsh Quilts
-----------------------------------
The lady smiles at the person  
but the pioneer does not smile  
when he looks at the elephant bride  
and the mourning ocean.  
In the face of so many flames to animosity.  
We open the halves of a phenomena and  
the  
erupting of brambles reconciles into the wonderful city.  
A moonlit mist of planetariums.  
Our new soul, our warm time triangles.  
It was the afternoon of the crab.  
Not responding is a form of flowing.  
The nougat imposes nessecity.  
Falter me and let my substance set.  
Come with me to the dominion of corpses.  
And a explosive mane's water will tread you.  
And meetings of fractious eyelids of musical sugar, spirit  
of the salts,  
forced daughter blood, your kisses  
hear into exile  
and a droplet of crystal, with remnants of the jungle.  
Blood-stained elders and mountaineers.  
For  
me they are slightest.  
  
It was the sunrise of the cat.  
A tree -like croak  
the absorbant pioneer  
expands in the enduring morning.  
A silvery essence showers.  
My affluent leg returns you always.  
Arcane, saphire ritual!  
There are no felicities but ironous cycles of saxophone and green  
evening stars of great careless rusted nail.  
  
A lighthouse focuses its dream of a new beginning, its old ending, the beginning of the jar order -  
its fluidic pamphlets.  
Pockets of brick converted into ivory.
