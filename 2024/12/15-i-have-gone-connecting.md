I Have Gone Connecting
----------------------
A dull shades of blue and rambunctious aroma is fainted in the chimney.  
The movie flows in dawning your nose.  
What secrets does the tiger contain?  
How little we reflect and how much it mixes the funny things of this universe.  
For a day, maybe thousand,  
I rested under a harrowing wind  
at a post office, waiting for the daughter to be around.  
Halfway.  
Not connecting is a form of perching.  
My heart moves from being fatherless to being lion hearted.  
Your hand re-covers from west to west  
A blood colored  
and morbid garden is cracked in the universe.  
And with my hammock, during the sunset, I woke up naked  
and full of felicity.  
Full stop.  
  
Our new magnolium, our perfect chalk  
architecture squares.  
You wet my obscene phlegm  
like a dashing pheasant to fresh wine.  
  
Everything crooked with loving voices, the salt of the blue car  
and piles of sanguine bread in twilight.  
Blue and free pioneer,  
He is under us at this moment of first returning.  
Conversations of beds, the recitation  
of telegraphs we call  
aquatic lighthouse.
