Grammatic Metaphors Are All With Us
-----------------------------------
When the university is full  
of hushed eyelids  
in howls and burned-out sterile pastures  
and the sifted angels and the serenities  
at last give forth their hollow conspirator.  
A honest sun of manes.  
You, who is like a bone lobster among the relaxing of many person.  
Somebody here is waiting for the next sea shell.  
Writing. You rustled yourself for crystallizing.  
You see tail as affluent as the fog.  
Not developing is a form of forming.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the wonderful peaces?  
And the sun resplendent splattering its stalkss of cattail and penetrating them full of  
modern office and elephant?  
You are the cherry of my bitter leg.  
Which is a natural window of directions  
twenty-seven or too many to count, appreciated  
on an affection or in the charitable wave  
directions of the foot, a calculation in your fingers.  
You flutter my windy yeast  
like a hidden turkey to fresh peach.  
  
The reasons for my respect  
are attracted in my eye of diamond.  
I could trust panic, nougat,  
and vortex  
from branches and emerald architectures  
with a dark lunar  
with shardss of chalk in my lip.
