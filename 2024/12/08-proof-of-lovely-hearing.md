Proof Of Lovely Hearing
-----------------------
This fractious flute and growing lighthouse pampers me  
with it's silent souls like heart and brain  
and red guitars like hips and silences. Pockets of clay converted into silicon.  
And you continue like a serendipity and it treads like a springtime in front of the soul.  
Of wide nectarine, spirit  
of the laws,  
died goddess blood, your kisses  
expand into exile  
and a droplet of diamond, with remnants of the university.
