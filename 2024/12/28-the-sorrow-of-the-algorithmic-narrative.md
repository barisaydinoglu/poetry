The Sorrow Of The Algorithmic Narrative
---------------------------------------
A dead signal coddles  
even the resplendent  
algorithmic area in synonym  
to which the metaphor  
will not be attracted.  
Shall we move on?  
One of them is spacious,  
the other knows images.  
Where is someone  
she exclaims, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
What penetrates the props of happiness?  
You continue headlong into a boulevard to form your business.  
The handsome flag gave it decency.  
Pockets of aluminum converted into glass.
