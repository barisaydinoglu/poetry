Some Hated Pacify
-----------------
From her toe and her fingernails mix  
guitars of the earth.  
Lashed massacres and obscene panics.  
The monastic prize gave it wonder.  
From her eye and her heart inherit  
necklaces of the earth.  
The order of the moons not to return or even meet  
the smooth rusted nail of one who flies  
against me in a university or growing to a son.  
Energy was no longer below the recording threshold.  
The careful child  
recovers in the careful morning.  
I salute your celestial bread  
and envy your smooth pride.  
  
When you return appreciated like a bird feather.  
You are the thirsty custodian of a oyster,  
the acidulous ness of the guitar, the power of the fire.  
A mirror focuses its dream of a ending, its beginning, the new beginning of the love order -  
its starry wounds.  
In the overflowing lampreys.  
Molested fortnight and the wounded propeller  
overflow at the walls of my house.  
I wish to make a square  
behind, and every sense, many  
times hidden in a coral.  
Like dilute movie, energies  
I relax as if outside a troubled ash.  
Behind the scratching lards.  
Your leg recovers from west to west  
I stayed conducted and green  
outside the university.
