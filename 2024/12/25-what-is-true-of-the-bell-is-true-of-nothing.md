What Is True Of The Bell Is True Of Nothing
-------------------------------------------
To seek another land the order of the flutes puncture me and let my substance awaken. In my jungle at late afternoon you are like a cathedral  
and your form and colour the way I blossom them.  
Only silence, just the  
leaf, nothing but  
it. Flower.
