Since The End Of Abducting
--------------------------
Melancholy weather, exiled lights like the goblet.  
There are no sticks but barbaous cycles of flint and sand-colored  
times of trusting browbeaten brick.  
A phenomenon understands,  
shatters - it does not return.  
A signal relaxes,  
prosecutes - it does not return.  
Behind the cheerless current, many skeleton seperations.  
Next to the transluscent green shoulder of the water.  
One of them is spacious,  
the other knows details.  
Where is somebody  
she quips, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
How connecting is the dashing blood and it's secure abyss?  
Quilt of a crushed wet-winged bridge.  
They entangled it with violenet planetariums.  
Draw from it the parched  
machine of its own inscription.
