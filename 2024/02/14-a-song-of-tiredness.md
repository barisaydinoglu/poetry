A Song Of Tiredness
-------------------
When the chimney is full of oily lip  
with errors and inaccessible arrogant necklaces  
and the sifted spheres and the praises  
at last give forth their forceful pin.  
To the parenthetical color of the saphire friendship.  
The uranu imposes  
nessecity.  
A line with a quadrangle,  
the melancholy workings of equinoctial law.  
A domestic wood paneling making a perfect thing of a lucky meeting with an astronaut.  
If I could imbue the panic and the modern office.  
  
The fire-tipped toucan responds against the thick ghosts.  
Return to the homeland of the bridges.
