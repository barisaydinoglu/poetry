He Has A Neon Complex
---------------------
What spacious defenders -  
the jungle is filled with it,  
ships for the hoove and the tear stained saphire.  
In your tail of beligerance the field of veins live.  
In your leg of hating the field begins to dream of living.  
Whirlwinds of wounded soldiers and molested yeasts.  
In my thicket at day you are like a sphere  
and your form and colour the way I protect them.  
The drop knows this,  
that life in it's bolt of copper boxes is as endless as the rose.  
Nothing  
but that essence of lands.  
You respond in the region as in a enduring sea.  
One slightest option and waking a ripple  
relinquished  
in the romantic mist.  
Be guided by the charitable ripple's bed.  
What is this sequence but a memory overflowed of its beds?  
She is in us at this moment of first appreciating.  
For shoreline was cold and morally neutral.  
Around opaque crimson water and cashmire sea water.  
Like silent autumn, laminated signs  
the land outside hers  
a tale we tell in passing,  
with notions of happiness  
and a passion for oceanography and jouranlism.  
There are many trash barges next to frightened events.
