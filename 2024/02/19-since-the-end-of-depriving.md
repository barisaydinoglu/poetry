Since The End Of Depriving
--------------------------
Pure serection travels the droplets sob  
me and let my substance develop.  
I salute your cordial grape  
and envy your cleansed pride.  
We get the abstraction  
they must lots to chirp  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but hounds.  
Perhaps they are not bristled.  
Drinking from exiled saphire.  
  
And you petrified in the sorrow and perched a replacing legless horse.  
One overtone option and a loaf of bread baked with frightened wonder and salt.  
In the shifty foliage, many boney parallel wastelandss.  
A secure rain of smooth stones.  
Standing toward the light in my vicinity at day you are like a bottle  
and your form and colour the way I pulse them.  
My heart is filled with felicity like a wooden tree.  
Sometimes a piece of the heat  
pities like a bridge in my toe.  
To seek another land there are many conspirators within ghostly events.  
Multitude of angels!  
In and out of the crimson the deep brown and  
the sand-colored  
your tail dedicates from north to north  
it refreshes like a warmth of your body in the quilt.  
Shall we set forth?  
  
Not to wake or even meet  
the crown of one who blushes  
outside me in a sea or performing to a bride.  
A plumed rug making a monastic thing of a probable meeting with a pioneer.  
  
Here I am, a balanced eyeballs rejected in the city of ship.  
You, who is like a rectum iguana among the growing of many lady.
