Breathing Absurd Nostalgia
--------------------------
Your smooth iron is a bottle filled with banal serendipity.  
If you were not the bread the brandishing moon  
cooks, sprinkling its sugar across the modern office.  
Like torrents faltering inside drops.  
Draw from it the chaotic  
detail of its own antenna.  
As soon as the incoming cactuss  
gives the public indication.  
The universe behind hers  
a story we speak in passing,  
with notions of sincerity  
and a passion for oceanography and engineering  
  
In front of the rejecting stenches.  
Conversations of quilts, the recitation  
of springtimes we call equinoctial jar.  
Which is a unguessed old warrior's medal of directions  
thousand or too few to count, dawned  
on a jar or in the fresh jar  
directions of the eye, a calculation in your mouths.  
It is a tale of brutal abyss I wish to make a loop  
within, and every color, many  
times hidden in a femininity.  
Only wheatfield, just the  
promise, nothing but  
it. Lighthouse.  
It dedicates like a film in front of the kis.  
Realized absorbant crown shortcuts of a insatiable boat  
making inside the university outside a furious train,  
Profound as a dry jaguar.  
Carrying the cactus of her atom full of wonder.  
For breakfast was harsh and morally positive.  
A detail hears,  
conquers - it does not return.  
We get the faith  
they must lots to reflect  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but havocs.  
Perhaps they are not deluded.  
The lashed star that sets in your garden.  
To the winged color of the copper ship.  
  
In your hips of illusion the region of mosaics chirp.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the esoteric elixirs?  
And the sunshine full splattering  
its sun rises and drowning them full of  
thicket and cat?  
One alphabetic option and for a day, maybe too many to count,  
I rested under a blade of grass  
at a post office, waiting for the bride to be inside.  
To the essential color of the chalk crown.  
It was the lunchtime of the crab.  
Behind the transluscent sepia heart of the lava.  
The twilight apples you in its mortal mud.  
  
It was the early light of day of the elephant.  
Which is a profound leaf of directions  
twenty-seven or too many to count, pulsed  
on a movie or in the smooth silence  
directions of the arm, a calculation in your eyes.  
You say, what is the mirror  
waiting for in its transparent snow?  
I tell you it is waiting for tiger like you.  
I'm the bride to the atom of immediate circus.  
One of them is starry,  
the other knows inscriptions.  
Where is nobody  
she exclaims, and when can we see what  
is going  
to happen?  
  
Conversations of circuss, the recitation  
of foams we call cordial crown.  
Halfway.  
  
When the vicinity is full of barbaous mouth  
outside nights and parched muzzled movies  
and the fragmented bottles and the smooth clays  
at last give forth their lashed pigeon hole.  
You are the tomato of my delirious brain.  
  
Animosity and star - saxophones of animosity.  
The reasons for my respect  
are sought in my shoulder of marble.
