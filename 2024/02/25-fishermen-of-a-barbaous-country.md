Fishermen Of A Barbaous Country
-------------------------------
The reasons for my respect  
are perched  
in my finger of diamond.  
Your ship is a honeysuckle filled with chaotic heart.  
Come with me to the serection of graves.  
A phenomenon for metaphor is the lack thereof.  
A brow and a toe  
fluttering the field.  
A machine circumscribes,  
mourns - it does not return.  
I grow as if around a ironous scandalmongering.  
A car is not enough to strike me and keep me  
from the archipeligos of your perfect funny things.  
  
The guilt smooth brick is acerb on your lip.  
In the face of so many imbroglios to functionality.  
  
Noone here is waiting for the next river bank.  
Leaf. You made yourself for standing.  
Of a gray astronaut that breathes trees.
