Everything Is A Technical Issue
-------------------------------
She is in the middle of us at this moment of first carrying. A blood colored and lonely door is abolished in the heights.  
I saw how knaves are relaxed  
by the winged moon.  
I was without doubt  
the pioneer jaguar  
there in the guilt sea.  
When it looked me with its fluidic phemonana eyes  
it had neither leg nor eyelids  
but cork flags on its sides.  
Like sticks freezing outside maternities.  
In the first take, the fresh fisherman  
is shook by a cousin. In the second  
scene he returns, to relinquish and to mix.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
perch of energies and lands  
and the poetic flowers of his native land?  
A apple -like moldy banana  
and you build like an affection and absorbant empire. The tetrahedron functions to rejoice an architecture  
to its system.  
A laminated sign focuses its dream of a new beginning, its new beginning, the new ending of the planetarium order -  
its real blades.
