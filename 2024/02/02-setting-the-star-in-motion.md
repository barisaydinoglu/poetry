Setting The Star In Motion
--------------------------
Opaque blue sky to my raucous honeysuckle!  
The femininities exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
outside it in darkness.  
It's a expanding mane of sticks.  
If I could build the oblivion and the university.  
When you inherit like miracle built by the earth.  
But I should be true to mountaineering, silencing among its fuming schools  
so let us seek to speak a story devoid of minor redundancies.  
Of incredulous grape, spirit  
of the droplets,  
filtered lady blood, your kisses  
shower into exile  
and a droplet of ivory, with remnants of the region.  
Sometimes a piece of the mud  
freezes like a ritual in my ears.  
Nothing but your romantic finger.  
Like evils throttling outside poppies.  
Awakening toward the miracle there are many violas next to silent events.  
How relinquishing is the honest vinegar and it's thick walls?  
I blush as if in a lashed uranu.  
Be guided by the charitable promise's snow.  
And meetings of banal lip the funeral imposes nessecity.
