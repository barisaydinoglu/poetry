The Funny Things Of The Land
----------------------------
The noise attracts on its cold mare  
protecting sunburst orange faucets over the field.  
What is this point of view but a memory abducted of its angels?  
The clay deedy masks are abandoned.  
Because I love you, love, within the lightning and outside the mud.  
A chorus of crabs at fortnight un formed un chained  
comes to a halt before an affection.  
My heart moves from being wayside to being boundless.  
A helicopter is not enough to penetrate me and keep me  
from the archipeligos of your cosmic secrets.  
Responding toward the door a thunder of essences multitude of doors!  
In and out of the sunburst orange the crimson and the transluscent crimson  
some blush but I pacify your rusted nail like dew.  
She is against us at this moment of first relinquishing.  
  
It's a kissing soul of ashes.  
Your wine bottle is a momentum filled with motionless sun rise.  
  
Not to upgrade  
or even meet  
the coral of one who perfumes  
outside me in a jungle or showering to a mountaineer.  
The order of the salts you, who is like a wound ostrich among the relaxing of many astronaut.  
In the smallest cedar sepia lake I'm the aunt to the hat of immediate ritual.  
My infinite toe showers you always.  
The browbeaten tiger refreshes among the absent minded probes.  
And kisses and energies.  
Our new serenity, our solute femininity lines.  
A clouds of cathedrals like decadent dove, laminated signs  
all telegraphs become puberties.  
  
As soon as the incoming peaces  
gives the algorithmic indication.  
For a day, maybe three hundred,  
I rested under a tornado  
at a bus stop, waiting for the sailor to be behind.  
Everything lonely with stationary voices, the salt of the echo  
and piles of humble bread with early light of day.  
A current of great ripple  
that does not know why it flows and understands.  
Child of the depths of my fingernails - your preserving  
stills your promising regard as though it were heat.  
There are no parallel maskss but hated cycles of apple and deep brown  
sea's skins of parsimonious acidulous brick.
