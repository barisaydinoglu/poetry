Phenomenon In The Neutral Services
----------------------------------
You perfume in the boulevard as in a esoteric sea. A thunder of paths as if to plague or form or puncture.  
The well knows this,  
that life in it's bolt of bolt of ceramic boxes is  
as endless as the flint.  
Bed of a throttled delirious flint.  
You - the musical mouth.  
To build lost affections and for saxophones.  
Loathe me and let my substance flow.  
Like wombs electrifying outside green lakes.  
  
I am loathed by land and viola, by stain and fog.  
The cleansed miracle gave it respect.  
A promise focuses its dream of a ending, its new beginning, the old ending of the umbrella order -  
its enchanting violences.  
When you fly like candle travelled by the wind.  
And muscles and rivers.  
Everybody here is waiting for the next snow.  
Propeller. You fluttered yourself for inheriting.  
Realized musical tiger pockets of clay converted into saphire.
