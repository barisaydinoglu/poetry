Inside Of Springtime And Peace
------------------------------
The clay smooth lineages are devoured. I salute your enchanting peach  
and envy your deedy pride.  
Amid green water and cashmire fragrances of strawberry.  
  
A blue cactus breathes.  
What we say swims to  
chirp some other pioneer  
what a projection may teach.
