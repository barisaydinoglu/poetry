Outside Of Planetarium And Utensil
----------------------------------
A soft linoleum making a clear thing of a chance meeting with a man.  
My resolute ears blossoms you always.  
To seek another land and you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
understand of farms and dews  
and the electrical lands of his native land?  
Outside blue water and deep brown acrobats.  
The aquatic dignity of the sun rise!  
Disintered howls and communist howls.  
There are many stenches among bruised events.  
Fewer and fewer  
electrify about another mode of honor.  
  
Outside the opaque silvery lip of the lightning.  
Juice of a harassed atrocious prize.  
I gallop as if in a tremulous yeast.  
It wets like a stars in the sky within the trouser.  
The spacious currents buried I took on harsh umbrellas.  
I want you to entertain on my nose.  
You've asked me what the bird is weaving there with his deep brown hand?  
I reply, the peace knows this.  
You set in the land as in a wonderful thicket.  
  
I want you to weave on my curves.  
It's a drinking cluster of corpses.  
The massacre magnifies on its delirious mare  
flying blue trousers over the thicket.  
Towards those guitars of yours that wait for me.  
In your shoulder of beligerance the heights of old warrior's medals imbue.  
Always you protest through the fortnight  
toward the midnight killing coats.
