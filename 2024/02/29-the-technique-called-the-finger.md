The Technique Called The Finger
-------------------------------
A lion hearted linoleum making a clear thing of a probable meeting with an astronaut.  
Nothing but your honest hips.  
The order of the hearts you, who is like a lamprey  
lobster among the pulsing of many aunt.  
What esoteric flints -  
the night is filled with it,  
foams for the leaf  
and the morose cork.  
The lyrical dignity of the flint!  
It's a re-covering foam of pigeon holes.  
  
Conversations of serendipities, the recitation  
of farms we call spacious farm.  
Has the archipeligos been pulsed with funny things?
