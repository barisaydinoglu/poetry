The Production Has Not Dropped The Promise
------------------------------------------
What we say relinquishes to  
relinquish some other person  
what a technique may teach.  
The sand-colored lake rustles in wetting your ears.  
What funny things does the pheasant contain?  
How little we relinquish and how much  
it awakens the funny things of this universe.  
A handsome rain of gardens.  
Chirping toward the key smothered dusts and burned-out wounded soldiers. It was a guilt business of beast and shrapnels.
