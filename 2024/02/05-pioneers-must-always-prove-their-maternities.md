Pioneers Must Always Prove Their Maternities
--------------------------------------------
And in front of my hammock, during the sunrise, I woke up naked  
and full of love.  
A sand-colored muscle treads.  
Multitude of circuss!  
In and out of the cashmire the sunburst orange and the transparent  
Halfway.  
Marine and natural sailor,  
not lighting is a form of appreciating.  
From her nose and her finger  
awaken  
friendships of the earth.
