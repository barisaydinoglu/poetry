Setting The Promise In Motion
-----------------------------
Some seek but I refresh your steel like productivity. To flutter lost pullulations and for forms.  
The fleeting wine bottle gave it sincerity.  
  
Outside the flower head of the night where you sleep,  
a dream coddles into studies.  
A current of poetic bird feather  
that does not  
know why it flows and conducts.  
She is inside us at this moment of first mixing.  
Come with me to the throat of panics.
