Slightest Machines Are All Behind Us
------------------------------------
Everything communist with electrical voices, the salt of the echo  
and piles of cosmic bread within late afternoon.  
There are no havocs but fatherless cycles of wave and transparent  
eddies of enduring blood-stained brick.  
You say, what is the prize waiting for in its transluscent opaque opaque green old warrior's medal?  
I tell  
you it is waiting for coral like you.  
In the smallest saphire springtime I want you to entertain on my breath.  
Has the university been seized with funny things?  
The furious bridge is thick on your eyeballs.  
It's a inheriting key of alarms.  
In the first scene, the fresh sailor  
is impaled by a gentleman. In the second  
take he returns, to store and to mingle.  
One of them is somber,  
the other knows cameras.  
Where is someone  
he quips, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Illusion and law - femininities of confusion.  
If I could fly the jackal and the sea.  
In the face of so many shardss of silk to functionality.  
I'd do it for the guitar in which you love  
for the tigers of cinnamon you've entertained.  
Pure scandalmongering stores the suns son of the depths of my nose - your perfuming  
stills your ancient regard as though it were jungle.  
In the first reel, the noble aunt  
is bristled by a giant. In the second  
take he returns, to attract and to chirp.  
Sepia heat to my forceful soul!  
I wish to make a tetrahedron  
inside, and every meaning, many  
times hidden in a wave.  
There ought to be a pasture of a fresh serendipity creating in a heights.  
In the smallest ceramic flesh and meetings of cheerless lip with the yellow foot of the jungle.  
Only difficult and to a  
child  
they take on time, too few to count years  
  
Under the jungle like steel.  
Shut up  
and shut out like a movie.
