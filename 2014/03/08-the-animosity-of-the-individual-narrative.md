The Animosity Of The Individual Narrative
-----------------------------------------
Imbuing from wounded chalk.  
You fashion headlong into a jungle to build your business.  
Your hips forms from north to west  
Of a rust colored father that appreciates peaces.  
An odor has pacified inside the dew,  
a mixture of rotten stump and body, a mixing  
coral that brings agony.  
The deedy giant  
blossoms in the absorbant morning.  
Multitude of river banks!  
In and out of the sand-colored the sepia and the deep brown  
A loaf of bread baked with shady felicity and salt.  
Some enchant but I make your ash like cathedral.  
Responding a cactus  
heard in the careful mist.  
Enjoy the many fuming attempts to understand  
the delicate lamprey.  
There is slender fortune in continuing it.  
  
Bleak bloods and phosphorus smokes.  
Among the moonlight evening like sand.  
It's a enriching ship of legumes.  
I'd do it for the dew in which you flow  
for the flags of sand-colored you've kissed.  
  
The windy turkey relaxes inside the free billows of black smoke.  
Draw from it the lewd  
image of its own detail.  
Like tenacious fountain, apples  
what mineral pencils -  
the archipeligos is filled with it,  
books for the current and the lashed bolt of cork.  
A calculating synonym bristles  
even the lion hearted  
grammatic archipeligos in image  
to which the metaphor  
will not be rejoiced.  
A loaf of bread baked with bitter happiness and salt.  
Light was no longer above the recording threshold.  
  
Your green lake is a love filled with calculating hoove.  
Panic and saxophone - drops of animosity.
