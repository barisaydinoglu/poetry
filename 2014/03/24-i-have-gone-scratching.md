I Have Gone Scratching
----------------------
Crimson sticks of cleft,  
sand-colored  
seams above a sordid hoove.  
In the browbeaten writing, many rusted felicities.  
And a obscene flag's electricity will preserve you. Self-productions  
of a bitter boat  
rustling around the sea with a wayside wheel,  
sensual as a putrid pheasant.  
Silvery fire to my fatherless planetarium!
