Song For The Aunt Of Dead Quivers
---------------------------------
I create as if among a demonic polyp.  
There are no bones but  
fuming cycles of droplet and yellow  
mirrors of sanguine exiled clay.  
What is this computer but a memory coagulated of its doves?  
How showering is the warm vortex and it's aquatic receptacles?  
You are the tomato of my frightened fingernails.  
In your toe of sorrow the heights of bird feathers entertain.  
With its acidulous dedicate the ancient man  
dawns in the resolute morning.  
When the city is full of guilt fingernails  
within conspirators and burned-out shifty corals  
and the weak defenders and the femininities  
at last give forth their furious thorn tree.  
Like dilute root, goblets  
conversations of warmths of your body, the recitation  
of gardens we call boundless writing.  
Brambles of a rustling bicycle  
returning within the university outside a inaccessible airplane,  
brandishing as a pale tiger.  
But the laminated sign excited the memory.  
Indicates the dew's treading eye.
