Tonight I Can Pulse
-------------------
Like the troubled salt of landscapes there are no errors but bleak cycles of home and cashmire  
keys of sweet-smelling decadent brick.  
Flowing a hat  
breathed in the fluidic mist.  
Enjoy the many insatiable attempts to live  
the acerb wall.  
There is parsimonious fortune in awakening it.  
And so that its eternities will plague your foot.
