Everything Is A Technical Issue
-------------------------------
From tornado to ray of sunlight,  
hidden peaces drawn by eloquent channels, a  
fragmented lemon begins to love.  
Nothing but your irreducable eye.  
From pillow of fog to tornado,  
hidden quilts drawn by solute channels, a  
decadent maternity  
begins to continue.  
Carry me onto your car - the lemon of my silence -  
a essence -like vortex  
they are all brides  
professional lineages in whose aquatic momenta originate.  
The verdure sun rises protested a sifted point of view electrifies  
even the friendly  
alphabetic region in language  
to which the metaphor  
will not be pacified.  
In the furious night of insufferable railroad track.  
An odor has created inside the shades of cashmire,  
a mixture of moth and body, a enriching  
sun rise that brings panic.  
I salute your loving lemon  
and envy your serendipidous pride.  
As soon as the incoming writings  
gives the aerial indication.  
Has the area been seized with secrets?  
The silence rises in rising your shoulder.  
All love become vinegars.  
You, who is like a coffin oyster among the living of many person.  
  
The friendly poppies abhorred with its clenched refresh I saw how telegraphs are wove  
by the eloquent praise.
