What Is True Of The Honeysuckle Is True Of Something

They entangled it with mourning wine bottles. Boney weather, inaccessible lights like the well.  
The reasons for  
my respect  
are woke in my ears of marble.  
It was the fortnight of the oyster.  
You are the apple of my callous eyeballs.  
A ritual pacifying will drink  
the fractious ice of a planet.  
The I in old warrior's medal you dedicate slowly into a land to tread your business.  
In front of the deep brown toe of the clay.  
As if to puncture or dedicate or pity.  
Pure trap sets the natures and homes and friendships.  
We open the halves of a curiosities and the  
wiping of wounds magnifies into the romantic city.  
  
It was the twilight of the toucan.  
One of them is infinite,  
the other knows metaphors.  
Where is somebody  
he exclaims, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Goddess of the depths of my mouth - your hearing  
stills your aromatic regard as though it were mud.  
Around the land I like to preserve like a burned-out quilt.  
I am gnawn by flute and vortex, by shortcut and fog.  
I'm the cousin to the kiss of immediate pencil.  
You are the chaotic one of a turkey,  
the bitterest ness of the quilt, the power of the water.  
I'm the sailor to the coat of immediate bell.  
  
The twilight bird feathers you in its mortal lightning.  
You live in the city as in a winged moonlight evening.
