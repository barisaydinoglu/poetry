Elders Of A Calculating Country
-------------------------------
Sordid uncles and aunts.  
For me they are side. Outside the abhorring trash barges.  
Halfway.  
Swimming a light  
carried in the nocturnal sunshine.  
To seek another land a enchanting snow of elixirs.  
It was  
a frail business of dung and thorn trees.  
Multitude of sea shells!  
In and out of the cashmire the silvery and the marine  
  
And you mingle like a nature and as soon as the incoming kisses  
gives the individual indication.  
A humble carpet making an acerb thing of a unlikely meeting with a son.  
  
I could circumscribe evil, vigil, and wounded soldier  
from utensils and old warrior's medals  
with a blood colored tryst  
with wounds in my foot.  
And outside my hammock, during the late afternoon, I woke up naked  
and full of joy.
