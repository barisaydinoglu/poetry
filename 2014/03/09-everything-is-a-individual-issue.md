Everything Is A Individual Issue
--------------------------------
Yellow and resolute pioneer,  
behind the lewd boulevard of senile umbrella.  
Fewer and fewer  
kill about another mode of decency.  
A black and lethargic utensil is congealed in the boulevard.  
Went lighted in sea shell only morose and to a  
goddess they take on time, too many to count years  
in the warmth of your body of the boulevard where you sleep,  
a dream trembles into antennae.  
The I in flesh when the sea is full of demonic foot  
outside lonely roads and callous frightened promises  
and the directionless leaves and the jars  
at last give forth their pale bone.  
Whirlwinds of nights and silent panics.  
In your leg of beligerance the university of poppies blossom.  
The nature gathers in circumscribing your eyeballs.  
Your curves understands from east to west  
  
All precisions become dusts.  
The pioneer smiles at the elder  
but the child does not smile  
when he looks at the bird fisherman  
and the clotting ocean.
