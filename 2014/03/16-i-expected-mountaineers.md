I Expected Mountaineers
-----------------------
Wave of wave of moons rolling down the sea. Of your brimstone time when you hold out your fingernails.  
This furious light and circumscribing writing throttles me  
with it's loving grapes like heart and curves  
and dull shades  
of opaque cinnamon productivities like ears and cashmire lakes.  
A neurotic branch day  
in yellow water and sunburst orange old warrior's medals.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.
