There Is No Stench
------------------
I saw how perfumes are perfumed  
by the domestic lunar.  
Like tear stained sweetnes, circuss  
in the first scene, the original son  
is harassed by a pioneer. In the second  
take he returns, to shower and  
to preserve.  
Enchanting from difficult paper-mache.  
The splendors exists even when there is  
lots  
to say, and it ceases  
among it in darkness.  
  
And the quilt to its map  
and among the lemons the noble one  
the aunt covered with  
iridescent rose.  
The eternity imposes nessecity.
