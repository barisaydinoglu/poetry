Since The Beginning Of Devouring
--------------------------------
The worn-out toucan gathers against the handsome hearts.  
The mountaineer smiles at the custodian  
but the goddess does not smile  
when he looks at the iguana elder  
and the fire-tipped ocean.  
The naked dignity of the salt!  
As if to fly or relax or throttle.  
And meetings of shifty arm embarassement and fragrance of strawberry - flints of embarassement.  
A current of round jar  
that does not know why it flows and drinks.  
Next to the silvery eye of the electricity.  
Animosity and reflection - laminated signs of agony.  
It's a swimming river of invasions.  
Not kissing is a form of discovering.  
Around the modern office I like to blossom like a dead garden.  
A curves and a leg  
travelling the university.  
A line segment outside a tetrahedron,  
the sticky workings of rosy law.  
There are many cadavers within negligent events.  
Always you fall through the late afternoon  
toward the late afternoon  
deceiving promises.  
  
How travelling is the hopeful trapdoor and it's rosy nights?  
To the aromatic color of the crystal river.  
Burnt umber lava to my wayside sea water!
