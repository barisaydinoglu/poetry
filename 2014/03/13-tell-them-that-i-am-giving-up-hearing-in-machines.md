Tell Them That I Am Giving Up Hearing In Machines
-------------------------------------------------
I salute your loving sugar  
and envy your pure pride.  
Of sensual grape, spirit  
of the salts,  
bristled son blood, your kisses  
trust into exile  
and a droplet of silk, with remnants of the land.  
There ought to be a evening star of a starry elixir showering in a sea.  
Sometimes a piece of the water  
flies like a goblet in my ears.  
You, who is like a lightning pheasant among the making of many elder.  
From her toe and her arm expand  
river banks of the earth.  
It was a harsh business of croak and cummerbunds.  
Neither forest nor promise nor opaque brimstone  
nor cashmire but sand-colored.  
They wetted it with tremulous suns.  
The key preserves in upgrading your foot.  
  
The sea's  
skin plan that has everyone atrocious.  
Full stop.  
  
To the handsome color of the cork momentum.
