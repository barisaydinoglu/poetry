I Have Gone Recovering
----------------------
Everything mechanical with resolute voices, the salt of the jar  
and piles of parenthetical bread amid holiday.  
The absurd fellowship is domestic on your nose.  
  
Fashion on the felicities that wait for you  
smearing the callous chairs, throttling the doors.  
The order of the flowers what seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
  
What seems simultaneous to one will  
not seem so to another.  
You discover headlong into an area to understand your business.  
Pulsing the atom of her sea shell full of felicity.  
You say, what is the perfume waiting for in its silvery bird feather?  
I tell  
you it is waiting for lighthouse like you.  
A angellic rug making an affluent thing of a lucky meeting with a elder.  
Neither star nor momentum nor dull shades of transparent  
nor silvery but green.  
The chimney among hers  
a history we speak in passing,  
with notions of tiredness  
and a passion for computer science and engineering  
to rise lost yellow cars and for juices.  
  
Quiver of a decayed obscene wine bottle.  
Burnt umber lightning to my lonely atom!
