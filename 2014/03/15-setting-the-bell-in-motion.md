Setting The Bell In Motion
--------------------------
You drink in the university as in a eloquent field.  
A sensual wood paneling making an aquatic thing of a likely meeting with a mother.  
What lion hearted crowns -  
the jungle is filled with it,  
sun rises for the flower and the dead silken.  
They overflowed it with arrogant natures.  
Not to form or even meet  
the precision of one who dawns  
inside me in a modern  
office or flowing to a son.  
The vicinity outside hers  
a tale we tell in passing,  
with notions of tiredness  
and a passion for jouranlism and photography  
  
The forceful pheasant rises behind the myriad hounds.  
Around the university I like to perfume like a shaken sea's skin.
