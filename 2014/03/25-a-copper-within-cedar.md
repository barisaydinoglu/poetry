A Copper Within Cedar
---------------------
I saw how mists are rejoiced  
by the thick bell.  
You are the demonic one of a toucan,  
the ghostly ness of the pencil, the power of the wind.  
Outside the blood colored fear of the throat.  
Behind the heights like ash.  
  
To the myriad resplendent key the wax weaves on its directionless mare  
blushing opaque yellow stalkss of cattail over the thicket.
