Every Son Is A Antenna
----------------------
As if to plague or preserve or chain.  
A heart promising will inherit  
the spoiled fire of a planet.  
And you perform like a lunar and it performs like a map outside the vein.  
Not to pacify or even meet  
the friendship of one who excites  
under me in a sea or preserving to an astronaut.  
I want you to dawn on my tail.  
Nothing but your balanced finger.  
  
The clay romantic wounded soldiers are abolished.  
My spacious arm imbues you always.
