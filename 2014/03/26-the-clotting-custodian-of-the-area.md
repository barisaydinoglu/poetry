The Clotting Custodian Of The Area
----------------------------------
Halfway.  
Where roots meet  
flags meet, outside and in and the sound  
of legless horses, to reach out and kiss in agony.  
Magnifying a writing  
appreciated in the scrupulous rain.  
Blushing the garden of her lighthouse full of tiredness.  
  
Not relaxing is a form of galloping.  
My heart is filled with respect like a gem acrobat.  
Gathering toward the flint the order of the silences and the shades of crimson to its shoreline  
and among the hooves the aquatic one  
the giant covered with changeless telegraph.  
Bitten weather, senile lights like the planetarium.  
A foliage shining will seek  
the absurd electricity of a planet.  
Rambunctious ashes  
and chaotic lampreys.  
And so that its ghosts will lunge your finger.
