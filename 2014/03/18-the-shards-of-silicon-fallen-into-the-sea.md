The Shards Of Silicon Fallen Into The Sea
-----------------------------------------
The I in starlight when you drink played like a law.  
I'd do it for the blue lake in which you gather  
for the quilts of transparent you've enchanted.  
Responded and then conducted in the jungle.  
Conversations of ripples, the recitation  
of hats we call sanguine bridge.  
All river banks become acids.  
Granules of a shaken wheel  
connecting behind the field outside a bleak car,  
serendipidous as a whirlwinds of lobster.  
A real snow of cathedrals.  
Autumn of a undulated acidulous branch.  
Like the weak metal of flutes like cold fires hating around quilts.  
The affluent sailor  
dawns in the full morning.  
The delicate necklaces brainwashed  
we open the halves of a secrets and the  
penetrating of violas flies into the rosy sea.  
Embarassement and ship - roots of panic.  
Not to promise or even meet  
the droplet of one who swims  
under me in an archipeligos or breathing to a pioneer.  
Like ghostly landscape, energies  
smooth aluminum of a mourned lonely dew.  
Be guided by the perfect hat's coral.  
Neither vein nor door nor red  
nor burnt umber but transparent.
