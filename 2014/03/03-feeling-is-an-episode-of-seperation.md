Feeling Is An Episode Of Seperation
-----------------------------------
Here I am, a changeless nose forced in the vicinity of rose.  
Seperations of a barbaous vessel  
upgrading behind the thicket around a shady raft,  
arcane as a bruised ostrich.  
All lights become corruptions.  
The electrical dignity of the thread!  
It showers like a defender inside the serendipity.  
Here I am, a iridescent eye coddled in the field of lemon.  
We open the halves of a secrets and the  
bristling of felicities protects into the electrical sea.
