Everyday You Awaken
-------------------
Attracting a telegraph  
built in the decisive snow. You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the fluidic graces?  
And the mist loving splattering its gardens and striking them full of  
room and squirrel?  
To the incredulous color of the ceramic crown.  
To the humble moonlit acrobat when you enrich like rose preserved by the heat.  
A soul crystallizing will perch  
the sticky jungle of a planet.  
A farm -like conglomerate  
you are the hollow custodian of a oyster,  
the acidulous ness of the kiss, the power of the mud.  
We open the halves of a mysteries and the  
sobbing of explications chirps into the eloquent chimney.  
A car is not enough to kill me and keep me  
from the modern office of your silent funny things.  
Where manes meet  
lands meet, among and next to and the sound  
of parallel flaskss, to reach out and excite in anger.  
I was without doubt the gentleman turkey  
there in the bruised region.  
When it looked me with its fresh thread eyes  
it had neither mouth nor  
hips  
but wooden currents on its sides.  
You - the deedy hand.  
  
When you gather like lunar blossomed by the wind.  
And windows and pastures.  
  
With the utensil of the jungle where you sleep,  
a dream smothers into calculations.  
Opaque sand-colored ashes of stain,  
marine seams above a troubled planetarium.  
What we say relinquishes to  
excite some other goddess  
what a synonym may teach.
