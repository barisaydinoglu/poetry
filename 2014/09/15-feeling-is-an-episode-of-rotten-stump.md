Feeling Is An Episode Of Rotten Stump
-------------------------------------
I want you to reflect on my finger.  
Full stop.  
Nothing but your delicious heart.  
This raucous circus and seizing stone shatters me  
with it's absorbant grapes like eye and hand  
and rust colored threads like hips and spheres.  
The lightning imposes nessecity.  
Pulled out and closed off like an affection.  
It's a travelling praise of lineages.
