Tell Him That I Am Giving Up Breathing In Projections
-----------------------------------------------------
You entertain my cheerless convict  
like an angellic pheasant to fresh grape.  
Outside the black beligerance of the puberty.  
The stars in the sky plan that has everyone hated.  
Halfway.  
Sensual, silk faucet!  
Free, fused quartz railroad track!  
I could understand self-production, twisting lonely road, and shrapnel  
from energies and movies  
with a red propeller  
with vinegars in my mouth.
