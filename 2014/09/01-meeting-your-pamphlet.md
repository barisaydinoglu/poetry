Meeting Your Pamphlet
---------------------
If I could develop the shortcut and the vicinity.  
The conglomerate imposes nessecity.  
Towards those moons of yours that wait for me.  
A fleeting rug making a winged thing of a impossible meeting with a man.  
What we say creates to  
preserve some other god  
what a identity may teach.  
And in my hammock, during the twilight, I woke up naked  
and full of respect.  
Pure cold fire awakens the mosaics it was a careless business of shards of silicon and nights.  
Nothing but that magnolium of old warrior's medals.  
As soon as the incoming hearts  
gives the neutral indication.  
A sweetnes -like beast  
pockets of graphite converted into  
ceramic.  
If you were not the grape the ancient moon  
cooks, sprinkling its wine across the field.  
Dawning from hairy marble.  
Of a black daughter that relinquishes pencils.  
It was the late afternoon of the turkey.  
To the comfortable great key from her leg and her eyeballs perform  
sea water of the earth.  
What spacious shadess of blue -  
the archipeligos is filled with it,  
quilts for the breakfast and the sifted cork.  
Harass  
me and let my substance rejoice.  
She is under us at this moment of first pulsing.  
Blossom on the howls that wait for you  
abandoning the hairy chairs, dropping the doors.  
Which is an angellic goblet of directions  
twenty-seven or thousand, fashioned  
on a flower head or in the sanguine star  
directions of the eyeballs, a calculation in your mouths.  
  
The acidulous crab recovers in  
the middle of the eloquent ghosts.  
And you filtered in the anger and understood an abandoning massacre.  
  
It was the twilight of the jaguar.  
  
A warmth -like hound  
in your shoulder of loathing the field begins to dream of breathing.  
How continuing is the manly vortex and it's electric nights?
