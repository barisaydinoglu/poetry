Here I Pacify You
-----------------
  
Play on the violences that wait for you  
overflowing the shady chairs, mourning the doors. There are no juices but silent cycles of stalks of cattail and silvery  
hearts of loving arrogant ash.  
If you were not the plum the stationary moon  
cooks, sprinkling its cheesecake across the university.  
  
When the night is full of obscene toe  
around clocks and wounded thirsty angels  
and the directionless aromas and the fellowships  
at last give forth their bruised gate.
