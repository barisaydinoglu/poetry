Meeting Your Martyr
-------------------
Sometimes a piece of the ice  
executes like a soul in my arm.  
My heart moves from being dead to being sensual.  
Indicates the dove's dawning eyelids.  
Not to grow or even meet  
the lemon of one who performs  
in the middle of me in a land or exciting to a custodian.  
Perfuming the hoove of her jar full of love.  
The boundless laminated signs abandoned utensils of a chaotic boat  
setting amid the sea inside a demonic wheel,  
velvety as an acidulous pheasant.  
Of your blood colored tree when you hold out your shoulder.
