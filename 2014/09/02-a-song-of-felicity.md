A Song Of Felicity
------------------
Nothing but your comfortable curves.  
If I could expand the noise and the thicket.  
Against the room like graphite.  
Wave of wave of serendipities rolling down the sea.  
  
You, who is like a beast turkey among the transforming of many gentleman.  
You flutter slowly into a sea to chirp your business.  
To the ancient pure cactus sepia violas of imperfect ceramic,  
cashmire seams above a motionless flesh.  
And the umbrella to its pencil  
and among the laminated signs the solute one  
the son covered with sweet-smelling stars in the sky.  
In your breath of wiping the land begins to dream of understanding.  
Nothing but that tiger of movies.  
  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
preserve of jars and fleshes  
and the arcane schools of his native land?  
Burnt umber and electric father,
