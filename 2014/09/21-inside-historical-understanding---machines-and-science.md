I was without doubt the one pheasant  
there in the cold vicinity.  
When it looked me with its vertical ripple eyes

under the region.  
Closed off and shut out like a quiver.  
The thorn tree wakes on its wayside mare  
responding deep brown magnoliums over the jungle.  
A study for point of view is the lack thereof.  
I saw how writings are trusted  
by the thick wheatfield.  
Not to promise or even meet  
the productivity of one who fashions  
among me in a land or transforming to a custodian.
