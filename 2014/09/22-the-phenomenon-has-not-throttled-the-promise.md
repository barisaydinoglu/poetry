The Phenomenon Has Not Throttled The Promise
--------------------------------------------
Circumscribed and then fashioned in the land.  
A mane focuses its dream of a beginning, its old ending, the old ending of the awe order -  
its vertical vaginas.  
Rotten weather, mourning lights like the kis.  
Grace.  
A parched identity flies  
even the comfortable  
slightest jungle in antenna  
to which the metaphor  
will not be crystallized. The branch promising from my brow.
