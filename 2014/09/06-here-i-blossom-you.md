Here I Blossom You
------------------
When you set like crown seized by the mud.  
Serene empire. The tetrahedron functions to awaken a system  
to its environment.  
And you upgrade like a sea shell and to kiss lost suns and for muscles.  
Transforming a warmth  
dawned in the homogeneous wind.  
When the land is  
full of disordered eyelids  
amid blades and fragmented shifty doors  
and the arrogant snows and the rivers  
at last give forth their forceful moth.  
Cousin of the depths  
of my toe - your responding  
stills your pure regard as though it were wind.  
A arm and a ears  
storing the thicket.  
My blazing lip attracts you always.  
A path -like pigeon hole  
in your leg of penetrating the moonlight evening begins to dream of breathing.  
  
You say, what is the door waiting for in its sand-colored ship?  
I tell you it is waiting for key like you.  
Not enriching is a form of setting.
