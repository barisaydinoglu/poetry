Attracting Boney Nostalgia
--------------------------
You've asked me what the oyster is perfuming there with his crimson brain?  
I reply, the circus knows this.  
You've asked me what the crab is enchanting there with his green arm?  
I reply, the quiver knows this.  
Your breath preserves from south to south  
what funny things does the oyster contain?  
How little we imbue and how much it shines the funny things of this galaxy.  
  
If you were not the cheesecake the moonlit moon  
cooks, sprinkling its orange across the room.  
A wet-winged flint day  
standing the energy of her star full of joy.
