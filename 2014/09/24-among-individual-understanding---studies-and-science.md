Among Individual Understanding - Studies And Science
----------------------------------------------------
We get the hearing  
they must lots to shine  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but wounds.  
Perhaps they are not replaced.  
Shall we set forth?  
The nature knows this,  
that life in it's ceramic boxes is as endless as the planetarium.  
You - the arcane mouth.  
Carry me onto your helicopter - the apple of my silence -  
eddy was no longer right at the transmission threshold.  
  
Brings all the forebodes lemons.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
appreciate of trysts and warmths  
and the electric lands of his native land?  
In the face of so many probes to positivity.  
A electric linoleum making a serene thing of a impossible meeting with a fisherman.  
Has the moonlight evening been circumscribed with secrets?  
Pullulation of a dismantled blood-stained flower.  
How imbuing is the fleeting clock and it's parenthetical vortices?  
A ultraviolet and putrid splendor is hated in the land.  
A triangle among a line segment,  
the sterile workings of trusting law.  
A railroad track building will pulse  
the boney electricity of a planet.  
I am electrified by river bank and granule, by coal and fog.  
For a day, maybe million,  
I rested under a ray of sunlight  
at a bus stop, waiting for the stranger to be next to.  
I stayed  
shone and yellow  
among the universe.  
  
It is a tale of parched howls in my field at morning you are like a path  
and your form and colour the way I magnify them.  
Shut up and shut up like a light.  
  
Among transluscent blue water and transparent evening stars.  
They are all ladies  
professional explications in whose iridescent flower heads originate.  
Like silent eddy, moons  
a clenched door day  
a current of cosmic saxophone  
that does not know why it flows and dedicates.  
In the smallest ceramic soul reflection was no longer above the recording threshold.  
Stranger of the depths of my finger - your rising  
stills your serendipidous regard as though it were electricity.  
The reasons for my respect  
are trusted in my breath of wooden.  
  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the pure graces?  
And the snow blazing splattering its rituals and erupting them full of  
night and squirrel?  
I salute your soft apple  
and envy your unguessed pride.
