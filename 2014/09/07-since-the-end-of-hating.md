Since The End Of Hating
-----------------------
As if to bristle or magnify or abolish. In the face of so many alarms to animosity.  
Some gather but I seek your rusted nail like path.  
Burnt umber earth to my nauesous rose!  
The maternity knows this,  
that life in it's bolt of gold boxes is as endless as the coral.  
  
One of them is affluent,  
the other knows sequences.  
Where is everybody  
He quips, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Halfway.
