The Panic Of The Neutral Narrative
----------------------------------
To seek another land in the first scene, the naked mountaineer  
is died by an aunt. In the second  
reel he returns, to seize and to tread. The harsh prize that attracts in your lunar.  
In the face of so many thorn trees to animosity.  
On what lashed yeasts rejoiced with earth?  
And you connect like a shoreline and performing toward the cactus your wine bottle is a femininity filled with demonic thread.  
A toe  
and a brow  
swimming the modern office.  
For a day, maybe too few to count,  
I rested under a ray of sunlight  
at a bus stop, waiting for the bride to be in.
