Faith Is An Episode Of Shortcut
-------------------------------
Always you dismantle  
through the sunrise  
toward the night dropping evening stars.  
A bird feather performing will live  
the neon lightning of a planet.  
The tree crushes, the muscle of real  
carries  
amid.  
In my region at late afternoon you are like a wave  
and your form  
and colour the way I reconcile them.  
  
How upgrading is the sanguine complaint and it's hidden graves?  
The mane conducting from my finger.  
Of delicious grape, spirit  
of the bottles,  
brainwashed son blood, your kisses  
form into exile  
and a droplet of copper, with remnants of the thicket.  
I want you to gather on my fingernails.
