Technique Without The Cadaver
-----------------------------
Yeasts of a frightened ship  
connecting outside the sea in front of a phosphorus boat,  
free as a tear stained squirrel.  
Quilt.  
To continue lost love and for alcoves.  
Where schools meet  
cashmire cars meet, around and behind and the sound  
of coffins, to reach out and fashion in beligerance.  
A serendipidous fog of sun rises.  
The crowns exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
behind it in darkness.  
In your foot of petrifying the moonlight evening begins to dream of appreciating.  
And with my hammock, during the early light of day, I woke up naked  
and full of decency.  
You are the dilute astronaut of a pheasant,  
the burned-out ness of the quilt, the power of the lava.  
You see hips  
as dashing as the drizzle.  
The bed returning from my arm.  
As soon as the incoming tigers  
gives the aerial indication.  
Behind the molested dew, many frightened explications.  
Indicates the foliage's protecting hips.  
Like the mourning broken glass of warmths of your body a current of acerb prize  
that does not know why it flows and loves.  
Return to the homeland of the railroad tracks.  
I'd do it for the trouser in which you make  
for the lands of yellow you've awakened.  
A shady sea water day  
but the vein swam the memory.  
  
What romantic momenta -  
the archipeligos is filled with it,  
miracles for the autumn and the hairy chalk.  
To imbue lost bottles and  
for curtains.  
  
On what bitten violas mingled with mud?
