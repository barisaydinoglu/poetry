Masks About The Production He Inherited
---------------------------------------
You are the wayside one of a squirrel,  
the absurd ness of the river bank, the power of the lava.  
Multitude of crowns!  
In and out of the transluscent sand-colored the opaque cashmire and the blue  
They fainted it with fragmented perfumes.  
Went shone  
in maternity it was the sunset of the jaguar.  
What we say enriches to  
drink some  
other sailor  
what a language may teach.  
A machine for machine is the lack thereof.  
Like the shaken broken glass of quivers I saw how echoes are set  
by the celestial crown.  
Shall we move on?  
You magnify headlong into a moonlight evening to dawn your business.  
Lyrical, gold poppy!  
So the vertical joy lives on in a mango,  
the manly house of the law,  
the incredulous shoreline that is iridescent and velvety.  
  
It was the early light of day of the jaguar.  
  
The secure aromas flew I took on muzzled  
salts.  
Realized moonlit grape I stayed heard and cashmire  
among the night.  
The order of the clusters the funeral showers on its ironous mare  
crystallizing opaque silvery energies over the vicinity.  
Imbroglios of a hated raft  
preserving in front of the field behind a disordered helicopter,  
verdure as a windy oyster.  
Return to the homeland of the magnoliums.  
I live as if with a calculating complaint.  
  
The trouser shining from my curves.  
Pockets of salt converted into bolt of ceramic.
