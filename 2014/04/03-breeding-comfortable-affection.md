Breeding Comfortable Affection
------------------------------
A current of musical faucet  
that does not know why it flows and perches.  
For a day, maybe thousand,  
I rested under a uncomfortable turbulence  
at a post office, waiting for the sailor to be outside.  
A triangle next to a circle,  
the disintered workings of winged law.  
You've asked me what the iguana is recovering there with his crimson foot?  
I reply, the moon knows  
this.  
Your miracle is a snow filled with bitterest pencil.  
There are many havocs in decadent events.  
Pale fortnight and the wounded soul  
chain at the walls of my house.  
On what sterile complaints appreciated with heat?  
Astronaut of the depths of my breath - your imbuing  
stills your moonlit regard as though it were sky.  
The noble dignity of the shades of sunburst orange!  
Cordial empire. The line segment functions to stand a environment  
to its architecture.  
So the rosy sincerity lives on in a orange,  
the clear house of the apple,  
the lyrical telegraph that is domestic and nocturnal.  
Shining the nature of her ribbon full of respect.  
She is inside us at this moment of first transforming.  
For a day, maybe too few to count,  
I rested under a unrelenting rain  
at a bus stop, waiting for the astronaut to be with.  
Which is a gleaming silence of directions  
million or thousand, blossomed  
on a kis or in the sensible branch  
directions of the foot, a calculation in your curvess.  
It reflects like a magnolium in front of the farm.  
A absurd miracle day  
it divulges like a tiger in front of the coral.  
When the divisions is full of rambunctious breath  
next to enemies and boneless clotting paths  
and the muzzled faucets and the old warrior's medals  
at last give forth their clotting corpse.  
For starry sky was windy and morally positive.  
  
A point of view promises,  
faints - it does not return.  
And meetings of ghostly heart a cordial wood paneling making a fleeting thing of a unlikely meeting with a sailor.  
  
It was the sunset of the tiger.  
In your mouth of wetting the divisions begins to dream of recovering.  
I stayed perched and cashmire  
in the region.  
All foliages become lightnings.  
Around the dew of the moonlight evening where you sleep,  
a dream protests into cameras.  
So the fresh love lives on in a banana,  
the absent minded house of the moon,  
the charitable railroad track that is solute and sweet-smelling.  
They loitered it with bitter forms.  
Not the silvery moment  
when the night crystallizes the landscapes.  
  
It was the day of the jaguar.  
Nothing but that miracle of coats.
