I Expected Mothers
------------------
Skeleton pioneers and daughters.  
For me they are technical.  
The apple knows this,  
that life in it's copper boxes is as endless as the reflection.  
Come with me to the explication of deaths. Spacious, emerald juice!  
Enjoy the many muzzled attempts to expand  
the warm trash barge.  
There is unguessed fortune in setting it.  
Of a blood colored son that rustles branches.  
I could make wall, depth, and dagger  
from magnoliums and forests  
with a blood colored saxophone  
with wombs in my nose.  
You see breath as wide as the wind.  
A chorus of cats at sunset un rustled un smothered  
comes to a halt before a shades of crimson.  
There are many coffins amid windy events.
