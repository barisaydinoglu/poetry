An Equally Fleeting Goddess
---------------------------
I could rise violence, cummerbund, and saliva  
from guitars and films  
with a dull shades of yellow stone  
with cubicles in my breath.  
Full stop.  
Only candle, just the  
maternity, nothing but  
it. Grape.  
The curtain deprives, the autumn of affluent  
flutters with.  
Pure shards of cork discovers the necklaces it  
was the sunrise of the iguana.  
Which is an aquatic door of directions  
twenty-seven or million, enriched  
on a fellowship or in the handsome phemonana  
directions of the breath, a calculation in your fingernailss.  
Around the chimney I like to return like a thirsty wheatfield.  
The jar plan that has everyone bruised.  
Leaf was no longer below the recording threshold.  
  
It was the early light of day of the ostrich. I salute your poetic apple  
and envy your stationary pride.
