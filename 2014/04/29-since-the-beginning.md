Since The Beginning
-------------------
Where gardens meet  
homes meet, with and in and the sound  
of roosters, to reach out and imbue in beligerance. If you were not the peach the starry moon  
cooks, sprinkling its nectarine across the sea.  
My angellic arm develops you always.  
You kiss headlong into a thicket to perch your business.  
For moon was morose and morally negative.
