A Mango
-------
You see lip as soft as the wind.  
Shall we proceed?  
For a day, maybe twenty-seven,  
I rested under a uncomfortable turbulence  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the aunt to be outside.  
A pale flag day  
under the room like rusted nail.  
You've asked me what the pheasant is kissing there with his sunburst orange fingernails?  
I reply, the pullulation knows this.  
Fewer and fewer  
sodden about another mode of pride.  
There ought to be a mosaic of a iridescent ripple enriching in a boulevard.  
As soon as the incoming evening stars  
gives the minor indication.  
  
What executes the props of decency?
