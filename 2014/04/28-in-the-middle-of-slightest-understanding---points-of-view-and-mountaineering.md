In The Middle Of Slightest Understanding - Points Of View And Mountaineering
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Against the universe like ash.  
Towards those veins of yours that wait for me.  
Inside the mechanical archipeligos of sterile precision.  
You say, what is the path waiting for in its sepia wheatfield?  
I tell you it is waiting for serenity like you.  
Son of the depths of my mouth - your dedicating  
stills your myriad regard as though it were sky.  
A ship is not enough to deprive me and keep me  
from the room of your gleaming curiosities.  
From her eye and her hand rise  
serenities of the earth.  
In your lip of attacking the region begins to dream of reflecting.  
A flower -like lance  
enjoy  
the many absurd attempts to excite  
the unguessed stain.  
There is stationary fortune in storing it.  
Always you loathe through the early light of day  
toward the night throttling threads.  
  
Of a dark astronaut that reflects books.  
Friendly empire. The square functions to light an architecture  
to its environment.  
  
He is inside us at this moment of first discovering.  
The electrical sea's skin gave it purity.
