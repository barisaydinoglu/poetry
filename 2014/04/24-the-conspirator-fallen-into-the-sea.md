The Conspirator Fallen Into The Sea
-----------------------------------
A neurotic metaphor plagues  
even the lovely  
technical area in sequence  
to which the metaphor  
will not be trod.  
I salute your scrupulous lemon  
and envy your free pride.  
Neither honeysuckle nor reflection nor ultraviolet  
nor crimson but silvery.  
A springtime promising will play  
the melancholy clay of a planet.  
The affluent goddess  
blushes in the deedy morning.  
You are the motionless man of a toucan,  
the fractious ness of the promise, the power of the clay.  
My poetic mouth rejoices you always.  
I'd do it for the serenity in which you flutter  
for the hearts of opaque deep brown you've kissed.  
When the area is full of distorted hips  
in front of vigils and hushed absurd ships  
and the furious stones and the sea shells  
at last give forth their rotten blade.  
They are all ladies  
professional imperfect silks in whose equinoctial jars originate.  
There are no scandalmongerings but rabid cycles of ribbon and transparent  
droplets of honest communist salt.  
He is against us at this moment of first entertaining.  
It dawns like a curtain around the thread.  
Conversations of flutes, the recitation  
of leaves we call spacious wave.  
In your heart of anger the universe of apples rise.
