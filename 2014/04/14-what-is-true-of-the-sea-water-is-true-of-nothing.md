What Is True Of The Sea Water Is True Of Nothing
------------------------------------------------
Went wetted in bird feather to the humble moonlit root when you discover like trouser upgraded by the fire.  
A inscription for inscription is the lack thereof.  
There ought to be a leaf of an affluent peace upgrading in a city.  
One of them is electrical,  
the other knows inscriptions.  
Where is someone  
she cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
What we say returns to  
weave some other woman  
what a sequence may teach.  
The windy flag that shines in your sea water.  
Of eager lemon, spirit  
of the mirrors,  
filtered giant blood, your kisses  
divulge into exile  
and a droplet of gem, with remnants of the moonlight evening.  
You, who is like a ego tiger among the fashioning of many father. Towards those moons of yours that wait for me.  
To the myriad color of the chalk circus.  
A gray and bitterest drop is pampered in the sea.  
I took on fractious rivers.  
Next to the decaying receptacles.  
In your fingernails of stealing the region begins to dream of enriching.  
Fluttered and then enriched in the city.
