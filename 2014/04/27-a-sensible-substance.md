A Sensible Substance
--------------------
And meetings of communist arm what curiosities does the toucan contain?  
How little we wake and how much it returns the secrets of this computer simulation.  
Noone here is waiting for  
the next fountain.  
Dove. You chirped yourself for perching.  
An odor has stored against the rose,  
a mixture of wax and body, a developing  
root that brings fear.  
Sometimes a piece of the heat  
dismantles like a telegraph in my nose.
