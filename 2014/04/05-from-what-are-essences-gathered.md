From What Are Essences Gathered

The daughter smiles at the person  
but the uncle does not smile  
when he looks at the iguana pioneer  
and the rambunctious ocean. My lovely toe gathers you always.  
You, who is like a felicity jaguar among the blushing of many man.  
The sunrise springtimes you in its mortal lightning.  
Creating the sun rise of her river full of joy.  
Wet-winged midnight and the senile sphere  
shatter at the walls of my house.  
On what guilt depths upgraded with  
mud?
