The Mysteries Of The University
-------------------------------
And within my hammock, during the day, I woke up naked  
and full of sincerity.  
To seek another land a free drizzle of threads.  
Carried and then sought in the land.  
With the horse of the modern office where you sleep,  
a dream strikes into images.
