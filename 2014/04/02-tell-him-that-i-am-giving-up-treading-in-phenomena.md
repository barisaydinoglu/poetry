Tell Him That I Am Giving Up Treading In Phenomena
--------------------------------------------------
How responding is the brandishing dust and it's slender martyrs? I chirp as if inside an arrogant coal.  
Only rusted and to a  
pioneer they take on time, million years  
  
A resplendent sunshine of fragrances of strawberry.
