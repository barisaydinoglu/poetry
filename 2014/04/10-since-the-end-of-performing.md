Since The End Of Performing
---------------------------
Blue and deedy uncle,  
panic  
and telegraph - sea water of fear.  
The musical vein gave it joy.  
And meetings of misunderstood fingernails as soon as the incoming umbrellas  
gives the public indication.  
Energy of a conquered insatiable energy.  
Respect is gone, the subject has breathed.  
  
All acrobats become lightnings.  
Once there was an acidulous man who  
gathered at parties, sitting in a line segment, among telegraphs.
