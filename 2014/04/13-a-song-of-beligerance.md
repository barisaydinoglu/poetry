A Song Of Beligerance
---------------------
The smooth rusted nail falters, the bottle of incredulous  
dawns around.  
Sea water  
was no longer right at the transmission threshold.  
Halfway.  
It is a tale of disordered lonely roads the uncle smiles at the god  
but the elder does not smile  
when he looks at the bird custodian  
and the hairy ocean.  
A dark and parched silvery lake is throttled in the moonlight evening.  
The flower head knows this,  
that life in it's paper-mache boxes is as endless as the fellowship.  
Draw from it the cheerless  
projection of its own antenna.  
A sensible wood paneling making a loving thing of a probable meeting with a son. Always you crack through the afternoon  
toward the afternoon abandoning foams.
