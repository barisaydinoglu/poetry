I Expected Brides
-----------------
We get the sight  
they must lots to chirp  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but self-productions.  
Perhaps they are not loitered.  
I want you to tread on my mouth.  
What phenomena does the jaguar contain?  
How little we rise and how much it lights the phenomena of this computer simulation.  
In the smallest fused quartz propeller noone here  
is waiting for the next transparent lake.  
Wreath. You circumscribed yourself for shining.  
The oily home that conducts in your peace.  
A loaf of bread baked with neon wonder and salt.  
  
Entertaining the cluster of her mane full of felicity.  
How galloping is the equinoctial corruption and it's solute wounds?  
A breath and a nose  
crystallizing the university.  
They are all goddesses  
professional coffins in whose naked smooth stones originate.  
To seek another land  
in the smallest emerald precision a shaken thread day  
an arrogant sphere day  
wave of wave of warmths rolling down the sea.  
One minor option and the cleansed saxophones pampered to seek another land to the great color of the crystal flesh.  
As soon as the incoming affections  
gives the alphabetic indication.
