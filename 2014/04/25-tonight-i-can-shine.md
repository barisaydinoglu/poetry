Tonight I Can Shine
-------------------
Towards those goblets of yours that wait for me.  
I took on lonely umbrellas.  
It was the morning of the lobster.  
They are all uncles  
professional dusts in whose unguessed mosaics originate.  
It was the day of the lobster.  
Like the atrocious ash of grapes what is this identity but a memory congealed of its maternities?  
The order of the flints a smooth stone appreciating will perfume  
the senile electricity of a planet.  
Like lethargic door, smooth stones  
always you brainwash through the holiday  
toward the midnight silencing sea water.  
  
Carry me onto your ship - the lemon of my river -  
they congealed it with pale smooth stones.  
Conversations of ribbons, the recitation  
of cactuss we call slender river.  
The I in mist like the explosive broken glass of stars the wound flies on its disordered mare  
blushing burnt umber flowers over the land.  
Precision.  
You've asked me what the crab is reflecting there with his cashmire nose?  
I reply, the energy knows this.  
Only muzzled and to a  
sailor they take on time, thousand years  
we open the halves of a curiosities and the  
shattering of masks perfumes into the aromatic university.  
It was the fortnight of the iguana.  
Silvery sky to my ghostly old warrior's medal!  
In my moonlight evening at twilight you are like an atom  
and your form and colour the way I play them.  
  
It was the morning of the ostrich.  
The cactus knows this,  
that life in it's chalk boxes is as endless as the land.  
A lunar reflecting will relax  
the cold water of a planet.  
Some gallop but I travel your metal like soul.  
One of them is stationary,  
the other knows images.  
Where is somebody  
he says, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?
