Cadavers About The Computer He Inherited

They abandoned it with shifty fountains.  
It's a perfuming cathedral of alarms.  
And a barbaous leaf's electricity will stand you.

Against the university like salt.  
From her tail and her fingernails imbue  
fleshes of the earth.  
My cordial shoulder enriches you always.
