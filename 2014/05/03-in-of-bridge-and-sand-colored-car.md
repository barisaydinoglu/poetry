In Of Bridge And Sand-colored Car
---------------------------------
Thirsty afternoon and the hushed flower head  
shatter at the walls of my house.  
There ought to be a breakfast of a smooth bird feather re-covering in a jungle.  
I do not condemn in the heights of oily enemy.  
Inside the wet-winged field of tear stained fountain.  
I want you to hear on my hips.  
I stayed heard and marine  
in the middle of the chimney.
