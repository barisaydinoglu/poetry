Shaken Honeysuckle
------------------
Here I am, a human arm condemned in the jungle of essence.  
In the smallest copper stars in the sky there are many lineages with wet-winged events.  
Acidulous corpses and dead throats.  
One neutral option and  
kiss on the invasions that wait for you  
dropping the melancholy chairs, falling the doors.  
It was the fortnight of the jaguar.  
Inherited and then rustled in the land.  
Return to the homeland of the faucets.  
  
It was the lunchtime of the pheasant.  
The billows of blood colored smoke imposes nessecity.  
Of poetic bread, spirit  
of the sweetness,  
died man blood, your kisses  
attract into exile  
and a droplet of marble, with remnants of the chimney.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
A grape focuses its dream of a new ending, its old ending, the new beginning of the autumn order -  
its original stalactites.  
A camera for production is the lack thereof.  
The oily flint is indespensable on your eyelids.  
When you stand fashioned like a root.  
From pillow of fog to ray of sunlight,  
hidden flags drawn by warm channels, a  
arrogant acrobat begins to protect.
