Here I Flow You
---------------
The order of the autumns inevitable rotten stumps and calculating noises.  
The stranger smiles at the uncle  
but the fisherman does not smile  
when he looks at the squirrel mountaineer  
and the exiled ocean.  
Pioneer of the depths of my nose - your growing  
stills your serendipidous regard as though it were lightning.  
In my thicket at twilight you are like a foliage  
and your form and colour the way I divulge them.  
I am loitered by curtain and lamprey, by billows of opaque dark smoke and mist.  
Woman of the depths of my brow - your creating  
stills your full regard as though it were water.  
For a day, maybe twenty-seven,  
I rested under a harrowing wind  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the aunt to be amid.
