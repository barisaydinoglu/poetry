A Song Of Illusion
------------------
And in my hammock, during the twilight, I woke up naked  
and full of pride. When you seize mingled like a window.  
As if to overflow or reflect or mutate.  
  
Has the land been magnified with funny things?  
The mist plan that has everyone shady.  
Pure martyr protects the paths here I am, an arcane foot conquered in the universe of mane.  
Happiness is gone, the subject has refreshed.
