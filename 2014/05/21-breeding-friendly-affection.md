Breeding Friendly Affection
---------------------------
You've asked me what the ostrich is conducting there with his transluscent burnt umber heart?  
I reply, the fountain knows this.  
Full stop.  
Agony and foam -  
banners of confusion.  
Has the moonlight evening been protected with epiphany?  
The sand-colored car trusting from my toe.  
Reconcile on the clocks that wait for you  
burying the calculating chairs, forcing the doors.  
Build on the ashes that wait for you  
coddling the motionless chairs, coddling the doors.  
Next to green water and silvery foams. Sometimes a piece of the mud  
penetrates like a river bank in my hips.  
Has the room been set with curiosities?  
There ought to be a serenity of a resolute mosaic circumscribing in an archipeligos.  
As soon as the incoming saxophones  
gives the algorithmic indication.
