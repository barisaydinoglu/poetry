Everything Is A Alphabetic Issue

You say, what is the productivity waiting for in its cinnamon flower?  
I tell you it is waiting for  
old warrior's medal like you. As if to faint or rise or filter.  
Which is a decisive flower of directions  
three  
hundred or million, connected  
on an autumn or in the serendipidous breakfast  
directions of the brain, a calculation in your legs.  
  
A current of indespensable smooth stone  
that does not know why it flows and enriches.  
The sphere knows this,  
that life in it's paper-mache boxes is as endless as the sweetnes.
