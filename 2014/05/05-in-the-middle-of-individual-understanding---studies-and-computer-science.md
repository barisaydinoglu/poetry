A train is not enough to force me and keep me  
from the night of your ancient epiphany.  
Towards those  
souls of yours that wait for me.  
The sunrise phemonanas you in its mortal fire.  
A harsh tree day  
it reconciles like a guitar outside the rose.  
Brings all the abolishes apples. Multitude of praises!  
In and out of the opaque cinnamon the yellow and the transluscent blue
