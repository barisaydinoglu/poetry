Some Motionless Conduct
-----------------------
The splendors exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
next to it in darkness.  
The bitten ostrich crystallizes in the steady abberations.  
The order  
of the landscapes ghostly weather, skeleton lights like the apple.  
A hips and a nose  
kissing the thicket.  
And meetings of bitterest hips gathering from bruised saphire.  
When you transform like pasture grew by the fire.  
All autumns become egoes.  
All starry skies become imbroglios.  
Fire-tipped violences and banal trashes.  
Some perfume but I light your rusted nail like sea's skin.  
And jars and springtimes.  
Angel.  
A blue candle flutters.
