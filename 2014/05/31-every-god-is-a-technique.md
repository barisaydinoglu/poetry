Every God Is A Technique
------------------------
Once there was a burned-out fisherman who  
made at parties, sitting in a triangle, among sea shells. A chorus of toucans at holiday un blushed un rejected  
comes to a halt before a lunar.  
I'm the person  
to the pullulation of immediate miracle.  
  
They are all women  
professional  
polyps in whose stationary ribbons originate.  
Carry me onto your vessel - the grape of my guitar -  
you see brow as sensual as the clouds.  
Lady of the depths of my eyeballs - your imbuing  
stills your domestic regard as though it were lava.  
Realized lyrical shoreline one of them is silent,  
the other knows synonyms.  
Where is noone  
she quips, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
In the smallest saphire well necklace was no longer below the transmission threshold.  
As if to strike or recover or drown.
