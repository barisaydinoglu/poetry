Tonight I Can Perch
-------------------
Standing toward the bottle you stand in the universe as in a delicate chimney.  
Not upgrading is a form of relinquishing.  
Within the landscape  
of the universe where you sleep,  
a dream  
abolishes into productions.  
But the starlight seized the memory.  
For a day, maybe thousand,  
I rested under a palm tree leaf  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the father to be inside.  
To the natural color of the glass angel.  
The oblivion imposes nessecity.  
You, who is like a dagger tiger among the shining of many person.  
Has the heights been connected with secrets?  
One individual option and under the night like sand.  
It promises like an angel among the elixir.
