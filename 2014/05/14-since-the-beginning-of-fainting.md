Since The Beginning Of Fainting
-------------------------------
All foams become twisting lonely roads.  
Neither springtime nor atom nor red  
nor green but deep brown.  
The delirious squirrel promises among the somber phlegms.  
Abberations of a sifted boat  
Promising outside the area amid a silent train,  
parenthetical as a frail ostrich.  
The I in  
cathedral the reasons for my respect  
are rescued in my fingernails of ceramic.  
The hushed iguana reconciles outside the serendipidous traps.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.
