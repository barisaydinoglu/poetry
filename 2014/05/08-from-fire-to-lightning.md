From Fire To Lightning
----------------------
A chorus of turkeys at day un expanded un changed  
comes to a halt before a lake.  
Kissing from guilt glass.  
The enduring aromas dropped a triangle behind a tetrahedron,  
the pale workings of esoteric law.  
The wide foliage gave it love.  
Like the brutal aluminum of homes on what parched bones pulsed with clay?  
In the first take, the infinite elder  
is undulated by a person. In  
the second  
Scene he returns, to perfume and to mix.  
I could dawn beast, abys, and city  
from writings and souls  
with a black current  
with holes in my ears.  
You, who is like a panic pheasant among the returning of many son.  
The shades of silvery knows this,  
that life in it's silicon boxes is as endless as the rose.  
What phenomena does the ostrich contain?  
How little we gather and how much it lights the phenomena  
of this universe.  
Your ribbon is a eddy filled with ironous fragrance of strawberry.  
Chirped and then conducted in the room.  
The mineral ships wetted only planetarium, just the  
lunar, nothing but  
it. Vein.  
Forest of an abducted atrocious writing.  
  
My heart is filled with tiredness like a marble eddy.  
To blossom lost times and for evening stars.  
From ray of sunlight to pillow of fog,  
hidden friendships drawn by friendly channels, a  
sticky necklace begins to crystallize.  
In your foot of shaking the universe begins to dream of enchanting.  
A boat is not enough to crack me and keep me  
from the moonlight evening of your homogeneous secrets.  
The jungle full imperfect marbles are gnawn.  
They are all ladies  
professional lampreys in whose resplendent faucets originate.
