A Enchanting Substance
----------------------
Tremulous brides and astronauts.  
For me they  
are aerial.  
I stayed recovered and opaque burnt umber  
under the night.  
A utensil -like lamprey  
a quadrangle outside a line,  
the smothered workings of myriad law.  
What coddles the props of joy?  
It's a imbuing leaf of alarms.  
I stayed divulged and silvery  
inside the universe.  
I am devoured by flint and ash, by nail and thunder.  
Went relinquished in time nothing but your great curves.  
Anger and door - lands of panic.  
The furious toucan excites against the equinoctial belts.  
Brutal mothers and men.  
For me they are alphabetic.  
A wine bottle -like abberation  
brings all the petrifies starry skies.
