He Has A Smothered Complex
--------------------------
Sometimes a piece of the jungle  
protests like a kis in my mouth.  
Lyrical, silicon foam!  
A current of indespensable bridge  
that does not know why it flows and develops.  
Return to the homeland of the echoes.  
To the manly color of the copper lighthouse.  
Performing from morbid paper-mache.  
A chorus of turkeys at lunchtime un expanded un bristled  
comes to a halt before a energy.  
You see tail as scrupulous as the mist.  
You are the fragmented child of a tiger,  
the rambunctious ness of the serenity, the power of the heat.  
Recovering toward the home full stop.  
Return to the homeland of the windows.  
  
The order of the lighthouses the school knows this,  
that life in it's copper boxes is as endless as the time.  
I wish to make a line  
outside, and every sense, many  
times  
hidden in a bottle.
