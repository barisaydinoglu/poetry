The Thorn Tree Fallen Into The Sea
----------------------------------
Wave of wave of cactuss rolling down the sea.  
My starry finger continues you always.  
But the miracle lighted the memory.  
A boat is not  
enough to fly me and keep me  
from the region of your charitable epiphany.  
You recover slowly into a land to pulse your business.  
In front of the marine brain of the fire.  
As soon as the incoming coats  
gives the technical indication.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
imbue of roots and times  
and the full bottles of his native land?  
A whirlwinds of detail strikes  
even the sanguine  
grammatic divisions in image  
to which the metaphor  
will not be perfumed.  
I want you to perch on my heart.  
In the smallest chalk drop to seek another land like the sifted metal of phemonanas I'm the sailor to the guitar of immediate sea shell.  
A shoulder and a breath  
enchanting the vicinity.  
Not the marine moment  
when the late afternoon promises the veins.
