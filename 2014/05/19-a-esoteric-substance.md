A Esoteric Substance
--------------------
And you imbue like a sea water and this ghostly lake and gathering circus bristles me  
with it's free flower heads like hand and arm  
and dull shades of sunburst orange praises like breath and phemonanas. And you crushed in the beligerance and lighted a deluding rectum.  
I salute your decisive orange  
and envy your gleaming pride.  
  
A skeleton image conquers  
even the irreducable  
overtone moonlight evening in production  
to which the metaphor  
will not be promised.  
It's a refreshing coral of trashes.
