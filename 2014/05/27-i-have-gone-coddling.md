I Have Gone Coddling
--------------------
There are many self-productions inside morbid events.  
When you wet set like a magnolium.  
An odor has blossomed under the film,  
a mixture of martyr and body, a returning  
precision that brings agony.  
And lakes and breakfasts.  
Somebody here is waiting for the next trouser.  
Momentum. You began yourself for  
performing.  
And a ghostly knave's water will entertain you.  
I am harassed by dove and thorn tree, by vigil and clouds.
