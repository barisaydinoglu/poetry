Since The Beginning Of Smothering
---------------------------------
Felicity is gone, the subject has perched.  
I'd do it for the sun rise in which you enchant  
for the breakfasts of deep brown you've discovered.  
It pacifies like a sea's skin outside  
the nature.  
On what forceful bones swam with lava?  
Neither eddy nor alcove nor brimstone  
nor cinnamon but marine.  
Our new dew, our trusting autumn line segments.  
A signal for machine is the lack thereof.
