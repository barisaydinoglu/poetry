A Cork Within Diamond
---------------------
The I in utensil a romantic drizzle of currents.  
In my room at morning you are like a energy  
and your form and colour the way I perfume them.  
What freezes the props of honor?  
And the film to its productivity  
and among the wreaths the noble one  
the man covered with absorbant rose.  
A reflection -like clock  
I divulge as if among a molested eternity.  
The flower head lighting from my curves.  
Like imbroglios filtering behind starss in the sky.
