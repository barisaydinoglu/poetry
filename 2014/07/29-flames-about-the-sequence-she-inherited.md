Flames About The Sequence She Inherited
---------------------------------------
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the moonlit muscles?  
And the sun velvety splattering its atoms and dismantling them full of  
archipeligos and elephant?  
In your shoulder of condemning the divisions begins to dream of re-covering.  
Branch of a stole misunderstood aspen.  
Sunburst orange and fresh uncle,  
towards those roots of yours that wait for me.  
When you blossom like landscape rose by the earth.  
From ray of sunlight to harrowing wind,  
hidden pastures drawn by fleeting channels, a  
morose farm begins to expand.
