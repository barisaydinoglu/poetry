Every Person Is A Language
--------------------------
The silence pulses in travelling your heart.  
So the promising sincerity lives  
on in a banana,  
the scrupulous house of the utensil,  
the sensible starlight that is fresh and indespensable.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
If I could perfume the imbroglio and the boulevard.
