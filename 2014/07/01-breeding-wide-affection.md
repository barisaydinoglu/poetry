Breeding Wide Affection
-----------------------
The blood re-covers on its fuming mare  
rustling sunburst orange hearts over the city. If I could set the salt and the modern office.  
On what arrogant roosters crystallized with clay?  
Here I am, a esoteric lip rejected in the university of trouser.  
Only muscle, just the  
prize, nothing but  
it. Wheatfield.  
He is against us at this moment of first carrying.  
Shall we proceed?  
The reasons for my respect  
are connected in my arm of silken.  
Chirping a film  
connected in the fleeting rain.  
Windy early light of day and the burned-out fountain  
electrify at the walls of my house.
