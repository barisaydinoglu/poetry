The Secrets Of The Boulevard
----------------------------
Nothing but your balanced fingernails.  
Conversations of wine bottles, the recitation  
of eddies we call natural heart.  
I am undulated by lighthouse and vinegar, by wound and sunshine.  
Not the opaque deep brown moment  
when the morning recovers the angels.  
Of serendipidous lemon, spirit  
of the telegraphs,  
conquered gentleman blood, your kisses  
blossom into exile  
and a droplet of cedar, with remnants of the heights.  
Transparent and careful uncle,  
realized sensible grape and the poppy to its flesh  
and among the perfumes the romantic one  
the sailor covered with mineral time.  
I do not reject in the field of ironous ego.  
There are no puberties but distorted cycles of lemon and cashmire  
juices of sweet-smelling decadent metal.  
What deforms the props of honor?  
Pockets of iron converted into paper-mache.  
And you rejected in the illusion and seized a killing howl.
