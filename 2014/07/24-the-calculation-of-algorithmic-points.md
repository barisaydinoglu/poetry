The Calculation Of Algorithmic Points
-------------------------------------
Like salts deluding inside lighthouses.  
Of a dark uncle that travels threads.  
A eloquent clouds of waves.  
Multitude of sun rises!  
In and out of the opaque sepia the transluscent sand-colored and the yellow  
mane of a died decadent stars in the sky.
