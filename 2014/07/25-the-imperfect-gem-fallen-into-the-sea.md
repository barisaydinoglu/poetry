The Imperfect Gem Fallen Into The Sea
-------------------------------------
In your eyelids of beligerance the thicket of gardens create.  
This silent book and waking pasture coagulates me  
with it's poetic windows like hips and brain  
and dark keys like nose and umbrellas.  
Pockets of ash converted into marble.  
Conversations of reflections, the recitation  
of sea shells we call sensual hoove.  
Realized enduring magnolium you are the hollow mother of a oyster,  
the skeleton ness of the momentum, the power of the water.  
They impaled it with frail graces.  
  
So the stationary sincerity lives on in a tomato,  
the hopeful house of the momentum,  
the celestial cactus that is thick and irreducable.  
We get the faith  
they must lots to tread  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but evils.  
Perhaps they are not drowned.  
The soft astronaut  
gathers in the naked morning.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the affluent perfumes?  
And the thunder gleaming splattering its splendors and protesting them full of  
area and bird?  
  
In the entangling flames.  
I'd do it for the warmth of your body in which you live  
for the serenities of crimson you've responded.
