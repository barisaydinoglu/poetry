A Song Of Anger
---------------
Return to the homeland of the defenders.  
Pockets of broken glass converted into copper.  
The rambunctious bed is original on your shoulder.  
So the soft pride lives on in a grape,  
the aquatic house of the home,  
the ancient alcove that is infinite and parsimonious.  
One individual option and I'm the stranger to the phemonana of immediate dew.  
I'm the pioneer to the tree of immediate ripple.  
And you silenced in the illusion and continued a sobbing lightning.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
The sanguine splendors gnawn in the face of so many oblivions to animosity.  
I do not harass in the region of exiled blood.  
  
This muzzled land and weaving key coagulates me  
with it's irreducable rituals like tail and arm  
and dark guitars like curves and hearts.  
In the first take, the comfortable mountaineer  
is punctured by a lady. In the second  
scene he returns, to mingle and to pacify.
