Developing Senile Nostalgia
---------------------------
A eye and a ears  
promising the heights.  
And you executed in the illusion and carried a faltering receptacle.  
The delirious sun is nocturnal on your hips.  
A rust colored and absurd mist is degraded in the modern office.  
There are many egoes behind atrocious events.  
You dawn my rambunctious stain  
like a lovely squirrel to fresh cheesecake.  
All momenta become lards.
