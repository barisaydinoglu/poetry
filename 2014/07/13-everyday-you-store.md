Everyday You Store

He is under us at this moment of first breathing.  
Like receptacles dismantling among farms.  
Enjoy the many atrocious attempts to pacify  
the gleaming felicity.  
There is domestic fortune in connecting it.  
A study for calculation is the lack thereof.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the secure silences?  
And the mist slender splattering its flutes and ignoring them full of  
university and cat?  
Multitude of starss in the sky!  
In and out of the yellow the cashmire and the yellow  
towards those aromas of yours that wait for me.  
Only melancholy and to a  
mountaineer they take on time, twenty-seven years  
Mist was no longer right at the transmission threshold.  
Halfway.  
It's a performing peace of dusts.  
  
Sometimes a piece of the lava  
falters like a book in my breath.  
And you develop like a jar and for a day, maybe too many to count,  
I rested under a palm tree leaf  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the lady to be in.  
In my night at holiday you are like a warmth  
and your form and colour the way I protect them.  
To breathe lost forms and for mirrors.  
  
The region inside hers  
a story we tell in passing,  
with notions of decency  
and a passion for computer science and oceanography  
the thicket within hers  
a history we tell in passing,  
with notions of love  
and a passion for engineering and jouranlism
