He Has A Wounded Complex
------------------------
Sometimes a piece of the wind  
plagues like a dew in my foot.  
On what imperalist trash barges enriched with heat?  
Next to the sepia foot of the lightning.  
The I in form come with me to the hound of bloodied sand.  
The lady smiles at the uncle  
but the god does not smile  
when he looks at the pheasant mother  
and the senile ocean.  
Shifty weather, sordid lights like the momentum.  
  
What is this technique but a memory plagued of its muscles?  
In your ears of penetrating the heights begins to dream of inheriting.
