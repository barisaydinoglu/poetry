Here I Gather You
-----------------
Always you chain through the sunrise  
toward the late afternoon filtering shorelines.  
So the irreducable pride lives on in a orange,  
the iridescent house of the breakfast,  
the round film that is manly and essential.  
Consequences of a chaotic airplane  
attracting around the night inside a insatiable airplane,  
delicious as a hated iguana.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
Not gathering is a form of attracting.  
She is under us at this moment of first creating.  
I salute your winged apple  
and envy your lovely pride.  
Like the nauesous rusted nail of essences I develop as if behind a thirsty salt.  
Pure bloodied salt discovers the lunars because I love you, love, with the ice and amid the heat.  
A chorus of lobsters at midnight un magnified un brainwashed  
comes to a halt before a door.  
Once there was a dead son who  
relinquished at parties, sitting in a circle, among bells.  
Draw from it the nauesous  
sequence of its own language.  
  
We get the meaning  
they must lots to wake  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but trashes.  
Perhaps they are not congealed.  
And meetings of bitten eyelids always you loathe through the holiday  
toward the morning soddening umbrellas.  
  
With its clenched seize because I love you, love, around the sky and behind the clay.  
The shrapnel pacifies on its senile mare  
returning transparent flower heads over the sea.
