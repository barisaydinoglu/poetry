Since The End
-------------
Our new wave, our resplendent nature triangles. Conversations of affections, the recitation  
of doors we call perfect current.  
A cathedral focuses its dream of a new ending, its new ending, the old ending of the shoreline order -  
its deedy trash barges.  
A blue stars in the sky connects.
