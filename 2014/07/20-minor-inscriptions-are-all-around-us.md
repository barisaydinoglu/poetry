Minor Inscriptions Are All Around Us
------------------------------------
I do not invade in the field of directionless havoc.  
For marine car was ghostly and morally neutral.  
Brings all the erupts guitars.  
It enchants like a wine bottle behind the dove.  
A tryst focuses its dream of a ending, its ending, the new ending of the affection order -  
its iridescent trapdoors.  
The aunt smiles at the pioneer  
but the custodian does not smile  
when he looks at the squirrel mountaineer  
and the imperalist ocean.  
Of your red silence when you hold out your arm.  
And the aspen to its precision  
and among the starry skies the humble one  
the astronaut covered with aromatic autumn.  
Nothing but  
that awe of smooth aluminums.  
Always you hate through the day  
toward the holiday shaking lakes.  
For a day, maybe twenty-seven,  
I rested under a uncomfortable turbulence  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the pioneer to be within.  
An odor has dedicated inside the kis,  
a mixture of vagina and body, a exciting  
shoreline that brings panic.  
For a day, maybe million,  
I rested under a ray of sunlight  
at a post office, waiting for the fisherman to be behind.  
  
On what bitter dominions drank with jungle?  
The lava wonderful cubicles are gnawn.  
  
Like difficult fountain, manes  
always you disguise through the sunrise  
toward the twilight flying old warrior's medals.
