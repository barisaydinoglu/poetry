The Metaphor Of Algorithmic Points
----------------------------------
If I could transform the lineage and the region.  
A natural wood paneling making a noble thing of a probable meeting  
with a bride.  
When you enchant attracted like a soul.  
I took on  
windy leaves.  
Realized lyrical key in your brain of confusion the jungle of rivers carry.  
The night imposes nessecity.  
And fragrances of strawberry and foliages.  
This wounded silence and fluttering flute wets me  
with it's silent faucets like hips and foot  
and brimstone graces like eyeballs and ribbons.  
Halfway.  
My heart is filled with sincerity like a ivory mirror.  
Always you attack through the sunrise  
toward the twilight smearing bottles.  
The gleaming old warrior's medals bristled because I love you, love, with the clay and amid the fire.  
In the first scene, the resplendent mountaineer  
is faltered by a mother. In the second  
scene he returns, to fly and  
to blush.  
He is outside us at this moment of first attracting.  
  
Behind the bell of the modern office where you sleep,  
a dream forces into metaphors.
