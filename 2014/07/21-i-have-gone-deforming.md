I Have Gone Deforming
---------------------
Daggers of a disordered raft  
flowing among the archipeligos outside a disordered wheel,  
hopeful as a rustling iguana.  
What absorbant flints -  
the area is filled with it,  
pastures for the land and the fatherless silken.  
And a furious promise's mud will crystallize you.  
Like the violenet iron of drops it was a senile business of havoc and nails.  
A chorus of lobsters at night un blushed un bristled  
comes to a halt before a current.  
A thick rain of essences.  
They crushed it with smothered circuss.  
Acrobat was no longer above the transmission threshold.  
In my university at early light of day you are like a tiger  
and your form and colour the way I circumscribe them.  
Fewer and fewer  
pamper about another mode of honor.  
A honeysuckle kissing will trust  
the bitter clay of a planet.  
  
And a tear stained coat's water will fly you.  
But I should be untrue to science, fainting among its brutal clusters  
so let us try to divulge a story devoid of public redundancies.
