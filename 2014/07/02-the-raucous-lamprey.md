The Raucous Lamprey
-------------------
A chorus of cats at morning un crystallized un attacked  
comes to a halt before a time.  
I could re-cover dominion, stain, and rotten stump  
from affections and springtimes  
with a ultraviolet wreath  
with explications in my brain.  
A whirlwinds of metaphor drops  
even the sanguine  
algorithmic area in sequence  
to which the metaphor  
will not be sought.  
Of your red sea shell when you hold out your brow.  
It's a flying wheatfield of dungs.  
Among the difficult land of dry banner.  
What funny things does the elephant contain?  
How little we carry and how much it perches the curiosities of this universe.  
  
Protect on the egoes that wait for you  
abducting the difficult chairs, foreboding the doors.  
A loaf of bread baked with shifty pride and salt.  
As if to bristle or blossom or abhor.  
To seek another land be guided by the steady key's juice.  
  
Cashmire earth to my wounded prize!  
Like the morose graphite of forests building the juice of her mist full of happiness.
