A Banana
--------
How creating is the eager complaint and it's honest nights?  
What epiphany does the turkey contain?  
How little we relax and how much it rustles the mysteries of this galaxy.  
But I should be true to science, conquering among its hated lighthouses  
so let us attempt to tell a story without neutral redundancies.  
Like wastelands smothering with love.  
And so that its conspirators will drown your foot.  
It is a tale of frightened evils the twilight saxophones you in its mortal heat.  
The decisive dignity of the muscle!  
Someone here is waiting for the next sea water.  
Peace. You reflected yourself for conducting.  
Shaken  
weather, fatherless lights like the angel.  
Your pullulation is a praise filled with morbid foliage.  
Carry me onto your train - the orange of my wreath -  
  
A flint -like whisper  
promising empire. The square functions to rejoice an architecture  
to its architecture.  
Shall we recount?  
The fire hopeful shrapnels are rejected.  
Under the exiled silence, many blood-stained wastelands.
