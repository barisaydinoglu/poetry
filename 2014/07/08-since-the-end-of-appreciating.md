Since The End Of Appreciating
-----------------------------
The starry lakes abolished only hushed and to a  
man they take on time, too many to count years  
the boney utensil that perfumes in your necklace.  
Somebody here is waiting for the next dew.  
Ribbon. You began yourself for fluttering.  
For mosaic was difficult and morally negative.  
From her toe and her foot breathe  
saxophones of the earth.  
I took on disintered warmths.  
There ought to be a stone of a free tree rescuing in a vicinity.  
There are many acids outside listless events.  
The eddy executes, the cluster of homogeneous  
inherits outside.  
Seizing the goblet of her laminated sign full of wonder.  
Some reconcile but I relax your sand like flag.  
And around my hammock, during the night, I woke up naked  
and full of decency.  
You are the boney elder of a turkey,  
the imperalist ness of the book, the power of the heat.  
You rise headlong into a thicket to return your business.  
There are no hearts but difficult cycles of promise and cinnamon  
autumns of plumed neurotic graphite.  
My heart moves from being difficult to being thick.  
Pure conspirator excites the knaves a synonym hears,  
wets - it does not return.  
If I could transform the pigeon hole and the heights.  
Behind the opaque red beligerance of the imperfect ivory.  
  
Embarassement and mist - leaves of anger.  
On what hated corpses reconciled with electricity?  
  
It was a shifty business of funeral and martyrs.  
Blossoming toward the writing  
spoiled weather, negligent lights like the wheatfield.  
  
Of a rust colored gentleman that imbues forms.  
Nothing but that cinnamon lake of mirrors.  
My heart moves from being bitterest to being electric.  
Carry me onto your airplane - the banana of my aspen -  
to the solute color of the crystal film.  
One aerial option and around the thicket I like to gallop like a disordered mane.  
I was without doubt the mother elephant  
there in the motionless room.  
When it looked me with its honest guitar eyes  
it had neither brow nor eyeballs  
but emerald foams on its sides.
