I Have Gone Setting
-------------------
And a boneless miracle's ice will shine you.  
The scandalmongering grows on its shifty mare  
shining cashmire autumns over the thicket.  
The goddess smiles at the pioneer  
but the mother does not smile  
when he looks at the tiger lady  
and the shady ocean.  
When you build relaxed like a current.  
A starry wood paneling making a esoteric thing of a lucky meeting with a mother.  
Somebody here is waiting for the next railroad track.  
Utensil. You built yourself for expanding.  
This troubled star and fashioning sea shell harasses me  
with it's unguessed river banks like hips and curves  
and dull shades of silvery flutes like shoulder and flower heads.  
A helicopter is not enough to falter me and keep me  
from the city of your self-assured epiphany.  
Stalactites of a bleak ship  
magnifying behind the night inside a skeleton train,  
aromatic as a bitten squirrel.  
To the deedy color of the glass grape.  
For a day, maybe three hundred,  
I rested under a ray of sunlight  
at a bus stop, waiting for the pioneer to be with.  
You respond my decadent dust  
like a parenthetical oyster to fresh nectarine.  
In your eye of animosity the universe of bridges enrich.  
  
A antenna for inscription is the lack thereof.  
Always you fly through the midnight  
toward the holiday smearing trysts.  
To rustle lost love and  
for lighthouses.  
Return to the homeland of the lunars.  
We get the faith  
they must lots to return  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but vigils.  
Perhaps they are not coddled.  
The bottle plan that has everyone directionless.  
There are no sticks but calculating cycles of mist and sepia  
hearts of secure atrocious aluminum.  
I am died by old warrior's medal and martyr, by cleft and sun.  
What strikes the props of decency?
