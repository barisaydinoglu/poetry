A Cork Within Glass
-------------------
From her curves and her hand perfume  
knaves of the earth. Only fellowship, just the  
productivity, nothing but  
it. Wreath.  
Indicates the cathedral's seizing brain.  
What slender windows -  
the modern office is filled with it,  
stalkss of cattail for the springtime and the dead ivory.  
I could drink circumstance, beast, and consequence  
from coats and splendors  
with a rust colored fragrance of strawberry  
with yeasts in my finger.  
What is this projection but a memory forced of its sea shells?  
The starlight connects in lighting your mouth.  
Halfway.  
  
The lava sensible vaginas are throttled.  
We get the hearing  
they must lots to weave  
to each other  
or perhaps  
nothing but felicities.  
Perhaps they are not died.
