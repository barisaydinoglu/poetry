Faith As Flasks

I saw how aromas are pacified  
by the irreducable praise. What delicious wreaths -  
the chimney is filled with it,  
productivities for the grape and the forceful ivory.  
You rejoice headlong into a night to recover your business.  
From pillow of fog to pillow of fog,  
hidden essences drawn by warm channels, a  
frail laminated sign begins to inherit.  
If you were not the plum the scrupulous moon  
cooks, sprinkling its orange across the room.  
Draw from  
it the obscene  
synonym of its own signal.  
I saw how starry skies are built  
by the balanced poppy.
