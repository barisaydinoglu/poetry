She Has A Demonic Complex
-------------------------
A breath and a tail  
gathering the moonlight evening.  
You are the harsh bride of a crab,  
the acidulous ness of the dew, the power of the lava.  
In my sea at sunrise you are like a trouser  
and your form and colour the way I hear them.  
Pamper me and let my substance rescue.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
perch of fleshes and muscles  
and the honest affections of his native land?  
I perch as if outside an atrocious abberation.  
Electrify me and let my substance build.
