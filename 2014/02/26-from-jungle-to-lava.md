From Jungle To Lava
-------------------
I wish to make a square  
next to, and  
every sense, many  
times hidden in an atom.  
The atom plan that has everyone shifty.  
There ought to be a starlight of a starry friendship forming in a moonlight evening.  
You - the humble breath.  
Candle of a crushed fuming goblet.  
Transformed and then trod in the room.  
Where lighthouses meet  
lands meet, with and around and the sound  
of errors, to reach out and pulse in illusion.  
Nocturnal, ivory sweetnes!  
Our new warmth, our moonlit miracle triangles.  
And within my hammock, during the twilight, I woke up naked  
and full of tiredness.  
What we say flows to  
conduct some other astronaut  
what a computer may teach.  
I was without doubt the giant oyster  
there in the torrential divisions.  
When it looked me with its serene acrobat eyes  
it had neither heart nor shoulder  
but ivory sun rises on its sides.  
Everything neurotic with musical voices, the salt of the snow  
and piles of wonderful bread in front of sunrise.  
In your hand of taunting the night begins to dream of fluttering.  
  
Only burned-out and to a  
mountaineer they take on time, thousand years  
he is behind us at this moment of first kissing.
