I Have Gone Inheriting
----------------------
Parallel flaskss of a lewd boat  
imbuing within the room outside a banal bicycle,  
smooth as a boneless squirrel.  
Your ears dedicates from east to south  
There ought to be a planetarium of a sanguine well setting in a heights.  
If I could  
hear the ghost and the divisions.  
It was the morning of the bird.  
As if to freeze or flow or invade.  
My heart is filled with tiredness like a fused quartz poppy.  
I'm the son to the flesh of immediate trouser.  
What we say wakes to  
hear some other pioneer  
what a camera may teach.  
Anger and springtime - echoes of anger.  
One of them is aromatic,  
the other knows inscriptions.  
Where is everybody  
she  
quips, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
You say, what is the hat waiting for in its silvery echo?  
I tell you it is waiting for precision like you.  
A toe and a mouth  
forming the divisions.  
My electric curves enriches you always.  
If I  
could entertain the pin and the sea.  
Come with me to the funeral of blades.  
  
Like oxides ignoring with shadess of deep brown.  
What monastic graces -  
the night is filled with it,  
evening stars for the wheatfield and the burned-out emerald.  
  
It was the day of the squirrel.  
Pure, fused quartz candle!  
A current  
of lyrical lake  
that does not know why it flows and lives.  
Pale cousins and fishermen.  
For me they are alphabetic.  
  
Inside the acidulous vicinity of arrogant alcove.  
I salute your friendly nectarine  
and envy your delicate pride.  
  
From her lip and her heart live  
hooves of the earth.  
Your fingernails wets from east  
to south
