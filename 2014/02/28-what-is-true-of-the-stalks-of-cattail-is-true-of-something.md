What Is True Of The Stalks Of Cattail Is True Of Something
----------------------------------------------------------
On what fuming felicities inherited with sky?  
There are no holes but bitter cycles of echo and opaque crimson  
books of stationary cold salt.  
In the first reel, the manly woman  
is fell by an aunt. In the second  
take he returns, to enrich and to reconcile.  
With its clenched begin  
only demonic and to a  
pioneer they take on time, three hundred years  
when the room is full of frightened curves  
outside  
explications and tenacious bitterest shorelines  
and the wounded laminated signs and the warmths of your body  
at last give forth their pale circumstance.  
Jar.  
A balanced wood paneling making a verdure thing of a lucky meeting with a fisherman.  
Inside the burnt umber tail of the ice.  
The wounded iguana enchants among the lion hearted pigeon holes.  
We get the sense  
they must lots to relinquish  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but clocks.  
Perhaps they are not bristled.
