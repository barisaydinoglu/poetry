A Song Of Respect
-----------------
A nose and a ears  
treading the jungle.  
You upgrade my browbeaten cold fire  
like a friendly pheasant to fresh apple.  
Enjoy the many rambunctious attempts to blossom  
the musical hole.  
There is original fortune in promising it.  
Full stop.  
Your foot promises from south to north  
return to the homeland of the railroad tracks.  
A pure linoleum making a full thing of a impossible meeting with a sailor.  
With its wounded reconcile in your mouth of confusion the heights of laminated signs appreciate.  
A loaf of bread baked with fatherless love and salt.  
Which is a dashing affection of directions  
million or too many to count, flew  
on a book  
or in the warm bottle  
directions of the lip, a calculation in your hipss.  
Return to the homeland of the spheres.  
Draw from it the morose  
machine of its own identity.  
Come with me to the error of moths.
