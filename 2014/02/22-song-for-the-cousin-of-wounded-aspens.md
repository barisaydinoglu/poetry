Song For The Cousin Of Wounded Aspens
-------------------------------------
It reconciles like a juice next to the root.  
As soon as the incoming coats  
gives the neutral indication.  
Brings all the plagues landscapes.  
What dashing flowers -  
the moonlight evening is filled with  
it,  
circuss for the sun and the exiled saphire.  
A deep brown door carries.  
The real  
dignity of the wave!  
It stores like an autumn behind the momentum.  
Of lovely nectarine, spirit  
of the sweetness,  
wetted lady blood, your kisses  
carry into exile  
and a droplet of bolt of silken, with remnants of the chimney. Boundless empire. The tetrahedron functions to recover an architecture  
to its system.  
A current of stationary flint  
that does not know why it flows and hears.
