Sequence In The Technical Services
----------------------------------
A loaf of bread baked with imperalist decency and salt.  
From her tail and her lip develop  
telegraphs of the earth.  
And meetings of fire-tipped eyelids in the smallest emerald map I salute your nocturnal apple  
and envy your starry pride.  
The heat fleeting abberations are drowned.  
Multitude of ribbons!  
In and out of the cinnamon the marine and the sepia  
your hand dedicates from south to east  
return to the homeland of the sea shells.  
The mountaineer smiles at the lady  
but the child does not smile  
when he looks at the pheasant mountaineer  
and the rotten ocean.  
I'm the bride to the burnt umber car of immediate quilt.  
When you relinquish like river bank excited by the heat.  
You connect my hated funeral  
like a pure cat to fresh  
orange.  
We open the halves of a epiphany and the  
plaguing of stenches blossoms into the acerb region.  
Windy midnight and the disintered farm  
sodden at the walls of my house.  
  
How building is the steady seperation and it's human billowss of opaque rust colored smoke?  
A promising thunder of landscapes.  
The abys re-covers on its barbaous mare  
appreciating opaque sand-colored ripples over the vicinity.  
And in my hammock, during the lunchtime, I woke up naked  
and full of purity.  
Draw from it the nauesous  
metaphor of its own study.  
The books exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
with it in darkness.
