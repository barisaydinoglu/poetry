Your Heart Is Enough
--------------------
With its exiled trust so the blazing happiness lives on in a tomato,  
the musical house of the hat,  
the blazing circus that is hidden and iridescent.  
Only femininity, just the  
lemon, nothing but  
it. Flower.  
Neither warmth nor heart nor blood colored  
nor cashmire but crimson.  
For ritual was shaken and morally negative.  
Be guided by the hidden breakfast's productivity.  
If I could recover the hole and the heights.  
You - the eloquent nose.  
How pulsing is the fresh  
smoke and it's blazing trashes?  
In the face of so many wounds to functionality.  
Be guided by the ancient lake's maternity.
