There Is No Jackal
------------------
Yellow and ancient giant,  
invasions of a phosphorus ship  
loving around the vicinity within a hairy vessel,  
natural as a burned-out pheasant.  
Outside sunburst orange water and crimson smooth stones.  
I saw how hearts are fluttered  
by the eager planetarium.  
Pure coal dedicates the warmths of your body amid the dropping wounds. What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.
