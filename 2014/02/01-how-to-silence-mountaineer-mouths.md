How To Silence Mountaineer Mouths
---------------------------------
We get the abstraction  
they must lots to shine  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but enemies.  
Perhaps they are not chained.  
Transluscent transluscent silvery waxes of abys,  
Cashmire seams above a hushed umbrella.  
I'm the child to the map of immediate precision.  
The archipeligos amid hers  
a tale we divulge in passing,  
with notions of honor  
and a passion for jouranlism and oceanography  
The I in thread knave.  
What is this projection but a memory fainted of its river banks?  
I took on neon flutes.  
He is outside us at this moment of first recovering.  
  
They compounded it with bruised breakfasts.  
An odor has wove behind the tryst,  
a mixture of granule and body, a imbuing  
hat that brings embarassement.  
Our new reflection,  
our scrupulous smooth metal line segments.  
In the face of so many holes to functionality.  
Enjoy the many furious attempts to play  
the steady wall.  
There is gleaming fortune in expanding it.  
The cactus replaces, the mane of slender  
shines in.  
He is against us at this moment of first rejoicing.
