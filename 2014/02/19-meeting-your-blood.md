Meeting Your Blood
------------------
Nobody here is waiting for the next laminated sign.  
Grace. You mixed yourself for flying.  
There are no flames but worn-out cycles of smooth stone and sunburst orange  
landscapes of warm tremulous rusted nail.  
Scrupulous empire. The triangle functions to preserve a system  
to its environment. Be guided by the pure starlight's autumn.
