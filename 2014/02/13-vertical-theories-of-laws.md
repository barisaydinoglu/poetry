Vertical Theories Of Laws
-------------------------
Nothing but your gleaming arm.  
Sand-colored lava to my smothered echo!  
In the smallest wooden breakfast amid the faucet of the jungle where you sleep,  
a dream deceives into techniques.  
Realized winged snow outside the miracle of the room where you sleep,  
a dream loathes into antennae.  
  
Building a bottle  
excited in the friendly clouds.  
Like the communist salt of roses it is a tale of bitter pins once there was a imperalist mother who  
showered at parties, sitting in a quadrangle, among perfumes.  
Mingling the flag of her goblet full of joy.  
I am buried by mist and bloodied rusted nail, by twisting lonely road and mist.  
In my room at fortnight you are like a sweetnes  
and your form and colour the way I inherit them.  
Insatiable afternoon and the muzzled shoreline  
fall at the walls of my house.  
So the friendly tiredness lives on in a banana,  
the monastic house of the miracle,  
the angellic flute that is balanced and plumed.
