Camera Without The Lard
-----------------------
In the face of so many felicities to functionality. A machine discovers,  
invades - it does not return.  
I salute your round nectarine  
and envy your musical pride.  
It was a chaotic business of trash barge and havocs.  
I do not  
loiter in the region of sticky corruption.  
I took on rusted ships.  
If you were not the wine the steady moon  
cooks, sprinkling its lemon across the jungle.  
My heart moves from being crooked to being spacious.  
I was without doubt the man elephant  
there in the insufferable sea.  
When it looked me with its somber flower eyes  
it had neither fingernails nor brow  
but paper-mache planetariums on its sides.
