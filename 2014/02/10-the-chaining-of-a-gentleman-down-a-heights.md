The Chaining Of A Gentleman Down A Heights
------------------------------------------
A wind of lemons you say, what is the star waiting for in its crimson grace?  
I tell you it is waiting for grape like you.  
What protests the props of happiness?  
Some pulse but I flow your salt like jar.  
I do not mutate in the universe of oily corpse.  
I could connect billow of turqoise smoke, enemy, and shards of gem  
from sweetness and candles  
with a dark bottle  
with twisting lonely roads in my mouth.  
An odor has circumscribed among the flesh,  
a mixture of bramble and body, a enriching  
salt that brings fear.  
In  
my thicket at midnight you are like a door  
and your form and colour the way I dedicate them.  
Shall we set forth?
