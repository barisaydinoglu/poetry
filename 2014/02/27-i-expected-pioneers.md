I Expected Pioneers
-------------------
Gnaw me and let my substance drink.  
The promise entertains in conducting your ears.  
You blossom slowly into a city to kiss your business.  
A marine bell makes.  
What mysteries does the iguana contain?  
How little we breathe and how much it continues the curiosities of this computer simulation.  
You carry in the divisions as in a iridescent land.  
Halfway.  
We open the halves of a funny things and the  
mutating of self-productions crystallizes into the human chimney. The divisions amid hers  
a tale we divulge in passing,  
with notions of wonder  
and a passion for photography and engineering  
in the middle of the modern office like sand.  
The pamphlet imposes nessecity.  
Not beginning is a form of growing.
