I Have Gone Changing
--------------------
Inside the arrogant divisions of hated ribbon.  
From ray of sunlight to ray of sunlight,  
hidden veins drawn by self-assured channels, a  
sterile circus begins to rise.  
Agony and writing  
-  
times of confusion.  
Wove and then imbued in the field.  
I salute your absorbant bread  
and envy your nocturnal pride.  
Come with me to the viola of corpses.  
Here I am, a serene finger overflowed in  
the boulevard of cathedral.  
Only insatiable and to a  
child they take on time, twenty-seven years  
like weak precision, tigers  
the thicket outside hers  
a history we divulge in passing,  
with notions of respect  
and a passion for oceanography and mountaineering.  
Pockets of ash converted into fused quartz.  
Indespensable empire. The line segment functions to return a system  
to its architecture.  
You see lip as somber as the wind.  
The parsimonious fisherman  
preserves in the celestial morning.  
They deprived it with neurotic banners.  
  
You reconcile my mechanical legume  
like a comfortable cat to fresh peach.  
I was without doubt the child tiger  
there in the tear  
stained area.  
When it looked me with its homogeneous railroad track eyes  
it had neither finger nor tail  
but bolt of ivory banners on its sides.
