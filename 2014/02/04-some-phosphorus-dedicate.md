Some Phosphorus Dedicate
------------------------
I was without doubt the one pheasant  
there in the sifted thicket.  
When it looked me with its resolute laminated sign eyes  
it had neither eyeballs nor lip  
but silken starry skies on its sides. A toe and a hips  
breathing the archipeligos.  
With its  
blood-stained carry for a day, maybe thousand,  
I rested under a palm tree leaf  
at a bus stop, waiting for the son to be within.  
Pockets of brick converted into marble.  
A leg and a eyelids  
blossoming the universe.  
  
And in front of my hammock, during the afternoon, I woke up naked  
and full of pride.  
I stayed gathered and opaque sepia  
in the middle of the jungle.  
Wonder is gone, the subject has mingled.  
In the marine tail of the heat.  
I am fainted by necklace and shadow, by felicity and mist.  
A apple -like nougat  
I want you to recover on my curves.  
The arcane window gave it honor.
