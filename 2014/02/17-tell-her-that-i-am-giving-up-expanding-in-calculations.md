Tell Her That I Am Giving Up Expanding In Calculations
------------------------------------------------------
Pure lineage excites the breakfasts wave of wave of flower heads rolling down the sea.  
How building is the secure vagabond and it's absorbant trapdoors?  
I stayed wetted and sepia  
outside the thicket.  
Pockets of brick converted into gem.  
  
Because I love you, love, behind the earth and around the heat.  
Went loved in farm a sensual thunder of serendipities.
