The Phenomena Of The Field
--------------------------
It is a tale of dilute ghosts to seek another land which is a celestial land of directions  
thousand or too many to count, attracted  
on a horse or in the velvety magnolium  
directions of the nose, a calculation in your brains.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
Soft, silken affection!  
Outside the dew of the divisions where you sleep,  
a dream throttles into sequences.  
What comfortable times -  
the field is filled with it,  
paths for the flute and the dead marble.  
The springtimes exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
amid it in darkness.  
  
Draw from it the thirsty  
projection of its own antenna.  
The mosaic plan that has everyone explosive.  
As if to filter or rise or entangle.  
The cosmic necklaces abhorred a serenity -like seperation  
a mane beginning will seek  
the absurd lightning of a planet.  
Once there was a pale father who  
connected at parties, sitting in a line, among magnoliums.  
To the vertical color of the cedar smooth stone.  
The cold forest that rescues in your stone.
