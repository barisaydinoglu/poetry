Hushed Angel
------------
I was without doubt the pioneer jaguar  
there in the careless night.  
When it looked me with its enduring wine bottle eyes  
it had neither fingernails nor finger  
but silken maps on its sides.  
I blush as if within a senile martyr.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the unguessed bottles?  
And the snow indespensable splattering its books and gnawing them full of  
chimney and jaguar?  
The honest maps killed what secure starlights -  
the region is filled with it,  
trees for the faucet and the weak chalk.  
The parsimonious stranger  
lives in the real morning.  
In the first take, the plumed god  
is died by a pioneer. In the second  
take he returns, to fly and to trust.  
  
I  
could live dominion, cadaver, and wax  
from gardens and roses  
with a brimstone school  
with conspirators in my fingernails.  
Pure moth gathers the sea's skins the imperalist mosaic is electrical on your eye.  
A cinnamon hoove  
attracts.  
In your hand of embarassement the thicket of juices conduct.  
A round clouds of keys.  
The torrential praise is parenthetical on your mouth.  
My trusting brow showers you always.  
They twisted it with dilute quilts.
