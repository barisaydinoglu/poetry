I Expected Pioneers
-------------------
Lewd weather, disintered lights like the sphere.  
What is this identity but a memory dropped of its currents?  
My heart moves from being explosive to being essential.  
You are the delirious astronaut of a cat,  
the acidulous ness of the time, the power of the wind.
