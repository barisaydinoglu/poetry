He Has A Lewd Complex
---------------------
Around the area I like to recover like a wounded pencil.  
A chorus of tigers at late afternoon un began un imprisoned  
comes to a halt  
before a smooth broken glass.  
Multitude  
of knaves!  
In and out of the cinnamon the marine and the silvery  
acrobat.  
What we say seizes to  
imbue some other son  
what a calculation may teach.  
Like consequences devouring with maternities.  
In your curves of panic the heights of flowers stand.  
Inside the shattering bombs.  
Your eyeballs rejoices from west to east  
in the first take, the mineral god  
is killed by a son. In the second  
reel he returns, to transform and to refresh.  
Of your rust colored book when you hold out your finger.  
  
Draw from it the putrid  
calculation of its own projection.  
For a day, maybe million,  
I rested under a ocean wave  
at a post office, waiting for the god to be in.
