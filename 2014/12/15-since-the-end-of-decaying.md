Since The End Of Decaying
-------------------------
Shall we proceed?  
The boney coat is moonlit on your lip.  
Draw from it the boney  
production of its own signal. Multitude of pullulations!  
In and out of the yellow the blue and the yellow  
love is gone, the subject has expanded.  
Multitude of silences!  
In and out of the cinnamon the marine and the silvery  
and you stole in the illusion and chirped a coddling eternity.
