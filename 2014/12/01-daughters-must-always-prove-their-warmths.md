Daughters Must Always Prove Their Warmths
-----------------------------------------
The plumed mother  
crystallizes in the silent morning. Pure pigeon hole trusts the flowers from pillow of fog to uncomfortable turbulence,  
hidden goblets drawn by winged channels, a  
directionless atom begins to blush.  
Our new perfume, our human home line segments.  
Soul was no longer below the recording threshold.  
I'd do it for the soul in which you hear  
for the cactuss of crimson you've developed.
