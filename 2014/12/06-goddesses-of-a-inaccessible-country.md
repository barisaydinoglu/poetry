Goddesses Of A Inaccessible Country
-----------------------------------
Sometimes  
a piece of the jungle  
throttles like a bird feather in my ears.  
To breathe lost farms and for phemonanas.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the clear veins?  
And  
the sun poetic splattering its doors and compounding them full of  
jungle and toucan?  
The real dignity of the flute!  
  
Love on the imbroglios that wait for you  
drowning the obscene chairs, fainting the doors.  
This boneless banner and wetting serendipity loathes me  
with it's free sea shells like lip and arm  
And dull shades of marine mists like curves and veins.  
Like the delirious broken glass of grapes the fellowship plan that has everyone frightened.  
Here I am, a handsome mouth twisted in the land of alcove.  
  
He is against us at this moment of first loving.
