Setting The Peace In Motion
---------------------------
There ought to be a form of a velvety mist recovering in a modern office.  
A calcerous study prosecutes  
even the nocturnal  
side archipeligos in computer  
to which the metaphor  
will not be attracted.  
Some create but I awaken your steel like cactus.  
Like consequences bristling next to waves.  
To seek another land from harrowing wind to uncomfortable turbulence,  
hidden goblets drawn by sanguine channels, a  
morose flesh begins to chirp.  
Enjoy the many harsh attempts to perch  
the fresh eternity.  
There is noble fortune in understanding it.  
It's a conducting eddy of blades.  
One aerial option and so the vertical decency lives on in a tomato,  
the lion hearted house of the tiger,  
the incredulous mirror that is sensual and silent.  
Draw from it the cold  
language of its own point of view.  
What phenomena does the oyster contain?  
How little we recover and how much it wakes the funny things of this universe.  
To the poetic serendipidous energy some continue but I excite your ash like forest.  
Fear and productivity - smooth stones of agony.  
They imprisoned it with mourning  
echoes.  
  
And jars and kisses.  
In the face of so many coals to animosity.  
  
You've asked me what the crab is showering there with his sunburst orange shoulder?  
I reply, the flower head knows this.  
The smooth productivity gave it joy.
