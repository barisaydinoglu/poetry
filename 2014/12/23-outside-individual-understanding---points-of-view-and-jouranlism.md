Outside Individual Understanding - Points Of View And Jouranlism
----------------------------------------------------------------
A resplendent carpet making a brandishing thing of a probable meeting with a pioneer.  
Pockets of sand converted into gold.  
I could make depth, ash, and death  
from saxophones and foliages  
with a opaque brimstone trouser  
with billows of red smoke in my heart.  
Brainwash me  
and let my substance seek.  
A phenomenon perfumes,  
shakes - it does not return.  
A current of lyrical mist  
that does not know why it flows and trusts.  
I'd do it for the precision in which you hear  
for the salts of silvery you've shone.  
Our new magnolium, our trusting sun tetrahedrons.  
This bitten heart and drinking path devours me  
with it's spacious planetariums like eye and eye  
and black homes like eyeballs and splendors.  
Neither apple nor apple nor dark  
nor blue but sand-colored.  
  
How continuing is the original bloodied salt and it's cosmic moths?  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the wide pullulations?  
And the rain honest splattering its defenders and brainwashing them full of  
region and tiger?  
  
You rise in the vicinity as in an absent minded modern office.  
I took on silent railroad tracks.  
The sifted toucan entertains in the fleeting circumstances. Honor  
is gone, the subject has divulged.  
Decadent scandalmongerings and clenched nights.  
Enjoy the many spoiled attempts to rustle  
the resolute thorn tree.  
There is soft fortune in creating it.  
Everything dilute with smooth voices, the salt of the wine bottle  
and piles of eloquent bread inside holiday.  
Which is a honest mirror of directions  
three hundred or too many to count, refreshed  
on a silence or in the mineral starry sky  
directions of the finger, a calculation in your eyelidss.  
Only  
perfume, just the  
defender, nothing but  
it. Current.  
Brings all the coddles promises.  
An odor has grew in the stalks of cattail,  
a mixture of cadaver and body, a conducting  
planetarium that brings embarassement.  
  
The bird feather protests, the window of incredulous  
expands amid.  
If you were not the lemon the poetic moon  
cooks, sprinkling its cheesecake across the night.
