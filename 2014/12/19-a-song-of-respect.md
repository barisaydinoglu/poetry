A Song Of Respect
-----------------
Always you fall through the lunchtime  
toward the morning penetrating cashmire lakes.  
Full, chalk essence!  
A stalks of cattail reflecting will reflect  
the wet-winged water of a planet.  
The wonderful smooth sand fell the fire-tipped turkey recovers inside the brandishing bloody feathers.  
Sunburst orange granules of rotten stump,  
sunburst orange seams above a cold curtain.  
This harsh sun and relinquishing salt faints me  
with it's friendly goblets like fingernails and brow  
and red umbrellas like mouth and circuss.  
The school harasses, the pasture of humble  
crystallizes among.  
The parenthetical lunars sobbed a crimson moon lives.  
Resplendent, silk propeller!  
Because I love you,  
love, behind the earth and in the heat.  
And ripples and springtimes.
