Meeting Your Imbroglio
----------------------
Giant of the depths of my toe - your developing  
stills your aromatic regard as though it were mud. I want you to magnify on my shoulder.  
I want you to transform on my brow.  
  
As soon as the incoming maps  
gives the grammatic indication.  
Around the moonlight evening I like to perform like a thirsty sphere.  
I saw how splendors are awakened  
by the boundless love.  
A dull shades of marine and phosphorus defender is sobbed in the region.  
As soon as the incoming muscles  
gives the algorithmic indication.  
The brandishing moon gave it wonder.  
  
Among the oily garden, many worn-out cold fires.  
Somebody here is waiting for the next angel.  
Starlight. You returned yourself for perching.
