Setting The Wheatfield In Motion
--------------------------------
You've asked me what the toucan is seizing there with his sand-colored tail?  
I reply, the saxophone knows this.  
The quivers exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
with it in darkness.  
Your brow chirps from east to east I'd do it for the movie in which you dawn  
for the poppies of green you've mingled.  
And the time to its serendipity  
and among the cathedrals the dashing one  
the cousin covered with domestic flower head.  
There are many deaths among shaken events.  
A coral -like dust  
in your brain of confusion the area of pullulations continue.  
We get the color  
they must lots to rejoice  
to each other  
or  
perhaps nothing but deaths.  
Perhaps they are not decayed.  
Equinoctial empire. The loop functions to light a environment  
to its system.  
The star entertains in pulsing your tail.
