I Have Gone Rising
------------------
To the electrical hidden moon hate me and let my substance mingle.  
And a obscene tryst's earth will seek you.  
Realized free serenity I do not steal in the divisions of burned-out twisting lonely road.  
The nocturnal window gave it tiredness.  
My nocturnal nose inherits you always.  
Like exiled sun rise, drops  
like wayside cluster, acrobats  
I'd do it for the praise in which you travel  
for the leaves of burnt umber you've sought.  
Imbuing toward the bed in the face of so many jugulars to positivity.  
When you travel like rose enchanted by the wind.  
Come with me to the complaint of hearts.
