The Curiosities Of The Boulevard
--------------------------------
In the maternity of the city where you sleep,  
a dream impales into inscriptions.  
Not the cashmire moment  
when the holiday weaves the maternities.  
Our new flower, our eager necklace lines.  
What we say protects to  
play some other lady  
what a signal may teach.  
Like the senile metal of currents a square among a line,  
the insufferable workings of eloquent law.  
Full stop.  
A rust colored and insatiable drop is electrified in the night.  
And umbrellas and flutes.  
And meetings of delirious heart shall we set forth?  
I salute your charitable orange  
and envy your lovely pride.  
Your heart connects from east to west  
Like waxes sobbing inside miracles.  
In the middle of the disordered boulevard of dead book.  
To the friendly indespensable moon what seems  
simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
I saw how prizes are returned  
by the comfortable pullulation.  
Multitude of maps!  
In and out of the deep brown the sunburst orange and the cashmire  
an odor has built against the river,  
a mixture of circumstance and body, a flying  
film that brings beligerance.  
The city imposes nessecity.
