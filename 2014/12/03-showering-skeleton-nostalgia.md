Showering Skeleton Nostalgia
----------------------------
The dagger imposes nessecity.  
A eyeballs and a mouth  
perching the jungle.  
The sea next to hers  
a story we speak in passing,  
with notions of respect  
and a passion for science and engineering  
the femininity forebodes, the key of arcane  
pulses in front of.  
Muzzled mountaineers and uncles.  
For me they are historical.  
All breakfasts become hearts.  
  
Like corpses shaking in writings.
