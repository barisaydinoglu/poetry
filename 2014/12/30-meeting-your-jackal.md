Meeting Your Jackal
-------------------
Wave of wave of flower heads rolling down the sea.  
Full stop.  
A chorus of crabs at early light of day un magnified un deformed  
comes to a halt before a cathedral.  
In the smallest silk propeller it kisses like a cluster in the droplet.  
Curtain of a deluded mechanical fragrance of strawberry.  
You say, what is the law waiting for in its green lake?  
I tell you it is waiting for energy like you.  
You carry in the area as in a scrupulous land.  
Around the area I like to perform like a smothered sunburst orange car.  
Outside the green leg of the water.  
Went protected in cluster not galloping is a form of attracting.
