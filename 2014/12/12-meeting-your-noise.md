Meeting Your Noise
------------------
I conduct as if in front of a motionless utensil.  
Where foams meet  
quilts meet, next to and around and the sound  
of probes, to reach out and store in fear.  
A wheel is not enough to impale me and keep me  
from the university of your electrical epiphany.  
Not  
showering is a form of divulging.  
I wish to make a loop  
amid, and every sense, many  
times hidden in a form.  
You are the lemon of my mourning toe.  
Has the land been galloped with funny things?
