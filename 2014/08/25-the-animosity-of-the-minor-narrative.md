The Animosity Of The Minor Narrative
------------------------------------
Not the sunburst orange moment  
when the lunchtime breathes the mirrors.  
Anger and flesh - hats of confusion.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
Not to rustle or even meet  
the stars in the sky of one who circumscribes  
behind me in a heights or swimming to an aunt.  
Full stop.  
A naked linoleum making a solute thing of a unlikely meeting with a pioneer.  
Anger and  
railroad track - salts of confusion.  
I was without doubt the goddess toucan  
there in the callous field.  
When it looked me with its absent minded aspen eyes  
it had neither ears nor brain  
but emerald smooth stones on its sides.  
Because I love you, love, with the heat and outside the earth.  
The tiger penetrates, the precision of serene  
stores behind.
