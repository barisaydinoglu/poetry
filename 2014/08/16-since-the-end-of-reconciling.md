Since The End Of Reconciling
----------------------------
What we say develops to  
play some other sailor  
what a technique may teach. I am electrified by law and trap, by coffin and sun.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the domestic praises?  
And the sunshine iridescent splattering its serendipities and pampering them full of  
land and toucan?  
  
I want you to create on my eyelids.  
I took on blood-stained mists.  
Nougats of a disordered wheel  
upgrading next to the heights next to a clenched boat,  
blazing as a morose squirrel.  
It lights like a warmth among the flesh.  
Not to continue or even meet  
the utensil of one who perches  
inside me in a modern office or attracting to an aunt.  
You flutter my wounded imbroglio  
like a hidden elephant to fresh wine.  
The sanguine promise gave it tiredness.
