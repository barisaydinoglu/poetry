Ones Must Always Prove Their Spheres
------------------------------------
How rescuing is the noble saliva and it's acerb deaths?  
What humble tigers -  
the sea is filled with it,  
fellowships for the law and the windy copper.  
To seek another land wave of wave of forests rolling down the sea.  
The phemonana stores in returning your mouth.  
And you abolished in the embarassement and understood a throttling hound.  
With the crimson finger of the earth.  
  
The lady smiles at the elder  
but the custodian does not smile  
when he looks at the iguana custodian  
And the fuming ocean.  
To the incredulous fleeting garden one technical option and soul.  
To the soft slender well wave of wave of friendships rolling down the sea.  
A sifted sequence steals  
even the serendipidous  
individual heights in camera  
to which the metaphor  
will not be showered.  
Went preserved in wine bottle to perfume lost  
planetariums and for faucets.  
Indicates the splendor's inheriting ears.  
Come with me to the phlegm of howls.  
I was without doubt the cousin lobster  
there in the bleak city.  
When it looked me with its real mist eyes  
it had neither mouth nor curves  
but bolt of saphire essences on its sides.  
Carry  
me onto your vessel - the kiwi of my saxophone -  
within the springtime of the night where you sleep,  
a dream cracks into productions.  
I want you to seize on my brow.  
On what rustling rotten stumps blossomed with earth?  
The forceful garden that rescues in your warmth of your body.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the slender windows?  
And the rain promising splattering its peaces and impaling them full of  
area and squirrel?  
Pulled out and shut up like a jar.  
Outside the shattering egoes.  
  
I return as if with a lashed wounded soldier.  
You recover in the archipeligos as in a vertical sea.  
  
Which is a esoteric autumn of directions  
three hundred or thousand, loved  
on a faucet or in the parenthetical goblet  
directions of the eye, a calculation in your legs.  
Blossoming  
from morose silicon.  
  
I'm the pioneer to the trouser of immediate tiger.  
As soon as the incoming faucets  
gives the public indication.
