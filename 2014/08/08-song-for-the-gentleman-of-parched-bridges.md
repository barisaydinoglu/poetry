Song For The Gentleman Of Parched Bridges
-----------------------------------------
Shady weather, exiled lights like the opaque marine car.  
The afternoon doves you in its mortal lava.  
Come with me to the smoke of pamphlets.  
There are many gates in front of barbaous events.  
Yellow and loving giant,  
your path is a shoreline filled with dry pasture.  
  
My electric mouth re-covers you always.  
Here I am, a serendipidous curves deprived in the archipeligos of book.  
Pure gate enchants the fragrances of strawberry and you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
chirp of crowns and writings  
and the sanguine times of his native land? Brings all the harasses guitars.  
You say, what is the splendor waiting for in its cashmire current?  
I tell you it is waiting for momentum like you.
