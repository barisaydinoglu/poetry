Hearing Is An Episode Of Self-production
----------------------------------------
Dead sons and giants.  
For me they are grammatic.  
You promise in the night as in a incredulous night.  
Be guided by the cordial peace's door.  
Neither femininity nor vein nor opaque rust colored  
nor cinnamon but sand-colored.
