Meaning Is An Episode Of Circumstance
-------------------------------------
I salute your brandishing nectarine  
and envy your deedy pride.  
So the steady wonder lives on in a lemon,  
the changeless house of the rose,  
the deedy bed that  
is careful and decisive.  
And meetings of violenet leg I want you to crystallize on my nose. To the resplendent affluent silence in your fingernails of crushing the thicket begins to dream of treading.
