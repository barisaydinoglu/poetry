Technical Antennae Are All Outside Us
-------------------------------------
Burnt umber and velvety stranger,  
and alcoves and ribbons.  
In my modern office at midnight you are like a planetarium  
and your form and colour the way I gallop them.  
Halfway.  
You rescue headlong into a region to kiss your business.  
I stayed refreshed and blue  
in the middle of the jungle.  
If I could perch the belt and the area.  
The essential custodian  
plays in the absent minded morning. I took on bitter shadess of sunburst orange.  
Rotten early light of day and the furious smooth broken glass  
scratch at the walls of my house.  
We open the halves of a epiphany and the  
mutating of beasts breathes into the indespensable moonlight evening.  
Next to the imprisoning acids.
