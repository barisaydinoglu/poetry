The Barbaous Cousin Of The City
-------------------------------
How swimming is the great invasion and it's stationary coffins?  
And you pulse like a cathedral and what seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
Of a red one that re-covers laminated signs.  
And the grape to its sun  
and among the writings the fresh one  
the person covered with sensual energy.  
A vessel is not enough to steal me and keep me  
from the vicinity of your gleaming secrets.  
Shone and then magnified in the area.  
The rustling oyster dawns behind the steady probes.  
Law of a drowned muzzled hoove.  
Full stop.  
  
I'm the elder to the stalks of cattail of immediate essence.  
She is behind us at this moment of first beginning.
