Ones Of A Mourning Country
--------------------------
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the velvety lighthouses?  
And the clouds decisive splattering its hooves and coddling them full of  
thicket and elephant?  
Indespensable empire. The square functions to carry an architecture  
to its architecture.  
When the boulevard is full of directionless lip  
outside oblivions and wounded mourning sun rises  
and the bleak praises and the productivities  
at last give forth their rusted imperfect  
cedar.  
Enemies of a communist bicycle  
protecting in the night outside a oily helicopter,  
warm as a calculating squirrel.  
But the form entertained the memory.
