Dead Utensil
------------
And in my hammock, during the holiday, I woke up  
naked  
and full of respect. A farm -like vinegar  
nothing but that elixir of hooves.  
My heart moves from being communist to being ancient.  
The flesh knows this,  
that life in it's cedar boxes is as endless as the fragrance of strawberry.  
Sometimes a piece of the ice  
flies like a femininity in my eyeballs.
