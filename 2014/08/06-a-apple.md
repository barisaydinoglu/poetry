A Apple
-------
They are all women  
professional trash barges in whose parenthetical smooth aluminums originate.  
Nothing but that sphere of stones.  
Within the brimstone illusion of the wall.  
The reasons for my respect  
are flowed in my lip of crystal.  
Where flags meet  
fleshes meet, next to and in and the sound  
of conglomerates, to reach out and understand in agony.  
Of smooth plum, spirit  
of the faucets,  
undulated astronaut blood, your kisses  
wet into exile  
and a droplet of diamond, with remnants of the city.  
  
Recovering a farm  
wove in the noble sun.  
I was without doubt the pioneer iguana  
there in the wayside area.  
When it looked me with its real sea's skin eyes  
it had neither fingernails nor eyelids  
but wooden sun rises on its sides.  
A loaf of bread baked with harsh pride and salt.  
Inside the furious jungle of cold nature.  
Agony and flesh - stars of agony.  
In front of the black illusion of the imbroglio.  
Pockets of aluminum converted into silken.  
A stone focuses its dream of a old ending, its new ending, the new ending of the drop order -  
its myriad scandalmongerings.  
It's a re-covering flute of bloods.  
Inside the cracking moths.  
Closed off and pulled out like a river.
