The Neurotic Bloodied Metal
---------------------------
Conversations of stalkss of cattail, the recitation  
of fellowships we call hidden light.  
A gray and thirsty phemonana is congealed in the jungle.  
Time was no longer above the recording threshold.  
Transparent bloods of conglomerate,  
blue seams above a disintered serenity.  
My eloquent breath treads you always.  
A language for machine is the lack thereof.
