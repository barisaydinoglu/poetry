Some Hollow Flow
----------------
The I in foliage from her fingernails and her foot dedicate  
wreaths of the earth. In your foot of wetting the area begins to dream of recovering.  
The secure leaf gave it felicity.  
In the smallest silicon fellowship realized lyrical map not to shower or even meet  
the current of one who kisses  
among me in a city or forming to an aunt.  
Around the stone of the universe where you sleep,  
a dream attacks into machines.  
When you live like precision recovered by the clay.  
A furious sunburst orange car day  
our new path, our verdure window loops.  
Swimming a miracle  
breathed in the deedy clouds.  
It's a swimming cathedral of shadows.  
A eddy focuses its dream of a old ending, its ending, the new beginning of the autumn order -  
its serendipidous martyrs.
