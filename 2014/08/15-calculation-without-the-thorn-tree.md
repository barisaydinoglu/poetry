Calculation Without The Thorn Tree
----------------------------------
And you reflect like a bridge and the friendships  
exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
next to it in darkness.  
The slender dignity of the love!  
Mourn me and let my substance stand.  
And lights and love.  
What coagulates the props of respect?  
A sunshine of river banks what lyrical foams -  
the area is filled with it,  
trysts for the mane and the careless cedar.  
  
The water indespensable oxides are coddled.  
Neither land nor school nor red  
nor crimson but transparent.  
On what fuming oblivions perched with wind?  
I'd do it for the honeysuckle in which you swim  
for the banners of burnt umber you've circumscribed.
