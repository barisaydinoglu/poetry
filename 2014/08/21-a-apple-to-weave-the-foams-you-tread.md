A Apple To Weave The Foams You Tread
------------------------------------
A vessel is not enough to dismantle me and keep me  
from the sea of your poetic mysteries.  
Around the blue brow of the sky.  
Not to flutter or even meet  
the elixir of one who seeks  
under me in an area or dedicating to a person. Outside the writing of the archipeligos where you sleep,  
a dream forces into cameras.
