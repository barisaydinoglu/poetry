Here I Flow You
---------------
I am erupted by saxophone and ash, by convict and thunder.  
Of your red warmth of your body when you hold out your eye.  
Indicates the saxophone's beginning leg.  
How inheriting is the full vagabond and it's pure vaginas?  
Pure howl awakens the promises a blood colored and decadent rose is rejected in the night.  
For a day, maybe million,  
I rested under a ray of sunlight  
at a bus stop, waiting for the aunt to be around.  
Behind the spoiled smooth stone, many bitten seperations.  
A mist of telegraphs of a dark pioneer that refreshes reflections.  
We open the halves of a curiosities and the  
lunging of wombs stands into the parsimonious sea.  
Pure cubicle entertains the sea shells all stones become vaginas.  
I want you to connect on my tail.  
Behind the jungle like ash.
