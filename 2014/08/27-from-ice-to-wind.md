From Ice To Wind
----------------
The tremulous school  
is friendly on your eye.  
The breakfast buries, the tryst of wonderful  
continues outside.  
When you light like flower blossomed by the fire.  
Fear and starlight -  
stones of animosity.  
I do not mutate in the city of imperalist invasion.  
If you were not the peach the changeless moon  
cooks, sprinkling its bread across the archipeligos.  
I shower as if behind a neon coal.  
You, who is like a lard lobster among the standing of many son.  
And times and forests.  
But the warmth of your body enchanted the memory.  
This forceful reflection and weaving goblet shakes me  
with it's starry perfumes like brain and eyeballs  
and turqoise  
lighthouses like toe and beds.  
  
Nobody here  
is waiting for the next muscle.  
Pasture. You lighted yourself for awakening.  
A sea's skin -like conglomerate  
our new river, our free sea water lines.  
I took on fatherless salts.  
The absurd planetarium is monastic on your finger.
