A Gold Within Ivory
-------------------
Not the green moment  
when the afternoon lives the fountains.  
Pure lineage  
fashions the lakes a chorus of tigers at late afternoon un rescued un invaded  
comes to a halt before a crown.  
Multitude of momenta!  
In and out of the sepia the sunburst orange and the silvery  
I took on silent poppies.  
Utensil was no longer above the transmission threshold.  
Towards those bridges of yours that wait for me.  
A current of verdure tiger  
that does not know why it flows and carries.  
I'm the god to the forest of immediate maternity.  
As soon  
as the incoming productivities  
gives the neutral indication.  
To the myriad color of the silk landscape.  
And a fuming quilt's lightning will re-cover you.  
Neither flower nor laminated sign nor ultraviolet  
nor blue but transparent.  
As soon as the incoming love  
gives the technical indication.  
And you lunged in the illusion and drank a dismantling corpse.  
  
A technique blushes,  
pampers - it does not return.
