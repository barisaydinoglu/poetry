A Dashing Substance
-------------------
One grammatic option and the ribbon plan that has everyone worn-out. Trusting the defender of her stone full of felicity.  
There ought to be a banner of a silent echo storing in a jungle.  
  
You've asked me what the squirrel is gathering there with his green shoulder?  
I reply, the love knows this.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the boundless railroad tracks?  
And the mist mineral splattering its rivers and deceiving them full of  
region and cat?  
A circle among a circle,  
the calculating workings of plumed law.  
When the archipeligos is full of worn-out fingernails  
within thorn trees and dead dead ships  
and the careless femininities and the curtains  
at last give forth their bleak wasteland.  
A triangle among a circle,  
the boney workings of myriad law.  
Fewer and fewer  
petrify about another mode of love.  
The barbaous crab enriches in the middle of the mineral oblivions.
