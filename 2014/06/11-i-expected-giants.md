I Expected Giants
-----------------
I  
was without doubt the pioneer oyster  
there in the obscene region.  
When it looked me with its perfect ripple eyes  
it had neither ears nor shoulder  
but emerald guitars on its sides.  
A red and hairy bottle is silenced in the archipeligos.  
Behind the sand-colored toe of the earth.  
The dust imposes nessecity.  
All droplets become jugulars.  
To seek another land when you set like warmth of your body rescued by the electricity.  
  
A eyeballs and a brow  
travelling the modern office.  
Shall we go forward?
