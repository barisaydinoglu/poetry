Grammatic Calculations Are All Outside Us
-----------------------------------------
This cold book and perching propeller soddens me  
with it's essential rivers like ears and heart  
and black umbrellas like arm and faucets.  
What mysteries does the lobster contain?  
How little we fashion and how much it appreciates the curiosities of this universe.  
And so that its noises will delude your finger.  
But I should be untrue to oceanography, dropping among its motionless flags  
so let us seek to divulge a story without algorithmic redundancies.  
  
Seeking a circus  
performed in the eloquent sun.  
A square with a tetrahedron,  
the difficult workings of enduring law.  
Nothing but that salt of energies.  
Where awes meet  
praises meet, inside and around and the sound  
of havocs, to reach out and pulse in panic.  
I'm the custodian to the serenity of immediate cathedral.  
Draw from it the calculating  
calculation of its own detail.  
  
In your curves of panic the field of starlights hear.  
Of a opaque blood colored elder that expands ripples.
