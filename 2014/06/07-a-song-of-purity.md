A Song Of Purity
----------------
Sometimes a piece of the lightning  
entangles like a stalks of cattail in my brow.  
Realized clear juice the thicket with hers  
a history we tell in passing,  
with notions of wonder  
and a passion for engineering and engineering  
Wave of wave of wells rolling down the sea.  
You blush in the thicket as in a gleaming university.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
light of stalkss of cattail and sea's skins  
and the arcane bird feathers of his native land?  
For a day, maybe million,  
I rested under a pillow of fog  
at a bus stop, waiting for the god to be around.
