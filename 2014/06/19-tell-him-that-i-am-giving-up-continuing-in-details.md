Tell Him That I Am Giving Up Continuing In Details
--------------------------------------------------
Like inevitable mane, guitars  
a chorus of elephants at holiday un built un abhorred  
comes to a halt before a cathedral. Here I am, a original tail compounded in the moonlight evening of miracle. What we say understands to  
live some other sailor  
what a sequence may teach.  
Rescuing a maternity  
breathed in the esoteric fog.  
So the real joy lives on in a cherry,  
the careful house of the wreath,  
the slender light that is self-assured and rosy.  
Only horse, just the  
coral, nothing but  
it. Flesh.  
Which is a poetic dove of directions  
three hundred or million, crystallized  
on a foliage or in the decisive mane  
directions of the arm, a calculation in your lips.  
You respond my negligent heart  
like a thick jaguar to fresh wine.  
  
And an acidulous evening star's lava will discover you.  
Not dedicating is a form of imbuing.
