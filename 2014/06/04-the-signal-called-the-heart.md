The Signal Called The Heart
---------------------------
So the balanced wonder lives on in a tomato,  
the pure house of the lemon,  
the sensual poppy that is brandishing and parenthetical. The celestial child  
mixes in the boundless morning.  
A chorus of tigers at morning un made un imprisoned  
comes to a halt before a flower.  
Exiled complaints and motionless stalactites.  
Deep brown lightning to my disordered grace!  
Your arm divulges from north to west  
in my chimney at sunrise you are like a praise  
and your form and colour the way I light them.  
Wave of wave of mirrors rolling down the sea.  
  
Like senile perfume, paths  
and goblets and rivers.  
How returning is the smooth conspirator and it's cleansed abberations?
