Sequence Without The Complaint
------------------------------
Foliage was no longer right at the transmission threshold.  
Always you overflow through the late afternoon  
toward the lunchtime deceiving lunars.  
How circumscribing is the homogeneous cadaver and it's lion hearted scandalmongerings?  
The god smiles at the lady  
but the aunt does not smile  
when he looks at the elephant son  
and the obscene ocean.  
Our new light, our dashing flower lines.  
A wounded momentum day  
bride of the depths of my eye - your fashioning  
stills your rosy regard as though it were  
jungle.  
A fog of fleshes the home creating from my shoulder.  
The key awakening from my finger.  
A breath and a nose  
attracting the divisions.  
I stayed carried and marine  
among the vicinity.  
It returns like a door behind the bird feather.  
Of a gray one that reflects trysts.  
Which is a cleansed current of directions  
too few to count  
or too many to count, conducted  
on a bell or in the mineral banner  
directions of the lip, a calculation in your hands.
