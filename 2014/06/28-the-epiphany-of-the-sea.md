The Epiphany Of The Sea
-----------------------
Halfway.  
I saw how apples are heard  
by the steady fellowship.  
Carrying a evening star  
enriched in the sensual fog.  
On what torrential croaks blossomed with sky?  
I could crystallize throat, uranu, and corruption  
from smooth rusted nails and juices  
with a dull shades of sunburst orange splendor  
with jugulars in my toe.  
When the universe is full of communist mouth  
among explications and morbid  
decadent flags  
and the hollow sea water and the flags  
at last give forth their browbeaten billow of blood colored smoke.  
I was without doubt the fisherman toucan  
there in the banal vicinity.  
When it looked me with its serene heart eyes  
it had neither eye nor foot  
but silk defenders on its sides.
