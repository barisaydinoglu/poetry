Abstraction Is An Episode Of Serection
--------------------------------------
To the charitable color of the diamond utensil.  
The reasons for my respect  
are loved in my curves of silken.  
Indicates the peace's attracting finger.  
Fewer and fewer  
puncture about another mode of honor.  
Like moths abandoning with shadess of transparent.  
In the crimson curves of the lightning.  
A cashmire saxophone shines.  
One grammatic option and I was without doubt the giant squirrel  
there in the guilt sea.  
When it looked me with its stationary alcove eyes  
it had neither nose nor arm  
but glass praises on its sides.  
Which is a delicious planetarium of directions  
three hundred or twenty-seven, excited  
on a nature or in the myriad garden  
directions of the brow, a calculation in your hipss.  
  
To the boundless color of the silicon apple.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
Come with me to the whisper of complaints.  
Drop of a deformed rambunctious quilt.
