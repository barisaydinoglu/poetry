A Grape
-------
Carry me onto  
your vessel - the orange  
of my door -  
you shine in the archipeligos as in a enchanting land.  
I salute your resplendent nectarine  
and envy your original pride.  
Sometimes a piece of the jungle  
petrifies like a map in my heart.  
If I could return the saliva and the thicket.  
Once there was a demonic daughter who  
carried at parties, sitting in a line, among crowns.  
The I in branch behind the black panic of the funeral.
