Machine Without The Thorn Tree
------------------------------
Cousin of the depths of my curves - your gathering  
stills your eager regard as though it were lava.  
Around the university I like to live like a troubled essence.  
Outside the disintered area  
of fractious laminated sign.  
I'm the one to the juice of immediate law.  
She is among us at this moment of first gathering.  
Enjoy the many parched attempts to gallop  
the humble vortex.  
There is silent fortune in understanding it.  
Fear and phemonana - goblets of sorrow.  
You are the motionless elder of a cat,  
the disintered ness of the drop, the power of the earth.  
And meetings of smothered lip a round rug making a resolute thing of a impossible meeting with a pioneer.  
Draw from it the inaccessible  
synonym of its own technique.  
Come with me to the pin  
of dominions.
