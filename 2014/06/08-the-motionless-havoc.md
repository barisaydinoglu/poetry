The Motionless Havoc
--------------------
Inside the dove of the universe where you sleep,  
a dream harasses into cameras.  
A awe flying will discover  
the ironous clay of a planet.  
The directionless oyster mingles inside the silent oxides.  
In the face of so many billowss of blood colored smoke to positivity.  
The order of the coats when you re-cover pulsed like a momentum.  
I took on frightened lighthouses.  
Promising from bitterest ceramic.  
Neither honeysuckle nor acrobat nor turqoise  
nor yellow but silvery.  
For a day, maybe too few to count,  
I rested under a ocean wave  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the one to be in front of.  
Halfway.  
To expand lost moons and for evening stars.  
So the unguessed purity lives on in a kiwi,  
the clear house of the fountain,  
the cordial perfume that is handsome and parenthetical.  
And  
you divulge like a kis and she is inside us at this moment of first enchanting.
