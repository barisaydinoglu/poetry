The Frail Sailor
----------------
A clouds of windows a tail and a foot  
perfuming the boulevard. I took on dry corals.  
Everybody here is waiting for the next stars in the sky.  
Mirror. You wove yourself for perfuming.  
What is this point of view but a memory silenced of its cinnamon cars?  
To seek another land a image for synonym is the lack thereof.  
Pockets of ash converted into marble.
