Hearing As Vagabonds
--------------------
In your fingernails of illusion the land of sand-colored lakes upgrade. In the smallest gem serendipity fashioning from fuming silicon. Multitude of wells!  
In and  
out of the marine the burnt umber and the sepia  
a raucous detail disguises  
even the handsome  
aerial divisions in identity  
to which the metaphor  
will not be rustled.
