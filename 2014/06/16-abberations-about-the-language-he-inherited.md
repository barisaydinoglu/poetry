Abberations About The Language He Inherited
-------------------------------------------
Against the tear stained area of wounded angel. Closed off and pulled out like a wheatfield.  
A production for metaphor is the lack thereof.  
Next to the dark illusion of the trap.  
We get the meaning  
they must lots to mix  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but brambles.  
Perhaps they are not mutated.  
Realized cordial foam I'm  
the lady to the serenity of immediate foam.  
Nothing but that  
prize of lighthouses.  
Everything lethargic with acerb voices, the salt of the key  
and piles of self-assured bread in night.  
Serendipity was no longer right at the recording threshold.  
Like the smothered rusted nail of lemons an odor has lighted in the wreath,  
a mixture of gate and body, a divulging  
sun that brings anger.
