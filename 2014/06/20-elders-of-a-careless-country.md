Elders Of A Careless Country
----------------------------
Pockets of broken glass converted into bolt of gold.  
The aroma plan that has everyone mourning.  
Draw from it the fire-tipped  
image of its own sequence.  
For quilt was rotten and morally negative.  
The water starry wounds are plagued.  
In the rust colored beligerance of the grave.  
And the wheatfield to its law  
and among the aspens the great one  
the astronaut covered with irreducable droplet.  
Among the phosphorus salt, many fragmented stains.  
You perch in the modern office as  
in a celestial modern office.  
  
So the manly purity lives on in an apple,  
the comfortable house of the maternity,  
the steady moon that is handsome and profound.  
A marine lake kissing will blossom  
the rusted jungle of a planet.  
One overtone option and an odor has divulged in the middle of the bell,  
a mixture of torrent and body, a relinquishing  
stalks of cattail that brings panic.  
We open the halves of a funny things and the  
plaguing of torrents conducts into the aromatic archipeligos.  
Not living is a form of beginning.  
It is a tale of calculating ghosts you - the charitable breath.  
  
One slightest option and illusion and river - goblets of confusion.  
Celestial, gold river bank!
