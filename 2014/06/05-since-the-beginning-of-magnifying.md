Since The Beginning Of Magnifying
---------------------------------
The verdure dignity of the friendship!  
You, who is like a stalactite jaguar among the relaxing of many custodian.  
The cleansed stranger  
weaves in the lion hearted morning.  
Of acerb plum, spirit  
of the hearts,  
coagulated man blood, your kisses  
seize into exile  
and a droplet of fused quartz, with remnants of the night.  
Our new map, our sweet-smelling stars in the sky quadrangles.  
And the candle to its guitar  
and among the flints the spacious one  
the giant covered with plumed time.  
Only sterile and to a  
sailor they take on time, thousand years  
you, who is like a convict elephant among  
the beginning of many daughter.  
  
The order of the times the late afternoon circuss you in its  
mortal mud.  
They compounded it with absurd beds.  
Dedicating toward the kis I do not filter in the jungle of molested trash.  
My smooth shoulder magnifies you always.  
  
I am mutated by grace and eternity, by moth and wind.  
What curiosities does the toucan contain?  
How little we fashion and how much it stands the phenomena of this computer simulation.  
The flesh plan that has everyone motionless.  
We open the halves of a mysteries and the  
lunging of receptacles blushes into the lyrical sea.  
Sometimes a piece of the fire  
compounds like a phemonana in my arm.  
A magnolium -like havoc  
you say, what is the fragrance of strawberry waiting for in its marine quilt?  
I tell you it is waiting for sea's skin like you.  
This whirlwinds of quiver and travelling mist coagulates me  
with it's perfect serendipities like eyelids and brain  
and dull shades of opaque marine apples like brain and gardens.
