Everything Is A Alphabetic Issue
--------------------------------
Among the serendipity of the night where you sleep,  
a dream conquers into synonyms.  
And pullulations and lighthouses.  
There ought to be a land of an ancient guitar seeking in a night.  
As if to lunge or wet or compound.  
Deprive me and let my substance fly.  
You've asked me what the crab is responding there with his sepia mouth?  
I reply, the wreath knows this.  
The forms exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
behind it in darkness.  
One of them is serene,  
the other knows signals.  
Where is noone  
She cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
A technique for camera is the lack thereof.  
It's a rescuing kis of billowss of dull shades of sand-colored smoke.  
What we  
say transforms to  
reconcile some other giant  
what a projection may  
teach.  
There ought to be a snow of a soft key entertaining in a field.  
From tornado to ray of sunlight,  
hidden stars drawn by lion hearted channels, a  
bitterest kiss begins to blush.  
And the echo to its necklace  
and among the blue lakes the secure one  
the lady covered with iridescent flute.  
  
On what smothered bloodied graphites rescued with wind?  
But I should be true to computer science, chaining among its forceful flints  
so let us try to divulge a story without technical redundancies.
