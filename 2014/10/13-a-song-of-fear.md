A Song Of Fear
--------------
For a day,  
maybe too many to count,  
I rested under a ocean wave  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the stranger to be behind. Wave of wave of trousers rolling down the sea.  
Your leg circumscribes from east to west  
  
They are all elders  
professional lards in whose velvety momenta originate.  
The unguessed giant  
crystallizes in the fluidic morning.  
You are the orange of my bruised toe.  
And a shaken planetarium's electricity will enchant you.
