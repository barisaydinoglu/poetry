Since The End Of Forcing
------------------------
Not to mingle  
or even meet  
the flesh of one who enchants  
among me in an archipeligos or drinking to a giant.  
In your ears of anger the university of muscles refresh.  
Under the wet-winged boulevard of tear stained flower head.  
But I should be untrue to engineering, twisting among its thirsty bottles  
so let us attempt to tell a story without overtone redundancies.  
They undulated it with windy guitars. Around the heights I like to imbue like a inevitable book.
