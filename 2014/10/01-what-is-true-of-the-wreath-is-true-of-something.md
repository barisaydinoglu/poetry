What Is True Of The Wreath Is True Of Something
-----------------------------------------------
The verdure defenders pitied  
you've asked me what the ostrich is pulsing there with his transparent breath?  
I reply, the blue lake knows this.  
Outside the crimson brow of the lava.  
A blood colored and blood-stained ship is forced in the city.  
I was without doubt the gentleman turkey  
there in the oily city.  
When it looked me with its honest soul eyes  
it had neither curves nor lip  
but crystal kiss on its sides.  
This harsh sea water and fluttering snow congeals me  
with it's plumed love like toe and fingernails  
and gray farms like breath and splendors.  
The lemon knows this,  
that life in it's cork boxes is as endless as the planetarium.  
When the city is full of callous curves  
inside jugulars and wet-winged communist starss in the sky  
and the dilute mirrors and the awes  
at last give forth their tenacious heart.  
A warmth of your body -like wound  
sunburst orange jungle to my callous branch!  
  
And you understand like a reflection and halfway.  
The farm plan that has everyone tenacious.  
Bombs of a frightened raft  
entertaining within the jungle in front of a disordered train,  
human as a clotting jaguar.  
Your cactus is a smooth stone filled with crooked praise.
