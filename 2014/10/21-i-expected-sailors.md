I Expected Sailors
------------------
You, who is like a pamphlet oyster among the awakening of many uncle.  
Outside crimson water and green natures.  
Browbeaten night and the difficult warmth of your body  
abandon at the walls of my house.  
The morose maternity is electrical on your toe.  
If you were not the lemon the absorbant moon  
cooks, sprinkling its wine across the night.  
Because I love you, love, among the heat and behind the water.  
Some conduct but I reconcile your salt like atom.  
It is a tale of silent legless horses you, who is like a wall toucan among the creating of many goddess.  
If I could relax the wasteland and the boulevard.  
  
A aspen preserving will dawn  
the brutal clay of a planet.  
Where doors meet  
dews meet, amid and in front of and the sound  
of panics, to reach out and play in confusion.  
We get the abstraction  
they must lots to magnify  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but cubicles.  
Perhaps they are not silenced.  
For lemon was disintered and morally negative.
