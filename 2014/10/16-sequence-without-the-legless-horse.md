Sequence Without The Legless Horse
----------------------------------
Halfway.  
And a wounded angel's earth will stand you.  
I want you to trust on my eyelids.  
Carry me onto your raft - the grape of my defender -  
I saw how books are gathered  
by the solute law.  
The ice cleansed abberations are chained.  
When you swim like affection pulsed by the clay.  
So the verdure felicity lives on in a orange,  
the hidden house of the ritual,  
the ancient stars in the sky that is dashing and starry.  
Ghostly weather, fuming lights like the wave.  
There ought to be a kis of a rosy goblet magnifying in a room.
