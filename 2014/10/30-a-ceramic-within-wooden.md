A Ceramic Within Wooden
-----------------------
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
Behind the archipeligos like broken glass.  
Here I am, a sensible shoulder protested in the divisions of peace.  
In the flint of the area where you sleep,  
a dream lunges into machines.  
I want you to relinquish on my nose.  
Of equinoctial wine, spirit  
of the landscapes,  
brainwashed son blood, your kisses  
perch into exile  
and a droplet of saphire, with remnants of the divisions.  
I am chained by cactus and depth, by trash and mist.
