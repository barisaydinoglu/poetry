Setting The Pullulation In Motion
---------------------------------
Parenthetical, cedar river bank! The bird feather knows this,  
that life in it's gem boxes is as endless as the miracle.  
I could love depth, jackal, and night  
from aromas and cactuss  
with a turqoise path  
with coals in my hand.
