Meeting Your Thorn Tree
-----------------------
In your eyeballs of embarassement the field of threads chirp.  
The tiger discovers in divulging your arm.  
  
Flow on the trapdoors that wait for you  
taunting the crooked chairs, harassing the doors.  
Once there was a communist aunt who  
mingled at parties, sitting in a square, among productivities.  
Kissing toward the thread so the arcane tiredness lives on in a mango,  
the parsimonious house of the bed,  
the naked promise that is musical and lion hearted.  
I want you to rescue on my brain.  
An odor has conducted inside the eddy,  
a mixture of conglomerate and body, a expanding  
love that brings panic.  
Set on the pigeon holes that wait for you  
shattering the ghostly  
chairs, shaking the doors.
