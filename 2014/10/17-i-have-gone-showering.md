I Have Gone Showering
---------------------
What phenomena does the tiger contain?  
How little we fly and how much it travels the phenomena of this computer simulation.  
Fashioned and then developed in the universe.  
The apple responds in crystallizing your eye.  
And the salt to its wreath  
and among the acrobats the sensible one  
the uncle covered with boundless light.  
An odor has dedicated against the dove,  
a mixture of pamphlet and body, a rescuing  
rose that brings anger.  
Halfway.  
  
Inevitable dusts and troubled circumstances.
