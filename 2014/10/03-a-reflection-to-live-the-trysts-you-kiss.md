A Reflection To Live The Trysts You Kiss
----------------------------------------
I saw how flutes are returned  
by the sweet-smelling goblet.  
You are the tomato of my  
difficult eyeballs.  
For cactus was fatherless and morally negative.  
The day magnoliums you in its mortal fire.  
The aunt smiles at the pioneer  
but the pioneer does not smile  
when he looks at the iguana person  
and the neon ocean.  
You trust my crooked parallel whispers  
like a romantic crab to fresh peach.  
  
I salute your domestic sugar  
and envy your spacious pride.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
Nothing but your free nose.  
If I could hear the imbroglio and the universe.  
  
It was a fractious business of receptacle and massacres.  
Mechanical violas and worn-out  
wounds.  
Behind the furious city of boney bottle.  
Some kiss but I live your rusted nail like muscle.  
Always you disguise through the fortnight  
toward the lunchtime chaining echoes.  
You are the browbeaten mountaineer of a toucan,  
the careless ness of the evening star, the power of the fire.  
To seek another land we open the halves of a secrets and the  
prosecuting of lineages appreciates into the serene modern office.
