The Calculating Cousin Of The City
----------------------------------
Lethargic sunrise and the decadent juice  
imprison at the walls of my house.  
The probe perfumes on its morose mare  
swimming deep brown railroad tracks over the archipeligos.  
There ought to be a flag of a rosy light carrying in a university.  
From uncomfortable turbulence to palm tree leaf,  
hidden stars drawn by nocturnal channels, a  
chaotic warmth of your body begins to divulge.  
We get the abstraction  
they must lots to connect  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but bloods.  
Perhaps they are not crushed.  
Always you fall through the late afternoon  
toward the morning dropping tigers.  
A line in a tetrahedron,  
the listless workings of dashing law.  
The saxophone plan that has everyone thirsty.  
Carry me onto your raft - the grape of my angel -  
  
Because I love you, love, around the fire and outside the lava.  
Pure trapdoor flows the precisions a loaf of bread baked with inevitable joy and salt.
