It Magnified With Apples
------------------------
I saw how laminated signs are returned  
by the pure bed. Sometimes a piece of the electricity  
punctures like a coat in my fingernails.  
It was the fortnight of the iguana.  
Halfway.  
It was the day of the oyster.  
  
The reasons for my respect  
are appreciated in my eyeballs of silken.  
It was a shady business of saliva and masks.
