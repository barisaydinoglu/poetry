The Boney Stranger
------------------
It is a tale of banal stenches and you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
build of curtains and manes  
and the myriad flowers of his native land?  
Neither flower head nor fountain nor ultraviolet  
nor cinnamon but burnt umber.  
What balanced perfumes -  
the vicinity is filled with it,  
flowers for the lake and the fragmented glass.  
Phemonana of a chained rigid fragrance of strawberry.  
Of a turqoise person that chirps angels.  
And a worn-out goblet's water will promise you.  
It was the twilight of the bird.  
The fortnight grapes you in its mortal fire.  
It was the twilight of the lobster.  
From her eyeballs and her brow attract  
umbrellas of the earth.
