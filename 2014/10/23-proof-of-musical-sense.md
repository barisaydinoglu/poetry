Proof Of Musical Sense
----------------------
You travel in the region as in a trusting divisions.  
Not to perch or even meet  
the faucet of one who rescues  
in the middle of me in a region or travelling to a fisherman.  
Neither smooth ash nor flower head nor blood colored  
nor green but marine.  
With crimson water and cashmire fleshes.  
  
Fear and wreath - rivers of embarassement.  
How relinquishing is the starry nougat and it's loving coffins?  
Return to the homeland of the bottles.  
Blossoming the moon of her mist full of pride.  
A poetic linoleum making a self-assured thing of a chance meeting with an aunt.  
The I in telegraph multitude of alcoves!  
In and out of the opaque yellow the transluscent sepia and the burnt umber  
the area among hers  
a history we speak in passing,  
with notions of happiness  
and a passion for computer science and science
