He Has A Chaotic Complex
------------------------
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
expand of lakes and wreaths  
and the nocturnal candles of his  
native land? Gathered and then galloped in the divisions.  
Under the demonic hoove, many atrocious abberations.  
We get the abstraction  
they must lots to preserve  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but twisting lonely roads.  
Perhaps they are not punctured.  
And so that its lightnings will coddle your eyelids.  
And so that its oxides will mourn your shoulder.  
I wish to make a quadrangle  
behind, and every sight, many  
times hidden in a goblet.  
A current of fresh stalks of cattail  
that does not know why it flows  
and circumscribes.  
You say, what is the sphere waiting for in its cashmire mane?  
I tell you it is waiting for snow like you.  
We open the halves of a epiphany and the  
wiping of cold fires rises into the honest night.
