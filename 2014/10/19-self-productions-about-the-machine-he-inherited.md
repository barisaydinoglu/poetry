Self-productions About The Machine He Inherited
-----------------------------------------------
Hidden, gold grape!  
Realized romantic form I stayed transformed and yellow  
against the university.  
A loaf of bread baked with hollow purity and salt.  
Wonder is gone, the subject has dedicated.  
I stayed connected and silvery  
against the sea.  
Pulled out and closed off like a starry sky.  
What we say hears to  
pacify some other custodian  
what a language may teach.  
The lava friendly abyss are abhorred.  
I weave as if within a harsh error.  
And meetings of atrocious fingernails enjoy the many  
lewd attempts to wet  
the thick lineage.  
There is serene fortune in rescuing it.
