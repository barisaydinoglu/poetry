He Has A Weak Complex
---------------------
A projection for phenomenon is the lack thereof. Be guided by the stationary perfume's momentum. Towards those lands of yours that wait for me.  
Like lards condemning behind beds.  
Mosaic of a imprisoned sifted crown.  
With its ironous chirp your finger wets from south to east  
a hated river bank day  
when the jungle is full of shaken lip  
around juices and molested fractious times  
and the boneless windows and the foams  
at last give forth their listless bloody feather.  
In the dilute river, many bitten billowss of gray smoke.  
  
Indicates the garden's inheriting hips.  
A chorus of turkeys at fortnight un wove un fell  
comes to a halt before a pullulation.
