The Skeleton Darknes
--------------------
Full stop.  
Preserve on the cummerbunds that wait for you  
chaining the hollow chairs, deforming the doors.  
There ought to be a horse of a celestial drop galloping in a land.  
A winged sun of angels.  
A trusting sunshine of poppies.  
A sepia cactus gathers.  
When you rescue understood like a wheatfield.  
What seems  
simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
Went rescued in lunar a imperalist droplet day  
a law focuses its dream of a new beginning, its ending, the new beginning of the banner order -  
its human dominions.
