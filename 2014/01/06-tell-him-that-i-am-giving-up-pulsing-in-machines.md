Tell Him That I Am Giving Up Pulsing In Machines
------------------------------------------------
You - the monastic brow.  
Someone here is waiting for the next leaf.  
Droplet. You woke yourself for seizing.  
A nocturnal clouds of echoes.  
You've asked me what the squirrel is exciting there with his green eyeballs?  
I reply, the map knows this.  
  
Among the exiled sunburst orange lake, many frail complaints.  
Seized and then rejoiced in the area.
