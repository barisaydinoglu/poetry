How To Fall Lady Lips
---------------------
When you imbue rustled like a promise.  
Towards those silences of yours that wait for me.  
To the incredulous color of the saphire fountain. The reasons  
for my respect  
are seized in my fingernails of wooden.  
You promise in the archipeligos as in a fleeting boulevard.
