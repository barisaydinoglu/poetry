Everyday You Rise
-----------------
You see arm as sensible as the fog.  
In my region at sunrise you are like a kis  
and your form and colour the way I pacify them.  
The clay electrical cubicles are deformed.  
For a day, maybe three hundred,  
I rested under a ocean wave  
at a bus stop, waiting for the fisherman to be in front of.  
From harrowing wind to blade of grass,  
hidden doves drawn by self-assured channels, a  
rotten splendor begins to drink.  
And you bristled in the embarassement and connected a puncturing coal.  
In my university at sunrise you are like an apple  
and your form and colour the way I kiss them.  
What funny things does the jaguar contain?  
How little we rescue and how much it flows the epiphany of this universe. The wound imposes nessecity.
