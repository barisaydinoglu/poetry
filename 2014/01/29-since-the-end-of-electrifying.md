Since The End Of Electrifying
-----------------------------
Conversations of miracles, the recitation  
of jars we call myriad nature.  
A bicycle is not enough to replace me and keep me  
from the sea of your handsome funny things.  
When you connect like starry sky swam by the wind.  
In my field at early light of day you are like a breakfast  
and your form and colour the way I pacify them.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
gallop of wreaths and elixirs  
and the infinite branches of his native land?  
Carry me onto your bicycle - the grape of my eddy -  
  
Outside the silent quilt, many frightened trash barges.  
Indicates the movie's divulging arm.  
In the hollow thicket of tenacious trouser.  
Around the jungle I like to breathe like a brutal sunburst orange car.  
Went magnified in  
phemonana you are the apple of my inevitable shoulder.  
We open the halves of a mysteries and the  
abolishing of thorn trees pacifies into the sensual chimney.  
Pockets of clay converted into gem.  
Among the universe like ash.  
Only senile and to a  
pioneer they take on time, twenty-seven years  
Electric empire. The line segment functions to rise a environment  
to its environment.  
But I should be true to computer science, invading among its torrential hearts  
so let us attempt to divulge a story without neutral redundancies.
