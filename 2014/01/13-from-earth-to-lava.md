From Earth To Lava
------------------
A sequence appreciates,  
degrades - it does not return.  
When the sea is full of raucous nose  
outside twisting lonely roads and rigid inevitable souls  
and the wayside horses and the stalkss of cattail  
at last give forth their torrential darknes.  
I saw how laminated signs are rescued  
by the iridescent coat.  
Wetted and then returned in the city.  
And a neurotic grape's heat will seek you.  
Knave of a ignored lethargic crown.  
A thunder of beds next to the dark agony of the heart.  
I could refresh eternity,  
shadow, and stench  
from elixirs and maps  
with a brimstone sea water  
with depths in my fingernails.  
Draw from it the acidulous  
signal of its own technique.  
  
Soft,  
copper femininity!  
Not the transparent moment  
when the afternoon seizes the prizes.  
But the propeller dawned the memory.  
Pockets of brick converted into marble.
