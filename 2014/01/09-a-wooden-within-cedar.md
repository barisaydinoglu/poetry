A Wooden Within Cedar
---------------------
I do not deceive in the chimney of disordered vigil.  
In the smallest silicon cluster my delicate ears creates you always.  
Like the sterile steel of pencils behind the turqoise embarassement of the saliva.  
Difficult morning and the dilute flute  
loiter at the walls of my house.  
A balanced carpet making a naked thing of a unlikely meeting with a sailor. Realized steady light wave of wave of trysts rolling down the sea.  
Someone here is waiting for the next promise.  
Bed. You excited yourself for kissing.  
The comfortable dignity of the coat!  
To seek another land the wide elder  
understands in the angellic morning.
