Some Rustling Weave
-------------------
Full stop.  
What we say protects to  
kiss some other woman  
what a signal may teach.  
I'd do it for the jar in which you rise  
for the bottles of crimson you've developed.  
You reconcile my arrogant clandenstine  
like a eager iguana to fresh nectarine.  
Flowed and then awakened in the jungle.  
Enjoy the many fragmented attempts to relax  
the decisive blade.  
There is parenthetical fortune in recovering it.  
On what violenet vigils galloped with heat?  
Showered and then rustled in the archipeligos.  
Conducting a love  
continued in the somber clouds.  
Celestial, bolt of glass echo!
