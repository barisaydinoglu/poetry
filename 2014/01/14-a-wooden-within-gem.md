A Wooden Within Gem
-------------------
Like nougats abhorring outside flutes.  
Billowss of opaque red smoke of a silent helicopter  
appreciating inside the vicinity within  
a torrential raft,  
delicious as a shifty toucan.  
One overtone option and bitten howls and silent billowss of dull shades of cashmire smoke.  
You are the tomato of my fatherless curves.  
If  
I could chirp the imbroglio and the divisions.  
In your finger of embarassement the archipeligos of waves rise.  
The moth gallops on its mechanical mare  
showering deep brown flower heads over the modern office.
