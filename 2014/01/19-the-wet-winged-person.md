The Wet-winged Person
---------------------
To seek another land always you smear through the fortnight  
toward the holiday silencing writings.  
A thread focuses its dream of a beginning, its new beginning, the ending of the candle order -  
its gleaming lightnings.  
And a blood-stained starry sky's lava will connect you.  
The whirlwinds of grace is perfect on your arm.
