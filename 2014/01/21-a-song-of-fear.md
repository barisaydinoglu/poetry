A Song Of Fear
--------------
I salute  
your lovely bread  
and envy your charitable pride.  
Which is a decisive planetarium of directions  
thousand or twenty-seven, played  
on a sea's skin or in the smooth stars in the sky  
directions of the eye, a calculation in your mouths.  
Carry me onto your car - the lemon of my river -  
like the burned-out salt of saxophones of a gray  
fisherman that recovers lands.  
Pockets of steel converted into saphire.  
It pulses like a faucet in front of the drop.  
They executed it with hated saxophones.  
To the steady sensible laminated sign like the smothered salt of mirrors nobody here is waiting for the next eddy.  
Current. You recovered yourself for setting.
