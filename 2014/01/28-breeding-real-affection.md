Breeding Real Affection
-----------------------
Draw from it the acidulous  
sequence of its  
own signal.  
A rain of lands inside cinnamon water and sunburst orange burnt umber cars.  
When you divulge like ship galloped by the sky.  
Towards those friendships of yours that wait for me.  
Carry on the hearts that wait for you  
dismantling the forceful chairs, ignoring the doors.  
You see arm as arcane as the rain.  
Outside the blood colored fear of the conglomerate.  
Mourning weather, dead lights like the eddy.  
  
Yellow torrents of croak,  
transluscent transluscent sepia seams above a explosive bridge.  
There ought to be a banner of a profound current playing in a city.
