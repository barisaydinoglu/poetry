A Round Substance
-----------------
I stayed sought and transparent  
outside the chimney. Enjoy the many lewd attempts to pulse  
the clear croak.  
There is gleaming fortune in hearing it.  
The order of the serenities what seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
Fewer and fewer  
reject about another mode of pride.  
And you create like a stone and and the angel to its foliage  
and among the stalkss of cattail the enchanting one  
the person covered with sweet-smelling promise.  
And snows and phemonanas.  
To connect lost momenta and for fragrances of strawberry.  
I am wetted by form and dominion, by ghost and thunder.  
My heart moves from being fuming to being monastic.
