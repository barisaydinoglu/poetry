Some Forceful Play
------------------
Behind the arrogant chimney of chaotic flower.  
Yellow bloodied metals of clandenstine,  
transluscent cashmire seams above a lashed well.  
The sea's skin flows in storing your brow.  
We get the abstraction  
they must lots to appreciate  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but  
lampreys.  
Perhaps they are not shook.
