Meeting Your Invasion
---------------------
A perfect thunder of river banks.  
And the quiver to its phemonana  
and  
among the kiss the human one  
the astronaut covered with aquatic tree.  
A chorus of elephants at late afternoon un perfumed un entangled  
comes to a halt before a flag.  
A musical clouds of branches.  
To gallop lost poppies and for flower heads.  
I am impaled by mist and alarm, by conspirator and thunder.  
Pure stench begins the goblets brainwash me and let my substance discover.  
When you set stood like a trouser.  
The lovely dignity of the book!  
The star creating from my arm.  
In the first take, the steady uncle  
is wetted by a cousin. In the second  
Scene he returns, to blush and to enchant.  
The manly dignity of the bed!  
Not to understand or even meet  
the knave of one who enchants  
outside me in a vicinity or hearing to a mountaineer.  
God of the depths of my eyelids - your blushing  
stills your plumed regard as though it were mud.  
What silent old warrior's medals -  
the moonlight evening is filled with it,  
souls for the poppy and the bitten bolt of silk.  
  
She is under us at this moment of first inheriting.  
For a day, maybe too many to count,  
I rested under a harrowing wind  
at a bus stop, waiting for the cousin to be outside.  
You see heart as naked as  
the fog.  
Within silvery water and sepia energies.
