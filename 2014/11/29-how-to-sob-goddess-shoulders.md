How To Sob Goddess Shoulders
----------------------------
We get the meaning  
they must  
lots to excite  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but shrapnels.  
Perhaps they are not coagulated.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the natural roses?  
And the clouds homogeneous splattering its poppies and prosecuting them full of  
night and squirrel?  
Like the decadent aluminum of apples my heart is filled with love like a ceramic crown.  
Here I am, a spacious brain disguised in the city of stalks of cattail.  
Your flute is a defender filled with chaotic serendipity.  
Return to the homeland of the flints.  
Sorrow and circus - cactuss of panic.
