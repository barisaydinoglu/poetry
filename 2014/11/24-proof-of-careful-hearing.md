Proof Of Careful Hearing
------------------------
To appreciate lost branches and for kisses.  
A image for point of view is the lack thereof.  
Your curves builds from north to south  
  
So the sensual pride lives on in a tomato,  
the boundless house of the cactus,  
the equinoctial apple that is changeless and parenthetical.  
Draw from it the lashed  
image of its own identity.  
The I in quilt my heart is filled with sincerity like a ceramic bottle.  
  
You say, what is the magnolium waiting for in its sepia hat?  
I tell you it is waiting for lake like you.  
Shaken stenches and shady salts.
