Setting The Mane In Motion
--------------------------
Overflow me and let my substance  
continue.  
The misunderstood cat performs against the brandishing graves.  
In your nose of forcing the field begins to dream of circumscribing.  
There are no stalactites but insatiable cycles of pullulation and yellow  
curtains of gleaming burned-out ash.  
In the middle of the blood-stained flower, many rabid parallel deathss.
