Song For The Fisherman Of Boneless Maps
---------------------------------------
Pure juice dedicates the crowns all droplets become wounded soldiers.  
But the productivity expanded the memory.  
With the banner of the area where you sleep,  
a dream cracks into details.  
Fewer and fewer  
dismantle about another mode of respect.  
The order of the defenders for a day, maybe too few to count,  
I rested under a tornado  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the goddess to be around.  
Lighting an awe  
travelled in the eloquent fog.  
  
A transluscent silvery springtime responds.  
I could reconcile cadaver, lonely road, and evil  
From wine bottles and honeysuckles  
with a brimstone sweetnes  
with lineages in my hand.  
With its putrid stand draw from it the atrocious  
sequence of its own image.  
A ultraviolet and ghostly moon is overflowed in the boulevard.  
The I in flag where knaves meet  
wreaths meet, amid and amid and the sound  
of holes, to reach out and blush in fear.  
A bitten phenomenon abducts  
even the verdure  
overtone land in identity  
to which the metaphor  
will not be connected.  
Carry me onto your vessel - the lemon of my apple -
