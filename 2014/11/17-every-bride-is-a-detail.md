Every Bride Is A Detail

Indicates the sea water's circumscribing lip.  
Pure pamphlet awakens the writings the morning windows you in its mortal mud.  
Full stop.  
In your mouth of deforming the chimney begins to dream of blossoming.  
I'm the fisherman to the precision of immediate friendship.  
A warmth focuses its dream of a new beginning, its ending,  
the ending of the landscape order -  
its angellic brambles.  
I was without doubt the uncle toucan  
there in the callous moonlight evening.  
When it looked me with its parsimonious map eyes  
it had neither shoulder nor foot  
but glass doves on its sides.  
And the silence to its coat  
and among the knaves the human one  
the stranger covered with trusting honeysuckle.  
Nothing but your careful mouth.  
So the equinoctial sincerity lives on in a tomato,  
the velvety house of the evening star,  
the noble flower head that is monastic and original.  
I do not abolish in the archipeligos of insufferable saliva.
