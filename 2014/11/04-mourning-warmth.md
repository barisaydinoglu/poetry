Mourning Warmth
---------------
On what burned-out nights wove with wind? Multitude of starss in the sky!  
In and out of the marine the marine and the sepia  
here I am, a enchanting hand taunted in the vicinity of pencil.  
  
If you were not the lemon the mineral moon  
cooks, sprinkling its lemon across the night.  
There are no hounds but silent cycles of sun and transluscent marine  
wreaths of fluidic brutal aluminum.  
A prize -like beast  
a mist of angels halfway.  
The quiver knows this,  
that life in it's copper boxes is as endless as the wreath.
