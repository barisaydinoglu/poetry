Meaning Is An Episode Of Croak
------------------------------
Sifted mountaineers and fathers.  
For me they  
are alphabetic.  
Towards those muscles of yours that wait for me.  
In the face of so many  
panics to functionality.  
Carry me onto your helicopter - the grape of my foam -  
a triangle next to a quadrangle,  
the guilt workings of unguessed law.  
Shall we keep going?  
  
Conversations of grapes, the recitation  
of sea's skins we call myriad peace.  
I wish to make a line segment  
within, and every faith, many  
times hidden in a circus.
