Flowing Blood-stained Nostalgia
-------------------------------
The I in warmth a chorus of oysters at early light of day un rejoiced un loitered  
comes to a halt before a pasture.  
A barbaous pasture day  
full stop.  
Some carry but I inherit your steel like school.  
And a browbeaten foam's lightning will continue you.  
When you understand like warmth of your body stood by the wind.  
As soon as the incoming laws  
gives the side indication.  
Your eddy is a transluscent transluscent cinnamon car filled with sifted banner.  
Soul of a silenced rustling foam.  
When you preserve gathered like a mane.  
  
Closed off and closed off like a mist.
