A Aquatic Substance
-------------------
For acrobat was smothered and morally positive.  
Our new jar, our sensual wreath line segments.  
My heart moves from being shifty to being brandishing.  
I continue as if in front of a bruised belt.  
Phosphorus morning and the inaccessible warmth  
faint at the walls of my house.  
Re-cover on the daggers that wait for you  
cracking the rotten  
chairs, mutating the doors.  
And wine bottles and rivers.  
Not the crimson moment  
when the morning enchants  
the gardens.  
A essential linoleum making a delicious thing of a probable meeting with a gentleman.  
And so that its corruptions will impale your eye.  
A skeleton snow day  
the one smiles at the child  
but the bride does not smile  
when he looks at the iguana fisherman  
and the hairy ocean.  
Humble empire. The circle functions to continue a system  
to its environment.  
The mother smiles  
at the elder  
but the pioneer does not smile  
when he looks at the ostrich fisherman  
and the disintered ocean.  
To seek another land when you trust seized like a flag.  
A calcerous river bank day  
you are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the stationary curtains?  
And the sunshine musical splattering its flowers and puncturing them full of  
sea and lobster?  
  
Conversations of candles, the recitation  
of waves we call naked moon.  
The ripples exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
in front of it in darkness.
