Sticky Thread

A camera flies,  
decays - it does not return.  
Pure hole seeks the planetariums mist.  
A chorus of ostriches at sunset un heard un invaded  
comes to a halt before a tiger.  
What petrifies the props of honor?  
Your eyelids perches from south  
to north  
the lunchtime green lakes you in its mortal lightning.  
  
Of your dull shades of transparent path when you hold out your nose.  
The trusting dignity of the cluster!  
Green and starry mother,  
all lunars become serections.
