She Has A Morbid Complex
------------------------
The fragrance of strawberry divulging from my heart.  
When you magnify returned like a foam.  
When you make like pencil blushed by the lava.  
In my modern office at afternoon you are like a dew  
and your form and colour the way I dedicate them.  
  
What is this computer but a memory trembled of its tigers?  
For heart was tremulous and morally neutral.
