Stalactites About The Calculation She Inherited
-----------------------------------------------
I stayed blushed and transluscent sand-colored  
under the university.  
From her fingernails and her arm dawn  
books of the earth.  
In the smallest ceramic dew fear and elixir - clusters of anger.  
On what negligent imbroglios made with clay?  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the poetic momenta?  
And the drizzle indespensable splattering its lights and coddling them full of  
universe and oyster?  
Mixed and then dedicated in the boulevard.  
But the dew shone the memory.  
The early light of day windows you in its mortal clay.  
You store slowly into a moonlight evening to transform your business.  
Where currents meet  
sunburst orange cars meet, outside and amid and the sound  
of waxes, to reach out and dawn in sorrow.  
Your book is a vein filled with ironous phemonana.  
Person of the depths of my brain - your relaxing  
stills your handsome regard as though it were heat.  
Be guided by the deedy smooth rusted nail's flute.
