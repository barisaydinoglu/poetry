A Cedar Within Ivory
--------------------
One of them is manly,  
the other knows languages.  
Where is noone  
he cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
To seek another land the twisting lonely road imposes nessecity.  
Crimson electricity to my harsh lunar!  
In the communist river, many crooked evils.  
Neither precision nor kis nor gray  
nor sepia but yellow.  
Nothing but your cordial lip.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.
