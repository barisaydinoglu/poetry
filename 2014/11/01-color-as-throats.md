Color As Throats
----------------
The warmth of your body magnifies in circumscribing your finger.  
Among the cheerless dew, many calculating jackals.  
My heart is filled with love like a marble mane.  
We get the faith  
they must lots to dawn  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing  
but lances.  
Perhaps they are not throttled.  
A shifty bird feather day  
transluscent cinnamon noises of abys,  
blue seams above a careless foam.  
The vertical custodian  
dawns in the resolute morning.  
One of them is noble,  
the other knows projections.  
Where is everybody  
she exclaims, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Your breath builds from east to west a furious evening star day  
here I am, an ancient brain lunged in the area of faucet.  
The reasons for my respect  
are dedicated in my toe of ceramic.
