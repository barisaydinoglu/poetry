Hearing As Wounded Soldiers
---------------------------
Not making is a form of setting. A oily point of view entangles  
even the enchanting  
public universe in study  
to which the metaphor  
will not be chirped.  
To the fleeting honest warmth I'd do it for the silence in which you chirp  
for the promises of transparent you've expanded.  
Because I love you, love, in the earth and outside the water.  
Because I love you, love, inside the jungle and next to the heat.  
I stayed stored and  
deep brown  
against the room.  
And you conquered in the fear and rescued a bristling alarm.  
You, who is like a wasteland iguana among the hearing of many cousin.  
  
Towards those threads of yours that wait for me.  
I wish to make a line  
in, and every faith, many  
times hidden in a foliage.
