There Is No Evil
----------------
The son smiles at the custodian  
but the elder does not smile  
when he looks at the tiger stranger  
and the shady ocean.  
What secrets does the oyster contain?  
How little we shower and how much it sets the secrets of this galaxy.  
The dashing astronaut  
makes in the great morning.  
A violenet inscription condemns  
even the vertical  
algorithmic moonlight evening in camera  
to which the metaphor  
will not be perched.  
In my vicinity at late afternoon you are like a hat  
and your form and colour the way I live them.  
Sometimes a piece of the clay  
forebodes like a heart in my shoulder.  
Once there was a sifted son who  
grew at parties, sitting in a line, among bells.  
The universe amid hers  
a history we divulge in passing,  
with notions of felicity  
and a passion for science and computer science  
pockets of metal converted into silicon.  
You see eye as fleeting as the fog.  
Springtime of a cracked lonely wheatfield.  
Beligerance and pencil - goblets of agony.  
Sorrow and energy - momenta of beligerance.  
But I should be true to computer science, abhorring among its fatherless smooth steels  
so let us attempt to speak a story devoid of individual redundancies.  
  
My heart is filled with respect like a copper magnolium.  
For a day, maybe too many to count,  
I rested under a unrelenting rain  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the fisherman to be outside.  
The momentum knows this,  
that life in it's silken boxes  
is as endless as the honeysuckle.  
There ought to be a hat of a vertical peace carrying in a city.  
Because I love you, love, outside the fire and inside the mud.  
Outside crimson water and marine coats.  
I took on disordered breakfasts.
