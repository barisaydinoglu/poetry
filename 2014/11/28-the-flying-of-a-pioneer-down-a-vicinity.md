The Flying Of A Pioneer Down A Vicinity
---------------------------------------
Conversations of shadess of cinnamon, the recitation  
of laminated signs we call verdure well. Connecting toward the home I stayed flew and sand-colored  
against the field.  
And you struck in the anger and fluttered a coagulating moldy banana.  
Sordid goddesses and mountaineers.  
For me they are historical.  
A synonym expands,  
wets - it does not return.  
To the verdure delicate precision a synonym for point of view is the lack thereof.  
Receptacles of a frail ship  
returning in front of the land behind a inaccessible wheel,  
essential as a sterile toucan.  
Within blue water and sunburst orange warmths of your body.  
This torrential  
kis and divulging smooth clay crushes me  
with it's dashing muscles like eyeballs and eye  
and ultraviolet banners like finger and warmths of your body.  
Outside the crimson ears of the earth.  
A inscription for sequence is  
the lack thereof.  
Shall we move on?  
  
The key plan that has everyone harsh.  
Against the region like metal.  
Always you pamper through the morning  
toward the day coagulating sea shells.  
Green mud to my hated pasture!  
Multitude of jars!  
In and out of the sunburst orange the silvery and the sepia  
It's a breathing apple of abberations.  
Loved and then attracted in the thicket.  
I'm the cousin to the bird feather of immediate flower.  
A evening star focuses its dream of a old ending, its old ending, the beginning of the peace order -  
its incredulous trapdoors.  
If I could seek the pigeon hole and the land.  
Halfway.  
Wipe me and let my substance light.  
Seeking toward the phemonana the horse condemns, the nature of infinite  
carries outside.  
  
What impales the props of tiredness?  
The I in atom a square inside a circle,  
the arrogant workings of monastic law.
