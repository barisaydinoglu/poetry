There Is No Noise
-----------------
If you were not the apple the cleansed moon  
cooks, sprinkling its peach across the night.  
Draw from  
it the bitten  
Signal of its own production.  
Abandon me and let my substance grow.  
Realized human faucet the rabid toucan wakes inside the promising belts.  
So the noble love lives on in a tomato,  
the aquatic house of the mane,  
the sweet-smelling praise that is cosmic and lion hearted.  
Outside the tryst of the night where you sleep,  
a dream abolishes into images.  
  
The bruised pheasant understands among the arcane wombs.  
It's a seizing juice of depths.
