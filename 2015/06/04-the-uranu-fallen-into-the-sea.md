The Uranu Fallen Into The Sea
-----------------------------
A transparent book builds. It was the fortnight of the crab.  
A current of monastic maternity  
that does not know why it flows and blossoms.  
Nothing but that precision of energies.  
In the smallest silken old warrior's medal conversations of pullulations, the recitation  
of guitars we call plumed perfume.  
From her arm and her mouth form  
corals of the earth.  
  
It was the night of the iguana.  
Closed off and shut up like a bell.  
  
The violenet oyster gathers outside the manly twisting lonely roads.  
Decadent cousins and ladies.  
For me they are historical.
