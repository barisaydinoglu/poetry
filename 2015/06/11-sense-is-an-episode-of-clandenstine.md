Sense Is An Episode Of Clandenstine
-----------------------------------
When you make like smooth stone rescued by the mud.  
The homogeneous serenity gave it happiness.  
In my heights at morning you are like a springtime  
and your form and colour the way I promise them.  
Hushed elders and mountaineers.  
For me they are public.  
Breathing the path of her autumn full of respect.  
Multitude of silken architectures!  
In and out of the silvery the burnt umber and the burnt umber  
indicates the sea water's gathering mouth.  
Neither writing nor flint nor ultraviolet  
nor silvery but blue. An odor has developed outside the love,  
a mixture of ghost and body, a preserving  
lighthouse that brings confusion.  
They loitered it with fire-tipped kisses.
