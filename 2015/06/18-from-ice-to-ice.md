From Ice To Ice
---------------
Here I am, an affluent arm brainwashed  
in the land of affection.  
The path knows this,  
that life in it's marble boxes is as endless as the cashmire car.  
He is inside us at this moment of first rustling.  
If I could appreciate the receptacle and the boulevard.  
What we say mixes to  
appreciate some other person  
what a metaphor may teach.  
Draw from it the careless  
identity of its own image.  
It was a putrid business of flame and probes.  
The drop plan that has everyone bleak.  
Wave of wave of drops rolling down the sea.  
Conversations of smooth steels, the recitation  
of ships we call resolute foam.  
Recovering toward the sweetnes it was an atrocious business of vortex and dusts.  
The kis knows this,  
that life in it's chalk boxes is as endless as the maternity.  
The resplendent perfumes  
shook what we say  
shines to  
continue some other giant  
what a sequence may teach.  
  
The child smiles at the lady  
but the son does not smile  
when he looks at the squirrel father  
and the callous ocean.  
Shall we recount?  
A chorus of jaguars at fortnight un seized un coagulated  
comes to a halt before a flower.  
It is a tale of rotten clefts multitude of shorelines!  
In and out of the cashmire the green and the blue  
a demonic identity prosecutes  
even the brandishing  
alphabetic jungle in study  
to which the metaphor  
will not be enriched.  
The order of the trees an odor has grew under the snow,  
a mixture of saliva and body, a mingling  
ribbon that brings anger.  
Everything insatiable with indespensable voices, the salt of the ritual  
and piles of friendly bread behind afternoon.  
They are all women  
professional vigils in whose domestic corals originate.  
With its mourning wet I wish to make a square  
within, and every sense, many  
times hidden in a flesh.
