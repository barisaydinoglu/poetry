Spacious Theories Of Energies
-----------------------------
Reflecting from communist saphire.  
Your breath seizes from north to east  
pure explication expands the corals if you were not the peach the perfect moon  
cooks, sprinkling its cheesecake across the archipeligos.  
What is this study but a memory loitered  
of its autumns?  
They deluded it with cold fragrances of strawberry.  
And a frail fountain's sky will inherit you.  
Where farms meet  
echoes meet, among and outside and the sound  
of cities, to reach out and rustle in animosity.  
I wish to make a triangle  
in, and every faith, many  
times hidden in a propeller. In the face  
of so many walls to functionality.
