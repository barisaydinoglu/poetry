Your Breath Is Enough
---------------------
But I should be untrue to engineering, flying among its cheerless wine bottles  
so let us begin to divulge a story without historical redundancies.  
Opaque cashmire bombs of enemy,  
burnt umber seams above a smothered apple.  
To seek another land full stop.  
To the romantic parenthetical knave but the sea's skin showered the memory.
