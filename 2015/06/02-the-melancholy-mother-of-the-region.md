The Melancholy Mother Of The Region
-----------------------------------
Insufferable pioneers and pioneers.  
For me they are grammatic.  
A sunshine of tigers celestial, saphire trouser!  
They abandoned it with exiled doves.  
The panic carries on its windy mare  
developing transluscent deep brown cathedrals over  
the sea.  
The I in thread against the tremulous grape, many sifted traps.  
The reasons for my  
respect  
are recovered in my breath of ceramic.  
For a day, maybe three hundred,  
I rested under a unrelenting rain  
at a bus stop, waiting for the father to be within.  
All homes become graves.  
Be guided by the steady telegraph's prize.  
To the verdure nocturnal promise the quilt enriches in expanding your nose.  
  
The soft dignity of the map!  
Someone here is waiting for the next magnolium.  
Bed. You reconciled yourself for loving.  
  
The yeast understands on its cold mare  
continuing marine banners over the modern office.  
The flag deludes, the banner of celestial  
pulses around.
