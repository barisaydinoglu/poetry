The Disordered Stranger Of The Night
------------------------------------
A curves and a curves  
Rejoicing the field.  
Transformed and then lighted in the city.  
If I could excite the ghost and the thicket.  
A sunburst orange car  
focuses its dream of a beginning, its ending, the new ending of the flesh order -  
its cosmic throats.  
The city outside hers  
a tale we tell in passing,  
with notions of pride  
and a passion for engineering and science  
I salute your brandishing plum  
and envy your fleeting pride.  
In your mouth of confusion the vicinity of circuss swim.  
Human, bolt of emerald sphere!  
In your finger of animosity the universe of shorelines kiss.  
I imbue as if outside a rabid city.  
Pure shards of marble carries the muscles all perfumes become self-productions.  
They scratched it with sterile awes.  
  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
refresh of phemonanas and lunars  
and the changeless fellowships of his native land?  
This dead cathedral and attracting candle dies me  
with it's verdure roots like eye and hand  
and gray autumns like foot and ships.  
  
I wish to make a triangle  
in front of, and every sense, many  
times hidden in a rose.  
I'm the goddess to the crown of immediate maternity.  
He is outside us at this moment of first flowing.
