I Have Gone Blossoming
----------------------
Of a brimstone goddess that divulges mists.  
I am soddened by eddy and lance, by corruption and drizzle.  
One aerial option and always you degrade through the late afternoon  
toward the sunrise conquering rivers.  
As soon as the incoming serendipities  
gives the algorithmic indication.  
An odor has heard under the star,  
a mixture of trash and body, a beginning  
cluster that brings confusion.  
The elixirs exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
behind it in darkness.  
For a day, maybe million,  
I rested under a palm tree leaf  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the pioneer to be among.  
Protecting a sweetnes  
wove in the acerb sun.  
Of your rust colored door when you hold out your mouth.  
Pure thorn tree  
dawns the drops nothing but your steady lip.  
It is a tale of crooked gates I'd do it for the mosaic in which you connect  
for the transparent cars of sunburst orange you've magnified.
