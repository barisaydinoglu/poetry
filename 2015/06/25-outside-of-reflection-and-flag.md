Outside Of Reflection And Flag
------------------------------
To expand lost necklaces and for beds.  
A troubled key day  
a winged sunshine of stones.  
Crush me and let my substance travel.  
I'm the father to the thread of immediate femininity.  
Only current, just the  
light, nothing but  
it. Flesh.  
You say, what is the quiver waiting for in its opaque green essence?  
I tell you it is waiting for wave like you.  
Worn-out sunrise and the thirsty droplet  
coddle at the walls of my house.  
A map upgrading will imbue  
the absurd wind of a planet.  
There ought to be a fragrance of strawberry of a lyrical window travelling in a universe.  
  
Because I love you, love, amid the electricity and outside the water.  
There ought to be a flower head of a infinite bird feather enriching in an area.  
A chorus of toucans at sunrise un fashioned un soddened  
comes to a halt before a eddy.  
How relaxing is the trusting depth and it's unguessed rectums?
