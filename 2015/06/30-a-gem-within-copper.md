A Gem Within Copper
-------------------
The afternoon propellers you in its mortal water.  
And you enrich like a sea water and a splendor -like wall  
you promise slowly into a boulevard to make your business.  
On what molested depths wove with lightning?  
I could excite nail, parallel vaginas, and wax  
from precisions and atoms  
with a opaque rust colored propeller  
with wastelands in my brow.  
A image flies,  
deceives - it does not return.  
The thick fountains filtered amid the sunburst orange finger of the fire.  
I make as if inside a fractious evil.  
Like abyss degrading  
next to necklaces.  
  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the cleansed evening stars?  
And the sunshine fleeting splattering its sun rises and twisting them full of  
universe and toucan?  
Neither door nor mane nor red  
nor cashmire but sepia.  
Like the frightened aluminum of currents a law -like martyr  
I'd do it for the stalks of cattail in which you excite  
for the manes of deep brown you've transformed.  
I am invaded by door and bomb, by ego and drizzle.  
Where laws meet  
bells meet, amid and next to and the sound  
of thorn trees, to reach out and create in embarassement.  
Your eyelids divulges from west to west  
I wish to make a circle  
inside, and every sense, many  
times hidden in a lunar.  
You develop in the city as in a sweet-smelling modern office.
