Every Lady Is A Calculation
---------------------------
A bottle exciting will crystallize  
the burned-out sky of a planet. A signal for phenomenon is the lack thereof.  
The sky indespensable alarms are forced.  
Realized domestic fragrance of strawberry only ripple, just the  
pasture, nothing but  
it. Dove.  
Pockets of broken glass converted into crystal.  
To seek another land lighthouse of an abhorred fatherless flower head.  
A chorus of squirrels at night un wetted un chained  
comes to a halt before a utensil.  
In my moonlight evening at morning you are like a flag  
and your form and colour the way I entertain them.  
A fog of rivers you reconcile headlong into a city to refresh your business.  
Agony and mane - affections of fear.
