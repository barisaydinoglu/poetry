Difficult Lunar
---------------
An odor has fluttered under the serendipity,  
a mixture of consequence and body, a continuing  
sea shell that brings confusion.  
When you preserve created like a hat.  
If you were not the peach the delicious moon  
cooks, sprinkling its nectarine across the moonlight evening.  
And the quiver to its snow  
and among the salts the comfortable one  
the aunt covered with comfortable lighthouse.
