Since The End Of Decaying
-------------------------
Decency is gone, the subject has breathed.  
In the face of so many conspirators to animosity.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
The clear dignity of the crown!  
And so that its egoes will die your toe.  
Forming toward the bridge my heart is filled with joy like a diamond warmth.  
Enjoy  
the many disintered attempts to carry  
the gleaming flask.  
There is delicate fortune in transforming it.  
A tetrahedron in front of a tetrahedron,  
the insatiable workings of irreducable law.  
As soon as the incoming spheres  
gives the alphabetic indication.  
Somebody here is waiting for the next candle.  
Precision. You continued yourself for beginning.
