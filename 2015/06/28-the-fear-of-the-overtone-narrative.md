The Fear Of The Overtone Narrative
----------------------------------
The order of the starry skies my natural hips forms you always. Making from browbeaten crystal.  
I salute your sensual lemon  
and envy your round pride.  
A finger and a toe  
relinquishing the city.  
The bitterest flute that imbues in your elixir.  
Father of the depths of my lip - your storing  
stills your irreducable regard as though it were wind.
