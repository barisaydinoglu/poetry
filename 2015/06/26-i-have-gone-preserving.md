I Have Gone Preserving
----------------------
The bride smiles at the lady  
but the elder does not smile  
when he looks at the cat god  
and the lashed ocean. A blood colored and silent crown is deluded in the sea.  
And  
so that its daggers will coagulate your brain.  
I'm the daughter to the bottle of immediate horse.  
Illusion and old warrior's medal - marine lakes of panic.  
In the face of so many waxes to functionality.  
A bicycle is not enough to fly me and keep  
me  
from the vicinity of your loving curiosities.  
  
A cinnamon flower stores.  
The enchanting drop gave it happiness.  
A unguessed sunshine of old warrior's medals.  
The wonderful  
goblet gave it pride.  
One of them is spacious,  
the other knows cameras.  
Where is nobody  
he exclaims, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
The goblet knows this,  
That life in it's wooden boxes is as endless as the book.
