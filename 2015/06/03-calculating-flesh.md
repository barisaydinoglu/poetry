Calculating Flesh
-----------------
But I should be untrue to oceanography, rejecting among its motionless pencils  
so let us attempt to divulge a story without technical redundancies.  
Only breakfast, just the  
path, nothing but  
it. Curtain.  
Went refreshed in flower like calcerous tree, flags  
to connect lost starlights and for cathedrals. And the splendor to its laminated sign  
and among the lakes the somber one  
the uncle covered with absorbant opaque blue car.  
I wish to make a quadrangle  
inside, and every hearing, many  
times hidden in a wreath.  
You enrich in the modern office as in a comfortable jungle.  
The leaf punctures, the elixir of poetic  
connects in front of.
