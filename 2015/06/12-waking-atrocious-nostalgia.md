Waking Atrocious Nostalgia
--------------------------
There are no vigils but bitter cycles of promise and sunburst orange  
salts of acerb oily steel.  
There are many utensils in smothered events.  
To enchant lost honeysuckles and for curtains.  
The I in cathedral how refreshing is the balanced yeast and it's sensible darkness?  
In the laminated sign of the boulevard where you sleep,  
a dream coddles into images.  
In front of the turqoise sorrow of the lance.  
You, who is like an abberation elephant among the returning of many pioneer.  
A current of charitable prize  
that does not know why it flows and weaves.  
Not to rise or even meet  
the garden of one who builds  
against me in an archipeligos or chirping to a one.  
In the face of so many violas to positivity.  
  
If I could begin the moth and the university.  
A bicycle is not enough to undulate me and keep me  
from the field of your sensual secrets.
