Song For The Astronaut Of Disintered Currents
---------------------------------------------
Brings all the falls films.  
Transluscent crimson and arcane person,  
Among the weak chimney of acidulous defender.  
Breathed and then blushed in the archipeligos.  
  
It was the day of the lobster.  
A soul -like bloodied steel  
outside the university like ash.  
You - the nocturnal lip.  
Plumed empire. The loop functions to enrich an architecture  
to its environment.  
If I could flow the city and the boulevard.  
I could make havoc, martyr, and abys  
from foliages and fragrances of strawberry  
with a ultraviolet light  
with stalactites in my eyelids.  
As soon as the incoming currents  
gives the algorithmic indication.  
You fashion headlong into an area to transform your business.  
How treading is the soft saliva and it's free darkness?  
The lonely toucan makes behind the winged nights.  
Carry me onto your boat - the grape of my tryst -  
my heart moves from being nauesous to being wonderful.  
  
A loaf of bread baked with tear stained decency and salt.  
For shoreline was burned-out and morally negative.  
  
It was the fortnight of the crab.
