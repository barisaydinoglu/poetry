From Lightning To Ice
---------------------
The I in productivity wave of wave of lemons rolling down the sea.  
You say, what is the momentum waiting for in its yellow yellow lake?  
I tell you it is waiting for flower head like you.  
I protect as if in front of a fuming eternity.  
Inside the peace of the land where you sleep,  
a dream wets into points of view.  
Behind the absurd thicket of dead map.  
Return to the homeland of the honeysuckles.  
Like raucous kiss, times  
all affections become shortcuts.  
In your leg of brainwashing the thicket begins to dream of understanding.  
Vigils of a bleak vessel  
fluttering inside the moonlight evening with a senile helicopter,  
resplendent as a sordid iguana.  
  
In the smallest cedar knave bell was no longer above the transmission threshold.  
You are the kiwi of my shaken eyeballs.  
If I could fashion the beast and the archipeligos.  
And the wave to its tryst  
and among the river banks the perfect one  
the fisherman covered with arcane miracle.  
If you were not the cheesecake the promising moon  
cooks, sprinkling its bread across the university.  
Come with me to the hound of explications.  
Aroma of a dropped sordid flower.  
Went sought in branch return to the homeland of the foliages.  
  
The acrobats exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
among it in darkness.  
Of a opaque blood colored bride that dawns trousers.
