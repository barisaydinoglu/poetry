Breeding Vertical Affection
---------------------------
Not perfuming is a form of discovering.  
Your stalks of cattail is a eddy filled with explosive sea's skin.  
I took on sordid snows.  
This fractious diamond architecture and rejoicing sphere forebodes me  
with it's lovely coats like heart and shoulder  
and red jars like lip and quilts.  
Shall we keep going?  
But the autumn discovered the memory.  
  
We get the hearing  
they must lots to conduct  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but stalactites.  
Perhaps they are not shattered.  
The I in love smother me and let my substance upgrade.  
A echo beginning will seize  
the molested lava of a planet.  
It was a parched business of eternity and violences.  
  
Come with me to the puberty of ashes.
