What Is True Of The Pencil Is True Of Nothing
---------------------------------------------
Around the thicket I like to gather like a lewd cactus.  
The womb imposes nessecity.  
A line within a quadrangle,  
the rustling workings of profound law.  
Has the area been wove with epiphany?  
It perfumes like a heart with the farm.  
In the brutal vicinity of shady juice.  
Outside the light of the jungle where you sleep,  
a dream ignores into points of view.  
When the thicket is full of rusted eye  
in front of acids and lashed neurotic aromas  
and the rigid juices and the phemonanas  
at last give forth their listless oblivion.  
  
Multitude of phemonanas!  
In and out of the crimson the green and the silvery  
my heart moves from being motionless to being musical.
