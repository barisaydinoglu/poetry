There Is No Bramble
-------------------
What we say seeks to  
blush some other mother  
what a projection may teach.  
With its bitterest rise it was the midnight of the bird.  
If I could appreciate the belt and the archipeligos.  
A triangle in front of a triangle,  
the parched workings of wonderful law.  
  
It was the day of the jaguar.  
To the lyrical original  
branch when the field is full of rabid mouth  
with holes and inevitable windy banners  
and the browbeaten pencils and the promises  
at last give forth their mourning city.  
Draw from it the raucous  
machine of its own computer.  
Pure depth fashions the banners draw from it the furious  
technique of its own computer.  
Fluttering a wheatfield  
protected in the changeless thunder.  
There are no stenches but hated cycles of ribbon and opaque sand-colored  
muscles of lovely lethargic ash.  
Wave of wave of leaves rolling down the sea.  
Not the burnt umber moment  
when the midnight responds the farms.  
Only juice, just the  
cluster, nothing but  
it. Root.  
You blush my hollow complaint  
like an ancient lobster to fresh orange.  
  
Your current is a ritual filled with disordered thread.  
Return to the homeland of the stalkss  
of cattail.
