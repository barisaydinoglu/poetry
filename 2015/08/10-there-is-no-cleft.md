There Is No Cleft
-----------------
On what insufferable vortices entertained with heat?  
The fire irreducable lightnings are twisted.  
You've asked me what the iguana is waking there with his sand-colored brow?  
I reply, the ship knows this.  
Indicates the perfume's treading leg.  
Shall we go forward?  
Insufferable fishermen and elders.  
For me they are side.  
Only absurd and to a  
aunt they take on time, twenty-seven years  
I was without doubt the fisherman toucan  
there in the crooked area.  
When it looked me with its clear femininity eyes  
it had neither ears nor eyeballs  
but bolt of paper-mache prizes on its sides.
