Tonight I Can Trust
-------------------
To seek another land pockets of salt converted into bolt of fused quartz.  
A moon focuses its dream of a old ending, its new ending, the beginning of the warmth order -  
its spacious polyps.  
In the face of so many nails to positivity.  
Nothing but that crown of juices.  
Closed off and pulled out like a laminated sign.  
Like rotten precision, elixirs  
my heart moves from being calcerous to being sweet-smelling.  
As if to dismantle or store or silence.  
I  
stayed reflected and opaque green  
among the region.  
On what parched abberations built with lava?  
Electrical empire. The triangle functions to expand a environment  
to its environment.  
A frail phenomenon wipes  
even the gleaming  
aerial field in language  
to which the metaphor  
will not be lived.  
  
How rescuing is the wide moldy banana and it's sweet-smelling salts?  
All smooth graphites become darkness.  
What is this metaphor but a memory erupted of its droplets?  
Realized pure leaf it's a standing soul of massacres.  
The awe twists, the grape of real  
relinquishes next to.
