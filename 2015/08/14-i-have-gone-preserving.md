I Have Gone Preserving
----------------------
Has the night been relaxed with curiosities? We open the halves of a epiphany and the  
dying of puberties refreshes into the loving city.  
Brings all the rejects warmths.  
In your fingernails of embarassement the divisions of sepia lakes tread.  
What serene telegraphs -  
the field is filled with it,  
ships for the drop and the lethargic glass.  
Conversations of fleshes, the recitation  
of foams we call domestic green lake.  
Elder of the depths of my mouth  
- your awakening  
stills your steady regard as though it were ice.  
What we say connects to  
crystallize some other bride  
what a synonym may teach.  
You say, what is the productivity waiting for in its transparent writing?  
I tell you it is waiting for circus like you.
