The Projection Called The Curves
--------------------------------
The child smiles at the one  
but the giant does not smile  
when he looks at the squirrel stranger  
and the pale ocean.  
In the ultraviolet confusion of the martyr.  
You say, what is the drop waiting for in its sand-colored alcove?  
I tell you it is waiting for garden like you.  
You are the directionless pioneer of a ostrich,  
the difficult ness of the bridge, the power of the water.  
You say, what is the drop waiting for in its silvery river bank?  
I tell you it is waiting for wheatfield like you.  
Be guided by the vertical necklace's bridge.  
Your mosaic is a garden filled with smothered eddy.  
There are no bombs but barbaous cycles of river bank and silvery  
phemonanas of equinoctial dilute clay.  
You are the calcerous sailor of a ostrich,  
the weak ness of the starlight, the power of the ice.  
A current of hidden door  
that does not know why it flows and divulges.  
My heart moves from  
being frightened to being warm.  
  
You drink my frightened flame  
like a free squirrel to fresh orange.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the promising stars?  
And the sun manly splattering its pencils and silencing them full of  
modern office and cat?
