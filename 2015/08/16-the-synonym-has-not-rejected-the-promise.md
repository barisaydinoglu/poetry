The Synonym Has Not Rejected The Promise
----------------------------------------
Abduct me and let my substance crystallize.  
Conversations of ships, the recitation  
of movies we call solute sun rise.  
A loaf of bread baked with disintered pride and salt.  
A steady carpet making a sensual thing of a impossible meeting with a giant.  
Everything directionless with humble voices, the salt of the fragrance of strawberry  
and piles of slender bread in front of late afternoon.  
A technique blushes,  
abhors - it does not return.  
  
Pure clandenstine mingles the sweetness we open the halves of a mysteries and the  
crushing of lampreys  
returns into the gleaming region.  
Always you deceive through the afternoon  
toward the fortnight electrifying windows.
