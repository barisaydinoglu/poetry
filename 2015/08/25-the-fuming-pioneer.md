The Fuming Pioneer
------------------
You see foot as boundless as the wind.  
Understand on the violences that wait for you  
sobbing the calcerous chairs, flying the doors.  
Like difficult starlight, quilts  
sanguine empire. The line functions to perfume a environment  
to its system.  
And a torrential precision's mud will connect you.  
Behind the fainting parallel maskss.  
A current of parenthetical  
salt  
that does not know why it flows and gallops.  
  
In my sea at midnight you are like a warmth of your body  
and your form and colour the way I circumscribe them.  
I salute your incredulous apple  
and envy your promising pride.
