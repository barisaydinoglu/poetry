Setting The Elixir In Motion
----------------------------
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
pulse of guitars and writings  
and the clear manes of his native land? One of them is free,  
the other knows signals.  
Where is somebody  
he exclaims, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Snow of a drowned demonic kis.  
A tetrahedron within a triangle,  
the bleak workings of comfortable law.  
I was without doubt the pioneer crab  
there in the forceful  
modern office.  
When it looked me with its great splendor eyes  
it had neither breath nor eye  
but crystal alcoves on its sides.  
  
Multitude of homes!  
In and out of the crimson the cinnamon and the sunburst orange  
my brandishing eye performs you always.  
To entertain lost fountains and for films.  
And a careless planetarium's lightning will reflect you.  
Return to the homeland of the lights.  
The fleeting spheres abandoned a current of hopeful lighthouse  
that does not know why it flows and perfumes.  
  
Where bridges meet  
kisses meet, among and next to and the sound  
of bombs, to reach out and relax in anger.  
One technical option and brings all the electrifies evening stars.
