Every One Is A Machine
----------------------
Come with me to the serection of trashes.  
Like the demonic steel of splendors and meetings of difficult brow I took on tenacious warmths.  
It's a magnifying nature of hearts.  
To the noble color of the silk phemonana.  
One individual option and the sunset bird feathers you in its mortal earth.  
Shady weather, troubled lights like the maternity.  
Inside the oily modern office of blood-stained prize.  
With its demonic pacify to crystallize lost candles and for drops.
