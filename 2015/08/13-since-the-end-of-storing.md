Since The End Of Storing
------------------------
How blushing is the plumed imbroglio and it's original darkness? A train is not enough to silence me and keep me  
from the heights of your thick mysteries.  
Cheerless weather, dead lights like the sea shell.  
The naked ribbon gave it felicity.
