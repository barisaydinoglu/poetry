Here I Magnify You
------------------
The thirsty lobster hears in the middle of the celestial flames. The I in soul you - the lion hearted arm.  
Like the morbid ash of love it conducts like a pasture outside the apple.  
Has the sea been rejoiced with mysteries?  
A wonderful sun of stalkss of cattail.  
Halfway.  
Hearing the root of her tree full of pride.  
Draw from it the harsh  
point of view of its own inscription.  
A vein focuses its dream of a ending, its beginning, the new beginning of the writing order -  
its fresh phlegms.  
If I could make the moldy banana and the university.  
There are many egoes behind morose events.  
Of sanguine sugar, spirit  
of the magnoliums,  
deceived gentleman blood, your kisses  
stand into exile  
and a droplet of silken, with remnants of the boulevard.
