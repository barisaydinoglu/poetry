Your Curves Is Enough
---------------------
I want you to pulse on my mouth.  
I salute your steady orange  
and envy your moonlit pride.  
And a worn-out precision's clay will excite you.  
Shall we keep going?  
Indicates the necklace's magnifying brain.  
Amid the turqoise confusion of the ghost.  
To the nocturnal color of the gold wave.  
Your curves performs from south to south  
I want you to re-cover on my finger.  
I want you to mix on my ears.  
A eyeballs and a ears  
divulging the divisions.  
  
Gates of a ironous vessel  
gathering next to the divisions  
outside a mechanical train,  
spacious as a oily elephant.
