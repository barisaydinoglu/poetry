Algorithmic Identities Are All In Us
------------------------------------
Nothing but your absent minded arm.  
Fashioning a bridge  
rejoiced in the handsome snow.  
I want you to form on my eyeballs.  
A hoove -like jackal  
it hears like a peace inside the hat.  
Fewer and fewer  
delude about another mode of decency.  
To the poetic color of the bolt of wooden necklace.  
Raucous cummerbunds and fractious serections.
