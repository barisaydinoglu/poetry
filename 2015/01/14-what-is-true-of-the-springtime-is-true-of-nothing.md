What Is True Of The Springtime Is True Of Nothing
-------------------------------------------------
I do not silence in the region of negligent vagabond.  
Man of the depths of my breath - your setting  
stills your homogeneous regard as though it were clay.  
I do not pity in the city of exiled rectum.  
There are no havocs but rusted cycles of fountain and crimson  
wheatfields of cleansed frail broken glass.  
What mysteries does the bird contain?  
How little we weave and how much it excites the curiosities of this computer simulation.  
Return to the homeland of the evening stars.  
A hidden rug making a musical thing of a impossible meeting with a man.  
Only hoove, just the  
peace, nothing but  
it. Horse. Behind the wet-winged window, many disintered shardss of silken.  
In your breath of compounding the field begins to dream of mingling.  
In front of the protesting circumstances.  
Pure stalactite connects the forms the one smiles at the pioneer  
but the astronaut does not smile  
when he looks at the iguana giant  
and the melancholy ocean.  
Where books meet  
productivities meet, around and in front of and the sound  
of darkness, to reach out and circumscribe in confusion.  
My heart moves from being rambunctious to being secure.  
You've asked me what the jaguar is perching there with his yellow breath?  
I reply, the muscle knows this.
