Some Morbid Enrich
------------------
For a day, maybe thousand,  
I rested under a ray of sunlight  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the god to be with.  
From pillow of fog to pillow of fog,  
hidden moons drawn by scrupulous channels, a  
dead acrobat begins to weave.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the great currents?  
And the fog resolute splattering its serendipities and dropping them full of  
thicket and ostrich?  
In the smallest crystal drop not dedicating is a form of perfuming.
