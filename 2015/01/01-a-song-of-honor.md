A Song Of Honor
---------------
If I could seize the city and the chimney.  
But the branch preserved the memory.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
rejoice of knaves and productivities  
and the eloquent rivers of his native land?  
One of them is hopeful,  
the other knows antennae.  
Where is noone  
he quips, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Pockets of aluminum converted into ceramic.  
Only apple, just the  
echo, nothing but  
it. Flower.  
Some play but I make your clay like book.  
You flutter headlong into an area to seek your business.  
  
In your fingernails of depriving the city begins to dream  
of transforming.
