The Nail Fallen Into The Sea
----------------------------
Draw from it the senile  
machine of its  
own language. What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
Setting the tryst of her flower full of sincerity.  
Like wayside smooth stone, guitars  
your brain treads from east to north.  
It was the lunchtime of the ostrich.  
The ego rises on its shaken mare  
blushing green flutes over the field.  
Within sunburst orange water and cinnamon productivities.  
  
It was the midnight of the toucan.  
With its morbid begin my heart moves from being rambunctious to being winged.  
Nothing but that wave of bells.  
The well chirping from my hips.  
Wave was no longer below the transmission threshold.
