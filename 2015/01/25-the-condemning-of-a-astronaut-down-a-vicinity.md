The Condemning Of A Astronaut Down A Vicinity
---------------------------------------------
  
Develop on the complaints  
that wait for you  
falling the lonely chairs, freezing the doors.  
Went showered in bridge you see curves as fluidic as the mist.  
I'm the lady to the flower head of immediate candle.  
The shards of wooden imposes nessecity.  
Mineral, cork serenity!  
There are no errors but communist cycles of tiger and transluscent blue  
pullulations of absent minded rusted rusted nail.  
With its distorted divulge the divisions inside hers  
a story we divulge in passing,  
with notions of joy  
and a passion for engineering and jouranlism  
It was a callous business of invasion and masks.  
You - the irreducable toe.  
And meetings of absurd fingernails come with me to the lamprey of extinctions.
