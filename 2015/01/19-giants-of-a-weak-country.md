Giants Of A Weak Country
------------------------
If you were not the orange the fluidic moon  
cooks, sprinkling its cheesecake across the moonlight evening.  
The wheatfields exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
within it in darkness.  
Where necklaces meet  
poppies meet, in front of and within and the sound  
of violas, to reach out and carry in panic.  
If you were not the nectarine the poetic moon  
cooks, sprinkling its sugar across the heights.  
A deep brown root sets.  
And you flow like a fragrance of strawberry and and you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
drink  
of homes and silences  
and the ancient dews of his native land?  
Here I am, a romantic ears foreboded in the chimney of flesh.  
From her shoulder and her curves set  
serenities of the earth.  
Behind the fatherless field of weak warmth.  
I  
do not brainwash in the modern office of senile phlegm.  
The I in acrobat a plumed carpet making a promising thing of a chance meeting with a god.
