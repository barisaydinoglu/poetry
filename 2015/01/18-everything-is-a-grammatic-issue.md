Everything Is A Grammatic Issue
-------------------------------
What phenomena does the squirrel contain?  
How little we crystallize and how much it creates the curiosities of this computer simulation.  
Carry me onto your airplane - the banana of my coral -  
Within the garden of the chimney where you sleep,  
a dream rejects into signals.  
Decency is gone, the subject has responded.  
Among the room like ash.  
A somber  
rug making a homogeneous thing of a probable meeting with a mother.  
Outside deep brown water and sand-colored silences.  
Our new sphere, our affluent door loops.  
Full stop.  
When the university is full of listless lip  
inside extinctions and mourning bleak prizes  
and the boney promises and the fleshes  
at last give forth their harsh hole.  
The lunar knows this,  
that life in it's chalk boxes is as endless as the current.  
To create lost wine bottles and for books.  
And the bridge to its river bank  
and among the fellowships the stationary one  
the fisherman covered with moonlit crown.
