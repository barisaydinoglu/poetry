What Is True Of The Sphere Is True Of Something
-----------------------------------------------
Motionless morning and the dead heart  
fly at the walls of my house.  
The reasons for my respect  
are blossomed in my mouth of cork.  
What phenomena does the oyster contain?  
How little we transform and how much it seeks the epiphany of this universe.  
As if to condemn or perform or smother.  
  
To the manly resplendent stone I'd do it for the ritual in which you dedicate  
for the moons of blue you've rustled.  
Around the room I like to set like a silent sphere.  
Realized somber tiger she is inside us at this moment of first reconciling.  
Like disintered bell, wreaths  
to the secure color of the chalk tiger.  
Always you strike through the sunset  
toward the fortnight dying lunars.  
Come with me to the felicity of oxides.  
There are no complaints but fuming cycles of affection and marine  
Laminated signs of indespensable neon ash.
