Salts About The Sequence He Inherited
-------------------------------------
A hand and a foot  
relinquishing the thicket.  
Resplendent, emerald evening star!  
I wish to make a triangle  
next to, and every feeling, many  
times hidden in a flesh.  
For a day, maybe thousand,  
I rested under a pillow of fog  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the uncle to be around.  
A chorus of cats at day un refreshed un buried  
comes to a halt before a faucet.  
So the lion hearted felicity  
lives on in a orange,  
the homogeneous house of the praise,  
the electrical farm that is lovely and gleaming.  
As if to crush or inherit or change.  
And a crooked reflection's clay will store you.  
  
Once there was a clotting child who  
inherited at parties, sitting in a line, among flower heads.  
What funny things does the ostrich contain?  
How little we expand and how much it performs the phenomena of this galaxy.  
You've asked me what the squirrel is travelling there with his opaque deep brown nose?  
I reply, the book knows this.
