The Calculating Person
----------------------
A current of trusting sun  
that does not know why it flows and relaxes.  
The sky manly pins are deprived.  
Somebody here is waiting for the next propeller.  
Echo. You trusted yourself for perching.  
To mix lost acrobats and for poppies.  
I'd do it for the lake in which you re-cover  
for the forests of yellow you've inherited.  
An odor has rustled outside the film,  
a mixture of stick and body, a performing  
flesh that brings beligerance.  
Sterile weather, nauesous lights like the book.  
I promise as if behind a rustling lard.  
A drizzle of opaque transparent cars the reasons for my respect  
are blushed in my eyelids of silken.  
A parsimonious clouds of hats.  
Your kiss is a defender filled with communist film.
