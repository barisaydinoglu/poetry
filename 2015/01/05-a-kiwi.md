A Kiwi
------
They invaded it with fire-tipped forests.  
In the face of so many shadows to positivity.  
The disintered sweetnes is  
promising on your eye.  
I could live havoc, moth, and dominion  
from utensils and breakfasts  
with a red bottle  
with billows of dull shades of crimson smoke in my foot.  
A poppy -like dominion  
what electrifies the props of decency?  
The room in front of hers  
a history we divulge in passing,  
with notions of purity  
and a passion for computer science and computer science  
pioneer of the depths of my brain - your discovering  
stills your arcane regard as though it were jungle.
