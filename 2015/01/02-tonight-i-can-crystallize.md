Tonight I Can Crystallize
-------------------------
I stayed responded and yellow  
behind the land.  
Halfway.  
You are the apple of my sterile eyeballs.  
I was without doubt the stranger bird  
there in the disintered area.  
When it looked me with its boundless dew eyes  
it had neither eye nor brain  
but silken  
railroad tracks on its sides.  
  
I'm the stranger to the thread of immediate stars in the sky.  
On what bruised bloodied sand formed with jungle?  
Our new key, our pure sphere triangles.  
The utensil chirping from my finger.  
Shall we proceed?  
What secrets does the jaguar contain?  
How little we store and how much it shines the secrets of this universe.  
And you soddened in the fear and mingled a pitying  
trap.
