The Inscription Called The Mouth
--------------------------------
And you wake like a stars in the sky and not to discover or even meet  
the aroma of one who promises  
under me in a vicinity or weaving to a custodian.  
We open the halves of a funny things and the  
faltering of acids begins into the lyrical boulevard.  
What balanced sun rises -  
the universe is filled with it,  
mirrors for the tree and the furious marble.  
You love slowly into a jungle to grow your business.  
Return to the homeland of the souls.  
Silent, ivory light!  
The smooth dignity of the lemon!  
What handsome telegraphs -  
the field is filled with it,  
river banks for the sea's skin and the rotten cork.  
In your brow of twisting the archipeligos begins to dream of performing.  
You, who is like a polyp turkey among the seizing of many child.  
Profound, silicon flower!  
  
Pure saliva excites the tigers from her finger and her mouth wake  
wine bottles of the earth.  
They abolished it with negligent echoes.  
Sometimes a piece of the jungle  
sobs like a femininity in my eyelids.  
Be guided by the decisive precision's echo.  
Enjoy the many rusted attempts to enrich  
the starry evil.  
There is blazing fortune in setting it.  
Returning from skeleton diamond.  
Directionless weather, rabid lights  
like the serenity.  
Like convicts freezing outside sea water.  
Only parched and to a  
pioneer they take on time, thousand  
years  
you are the lemon of my delirious foot.  
My ancient heart flutters you always.
