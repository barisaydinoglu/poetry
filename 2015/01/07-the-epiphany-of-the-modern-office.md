The Epiphany Of The Modern Office
---------------------------------
The noble bride  
trusts in the pure morning.  
A silent well day  
utensils of a morose airplane  
protecting in front of the universe among a dilute wheel,  
resolute as a spoiled oyster.  
The chaotic dove that hears in your ripple.  
I saw how eddies are carried  
by the sweet-smelling curtain.  
A chorus  
of crabs at midnight un wove un abhorred  
comes to a halt before a flower. A wheel is not enough to erupt me and keep me  
from the heights of your fresh epiphany.  
And meetings of clenched brow to the decisive color of the crystal light.  
A marine dove travels.  
In your hips of anger the chimney of trees divulge.  
A current of mineral wheatfield  
that does not know why it flows and grows.  
Protecting the poppy of her bird feather full of sincerity.  
  
And a dead fellowship's lightning will develop you.  
A fingernails and  
a leg  
standing the jungle.
