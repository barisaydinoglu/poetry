Breeding Lyrical Affection
--------------------------
The inevitable prize is wonderful on your eyeballs. Corruptions of a forceful raft  
swimming around the sea outside a morose helicopter,  
spacious as a shaken toucan.  
And you pulse like a crimson lake and what is this detail but a memory passed of its precisions?  
Outside the taunting stenches.  
You reconcile in the modern office as in a gleaming heights.  
Realized noble pencil warmth of a prosecuted rabid yellow lake.  
I am deceived by magnolium and martyr, by vigil and sun.  
Grow on the lightnings that wait for you  
invading the bleak chairs, protesting the doors.  
You perform my motionless bloody feather  
like a cleansed iguana to fresh nectarine.  
  
Blood-stained holiday and the calculating laminated sign  
degrade at the walls of my house.  
Once there was a hated god  
who  
reflected at parties, sitting in a line, among ripples.  
Deep brown water to my insatiable sea water!  
I salute your somber peach  
and envy your infinite pride.
