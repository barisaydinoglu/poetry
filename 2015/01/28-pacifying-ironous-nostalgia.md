Pacifying Ironous Nostalgia
---------------------------
With its clenched reflect our new perfume, our delicate kiss triangles.  
In your brow of replacing the archipeligos begins to dream of rescuing.  
Where cathedrals meet  
apples meet, with and next to and the sound  
of errors, to reach out and gather in panic.  
What soft telegraphs -  
the moonlight evening is filled with it,  
bridges for the sea's skin  
and the tenacious chalk.
