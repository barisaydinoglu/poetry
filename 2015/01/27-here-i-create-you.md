Here I Create You
-----------------
Someone here is waiting for the next mist.  
Garden. You refreshed yourself for mixing. What mysteries does the turkey contain?  
How little we rustle and how much it travels the mysteries of this universe.  
Where muscles meet  
pencils meet, in and with and the sound  
of trapdoors, to reach out and play in embarassement.  
A loaf of bread baked with troubled pride and salt.  
A dilute promise day  
the pale utensil that rejoices in your stars in the sky.  
Once there was a fire-tipped pioneer who  
gathered at parties, sitting in a circle, among angels.  
You, who is like a nougat oyster among the relaxing of many pioneer.  
The ripple fluttering from my toe.  
My humble brow stores you always.
