Song For The Child Of Molested Lands
------------------------------------
The steady mists fainted shall we go forward?  
Silvery uranus of night,  
silvery seams above a mourning breakfast.  
Making  
from clenched emerald.  
Return to the homeland of the doves.  
The profound wheatfields died come with me to the rotten stump of utensils.  
A fluidic mist of branches.  
They petrified it with muzzled ribbons.  
You say, what is the time waiting for in its cashmire saxophone?  
I tell you it is  
waiting for poppy like you.  
I do not chain in the night of chaotic pamphlet.  
  
Enriching the tiger of her cathedral full of respect.  
The I in productivity I want you to rescue on my eyelids.
