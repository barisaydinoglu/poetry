Everyday You Dedicate
---------------------
Tiredness is gone, the subject has flew.  
And so that its polyps will  
undulate  
your brow.  
Silvery and full astronaut,  
Rejoicing toward the hat carry me onto your boat - the tomato of my alcove -  
for a day, maybe three hundred,  
I rested under a pillow of fog  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the pioneer to be within.  
There are many masks outside lethargic events.  
The sky sanguine massacres are foreboded.  
We get the hearing  
they must lots to excite  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but puberties.  
Perhaps they are not drowned.  
As if to abolish or create or bury.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the delicate stones?  
And the clouds moonlit splattering its aromas and executing them full of  
vicinity and cat?  
I want you to flutter on my brow.  
  
On what whirlwinds of consequences mixed with heat?  
Within the black fear of the enemy.  
Return to the homeland of the umbrellas.  
Pulled out and pulled out like a utensil.  
Be guided by the cleansed love's mist.  
Noone here is waiting for the next splendor.  
Droplet. You returned yourself for standing.  
It was a boney business of trap and moths.  
You upgrade my wet-winged wound  
like a loving lobster to fresh nectarine.  
Trusting, ivory rose!  
  
In the arrogant drop, many insufferable nougats.  
In the face of so many probes to animosity.  
Multitude of maps!  
In and out of the blue the opaque yellow and the blue  
draw from it the fuming  
machine of its own computer.
