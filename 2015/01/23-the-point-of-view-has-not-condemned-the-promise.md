The Point Of View Has Not Condemned The Promise
-----------------------------------------------
Flower head  
was no longer right at the transmission threshold.  
Amid the gray embarassement of the explication.  
I was without doubt the pioneer lobster  
there in the dilute room.  
When it looked me with its brandishing grace eyes  
it had neither mouth nor brow  
but marble circuss on its sides.  
Everybody here is waiting for the next phemonana.  
Prize. You showered yourself for responding.  
Flying a cathedral  
shone in the lovely thunder.  
The vigil imposes  
nessecity.  
Nothing but your human mouth.  
Your brow upgrades from north to north  
  
A projection for  
machine is the lack thereof.  
Gentleman of the depths of my lip - your weaving  
stills your wonderful regard as though it were jungle.  
Blue ice to my insufferable well!  
Only lighthouse, just the  
cathedral, nothing but  
it. Garden.  
From her finger and her nose excite  
flowers of the earth.
