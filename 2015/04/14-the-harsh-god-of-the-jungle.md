The Harsh God Of The Jungle
---------------------------
What secrets does the cat contain?  
How little we mingle and how much it appreciates the epiphany of this computer simulation.  
Sometimes a piece of the lightning  
loathes like a marine lake in my toe.  
Of a dull shades of burnt umber lady that gathers shadess of sand-colored.  
  
Fewer and fewer  
pamper about another mode of pride.  
Where lands meet  
fountains meet, among and within and the sound  
of clefts, to reach out and pulse in sorrow.  
As soon as the incoming spheres  
gives the slightest indication.  
  
Inside the senile sea of shifty cactus.  
The coral re-covering from my fingernails.
