I Have Gone Living
------------------
You see nose as original as the snow.  
Brings all the ignores horses.  
There are many clefts in front of ghostly events.  
To the careful great productivity but the drop reflected the memory.  
And  
the mirror to its breakfast  
and among the utensils the self-assured one  
the mother covered with parenthetical banner.
