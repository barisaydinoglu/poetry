Slightest Inscriptions Are All Amid Us
--------------------------------------
A transluscent silvery autumn excites.  
Multitude of mists!  
In and out of the green the opaque silvery and the sepia  
not making is a form of relaxing.  
You - the fresh brow.  
Only bridge, just the  
fragrance of strawberry, nothing but  
it. Miracle.  
Mixing a writing  
gathered in the absent minded sunshine.  
Wave of wave of threads rolling down the sea.  
The reasons for my respect  
are loved in my hips of silken.  
Not the sepia moment  
when the afternoon recovers the goblets.  
  
In my area at late afternoon you are like a trouser  
and your form and colour the way I gather them.  
Banal weather, clotting lights like the thread.  
School of a died clotting dove.  
When the chimney is full of dead heart  
among conglomerates and dilute bitten bird feathers  
and the lewd smooth metals and the circuss  
at last give forth their morose darknes.  
I'd do it for the river in which you rise  
for the kiss of sepia you've fluttered.  
It was a weak business of salt and sticks.  
  
The smooth clay gallops in reflecting your heart.  
There ought to be a faucet of an absent minded branch returning in a jungle.
