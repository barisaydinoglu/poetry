Callous Mist
------------
Sepia sky to my hollow sweetnes!  
Everybody here is waiting for the next echo.  
Cactus. You built yourself for circumscribing.  
In your heart of sorrow the archipeligos of dews dedicate.  
The boney  
turkey imbues under the loving lightnings.  
A branch focuses its dream of a new beginning, its old ending, the new ending of the mist order -  
its noble trashes.  
Once there was a browbeaten gentleman who  
created at parties, sitting in a triangle, among laminated signs.  
The uncle smiles at the son  
but the goddess does not smile  
when he looks at the ostrich goddess  
and the chaotic ocean.
