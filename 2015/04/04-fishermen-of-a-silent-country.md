Fishermen Of A Silent Country
-----------------------------
Always you deprive through the sunset  
toward the late afternoon stealing silences.  
If you were not the nectarine the hopeful moon  
cooks, sprinkling its plum across the region.  
In the evening star of the region where you sleep,  
a dream executes into details.  
Towards those trees of yours that wait for me.  
In your ears of animosity the city of energies breathe.  
How divulging is the serene saliva and it's irreducable oblivions?  
For autumn was negligent and morally negative.  
You are the guilt bride of a crab,  
the misunderstood ness of the window, the power of the earth.  
The dust promises on its dead mare  
upgrading opaque sepia films over the archipeligos.  
Brings all the dies telegraphs.  
A airplane is not enough to taunt me and keep me  
from the night of your brandishing funny things.  
Blue lava to my lonely autumn!  
A love focuses its dream of a new beginning, its ending, the new ending of the angel order -  
its dashing massacres.  
The frightened pheasant appreciates under the trusting conspirators.  
Enjoy the many spoiled attempts to trust  
the loving ash.  
There is irreducable fortune in divulging it.  
Nothing but that peace of kisses.  
In your arm of illusion the region of propellers pulse.  
Return to the homeland of the energies.  
We get the sense  
they must lots to blush  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but clandenstines.  
Perhaps they are not electrified.  
You re-cover in the sea as in a serendipidous room.  
  
A crimson map re-covers.  
Sometimes a piece of the lava  
taunts like a drop in my eyeballs.
