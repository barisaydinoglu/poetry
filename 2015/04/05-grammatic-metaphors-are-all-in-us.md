Grammatic Metaphors Are All In Us
---------------------------------
What curiosities does the oyster contain?  
How little we pacify and how much it entertains the epiphany of this universe.  
A study for sequence is the lack thereof.  
Only dry and to a  
stranger they take on time, three hundred years  
inside cashmire water and burnt umber planetariums.  
My sweet-smelling lip gallops you always.  
Always you deform through the late afternoon  
toward the sunrise sobbing pencils.  
  
A key rescuing will shine  
the boney ice of a planet.
