Here I Continue You
-------------------
I create  
as if behind a neon violence.  
I'd do it for the echo in which you perform  
for the tigers of burnt umber you've excited.  
My heart is filled with sincerity like a wooden wheatfield. There are no clandenstines but imperalist cycles of map and opaque silvery  
necklaces of romantic senile metal.  
Rigid weather, neon lights like the pencil.  
Pockets of metal converted into cork.  
Dry midnight and the phosphorus banner  
invade at the walls of my house.  
In the face of so many waxes to functionality.  
A cashmire miracle lives.  
  
Conversations of flowers, the recitation  
of beds we call balanced home.  
The fuming home that performs in your quilt.
