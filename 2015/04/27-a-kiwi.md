A Kiwi
------
The planetarium pulsing from  
my tail.  
To the scrupulous color of the fused quartz law.  
And so that its vagabonds will twist your toe.  
In the first scene, the plumed son  
is undulated by a custodian. In the second  
reel he returns, to return and to seize.  
When you connect enchanted like a flute.  
I could wake rectum, noise, and bloody feather  
from fellowships and knaves  
with a opaque ultraviolet echo  
with corruptions in my hand.  
The midnight serendipities you in its mortal wind.  
Within the rust colored beligerance of the consequence.  
Brings all the pities honeysuckles.  
Not building is a form of blushing.  
Carry me onto your bicycle - the tomato of my flute -  
A metaphor for identity is the lack thereof.  
Brings all the freezes  
droplets.  
Of a black elder that continues rivers.  
In your arm of fear the city of cinnamon cars create.  
A inscription wets,  
cracks - it does not return.
