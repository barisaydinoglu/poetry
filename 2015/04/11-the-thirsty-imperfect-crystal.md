The Thirsty Imperfect Crystal
-----------------------------
A brain and a shoulder  
wetting the universe.  
The equinoctial sailor  
carries in the full morning.  
I salute your serendipidous grape  
and envy your manly pride.  
And meetings of mourning ears dead afternoon and the fragmented smooth sand  
die at the walls of my house.  
How pulsing is the full bloodied broken glass and it's electric croaks?  
And so that its howls will mutate your eye.  
Where ribbons meet  
foams meet, around and within and the sound  
of blades, to reach out and pacify in illusion.  
A signal excites,  
harasses - it does not return.  
There  
are no hearts but windy cycles of autumn and yellow  
river banks of myriad insufferable iron.  
In the smallest gem stone change me and  
let my substance discover.  
Grace was no longer above the transmission threshold.  
There ought to be a kis of a monastic garden attracting in a divisions.  
The chimney in front of hers  
a history we divulge in passing,  
with notions of love  
and a passion for computer science and engineering
