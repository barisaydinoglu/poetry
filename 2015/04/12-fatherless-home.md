Fatherless Home
---------------
He is among us at this moment of first perfuming.  
A current of self-assured femininity  
that does not know why it flows and wakes.  
To the great color of the emerald shoreline.  
A detail for signal is the lack thereof.  
And the dove to its momentum  
and among the utensils the fleeting one  
the one covered with winged river.  
There are no conspirators but difficult cycles of alcove and cashmire  
bird feathers of round listless graphite.  
For a day, maybe twenty-seven,  
I rested under a unrelenting rain  
at a bus stop, waiting for the giant to be in.  
The scrupulous dignity of the wine bottle!  
I am gnawn by perfume and rotten stump, by imbroglio and mist.  
  
A sphere magnifying will make  
the melancholy jungle of a planet.  
The comfortable dignity of the muscle!
