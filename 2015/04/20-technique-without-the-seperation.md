Technique Without The Seperation
--------------------------------
My heart is filled with  
respect like a cork rose.  
It develops like an alcove with the writing.  
The order of the wheatfields what is this production  
but a memory deluded of its  
muscles?  
Conversations of drops, the recitation  
of kiss we call naked perfume.  
In the first take, the infinite man  
is entangled by a giant. In the second  
scene he returns, to upgrade and to live.  
And you loitered in the illusion and created a passing twisting lonely road.  
Outside the sea like clay.  
I'm the child to the wheatfield of immediate momentum.
