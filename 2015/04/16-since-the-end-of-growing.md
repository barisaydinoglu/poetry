Since The End Of Growing
------------------------
The eager dignity of the mirror!  
Around the universe I like to swim like a burned-out school.  
Living a mirror  
pulsed in the balanced wind.  
My serene finger blossoms you always.  
If you were not the orange the celestial moon  
cooks, sprinkling its orange across the universe.  
Kissing toward the forest like imperfect cedars twisting in silvery cars.  
  
When you pulse like faucet created by the fire.
