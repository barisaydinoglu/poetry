Public Antennae Are All In Front Of Us
--------------------------------------
Nothing but your verdure curves.  
A mist of precisions sometimes a piece of the wind  
passes like a juice in my mouth.  
And flags and shadess of transluscent transparent.  
On what listless abberations lived with lightning?  
What soft kiss -  
the heights is filled with it,  
awes for the cactus  
and the lashed gem.  
So the myriad joy lives on in a orange,  
the mineral house of the fountain,  
the equinoctial coral that is trusting and slender.  
Transformed and then developed in the region.
