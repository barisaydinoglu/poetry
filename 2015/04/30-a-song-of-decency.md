A Song Of Decency
-----------------
Oily jugulars and inevitable vagabonds.  
I salute your natural bread  
and envy your eloquent pride.  
A aroma focuses its dream of a new ending, its beginning, the new ending of the wheatfield order -  
its irreducable roosters.  
The elder smiles at the man  
but the man does not smile  
when he looks at the oyster mother  
and the molested ocean.  
Your law is a bridge filled with windy fragrance of strawberry.  
And outside my hammock, during the late afternoon, I woke up naked  
and full of happiness.  
The flint circumscribes in circumscribing your hips.
