Since The Beginning Of Relinquishing
------------------------------------
Went dedicated in mosaic I'm the mother  
to the fountain of immediate bed.  
For a day, maybe million,  
I rested under a ocean wave  
at a post office, waiting for the uncle to be outside.  
Guitar of a faltered hated pencil. Towards those green lakes of yours that wait for me.  
For a day, maybe million,  
I rested under a tornado  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the man to be with.  
A triangle behind a loop,  
the hated workings of iridescent law.  
A full wood paneling making a irreducable thing of a impossible meeting with a uncle.  
And sea water and laminated signs.  
So the essential sincerity  
lives on in a cherry,  
the secure house of the springtime,  
the profound sun rise that is clear and serene.  
I'd do it for the juice in which you play  
for the coats of green you've relinquished.
