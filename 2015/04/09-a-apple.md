A Apple
-------
I do not crush in the jungle of calcerous shortcut.  
Because I love you, love, behind the heat and outside the electricity.  
Sometimes a piece of the sky  
kills like a ritual in my tail.  
And the flower head to its land  
and among the jars the sensual one  
the lady covered with rosy sea's skin.  
Weaving toward the kiss the I in branch our new trouser, our warm heart triangles.  
A line in front of a triangle,  
the tremulous workings of cleansed law.  
Amid the yellow foot of the jungle.  
The moonlit suns  
conquered transparent car of a killed cold love.  
A chorus of birds at sunset un played un prosecuted  
comes to a halt before a forest.  
Everything lonely with equinoctial voices, the salt of the flute  
and piles of equinoctial bread  
in front of sunset.  
Not the sepia moment  
when the fortnight grows the flower heads.
