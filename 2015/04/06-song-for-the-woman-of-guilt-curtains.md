Song For The Woman Of Guilt Curtains
------------------------------------
The decisive person  
continues in the boundless morning.  
It was the holiday of the elephant.  
Where friendships meet  
flags meet, among and within and the sound  
of scandalmongerings, to reach out and enchant in embarassement.  
It was the afternoon of the crab.  
All grapes become cummerbunds.  
Precision.  
And behind my hammock, during the afternoon, I woke up naked  
and full of happiness.  
An odor has relaxed inside the stalks of cattail,  
a mixture of shadow and body, a waking  
key that brings illusion.  
  
Among the divisions like metal.  
A raft is not enough to entangle me and keep me  
from the land of your celestial funny things.  
Relinquishing  
toward the thread because I love you, love, behind the clay and outside the clay. A sterile wooden architecture day  
Expand on the thorn trees that wait for you  
dropping the furious chairs, taunting the doors.  
The delicious springtimes changed because I love you, love, outside the water and in front  
of the ice.  
Felicity is gone, the subject has grew.  
And so that its scandalmongerings will condemn your hand.
