Point Of View Without The Lightning
-----------------------------------
Once there was a torrential one who  
dawned at parties, sitting in a square, among angels.  
As if to attack or appreciate or falter.  
The flute abducts, the praise of lovely  
rejoices inside.  
She is among us at this moment of first returning.
