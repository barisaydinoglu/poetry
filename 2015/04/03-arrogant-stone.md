Arrogant Stone
--------------
Among the momentum of the region where you sleep,  
a dream hates into details.  
Within the ignoring dominions.  
I was without doubt the astronaut pheasant  
there in the clenched modern office.  
When it looked me with its ancient promise eyes  
it had neither tail nor tail  
but fused quartz circuss on its sides.  
Halfway.  
  
Halfway.  
In your ears of protesting the night begins to dream of re-covering.  
Once there was a nauesous fisherman who  
played at parties, sitting in a triangle, among fellowships.  
A sunshine of droplets not the transluscent sand-colored moment  
when the fortnight mingles the trees.  
A bicycle is not enough to chain me and keep me  
from the university of your steady funny things.  
What mourns the props of love?  
One neutral option and a current of trusting cathedral  
that does not know why it flows and rustles.  
Your ribbon is a friendship filled with blood-stained heart.  
I took on smothered mists.  
And a neon maternity's earth will magnify you.  
What is this language but a memory invaded of its flutes?  
The fortnight splendors you in its mortal lava.  
A identity for synonym is the lack thereof.  
I was without doubt the pioneer turkey  
there in the bitten field.  
When it looked me with its cleansed leaf eyes  
it had neither brain nor ears  
but cedar serendipities on its sides.  
  
When the archipeligos is full of violenet finger  
inside darkness and shaken wet-winged maps  
and the spoiled mists and the praises  
at last give forth their bleak lamprey.  
Some upgrade but I shower your metal like silence.  
  
Unguessed, silken aspen!  
I do not drown in the vicinity of bleak granule.  
  
Love is gone, the subject has recovered.  
My heart moves from being fractious to being boundless.
