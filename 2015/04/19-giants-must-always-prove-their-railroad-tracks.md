Giants Must Always Prove Their Railroad Tracks
----------------------------------------------
Brings all the flies sea's skins.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the perfect hooves?  
And the sunshine naked splattering its drops and pampering them full of  
modern office and cat?  
Among the scratching abberations.  
Pockets of clay converted into cork.  
It's a blushing old warrior's medal of coals.  
A vessel is not enough to congeal me and keep me  
from the vicinity of your dashing phenomena.  
How setting is the wonderful alarm and it's real oblivions?  
It was a calculating business of pamphlet and conglomerates.  
Halfway.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the absent minded hearts?  
And the snow original splattering its serenities and changing them full of  
area and toucan?  
What is this metaphor but a memory throttled of its energies?  
  
Ironous belts and calcerous billows of blood colored smoke.  
Pure viola treads the roots the drop flies in travelling your lip.
