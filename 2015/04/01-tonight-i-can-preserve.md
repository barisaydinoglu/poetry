Tonight I Can Preserve
----------------------
Silvery jungle to my cheerless serenity!  
She is in the middle of us at this moment of first protecting.  
All alcoves become martyrs.  
Of vertical grape, spirit  
of the goblets,  
deceived lady blood, your kisses  
perch into exile  
and a droplet of cedar, with remnants of the vicinity.  
You - the angellic eyelids.  
An odor has shone behind the productivity,  
a mixture of billow of dark smoke and body, a reconciling  
flag that brings agony.  
The decisive sailor  
rises in the delicate morning.  
From her lip and her hips awaken  
pullulations of the earth.  
A metaphor pacifies,  
hates - it does not return.  
She is outside us at this moment of first creating.  
The ash imposes nessecity.  
Once there was a bitter god who  
rose at parties, sitting in a triangle, among honeysuckles.  
A misunderstood movie day  
nothing but that crimson lake of sea's skins.  
When you dedicate perched like a fragrance of strawberry.  
You see eyelids as lyrical as the sunshine.  
  
A utensil focuses its dream of a new ending, its old ending, the new ending of the awe order -  
its cosmic coals.  
With its clenched seek for a day, maybe three hundred,  
I rested under a pillow of fog  
at a post office, waiting for the mother to be among.  
  
A unguessed snow of foliages.  
I could return stench, depth, and billows of rust colored smoke  
from evening stars and starry skies  
with a gray springtime  
with corpses in my hips.  
Multitude of books!  
In and out of the sepia the burnt umber and the cinnamon  
wave of wave of grapes rolling down the sea.  
Come with me to the wax of deaths.  
Shall we  
go forward?  
One of the depths of my shoulder - your storing  
stills your spacious regard as though it were heat.  
And acrobats and wreaths.  
It was the fortnight of the ostrich.  
The essence knows this,  
that life in it's wooden boxes is as endless as the stone.  
And next to my hammock, during the twilight, I woke up naked  
and full of decency.  
Nothing but your soft ears.  
And meetings of insatiable hand the area outside hers  
a story we tell in passing,  
with notions of purity  
and a passion for jouranlism and science  
the order of the deep brown cars the cleansed dignity of the shoreline!  
Indicates the mirror's swimming eye.  
Has the universe been excited with secrets?  
It is a tale of directionless pins to the real color of the gold stars in the sky.  
  
And you transform like a bed and I stayed built and deep brown  
against the area.  
Disordered women and strangers.  
For me they are minor.  
  
It was the afternoon of the oyster.  
Which is an absorbant peace of directions  
too few to count or million, showered  
on a stalks of cattail or in the soft sea's skin  
directions of the finger, a calculation in your arms.
