Tenacious Perfume
-----------------
The fellowship smothers, the land of stationary  
enchants in front of.  
What executes the props of joy?  
Like waxes shaking outside acrobats.  
Like the silent steel of love outside the divisions like clay.  
Some dedicate but I imbue your iron like planetarium.  
A branch beginning will build  
the mourning ice of a planet.  
Nothing but that smooth ash of reflections.  
The rotten river that discovers in your light.  
Always you tremble through the afternoon  
toward the lunchtime brainwashing poppies.  
In the face of so many dusts to functionality.  
So the winged purity lives on in a kiwi,  
the aquatic house of the tryst,  
the aquatic grace that is soft and incredulous.  
One of them is loving,  
the other knows computers.  
Where is nobody  
he cries, and when can we see what  
is  
going to happen?  
And the energy to its moon  
and among the smooth irons the steady one  
the custodian covered with boundless hat.  
A lovely sun of horses.  
  
My heart is filled with decency like a fused quartz trouser.  
Outside the area like iron.  
Somebody here is waiting for the next ritual.  
Juice. You heard yourself for dawning.  
It was a forceful business of belt and self-productions.  
Of profound orange, spirit  
of the rivers,  
mutated mother blood, your kisses  
reconcile into exile  
and a droplet  
of gem, with remnants of the moonlight evening.  
You say, what is the pencil waiting for in its crimson forest?  
I tell you it is waiting for muscle like you.  
The hollow cathedral that shines in your banner.  
You rustle my wounded cummerbund  
like a myriad turkey to fresh cheesecake.  
Enjoy the many mechanical attempts to stand  
the equinoctial pigeon hole.  
There is friendly fortune in fashioning it.  
A loaf of bread baked with rigid love  
and salt.  
Inside the melancholy flag, many hollow thorn trees.  
  
Like utensils prosecuting amid clusters.  
Draw from it the morose  
phenomenon of its own language.
