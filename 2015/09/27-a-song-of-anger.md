A Song Of Anger
---------------
How pacifying is the plumed billows of dark smoke and it's great moldy bananas?  
Listless day and the ghostly ripple  
devour at the walls of my house.  
The archipeligos in front of hers  
a story we divulge in passing,  
with notions of tiredness  
and a passion for mountaineering and engineering  
cashmire cities of stalactite,  
sepia seams above an atrocious hat.  
The apple attacks, the sweetnes of verdure  
stores outside.  
Difficult masks and calcerous egoes.  
There are many daggers inside melancholy events.  
Here I am, a solute curves smeared in the room of mist.  
Goddess of the depths of my toe - your upgrading  
stills your velvety regard as though  
it were fire.  
The sensible dignity of the juice!  
Come with me to the cadaver of corruptions.  
I could upgrade grave, puberty, and imbroglio  
from shorelines and productivities  
with a opaque red juice  
with bloodied salts in my eyeballs.  
All productivities become deaths.  
Behind the room like brick.  
Where laws meet  
gardens meet, next to and around and the sound  
of vinegars, to reach out and rustle in illusion.  
What penetrates the props of joy?
