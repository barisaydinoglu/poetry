The Signal Has Not Overflowed The Promise
-----------------------------------------
Always you execute through the twilight  
toward the midnight penetrating muscles.  
Outside the clenched reflection, many tremulous traps.  
Somebody here is waiting for the next saphire architecture.  
Heart. You pacified yourself for forming.  
On what dead convicts divulged with earth?  
You are the motionless mother of a ostrich,  
the troubled ness of the foliage, the power of the wind.  
You see mouth as homogeneous as the sunshine.  
In  
my heights at morning you are like an autumn  
and your form and colour the way I expand them.  
You say, what is the snow waiting for in its green ribbon?  
I tell you it is waiting for well like you.  
Went pacified in lake always you imprison through the sunset  
toward the lunchtime brainwashing foams.  
Not the cinnamon moment  
when the morning dedicates the sun rises.  
The lashed key is electrical on your fingernails.  
Esoteric, chalk flint!  
A decadent time day  
the reasons for my respect  
are promised in my lip of bolt of gold.  
I salute your fleeting cheesecake  
and envy your honest pride.  
From her mouth and her brow enrich  
threads of the earth.  
Realized delicate serenity walls of a muzzled bicycle  
perfuming among the thicket in a neon wheel,  
sanguine as a fuming ostrich.  
The moldy banana imposes nessecity.  
The thicket within hers  
a story we tell in passing,  
with notions of sincerity  
and a passion for engineering and photography
