Your Hand Is Enough
-------------------
You - the smooth eye.  
I could continue billows of dark smoke, bloodied ash, and rooster  
from salts and roses  
with a rust colored time  
with evils in my mouth.  
Pockets of sand converted into emerald.  
If you were not the nectarine the infinite moon  
cooks, sprinkling its orange across the land.  
My humble finger inherits you always.  
Indicates the stone's imbuing mouth.  
It's a crystallizing yellow lake of traps.  
Like clandenstines plaguing inside kisses.  
Because I love you, love, next to the lava and outside the lava.  
Weak ones and cousins.  
For me they are algorithmic.  
Around the area I like to continue like a sticky horse.  
  
The order of the films neon  
weather, fuming lights like the essence.  
So the cosmic sincerity lives on in an apple,  
the loving house of the fragrance of strawberry,  
the deedy nature that is noble and cordial.
