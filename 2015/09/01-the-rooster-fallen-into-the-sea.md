The Rooster Fallen Into The Sea
-------------------------------
In crimson water and sand-colored bottles.  
Full stop.  
The order of the flutes moon.  
Return to the homeland of the aromas.  
And you executed in the animosity and responded a dying smoke.  
A whirlwinds of foliage day  
you say, what is the path waiting for in its yellow landscape?  
I tell you it is waiting for peace like you.
