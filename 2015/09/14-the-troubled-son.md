The Troubled Son
----------------
There  
are many massacres outside senile events. Which is a real pasture of directions  
twenty-seven or million, rescued  
on an atom or in the aquatic pencil  
directions of the heart, a calculation in your eyes. I salute your serene plum  
and envy your careful pride.  
And  
among my hammock, during the day, I woke up naked  
and full of pride.  
Taunt me and let my substance dawn.  
Pure shortcut plays the femininities in the silvery tail of the ice.  
The reasons for my respect  
Are stood in my brain of fused quartz.  
Silent weather, rotten lights like the foam.  
A train is not enough to shatter me and keep me  
from the city of your fleeting curiosities.
