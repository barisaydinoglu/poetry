Tonight I Can Play
------------------
Abolish me and let my substance seize.  
Your gem architecture is a dove filled with cold branch.  
Of a dark pioneer that protects currents.  
Our new leaf, our delicate ship line segments.  
What funny things does the toucan contain?  
How little we seek and how much it gathers the secrets of this computer simulation.  
It's a seizing movie of darkness.  
I saw how laws are continued  
by the honest lemon.  
Seeking toward the rose but I should  
be untrue to photography, replacing among its harsh doors  
so let us attempt to tell a story devoid of aerial redundancies.  
To wake lost splendors and for films.  
Sometimes a piece of the earth  
abolishes like a trouser in my arm.  
Draw from it the disordered  
synonym of its own image.  
  
If you were not the bread the indespensable moon  
cooks, sprinkling its grape across the heights.  
Showering from phosphorus silicon.
