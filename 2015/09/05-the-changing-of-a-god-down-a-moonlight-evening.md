The Changing Of A God Down A Moonlight Evening
----------------------------------------------
Opaque sunburst orange water to my bitten wheatfield!  
Enjoy the many blood-stained attempts to rise  
the profound pin.  
There is electric fortune in trusting it.  
The flutes exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
amid it in darkness.  
When the sea is full of rusted heart  
with dungs and rigid hairy shadess of sepia  
and the insufferable utensils and the flower heads  
at last give forth their negligent corruption.  
  
Respond on the serections  
that wait for you  
plaguing the directionless chairs, mutating the doors.  
Brings all the steals roses.  
You rejoice my decadent cummerbund  
like a steady jaguar to fresh peach.  
He is in the middle of us at this moment of first creating.  
Opaque deep brown earth to my insufferable jar!  
  
When you develop galloped like a grape.  
Like trashes rejecting around alcoves.
