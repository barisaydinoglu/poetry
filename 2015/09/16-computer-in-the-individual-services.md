Not to form or even meet  
the jar of one who breathes  
among me in a universe or re-covering to a mother.  
Carry me onto your airplane - the fruit of my autumn -  
scrupulous empire. The quadrangle  
functions to mix an architecture  
to its system.  
Against the oily archipeligos of lonely light.  
It showers like a movie next to the necklace.  
Draw from it the shady  
machine of its own camera.  
On what boneless hounds galloped with lava?  
Everything hushed with rosy voices, the salt of the leaf  
and piles of wonderful bread  
behind sunrise.  
Pockets of clay converted into gold.  
A boat is not enough to drown me and keep me  
from the city of your serene curiosities.  
The calculating pheasant perfumes in the middle of the lion hearted flames.
