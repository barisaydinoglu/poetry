A Song Of Purity
----------------
Neither telegraph nor friendship nor brimstone  
nor opaque green but green.  
Like hounds passing within salts.  
Only demonic and to a  
aunt they take on time, million years  
nothing but your lovely toe.  
Making a silence  
gathered in the loving sunshine.  
Sordid day and the wet-winged echo  
change at the walls of my house.  
Confusion and flesh - energies of embarassement.
