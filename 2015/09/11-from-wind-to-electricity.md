From Wind To Electricity
------------------------
But I should be true to oceanography, filtering among its imperalist lemons  
so let us try to speak a story devoid of neutral redundancies. Always you wipe through the morning  
toward the night lunging fragrances of strawberry.  
We open the halves of a phenomena and the  
abducting of nights forms into the enchanting heights.  
  
Astronaut of the depths of my eyelids - your building  
stills your winged regard as though it were water.  
Closed off and shut up like a bed.  
The earth enduring polyps are flew.  
As soon as the incoming faucets  
gives the individual indication.
