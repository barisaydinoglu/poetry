Here I Rise You
---------------
You've asked  
me what the squirrel is storing there with his burnt umber eyelids?  
I reply, the hat knows this.  
They attacked it with tenacious fleshes.  
In the smallest silken eddy and ripples and windows.  
And the fellowship to its splendor  
and among the phemonanas the great one  
the woman covered with monastic crimson car.  
In my room at fortnight you are like a crown  
and your form and colour the way I seek them.  
I wish to make a line  
in, and every sight, many  
times hidden in a garden.  
You've asked me what the cat is expanding there with his cashmire breath?  
I reply, the serenity knows this.
