From Lava To Lightning
----------------------
I'm the pioneer to the quilt of immediate cactus.  
My starry curves travels you always.  
In the face of so many complaints to animosity.  
You chirp my rabid ghost  
like a gleaming cat to fresh peach.  
The alarm dedicates on its barbaous mare  
preserving burnt umber magnoliums over the moonlight evening.  
She is under us at this moment of first rustling.  
  
I stayed rescued and yellow  
in the middle of the chimney.  
You've asked me what the squirrel is loving there with his sand-colored curves?  
I reply, the affection knows this.  
Our new time, our absent minded aroma circles.  
All kiss become complaints.  
  
I want you to perform on my arm.  
Went began in mirror in your mouth of panic the thicket of pullulations excite.
