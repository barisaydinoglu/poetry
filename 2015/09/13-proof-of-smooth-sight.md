Proof Of Smooth Sight
---------------------
Behind the tenacious smooth ash, many rustling wounded soldiers.  
And in my hammock, during the holiday, I woke up naked  
and full of decency.  
I stayed preserved and transparent  
behind the field.  
A silvery flesh seeks.  
In the first take, the lion hearted lady  
is protested by a mother. In the second  
take he returns, to fashion and to build.  
You are the burned-out son of a turkey,  
the rotten ness of the love, the power of the jungle.  
The field outside hers  
a history we speak in passing,  
with notions of purity  
and a passion for science and mountaineering  
you attract in the room as in a plumed land.  
  
The wayside  
alcove is full on your finger.  
On what insatiable shardss of marble divulged with earth?
