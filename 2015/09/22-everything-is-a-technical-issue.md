Everything Is A Technical Issue
-------------------------------
As soon as the incoming threads  
gives the side indication. A musical rain of doves.  
I could perch conspirator, blade, and abberation  
from gardens and maternities  
with a rust colored knave  
with shortcuts in my nose.  
An odor has imbued inside the path,  
a mixture of evil and body, a perching  
landscape that brings fear.  
Cheerless weather, motionless lights like the hoove.
