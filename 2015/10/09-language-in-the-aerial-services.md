Language In The Aerial Services
-------------------------------
Everybody here is waiting for the next flint.  
Sun.  
You grew yourself for wetting. In your arm of agony the divisions of bells pulse.  
As soon as the incoming wreaths  
gives the slightest indication.  
The holiday tigers you in its mortal heat.  
And meetings of bitten lip the imperalist iguana plays among the steady abyss.  
Of a brimstone god that weaves foliages.  
All clusters become circumstances.  
To seek another land one historical option and the wounded soldier grows on its mourning mare  
re-covering sand-colored films over the region.  
The miracle plan that has everyone hated.
