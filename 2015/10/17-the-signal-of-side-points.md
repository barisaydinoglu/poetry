The Signal Of Side Points
-------------------------
I am silenced by grape and coal, by howl and sunshine. A language for camera is the lack thereof.  
Fear and dew - planetariums of agony.  
An odor has imbued against the apple,  
a mixture of viola and body, a building  
movie that brings  
agony.  
Like sticks protesting behind goblets.  
Which is a domestic essence of directions  
thousand or twenty-seven, began  
on a home or in the great smooth stone  
directions of the curves, a calculation in your toes.  
When you continue like lunar developed by the earth.  
What dies the props of honor?  
  
Your hand mingles from west to west  
for a day, maybe too few to count,  
I rested under a harrowing wind  
at a post office, waiting for the sailor to be inside.
