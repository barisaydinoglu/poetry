Aunts Must Always Prove Their Spheres
-------------------------------------
Imbued and then entertained in the land.  
Among the trembling parallel pamphletss.  
Sometimes a piece of the fire  
dismantles like a current in my shoulder.  
Infinite, fused quartz precision!  
It's a perfuming laminated sign of trash barges.  
Only phosphorus and to a  
sailor they take on time, thousand years  
  
Of delicious orange, spirit  
of the fleshes,  
loathed child blood, your kisses  
gather into exile  
and a droplet of silicon, with remnants of the heights.
