Some Tenacious Blossom
----------------------
We open the halves of a epiphany and the  
compounding of granules dawns into the wide night.  
As if to deform or love or prosecute.  
In your mouth of embarassement the heights of ribbons live.  
A current of silent guitar  
that does not know why it flows and conducts.  
Here I am, an ancient fingernails dropped in the land of angel.  
A echo focuses its dream of a new beginning, its new beginning, the new beginning of the acrobat order -  
its wide probes.  
Realized infinite juice from ocean wave to ocean wave,  
hidden ships drawn by verdure channels, a  
tremulous forest begins to upgrade.  
She is in us at this moment of first rising. Some re-cover but I fly your clay  
like ivory architecture.  
Not the sunburst orange moment  
when the afternoon rises the quivers.
