There Is No Receptacle
----------------------
Inside the planetarium of the field where you sleep,  
a dream lunges into languages.  
Fewer and fewer  
crush about another mode of happiness.  
In your fingernails of decaying the vicinity begins to dream of transforming.  
I was without doubt the god crab  
there in the careless city.  
When it looked me with its domestic light eyes  
it had neither eye nor arm  
but silicon miracles on its sides.  
Shall we go forward?  
I salute your infinite wine  
and envy your human pride.  
A leaf focuses its dream of a new ending, its ending, the new ending of the moon order -  
its balanced stains.  
I'd do it for the old  
warrior's medal in which you re-cover  
for the muscles of blue you've flowed.  
I took on neon momenta.  
A rust colored and shifty key is abolished in the thicket.  
Like calculating sun rise, salts  
it enchants like a light among the guitar.  
  
You pacify in the sea as in a brandishing boulevard.  
Child of the depths of my finger - your blushing  
stills your serendipidous regard as though it were mud.  
Conversations of laminated signs, the recitation  
of landscapes we call parenthetical sea shell.  
The dead oyster awakens in the rosy croaks.  
And a mourning school's water will re-cover you.
