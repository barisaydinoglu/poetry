Meeting Your Oxide
------------------
Shall we proceed?  
A drop making will entertain  
the blood-stained fire of a planet.  
A lashed camera smothers  
even the resolute  
technical boulevard in technique  
to which the metaphor  
will not be relinquished.  
I was without doubt the astronaut jaguar  
there in the sticky thicket.  
When it looked me with its hopeful friendship eyes  
it had neither breath nor fingernails  
but cork mosaics on its sides.  
My heart moves from being brutal to being essential.  
The reasons for my respect  
are fashioned in my lip of chalk.  
The indespensable uncle  
lives in the secure morning.  
What is this technique but a memory deprived of its fellowships?  
  
The sunrise doves you in its mortal earth.  
Draw from it the melancholy  
camera of its own metaphor.  
  
And suns and splendors.  
The cold pencil is perfect on your hips.
