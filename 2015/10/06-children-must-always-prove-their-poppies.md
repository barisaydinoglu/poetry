Children Must Always Prove Their Poppies
----------------------------------------
What we say relinquishes to  
connect some other person  
what a point of view may teach.  
I was without doubt the god jaguar  
there in the dead vicinity.  
When it looked me with its esoteric essence eyes  
it had neither heart nor eyeballs  
but cork splendors on its sides.  
Like the fragmented metal of souls I could travel imbroglio, lard, and panic  
from awes and salts  
with a rust colored smooth stone  
with bloodied irons in my hips. Ghosts of a rigid  
wheel  
blossoming inside the modern office within a whirlwinds of vessel,  
steady as a muzzled turkey.  
Towards those precisions of yours that wait for me.  
Only browbeaten and to a  
son they take on time, million years  
a brimstone and weak peace  
is deluded in the jungle.
