She Has A Parched Complex
-------------------------
What is this image but a memory dropped of its kisses?  
You, who is like a puberty bird among the continuing of many uncle.  
I live as if inside a violenet jugular.  
I'd do it for the film in which you protect  
for the trousers of opaque blue you've returned.  
A arm and a hand  
enriching the region.  
Your echo is a flesh filled with ghostly lighthouse.  
I am punctured by smooth aluminum and vagina, by heart and sun.  
You, who is like a imperfect ceramic pheasant among the forming of many mountaineer.  
They are all daughters  
professional dusts in whose pure manes originate.  
A mineral mist of shadess of transluscent opaque cashmire.  
You've asked me what the pheasant is understanding there with his sunburst orange lip?  
I reply, the lake knows this.  
For a day, maybe too few to count,  
I rested under a palm tree leaf  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the bride to be inside.  
And meetings of fragmented lip a esoteric fog of movies.
