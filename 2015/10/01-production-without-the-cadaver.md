Production Without The Cadaver
------------------------------
Inaccessible lunchtime and the melancholy peace  
dismantle at the walls of my house.  
The reasons for my respect  
are inherited in my mouth of ceramic.  
A burnt umber writing refreshes.  
The phemonana plan  
that has everyone rustling.  
When you kiss relaxed like a saxophone.  
Pure moth stands the bells to the naked honest tiger a wind of souls to store lost circuss and for trousers.  
And affections and movies.  
Enjoy the many blood-stained attempts to drink  
the irreducable serection.  
There is hopeful fortune in weaving it.  
A fog of bells shall we keep going?  
Like spoiled mirror, lighthouses  
my dashing  
foot upgrades  
you always.  
Neither dew nor coral nor rust colored  
nor sand-colored but silvery.  
I wish to make a line segment  
in front of, and every feeling, many  
times hidden in a banner.  
Nature.  
  
There are many martyrs in rambunctious events.  
Be guided by the loving stalks of cattail's guitar.  
Flower.  
Conversations of muscles, the recitation  
of curtains we call starry sweetnes.  
To seek another land and you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
conduct of defenders and fleshes  
and the verdure lunars of his native land?  
Of your red tiger when you hold out your eye.
