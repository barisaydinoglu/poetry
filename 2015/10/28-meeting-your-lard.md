Meeting Your Lard
-----------------
Where roots meet  
spheres meet, with and around and the sound  
of lances, to reach out and rejoice in sorrow.  
Has the area been imbued with phenomena?  
Your ribbon is a railroad track filled with violenet river.  
Only rustling and to a  
mountaineer they take on time, three hundred years  
but I should be true to engineering, mourning among its neon mosaics  
so let us try to divulge a story without aerial redundancies.  
I am invaded by smooth clay and rotten stump, by bomb and clouds.  
  
It's a trusting kiss of violences.  
Amid the dew of the room where you sleep,  
a dream invades into computers.  
Against the chaotic window, many fire-tipped bones.  
Full stop.  
And meetings of bruised mouth you are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the infinite waves?  
And the rain myriad splattering its utensils and sobbing them full of  
boulevard and bird?
