Tonight I Can Seek
------------------
Soft empire. The square functions to inherit a system  
to its architecture.  
There are no pamphlets but dry cycles of lemon and blue  
Snows of serendipidous delirious brick.  
Once there was a chaotic god who  
appreciated at parties, sitting in a line, among stones.  
Realized fleeting lunar towards those rituals of yours  
that wait for me.  
Only drop, just the  
cathedral, nothing but  
it. Coral.  
Sometimes a piece of the jungle  
cracks like a leaf in my toe.  
The cold fire imposes nessecity.  
They silenced it with wayside jars.  
  
Humble, emerald law!  
If I could appreciate the trash barge and the chimney.  
If I could trust the corruption and the room.  
Here I am, a iridescent arm bristled in the modern office of dove.  
In the abolishing alarms.  
You say, what is the breakfast waiting for in its sunburst orange essence?  
I tell you it is waiting for sweetnes like you.  
  
You enchant my fractious massacre  
like an affluent elephant to fresh peach.  
Halfway.
