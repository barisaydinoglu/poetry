Torrential Acrobat
------------------
A bitterest cathedral day  
in front of opaque deep brown water and silvery cork architectures. Like the insatiable salt of ships outside the form of the modern office where you sleep,  
a dream degrades into sequences.  
The law plan that has everyone rabid.  
A pullulation living will dedicate  
the insufferable lava of a planet.  
With the friendship of the boulevard where you sleep,  
a dream freezes into sequences.  
Refreshing toward the silence nothing but your wide arm.  
And you wet like a coral and a chalk architecture -like billow of dull shades of yellow smoke  
here I am, a domestic leg trembled in the sea of eddy.  
Sunburst orange masks of lonely road,  
transparent seams above a parched laminated sign.  
A irreducable wood paneling making a human thing of a impossible meeting with  
a man.  
Not the sand-colored moment  
when the day showers the horses.
