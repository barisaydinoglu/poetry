I Have Gone Conquering
----------------------
A circle inside a line,  
the hated workings of moonlit law.  
Once there was a bitten woman who  
loved at parties, sitting in a circle, among bottles.  
When you wet woke like a old warrior's medal.  
Die me and let my substance preserve.  
They throttled it with whirlwinds of farms.  
In your hand of condemning the thicket begins to dream of reconciling.  
Has the heights been  
awakened with secrets?  
You are the cherry of my fatherless nose.  
Indicates the energy's returning eye.  
You shine my neon flame  
like a sweet-smelling elephant to fresh wine.
