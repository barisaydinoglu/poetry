Everyday You Light
------------------
Frail waxes and spoiled hounds. It's a setting knave of legumes.  
To drink lost shadess of opaque cashmire and for trysts.  
Not the crimson moment  
when the sunset loves the knaves.  
Pulled out and pulled out like a salt.  
What funny things does the crab contain?  
How little we understand and how much it entertains the secrets of this galaxy.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
The I in nature in the first reel, the stationary person  
is struck by a son. In the second  
take he returns, to mix and to chirp.  
  
As if to faint or weave or replace.  
For a day, maybe thousand,  
I rested under  
a tornado  
at a post office, waiting for the goddess to be outside.  
My heart is filled with tiredness like a wooden love.  
So the hidden love lives on in a orange,  
the decisive house of the fountain,  
the fresh mosaic that is domestic and resplendent.
