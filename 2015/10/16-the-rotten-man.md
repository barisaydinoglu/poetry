The Rotten Man
--------------
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
A technique for identity is the lack thereof.  
I saw how times are mingled  
by the fresh horse.  
The arcane faucet gave it felicity.  
So the human joy lives on in a lemon,  
the electrical house of the thread,  
the stationary warmth of your body that is moonlit and round.  
Wave of wave of essences rolling down the sea.  
The grace plagues, the root of decisive  
pulses behind.  
I wish to make a tetrahedron  
in, and every  
feeling, many  
times hidden in an acrobat.  
The field outside hers  
a history we divulge in passing,  
with notions of wonder  
and a passion for engineering and science  
  
The boneless flag that makes in your starry sky.
