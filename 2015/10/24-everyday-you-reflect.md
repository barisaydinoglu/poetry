Everyday You Reflect
--------------------
Sea water.  
Disintered weather, sterile lights like the precision.  
Return to the homeland of the currents.  
Carry me onto your train - the kiwi of my phemonana -  
a neon stalks of cattail day  
sepia and infinite giant,  
love is gone, the subject  
has reconciled.  
Here I am, a poetic tail condemned in the night of bird feather.
