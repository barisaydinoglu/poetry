Thirsty Wine Bottle
-------------------
The smooth praises  
chained my heart is filled with joy like a glass farm.  
I'm the cousin to the foam of immediate love.  
On what inevitable whispers conducted with mud?  
But the sea's skin recovered the memory.  
Careless custodians and astronauts.  
For me they are alphabetic.
