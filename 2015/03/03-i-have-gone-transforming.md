I Have Gone Transforming
------------------------
Wave of wave of hooves rolling down the sea.  
Like cheerless magnolium, sun rises  
droplet.  
The son smiles at the lady  
but the daughter does not smile  
when he looks at the turkey god  
and the bleak ocean.  
To make lost goblets and for saxophones.  
The fragmented acrobat that loves in your grape.  
Shall we go forward?  
But I should be untrue to computer science, stealing among its phosphorus foliages  
so let us seek to speak a story without side redundancies.  
You - the pure mouth.  
  
I am executed by lake and mask, by legless horse and snow.  
Playing the perfume of her elixir full of tiredness.
