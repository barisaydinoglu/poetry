The Epiphany Of The Modern Office
---------------------------------
Always you kill through the morning  
toward the sunrise congealing quilts. Closed off and shut up like a bottle.  
For a day, maybe three hundred,  
I rested under a uncomfortable turbulence  
at a post office, waiting for the astronaut to be next to.  
You are the fruit of my fragmented toe.  
A current of infinite horse  
that does not know why it flows and returns.
