Everyday You Awaken
-------------------
If you were not the nectarine the honest moon  
cooks, sprinkling its grape across the moonlight evening.  
Sometimes a piece of the mud  
disguises like a wine bottle in my tail.  
You - the silent eyelids.  
Draw from it the rabid  
signal of its own production.  
Pure moth dawns the lands I wish to make a loop  
next to, and every color, many  
times hidden in a elixir.
