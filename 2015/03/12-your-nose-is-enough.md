Your Nose Is Enough
-------------------
To attract lost wheatfields and for grapes.  
Multitude of angels!  
In and out of the deep brown the sand-colored and the yellow  
from unrelenting rain to tornado,  
hidden wells drawn by enduring channels, a  
putrid springtime begins to hear.  
And you harassed in the panic and lighted a fainting stick.  
Indicates the cork architecture's living breath.  
I was without doubt the cousin crab  
there in the arrogant divisions.  
When it looked me with its starry praise eyes  
it had neither fingernails nor eyelids  
but chalk river banks on its sides.  
A triangle next to a line segment,  
the morbid workings of loving law.  
Draw from it the fire-tipped  
technique of its own image.  
Be guided by the ancient honeysuckle's quilt.  
Around the land I like to appreciate like a pale horse.  
Trusting a guitar  
lighted in the incredulous rain.  
An odor has understood in the bell,  
a mixture of utensil and body, a dawning  
wreath that brings sorrow.  
  
Within  
the writing of the universe where you sleep,  
a dream pities into points of view.  
Wheatfield.
