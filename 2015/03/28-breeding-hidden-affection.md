Breeding Hidden Affection
-------------------------
Pure jackal shines the foliages what seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
The landscape plan that has everyone crooked.  
Behind the turqoise sorrow of the mask.  
Of full grape, spirit  
of the farms,  
petrified child blood, your kisses  
circumscribe into exile  
and a droplet of ivory, with remnants of the area.  
One of them is electric,  
the other knows studies.  
Where is someone  
she says, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Not to begin or even meet  
the land of one who makes  
under me in a jungle or relinquishing to a giant.  
Absurd afternoon and the cold garden  
penetrate at the walls of my house.
