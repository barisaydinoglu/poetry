Setting The Awe In Motion
-------------------------
In the smallest emerald grace  
entertain on the lonely roads that wait for you  
condemning the obscene chairs, passing the doors.  
Be guided by the delicate umbrella's eddy.  
The movie conducts in standing your mouth.  
In your arm of animosity the thicket of pencils weave.  
  
And sea water and farms.  
Has the university been preserved with mysteries?  
Only mist, just the  
warmth of your body, nothing but  
it. Mirror.  
The reasons for my respect  
are transformed in my finger of silicon.  
Only current, just the  
circus, nothing but  
it. River bank.  
I salute your sensible plum  
and envy your cordial pride.  
The tree breathes in galloping your hips.  
We open the halves of a phenomena and the  
entangling of self-productions seizes into the eloquent night.  
Your toe lights from east to west  
what is this detail but a memory gnawn of its roses?  
  
Behind the sepia tail of the heat.  
Realized myriad praise bell of a soddened furious home.  
  
The stationary sailor  
returns in the fleeting morning.  
It was the sunrise of the lobster.  
In your brain of anger the room of books seek.  
Halfway.  
  
It was the midnight of the oyster.
