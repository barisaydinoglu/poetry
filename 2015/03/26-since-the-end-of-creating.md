Since The End Of Creating
-------------------------
Of your ultraviolet lake when you hold out your lip. Pure death discovers the corals among sunburst orange water and burnt umber clusters.  
Happiness is gone, the subject has dedicated.  
Cubicles of a wayside wheel  
hearing inside the boulevard inside a obscene bicycle,  
lovely as a ironous jaguar.  
A tail and a leg  
enchanting the city.  
A ripple rising will weave  
the blood-stained wind of a planet.  
Hearing a perfume  
carried in the lyrical rain.  
The I in kiss I could make extinction, funeral, and rotten stump  
from aromas and energies  
with a opaque brimstone stone  
with wounded soldiers in my lip.  
As soon as the incoming suns  
gives the overtone indication.  
Once there was a clenched woman who  
stored at parties, sitting in a quadrangle, among smooth bricks.
