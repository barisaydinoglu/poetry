Outside Of Eddy And Door
------------------------
Multitude of wreaths!  
In and out of the marine the silvery and the transparent  
brings all the cracks doors.  
To the balanced incredulous umbrella the wind lion hearted vagabonds are shattered.  
Sometimes a piece of the electricity  
drowns like a fountain in my shoulder.  
Cinnamon jungle to my putrid flint!  
I took on tremulous warmths of your body.  
The reasons for my respect  
are loved in my foot of emerald.  
And keys and honeysuckles.  
My starry brain hears you always.  
The guilt hoove is comfortable on your brow.  
What seems disjoint to one will not  
seem so to another.  
My resolute eyelids expands you always.  
Like the morbid iron of shadess of blue sometimes a piece of the lightning  
smears like a candle in my fingernails.  
Peace.  
  
It was the early light of day of the lobster.  
My heart is filled with respect like a ivory rose.  
Some play but I set your graphite like current.  
Boneless night and the rotten old warrior's medal  
overflow at the walls of my house.  
I could dawn shards of gold, bramble, and flask  
from times and precisions  
with a black alcove  
with alarms in my fingernails.  
  
It was the early light of day of the cat.
