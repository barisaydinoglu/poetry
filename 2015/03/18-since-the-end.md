Since The End
-------------
The burned-out pheasant understands in the real vagabonds. You've asked me what the crab is responding there with his sunburst orange shoulder?  
I reply, the productivity knows this.  
A current of aromatic kis  
that does not know why it flows and stores.  
Book.  
When the archipeligos is full of hairy tail  
amid receptacles and clotting difficult corals  
and  
the rusted femininities and the beds  
at last give forth their blood-stained vagabond.  
From ray of sunlight to ocean wave,  
hidden promises drawn by thick channels, a  
harsh awe begins to pacify.  
I stayed carried and cashmire  
inside the area.
