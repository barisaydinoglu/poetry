Fashioning Sterile Nostalgia
----------------------------
I'm the man to the pullulation of immediate land.  
Because I love you, love, inside the earth and among the mud.  
I do not deceive in the room of dilute felicity.  
Multitude of eddies!  
In and out of the blue the cinnamon and the blue  
this bitten evening star and trusting aspen loathes me  
with it's steady precisions like heart and finger  
and dull shades of opaque opaque cinnamon forms like curves and railroad tracks.  
Holes of a lethargic car  
gathering amid the universe around a melancholy boat,  
sweet-smelling as a insatiable oyster.  
  
Cinnamon wind to my burned-out crown!  
She is against us at this moment of first divulging.
