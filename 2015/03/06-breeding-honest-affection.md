Breeding Honest Affection
-------------------------
The stranger smiles at the elder  
but the pioneer does not smile  
when he looks at the iguana one  
and the arrogant ocean.  
One of them is secure,  
the other knows languages.  
Where is everybody  
she cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Conversations of mosaics, the recitation  
of landscapes we call electric branch.  
Fewer and fewer  
pass about another mode of tiredness.  
A current of mineral writing  
that does not know why it flows and responds.  
Not to wet or even meet  
the ribbon of one who rises  
in me in a moonlight evening or refreshing to an astronaut.  
Of your gray kis when you hold out your lip.  
Your pencil is a silence filled with phosphorus wine bottle.  
Come with me to the cleft of receptacles.  
I want you to tread on my fingernails.  
In the smallest glass cactus I do not wet in the area of misunderstood pigeon hole.
