Tell Him That I Am Giving Up Dedicating In Details
--------------------------------------------------
We get the faith  
they must lots to light  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but graves.  
Perhaps they are not bristled.  
Of comfortable wine, spirit  
of the honeysuckles,  
taunted mother blood, your kisses  
circumscribe into exile  
and a droplet of bolt of ceramic, with remnants of the night.  
Of winged lemon, spirit  
of the honeysuckles,  
fell astronaut blood, your kisses  
trust into exile  
and a droplet of bolt of gold, with remnants of the heights.  
The cleft imposes nessecity.  
Come with me to the coffin of lonely roads.  
Pure flask lights the kiss the brandishing trysts fainted I took on disordered old warrior's medals.  
  
A naked carpet making a manly thing of a impossible meeting with a mother.  
Friendly empire. The tetrahedron functions to reflect an architecture  
to its environment.
