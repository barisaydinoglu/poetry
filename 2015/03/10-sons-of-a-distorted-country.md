Sons Of A Distorted Country
---------------------------
My heart moves from being torrential  
to being dashing.  
Bitter  
sunset and the demonic grace  
wet  
at the walls of my house.  
I'm the stranger to the kiss of immediate key.  
The ripple conducts in reconciling your fingernails.  
The reasons for my respect  
are awakened in my shoulder of fused quartz.  
I salute your enchanting sugar  
and envy your serene pride.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.
