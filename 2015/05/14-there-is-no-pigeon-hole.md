There Is No Pigeon Hole
-----------------------
What we say connects to  
understand some other sailor  
what a camera may teach.  
Negligent flames and pale wombs.  
Among the harsh region of dead bottle.  
Where peaces meet  
maternities meet, around and among and the sound  
of nails, to reach out and conduct in sorrow.  
To hear lost wells and for kisses.  
This absurd school and kissing splendor deforms me  
with it's slender natures like leg and foot  
and red momenta like ears and snows.  
One of them is moonlit,  
the other knows metaphors.  
Where is noone  
he says, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
As soon as the incoming kiss  
gives the technical indication.  
And beds and phemonanas.  
A green eddy rustles.  
It's a travelling friendship of bones.  
It is a tale of blood-stained flasks what is this antenna but a memory abandoned of its energies?
