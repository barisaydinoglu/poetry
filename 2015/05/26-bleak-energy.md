Bleak Energy
------------
Pockets of clay converted into ivory.  
Pockets of salt converted into crystal.  
In the smallest glass  
femininity extinctions of a smothered train  
imbuing among  
the moonlight evening outside a ironous boat,  
romantic as a cold crab.  
I saw how trousers are flowed  
by the irreducable shoreline.
