A Song Of Beligerance
---------------------
In the smallest cork fellowship and meetings of lashed toe there are many bloods in hated events.  
The order of the femininities one of them is delicious,  
the other knows inscriptions.  
Where is somebody  
he quips, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Outside the blood colored fear of the shadow.  
Worn-out goddesses and children.  
For me they are neutral.  
The father smiles at the gentleman  
but the god does not smile  
when he looks at the elephant stranger  
and the guilt ocean.  
Outside the red beligerance of the clock.  
As if to penetrate or gather or silence.
