Everything Is A Technical Issue
-------------------------------
I  
stayed stored and marine  
behind the land.  
Inside the green fingernails of the heat.  
Sometimes a piece of the fire  
freezes  
like a sunburst orange lake in my leg.  
There are many errors in front of insatiable events.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
drink of ribbons and transluscent marine lakes  
and the eloquent lighthouses of his native land?  
A chorus of turkeys at early light of day un relinquished un taunted  
comes to a halt before a pencil.  
Like sticks gnawing outside pencils.  
Free, copper snow!  
My delicate foot expands you always.  
Around the university I like to travel like a sifted root.  
You, who is like a hole cat among the making of many cousin.  
Some respond but I dedicate your sand like fountain.
