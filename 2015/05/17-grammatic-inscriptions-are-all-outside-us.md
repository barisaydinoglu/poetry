Grammatic Inscriptions Are All Outside Us
-----------------------------------------
The room outside  
hers  
a story we speak in passing,  
with notions of pride  
and a passion for engineering and mountaineering  
knave was no longer right at the transmission threshold.  
I took on silent jars.  
Of silent orange, spirit  
of the energies,  
changed woman blood, your kisses  
drink into exile  
and a droplet of silken, with remnants of the universe.  
There ought to be a flint of an affluent warmth crystallizing in a chimney.  
As soon as the incoming corals  
gives the aerial indication.  
A current of myriad lighthouse  
that does not know why it  
flows and enchants.  
Pockets of rusted nail converted into cork.  
The croak connects on its sterile mare  
inheriting sunburst orange springtimes over the universe.  
What epiphany does the elephant contain?  
How little we travel and how much it recovers the mysteries of this galaxy.  
If you were not the bread the silent moon  
cooks, sprinkling its cheesecake across the vicinity.  
Once there was a violenet pioneer who  
understood at parties, sitting in a triangle, among grapes.  
Like felicities depriving with doors.
