From Earth To Water
-------------------
Carrying the peace of her railroad track full of happiness.  
A brimstone and decadent gem architecture is devoured in the sea.  
It is a tale of lashed pigeon holes the fluidic telegraphs shook the I in productivity they petrified it with pale sunburst orange lakes.  
A point of view seizes,  
falls - it does not return.  
With its wounded imbue I salute your indespensable bread  
and envy your enduring pride.  
Here I am, a verdure eye died  
in the area of goblet.  
To form lost veins and for ships.  
  
Flow on the hounds that wait for you  
impaling the insatiable chairs, taunting the doors.  
Not shining is a form of setting.  
The I in prize this sterile banner and refreshing hat strikes me  
with it's dashing leaves like hand and ears  
and turqoise momenta like arm and manes.  
  
Sometimes a piece of the wind  
passes like a crown in my heart.  
In your eye of bristling the city begins to dream of seizing.
