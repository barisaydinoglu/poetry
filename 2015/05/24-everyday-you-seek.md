Everyday You Seek
-----------------
Fewer and fewer  
freeze about another mode of decency.  
Like the hollow clay of leaves because I love you, love, inside the sky and inside the fire.  
If you were not the cheesecake the starry moon  
cooks, sprinkling its cheesecake across the vicinity.  
Green and parenthetical woman,  
Form on the depths that wait for you  
falling the exiled chairs, plaguing the doors.
