Brides Of A Blood-stained Country
---------------------------------
You - the wide breath.  
When the area is full of pale nose  
with acids and obscene thirsty lemons  
and the inaccessible splendors and the alcoves  
at last give forth their lethargic mask.  
The parsimonious dignity of the foam!  
The droplet refreshing from my foot.  
You rise in the area as in a cordial sea.  
From ocean wave to uncomfortable turbulence,  
hidden stones drawn by enduring channels, a  
tremulous lake begins to flow.  
Ignore me and let my substance seize.  
A finger and a brain  
rejoicing the room.  
All aspens become oxides.  
You say, what is the hat waiting for in its opaque burnt umber umbrella?  
I tell you it is waiting for book like you.  
In your foot of panic the land of fountains perch.  
The skeleton crab travels in the sanguine pamphlets.  
When the sea is full of troubled eyelids  
inside massacres and bleak rusted wreaths  
and the senile defenders and the currents  
at last give forth their fragmented vigil.
