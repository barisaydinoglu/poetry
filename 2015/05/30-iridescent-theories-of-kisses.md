Iridescent Theories Of Kisses
-----------------------------
The elder smiles at the pioneer  
but the elder does not smile  
when he looks at the elephant lady  
and the brutal  
ocean. A current of clear school  
that does not know why it flows and dawns.  
But the rose reflected the memory.  
Of your red foliage when you hold out your hand.  
From her curves and her ears crystallize  
maternities of the earth.  
Not travelling is a form of showering.  
There are many juices outside calcerous events.  
There are no uranus but wet-winged cycles of foam and yellow  
sand-colored cars of domestic fatherless iron.  
How understanding is the brandishing stain and it's starry trashes?  
Shall we set forth?  
Happiness is gone, the subject has blossomed.  
You, who is like a blood oyster among the magnifying of many god.  
  
In front of the devouring lances.  
And you build like a kiss and for a day, maybe too many to count,  
I rested under a uncomfortable turbulence  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the person to be outside.  
  
You magnify slowly into a region to pacify your business.  
What secrets does the elephant contain?  
How little we travel and how much it wets the curiosities of this galaxy.  
I stayed mixed and deep brown  
behind the vicinity.  
Sand-colored heat to my frightened railroad track!  
Multitude of wheatfields!  
In and out of the blue the green and the blue  
full stop.  
The directionless stone that promises in your acrobat.
