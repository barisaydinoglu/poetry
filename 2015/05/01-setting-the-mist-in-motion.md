Setting The Mist In Motion
--------------------------
Agony and well - beds of fear.  
Fewer and fewer  
forebode about another mode of felicity.  
I wish to make a square  
in, and every sense, many  
times hidden in a book.  
Pulled out and pulled out like a path.  
On what hated stenches relinquished with heat?  
Awe was  
no longer below the transmission threshold.
