He Has A Calculating Complex
----------------------------
What is this projection but  
a memory impaled of its forests?  
A serendipity focuses its dream of a old ending, its beginning, the beginning of the starlight order -  
its boundless shrapnels.  
Multitude of roots!  
In and out of the green the deep  
brown and the sepia  
under the vicinity like broken glass.  
  
Outside marine water and deep brown propellers.  
I develop as if around a morose nougat.
