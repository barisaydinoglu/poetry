Since The Beginning Of Perching
-------------------------------
In the face of so many wounds to animosity.  
In your hand of attacking the archipeligos begins to dream of galloping.  
Pockets of steel converted into bolt of ivory.  
You travel my lethargic bloody feather  
like a slender lobster to fresh sugar.  
And you protested in the anger and blossomed a overflowing legume.  
As soon as the incoming forests  
gives the alphabetic indication.  
Transforming a candle  
chirped in the loving fog.  
You are the troubled daughter of a jaguar,  
the banal ness of the springtime, the power of the electricity.  
A wind of acrobats a loaf of bread baked with bleak pride and salt.  
Your goblet is a door filled with explosive propeller.  
Everything banal with musical voices, the salt of the springtime  
and piles of humble bread amid morning.  
You stand in the room as in a moonlit university.  
Went pulsed in knave sometimes a piece of the ice  
mutates like a splendor in my eyelids.  
Once there was a imperalist elder who  
imbued at parties, sitting in a line, among bells.  
Noone here is waiting for the next mosaic.  
Flower head. You awakened yourself for blossoming.  
I build as if next to a ironous panic.
