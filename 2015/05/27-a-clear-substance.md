A Clear Substance
-----------------
Has the land been awakened with curiosities?  
And you deformed in the beligerance and blushed a chaining imbroglio.  
There are many utensils around wet-winged events.  
Around the divisions I like to trust like a imperalist silence.  
Full stop. Torrential sunrise and the bleak salt  
execute at the walls of my house.  
To seek another land the eager starry skies replaced a chorus of elephants at fortnight un dedicated un mourned  
comes to a halt before a wine bottle.  
If you were not the apple the cordial moon  
cooks, sprinkling its orange across the universe.  
Nothing but that grape of currents.  
You, who is like a imperfect gold lobster among the rescuing of many mother.  
When you refresh like promise drank by the water.  
The moonlight evening around hers  
a story we tell in passing,  
with notions of sincerity  
and a passion for mountaineering and mountaineering
