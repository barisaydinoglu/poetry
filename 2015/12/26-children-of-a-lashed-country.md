Children Of A Lashed Country
----------------------------
A chorus of crabs at sunrise un enchanted un conquered  
comes to a halt before a flag.  
Which is a delicate planetarium of directions  
thousand or too few to count, relinquished  
on a wave or in the musical door  
directions of the lip, a calculation in your eyelidss.  
For a day, maybe million,  
I rested under a uncomfortable turbulence  
at a bus stop, waiting for the gentleman to be among.  
Enjoy the many obscene attempts to make  
the natural nail.  
There is irreducable fortune in chirping it.  
Because I love you, love, around the earth and next to the fire.  
Indicates the well's transforming hand.  
  
They are all daughters  
professional cold fires in whose rosy pencils originate.  
So the hopeful love lives on in a grape,  
the sanguine house of the pasture,  
the infinite kiss that is spacious and monastic.  
I'm the man to the friendship of immediate door.  
A sunburst orange echo relaxes.  
  
How mingling is the careful shrapnel and it's winged alarms?
