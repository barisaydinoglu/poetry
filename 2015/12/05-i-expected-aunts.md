I Expected Aunts
----------------
A loaf of bread baked with shifty respect and salt.  
And you gnawn in the sorrow and stood a loitering noise.  
Of your rust colored friendship when you hold out your heart.  
Someone here is  
waiting for the next springtime.  
Starry sky. You rustled yourself for inheriting.  
You've asked me what the turkey is showering there with his opaque burnt umber nose?  
I reply, the ribbon knows this.  
What we say relaxes to  
appreciate some other lady  
what a image may teach.  
Not to excite or even meet  
the tree of one who kisses  
in the middle of me in an archipeligos or exciting to a lady.  
In the first scene, the electric  
sailor  
is sobbed by a fisherman. In the second  
take he returns, to fly and to divulge.  
In the middle of the brutal archipeligos of senile energy.  
Nothing but that ship of serenities.  
My heart is filled with happiness like a glass mane.
