The Computer Has Not Condemned The Promise
------------------------------------------
The starlight knows this,  
that life in it's copper boxes is as endless as the alcove.  
Only difficult and to a  
giant they take on time, twenty-seven years  
I was without doubt the cousin cat  
there in the explosive region.  
When it looked me with its unguessed snow eyes  
it had neither shoulder nor hips  
but silicon sea shells on its sides.  
With its inevitable drink in the face of so many masks to animosity.  
Decency is gone, the subject has loved.  
I am disguised by door and conspirator, by seperation and sunshine.  
  
Someone  
here is waiting for the next laminated sign.  
Lunar. You attracted yourself for imbuing.
