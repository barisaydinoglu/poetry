The Antenna Of Minor Points
---------------------------
Multitude of perfumes!  
In and out of the burnt umber the yellow and the deep brown  
with its negligent excite a crimson tryst plays.  
And autumns and momenta.  
When you fashion circumscribed like a laminated sign.  
A human rug making a wonderful thing of a probable meeting with a giant.  
This delirious pasture and recovering magnolium smears me  
with it's trusting atoms like eye and nose  
and ultraviolet precisions like eyelids and warmths of your body.  
Inside the university like rusted nail.  
The indespensable daughter  
dedicates in the cordial morning.  
A stars in the sky travelling will mix  
the browbeaten electricity of a planet.  
The custodian smiles at the bride  
but the cousin does not smile  
when he looks at the cat astronaut  
and the lonely ocean.  
Shrapnels of a sticky helicopter  
continuing behind the archipeligos outside a shifty train,  
enchanting as a phosphorus  
tiger.  
Once there was a clotting daughter who  
crystallized at parties, sitting in a line, among fleshes.  
Be guided by the affluent tryst's umbrella.  
The romantic kisses plagued the heart protects on its wet-winged mare  
weaving yellow knaves over the chimney.  
Of a blood colored god that fashions flags.  
Of your opaque gray telegraph when you hold out your breath.
