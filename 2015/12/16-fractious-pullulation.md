Fractious Pullulation
---------------------
Your tail expands from north to south  
as if to fall or drink or deprive.  
Errors of a nauesous raft  
shining in the thicket behind a distorted vessel,  
poetic as a phosphorus jaguar.  
In your eye of illusion the university of fragrances  
of strawberry grow.  
The serendipities exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
around it in darkness.  
Chirping from brutal silicon.  
A dull shades of cinnamon and banal awe is crushed in the modern office.  
You see  
eyeballs as handsome as the drizzle.  
It's a flying foam of depths.  
Among the nauesous bottle, many imperalist deaths.  
In the first reel, the decisive sailor  
is impaled by a daughter. In the second  
scene he returns, to chirp and to dawn.
