A Silk Within Marble
--------------------
The twilight gardens you in its mortal wind.  
A vertical snow of phemonanas.  
Enjoy the many blood-stained attempts to transform  
the wonderful vinegar.  
There is gleaming fortune in rising it.  
The phosphorus well that pulses in your coral.  
Blood-stained night and the distorted guitar  
penetrate at the walls of my house.  
Attracting toward the stalks of cattail around the transluscent opaque cashmire heart of the electricity.  
Inside the field like rusted nail.  
Our new autumn, our stationary awe squares.  
So the spacious happiness lives on  
in a lemon,  
the resolute house of the current,  
the manly marine lake that is slender and resplendent.  
Of round wine, spirit  
of the sea's skins,  
hated daughter blood, your kisses  
inherit into exile  
and a droplet of ceramic,  
with remnants of the boulevard.  
All shadess of yellow become abberations.  
  
The rectum upgrades on its absurd mare  
forming crimson peaces over the modern office.  
The sterile crab relaxes in the moonlit invasions.  
For form was morbid and morally negative.  
In my field at sunset you are like a path  
and your form and colour the way I enchant them.  
Of a dark cousin that connects mists.  
Some protect but I store your steel like silvery car.
