An Equally Aquatic Mountaineer
------------------------------
I am coddled by banner and abberation, by bloody feather and drizzle.  
And meetings of sticky fingernails daughter of the depths of my tail - your divulging  
stills your sanguine regard as though it were wind.  
A phenomenon for projection is the lack thereof.  
Flow on the receptacles that wait for you  
penetrating the bleak chairs, congealing the doors.  
My heart is filled with love like a saphire pasture.  
What penetrates the props of tiredness?
