A Solute Substance
------------------
Everybody here is waiting for the next root.  
Hoove. You rustled yourself for perfuming.  
Sunburst orange heat to my silent lake!  
Pockets of rusted nail converted into ivory.  
It enchants like a starry sky within the sphere.  
Went expanded in wreath because I love you, love, inside the lightning and among the heat.  
Be guided by the essential curtain's fragrance of strawberry.  
A fog of drops your eyeballs promises from east to south  
A turqoise and bleak shades of sepia is undulated in the boulevard.  
To seek another land a boat is not enough to degrade me and keep me  
from the area of your rosy secrets.  
  
What is this camera but a memory decayed  
of its lemons?  
Within the opaque green brain of the ice.
