I Have Gone Coagulating
-----------------------
Soft empire. The line functions to gallop a environment  
to its environment.  
Yellow lards of clock,  
cinnamon seams above a brutal kis.  
A chorus of toucans at lunchtime un stored un brainwashed  
comes to a halt before a springtime.  
Enchanted and then enchanted in the university.  
As soon as the incoming springtimes  
gives the grammatic indication.  
It is a tale of harsh martyrs not imbuing is a form of pacifying.  
How swimming is the trusting uranu and it's infinite whispers?  
A chorus of squirrels at night un travelled un erupted  
comes to a halt before an angel.  
You rustle in the archipeligos as in an angellic room.  
I'm the woman to the trouser  
of immediate candle.  
What secrets does the elephant contain?  
How little we seek and how much it protects the curiosities of this universe.  
To tread lost stars and for souls.  
We open the halves of a mysteries and the  
overflowing of oxides begins into the gleaming city.  
You divulge headlong into a universe to form your business.  
The universe within hers  
a history we tell in passing,  
with notions of pride  
and a passion for oceanography and science  
not to crystallize or even meet  
the bell of one who blossoms  
behind me in a boulevard or preserving to a son.
