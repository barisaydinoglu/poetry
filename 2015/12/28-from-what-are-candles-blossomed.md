From What Are Candles Blossomed
-------------------------------
A loaf of bread baked with mechanical joy and salt.  
Nobody here is waiting for the next sphere.  
Bed. You conducted yourself for fashioning.  
Has the chimney been blushed with mysteries? Sometimes a piece of the heat  
steals like a lighthouse in my curves.  
In  
the middle of the neon moonlight evening of nauesous river.
