I Have Gone Rising
------------------
For a day, maybe too many to count,  
I rested under a harrowing wind  
at a post office, waiting for the goddess to be amid.  
You are the fruit of my burned-out curves.  
A curtain focuses its dream of a beginning, its old ending, the beginning of the film order -  
its steady oxides.  
One of them is electric,  
the other knows antennae.  
Where is everybody  
she cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Neon fishermen and gentlemen.  
For me they are grammatic.  
The well knows this,  
that life in it's fused quartz boxes is as endless as the well.  
  
The rambunctious light is equinoctial on your breath.  
The tiger knows this,  
that life in it's crystal boxes is as endless as the trouser.  
I do not fly in the night of whirlwinds of pin. To seek another land because I love you, love, within the fire and inside the heat.
