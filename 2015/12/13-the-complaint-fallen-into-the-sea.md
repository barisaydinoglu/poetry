The Complaint Fallen Into The Sea
---------------------------------
If I could hear the massacre and the vicinity.  
The parenthetical mosaics coddled some shine but I chirp your brick like river.  
Fragmented daughters and sailors.  
For me they are public.  
The insufferable squirrel imbues behind the winged blades.  
As soon as the incoming currents  
gives the algorithmic indication.  
I'm the mountaineer to the femininity of immediate river.  
One of them is somber,  
the other knows inscriptions.  
Where is somebody  
she exclaims, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Purity is gone, the subject has formed.  
  
The I in bell we get the sense  
they must lots to excite  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but  
convicts.  
Perhaps they are not pampered.  
You've asked me what the elephant is magnifying there with his transluscent crimson eye?  
I reply, the bird feather knows this.  
  
This phosphorus breakfast and living mosaic smears me  
with it's romantic candles like foot and eye  
and brimstone movies like ears and fountains.
