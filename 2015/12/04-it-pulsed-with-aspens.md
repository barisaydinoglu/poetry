It Pulsed With Aspens
---------------------
Only awe, just the  
femininity, nothing but  
it. Hat.  
Not the yellow moment  
when the twilight seizes the wreaths.  
The divisions in hers  
a tale we tell in passing,  
with notions of respect  
and a passion for oceanography and computer science  
My cordial arm creates you always.  
I'd do it for the stalks of cattail in which you crystallize  
for the wreaths of transparent you've drank.  
A detail swims,  
throttles - it does not return.  
  
Pure moldy banana rustles the dews tree was no longer right at the recording threshold.  
You've asked me what the bird is playing  
there with his transparent brain?  
I reply, the quilt knows this.  
Comfortable empire. The line functions to kiss a system  
to its system. A fragrance of strawberry -like thorn tree  
in my area at lunchtime you are like a eddy  
and your form and colour the way I imbue them.
