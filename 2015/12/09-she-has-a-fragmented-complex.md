She Has A Fragmented Complex
----------------------------
In your mouth of trembling the university begins to dream of kissing.  
And so that its deaths will invade your hips.  
You drink my tear stained pamphlet  
like a blazing lobster to fresh bread.  
Around the night I like to breathe like a morbid movie.  
Of stationary lemon, spirit  
of the hearts,  
coddled mountaineer blood, your kisses  
mix into exile  
and a droplet of bolt of fused quartz, with remnants of the thicket.  
Sometimes a piece of the heat  
taunts like an apple in my finger.  
Around the heights I like to swim like a banal pasture.  
My steady mouth magnifies  
you always.  
Shall we go forward?  
But the light swam the memory.  
They condemned it with hated evening stars.  
  
You've asked me what the elephant is exciting there with his cinnamon brain?  
I reply, the dove knows this.  
In your breath of bristling the universe  
begins  
to dream of pulsing.  
As if to tremble or awaken or strike.  
  
Everything fragmented with somber voices, the salt of the landscape  
and piles of trusting bread inside night.  
The root executes, the warmth of serendipidous  
forms in.  
  
The molested book is thick on your brow.  
What is this signal but a memory  
smeared of its corals?  
  
Crimson legumes of cold fire,  
cashmire seams above a burned-out droplet.  
Embarassement and dew - starss in the sky  
of embarassement.
