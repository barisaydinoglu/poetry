The Neurotic Son Of The Chimney
-------------------------------
Be guided by the homogeneous springtime's saxophone.  
Carry me onto your car - the fruit of my lighthouse -  
in the middle of the thicket like ash.  
The affluent elder  
continues in the fluidic morning.  
Of a opaque gray cousin that drinks apples.  
When the modern office is full of exiled lip  
with walls and wayside exiled stars  
and the shifty curtains and the smooth stones  
at last give forth their rotten billow of brimstone smoke.  
Halfway.  
The flower plan that has everyone lashed.  
There are no wounds but clotting cycles of old warrior's medal and silvery  
wells of lyrical phosphorus aluminum.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
enrich of magnoliums and hats  
and the parenthetical stars of his native land?  
A car is not enough to harass me and keep me  
from the region of your cosmic epiphany.  
Transforming from neon silk.  
In the arrogant angel, many troubled havocs.  
You divulge in the modern office as in a fleeting city.  
  
My heart is filled with honor like a silk bed.  
Here I am, an ancient leg wiped in the divisions of sea water.
