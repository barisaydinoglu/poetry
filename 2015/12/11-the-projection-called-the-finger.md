The Projection Called The Finger
--------------------------------
With its burned-out enchant opaque burnt umber and affluent fisherman,  
the land among hers  
a story we speak in passing,  
with notions of pride  
and a passion for jouranlism and oceanography  
shall we set forth?  
Tiredness is gone, the subject has preserved.  
And you fainted in the fear and sought a condemning shortcut.  
Sepia jungle to my dead time!  
In your eyelids of illusion the city of warmths blossom.  
Multitude of mirrors!  
In and out of the green the green and the sand-colored  
you - the electric curves.  
  
Flow on the brambles that wait for you  
erupting the rotten chairs, mourning the doors.  
Indicates the magnolium's chirping toe.  
A parenthetical linoleum making a wide thing of a unlikely meeting  
with an aunt.  
The somber dignity of the time!  
  
Nothing but your sensual finger.  
Some travel but I perfume your brick like soul.  
You've asked me what the squirrel is continuing there with his sepia ears?  
I reply, the well knows this.
