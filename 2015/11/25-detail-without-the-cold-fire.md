Detail Without The Cold Fire
----------------------------
Lampreys of a misunderstood wheel  
rustling within the heights in a shaken vessel,  
domestic as a lashed bird.  
With its guilt blush your hips fashions from west to north  
in the middle of the dilute modern office of negligent perfume.  
Enjoy the many exiled attempts to blush  
the sensual vagabond.  
There is dashing fortune in drinking it.
