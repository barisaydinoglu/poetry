A Somber Substance
------------------
Only motionless and to a  
elder they take on time, too few to count years  
you've asked me what the tiger is drinking there with his burnt umber toe?  
I reply, the peace knows this.  
A loaf of bread baked with rustling joy and salt.  
A mouth and a brain  
understanding the boulevard.  
  
I saw how knaves are transformed  
by the nocturnal bridge.  
A steady sun of faucets.  
A aroma kissing will perform  
the sticky earth of a planet.  
Full stop.
