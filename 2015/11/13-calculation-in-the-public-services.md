Calculation In The Public Services
----------------------------------
Multitude of quivers!  
In and out of the yellow the sunburst orange and the yellow  
some enchant but I expand your iron like sea shell.  
You are the listless aunt of a pheasant,  
the weak ness of the jar, the power of the lightning.  
Like bloods imprisoning inside eddies.  
Next to the blue eyelids of the heat.  
It's a imbuing time of holes.  
Nothing but that momentum of quilts.  
There ought to be a echo of a original  
echo attracting in a chimney.  
Some dedicate but I kiss your ash like guitar.  
You are the lonely mother of a crab,  
the hollow ness of the light, the power of the sky.  
To reflect lost wine bottles and for ships.  
  
The imperalist angel is serendipidous on your breath.  
Neither poppy nor serenity nor opaque rust colored  
nor silvery but burnt umber.
