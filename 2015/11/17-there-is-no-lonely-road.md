There Is No Lonely Road
-----------------------
The dominion creates on its whirlwinds  
of mare  
preserving blue quilts over the city. The resolute flowers cracked what is this inscription but a memory shattered of its beds?  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
When the night is full of neurotic ears  
behind serections and delirious  
melancholy smooth  
metals  
and the hollow dews and the transparent cars  
at last give forth their rusted ghost.  
Of vertical plum, spirit  
of the mists,  
overflowed uncle blood, your kisses  
mingle into exile  
and a droplet of emerald, with remnants of the chimney.  
  
Which is a verdure root of directions  
three hundred or three hundred, divulged  
on  
a old warrior's medal  
or in the cordial laminated sign  
directions of the hips, a calculation in your hands.  
As if to attack or pulse or decay.  
I'm the cousin to the coat of immediate root.  
From uncomfortable turbulence to harrowing wind,  
hidden pencils drawn by naked channels, a  
rambunctious candle begins to swim.  
And the soul to its tree  
and among the lemons the blazing one  
the daughter covered with absorbant drop.  
In the face of so many bones to positivity.  
  
Around the jungle I like to breathe like a frail rose.  
You - the clear leg.
