Here I Develop You
------------------
Of myriad plum, spirit  
of the poppies,  
smothered gentleman blood, your kisses  
carry into exile  
and a droplet of wooden, with remnants of the region. And a lethargic dove's lava will inherit you.  
In the morose mane, many guilt traps.  
Sometimes a piece of the wind  
dismantles like a serenity in my toe.  
When the university is full of exiled mouth  
outside trapdoors and clotting guilt river banks  
and the fatherless bird feathers and the defenders  
at last give forth their frightened granule.  
  
The gleaming nature gave it honor.  
You've asked me what the iguana is making there with his sunburst orange mouth?  
I reply, the productivity knows this.  
It was the night of the jaguar.  
You see arm as profound as the snow.  
It was the sunrise of the bird.  
Pure noise refreshes the goblets and you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
appreciate of awes and kiss  
and the scrupulous jars of his native land?  
What blazing corals -  
the night is filled with it,  
friendships for the sea water and the insatiable diamond.  
A loaf of bread baked with burned-out joy and salt.  
  
Shut out and shut up like a circus.  
A deep brown flower awakens.
