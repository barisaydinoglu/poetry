Since The Beginning Of Loathing
-------------------------------
In the first take, the humble fisherman  
is undulated by a pioneer. In the second  
scene he returns, to swim and to swim. A chorus of elephants at sunrise un trod un lunged  
comes to a halt before a root.  
A point of view for image is the lack thereof.  
Around yellow water and opaque sepia doves.  
But I should be untrue to photography, smearing among its wet-winged fountains  
so let us try to tell a story without neutral redundancies.  
  
What plumed silences -  
the jungle is filled with it,  
apples for the essence and the tear stained silicon.
