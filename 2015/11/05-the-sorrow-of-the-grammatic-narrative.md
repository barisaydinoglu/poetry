The Sorrow Of The Grammatic Narrative
-------------------------------------
A blazing rug making a sensual thing of a impossible meeting with a cousin. It's a protecting form of rotten stumps.  
Where hats meet  
faucets meet, within and around and the sound  
of receptacles, to reach out and magnify in confusion.  
  
A loaf of bread baked with pale love and salt.
