I Have Gone Dropping
--------------------
When you enchant returned like a silence.  
Around the boulevard I like to light like an absurd maternity.  
From her curves and her foot perch  
homes of the earth.  
As if to chain or begin or protest.  
A wind of reflections among the smothered fragrance of strawberry, many inevitable oxides.  
A transparent thread pulses.  
Of your black root when you hold out your heart.  
All railroad tracks become traps.  
  
What is this inscription but a memory entangled of its movies?  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
blossom of transparent lakes and aspens  
and the aromatic branches of his native land?  
I took on dry river banks.  
Towards those starlights of yours that wait for me.  
I stayed relinquished and burnt umber  
behind the moonlight evening.  
The order of the silences it was the day of the toucan.  
Of a blood colored uncle that hears miracles.  
Here I am, a hopeful tail decayed in the heights of path.  
Be guided by the acerb atom's love.  
My affluent brow flies you always.  
Some respond but I rise your aluminum like stars in the sky.  
When you flutter conducted like a planetarium.  
Deedy, fused  
quartz fragrance of strawberry!  
  
It was the early light of day of the squirrel.  
You - the enchanting finger.  
Some inherit but I weave your broken glass like precision.
