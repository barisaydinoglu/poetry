Moonlit Theories Of Evening Stars
---------------------------------
Where times meet  
smooth stones meet, among and in front of and the sound  
of lampreys, to reach out  
and circumscribe in embarassement.  
Halfway.  
In the first scene, the cosmic stranger  
is foreboded by a goddess. In the second  
reel he returns,  
to circumscribe and to awaken.  
The eternity imposes nessecity.  
What is this signal but a memory electrified of its currents?  
I could transform city, violence, and vagina  
from momenta and productivities  
with a dark dew  
with corpses in my  
brain.  
Of a turqoise son that preserves trousers.
