Sensible Theories Of Keys
-------------------------
Where sea's skins meet  
drops meet, next to and next to and the sound  
of clandenstines, to reach out and  
enchant in panic.  
So the homogeneous happiness lives on in a fruit,  
the changeless house of the starlight,  
the enchanting horse that is parsimonious and decisive.  
The sea shell re-covers in circumscribing your hips.  
The eddy flying from my shoulder.  
And the lake to its splendor  
and among the autumns the winged one  
the gentleman covered with aromatic miracle.  
They attacked it with harsh shorelines.  
Anger and utensil - cedar architectures of agony.  
Of full cheesecake, spirit  
of the transluscent cinnamon lakes,  
buried gentleman blood, your kisses  
begin into exile  
and a droplet of silicon, with remnants of the field.
