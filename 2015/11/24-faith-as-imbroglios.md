Faith As Imbroglios
-------------------
Blue twisting lonely roads of self-production,  
sepia seams above a windy writing.  
Anger and sea's skin - utensils of panic.  
Of your dark ritual when you hold out your breath.  
Not the green moment  
when the sunset lives the laminated signs.  
Always  
you entangle through the sunrise  
toward the lunchtime mourning threads.
