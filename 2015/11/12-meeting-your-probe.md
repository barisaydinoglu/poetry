Meeting Your Probe
------------------
For a day, maybe twenty-seven,  
I rested under a uncomfortable turbulence  
at a post office, waiting for the giant to be in.  
I could perform stalactite, violence, and funeral  
from perfumes and smooth sand  
with a turqoise soul  
with nougats in my mouth.  
The starlight plan that has everyone neurotic.  
Realized original momentum it was the holiday of the iguana.  
The clay blazing cities are wiped.  
A line segment around a square,  
the lonely workings of friendly law.  
You crystallize in the field as in an aquatic room.  
Protected and then heard in the university.  
  
It was the holiday of the bird.  
Come with me to the dung of uranus.  
Bitter gentlemen and gentlemen.  
For me they are public.  
To drink lost hats and for mirrors.  
I stayed refreshed and crimson  
among the room. When you love like landscape circumscribed by the ice.  
A hairy phenomenon harasses  
even the great  
individual region in camera  
to which the metaphor  
will  
not be entertained.  
I do not penetrate in the boulevard of imperalist vagina.  
So the manly decency lives on in a banana,  
the original house of the branch,  
the profound jar that is fleeting and arcane.
