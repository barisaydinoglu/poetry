The Deluding Of A Mother Down A Moonlight Evening
-------------------------------------------------
If I could reconcile the death and the field.  
In my area at afternoon you are like a circus  
and your form and colour the way I rise them.  
Within the green breath of the lava.  
Enjoy the many motionless attempts to perch  
the sensible lightning.  
There is absorbant fortune in breathing it.  
A loaf of bread baked with smothered sincerity and salt.  
A senile computer impales  
even the affluent  
minor universe in detail  
to which the metaphor  
will not be pulsed.  
  
And a nauesous wine bottle's clay will trust you.  
Pass me and let my substance stand.
