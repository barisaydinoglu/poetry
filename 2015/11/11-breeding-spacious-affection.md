Breeding Spacious Affection
---------------------------
For a day, maybe million,  
I rested under  
a pillow of fog  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the lady to be among.  
There are no lards but wayside cycles of mane and blue  
foliages of original fire-tipped metal.  
But the echo understood the memory.  
Lived and then made in the moonlight evening.  
Callous goddesses and ones.  
For me they are slightest.  
In the first reel, the fresh god  
is dismantled by a one. In the second  
take he returns, to attract and to seize.  
Nothing but your somber eyelids.
