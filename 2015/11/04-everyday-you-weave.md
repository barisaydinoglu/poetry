Everyday You Weave
------------------
What is this production but a memory erupted of its alcoves?  
The lunchtime aspens you in its mortal water.  
The fountains exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
next to it in darkness.  
Only mechanical and to a  
man they take on time, twenty-seven years  
I'm the child to the fragrance of strawberry of immediate sweetnes.  
I salute your clear sugar  
and envy your delicate pride.  
The droplet connecting from my leg.  
An odor has developed against the ritual,  
a mixture of bloody feather and body, a showering  
essence that brings sorrow.  
Which is a mineral light of directions  
thousand or too few to count, began  
on a stars in the sky or in the wide cactus  
directions of the nose, a calculation in your brains.  
A imperalist technique loiters  
even the somber  
Neutral divisions in image  
to which the metaphor  
will not be promised.  
You reflect my lewd funeral  
like a promising squirrel to fresh peach.  
If I could recover the nail and the archipeligos.  
Among the gray agony of the cubicle.  
The ship petrifies, the railroad track of lovely  
wakes around.  
  
Seeking toward the tiger a image for machine is the lack thereof.  
A branch focuses its dream of a ending, its ending, the ending of the evening star order -  
its naked conspirators.  
I want you to make on my lip.  
I stayed enchanted and cinnamon  
in the middle of the moonlight evening.  
Fear and pencil - wreaths of fear.  
Of a red mother that awakens lands.  
The land within hers  
a tale we divulge in passing,  
with notions of honor  
and a passion for oceanography and mountaineering
