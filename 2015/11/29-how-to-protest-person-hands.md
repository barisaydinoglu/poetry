How To Protest Person Hands
---------------------------
Where promises meet  
miracles meet, inside and around and the sound  
of vortices, to reach out and enchant in confusion.  
A current of delicious rose  
that does not know why it flows and wakes.  
Always you pity through the afternoon  
toward the day smothering necklaces.  
In the smallest cedar ship I salute your resplendent wine  
and envy your boundless pride.  
From pillow of fog to unrelenting rain,  
hidden cathedrals drawn by free channels, a  
forceful moon begins to wet.  
And angels and rituals.  
Nothing but that sweetnes of bells.
