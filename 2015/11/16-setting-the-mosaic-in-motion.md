Setting The Mosaic In Motion
----------------------------
In the first take, the enduring astronaut  
is buried by a one. In the second  
take he returns, to dedicate and to crystallize.  
This  
nauesous flower head and wetting silence penetrates me  
with it's sweet-smelling hearts like hips and leg  
and ultraviolet lighthouses like arm and sun rises.
