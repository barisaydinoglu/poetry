Harsh Breakfast

In the face of so many corpses to positivity. You are the melancholy giant of a cat,  
the cold ness of the wheatfield, the power of the lightning. With the ultraviolet illusion of the moth.

there in the rotten archipeligos.  
When it looked me with its enduring blue car eyes  
it had neither tail nor brain  
but ceramic peaces on its sides.
