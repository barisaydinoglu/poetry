Ones Of A Putrid Country
------------------------
In my boulevard at early light of day you are like a starlight  
and your form and colour the way I perfume them.  
Realized charitable key they struck it with skeleton muscles.  
  
Return on the bloody feathers that wait for you  
coagulating the whirlwinds of chairs, filtering the doors. Nothing but that shoreline of drops.  
You've asked me what the toucan is recovering there with his blue mouth?  
I reply, the blue lake knows this.
