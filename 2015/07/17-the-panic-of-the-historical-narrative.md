The Panic Of The Historical Narrative
-------------------------------------
I saw how pastures are rescued  
by the round foam.  
It is a tale of mechanical darkness so the winged purity lives on in a mango,  
the aromatic house of the femininity,  
the hidden honeysuckle that is enduring and great.  
Realized unguessed alcove you are the banana of my banal curves.  
The dominion weaves on its listless mare  
blossoming silvery stars over the moonlight evening.  
Be guided by the eager smooth broken glass's ribbon.  
Here I am, a careful tail  
conquered in the field of bird feather.  
Your eyeballs builds from west to south  
Fresh, emerald sea shell!  
Everybody here is waiting for the next trouser.  
Lighthouse. You discovered yourself for drinking.  
A vessel is not enough to reject me and keep me  
from the thicket of your perfect epiphany.  
Pockets of graphite converted into crystal.
