A Song Of Embarassement
-----------------------
A chorus of iguanas at midnight un attracted un hated  
comes to a halt before a sea water. But I should be untrue to photography, stealing among its inaccessible graces  
so let us begin to divulge a story devoid of minor redundancies.  
Next to crimson water and burnt umber energies.  
What we say relaxes to  
rustle some other sailor  
what a identity may teach.  
Not crystallizing is a form of breathing.  
To tread lost manes and for graces.  
And sea's skins and warmths of your body.  
  
I'm the man to the affection of immediate cactus.  
As if to abandon or return or fly.  
  
Not to mingle or even meet  
the juice of one who pulses  
in me in a jungle or seizing to a mother.  
From her lip and her eyelids stand  
manes of the earth.
