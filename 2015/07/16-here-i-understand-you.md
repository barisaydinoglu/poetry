Here I Understand You
---------------------
It's a divulging film of imbroglios. Like the lonely ash of mosaics our new stars in the sky, our trusting defender loops.  
Brings all the hates angels.  
The difficult curtain is esoteric on your finger.  
Enrich on the twisting lonely roads that wait for you  
erupting the bitten chairs, deforming the doors.  
The bomb enchants on its bruised mare  
expanding transparent acrobats over the sea.  
Imbuing the moon of her coral full of purity.  
Full stop.  
  
My heart moves from being dead to being electrical.  
So the aquatic felicity lives on in a mango,  
the rosy house of the old warrior's medal,  
the eloquent apple that is eloquent and sweet-smelling.  
My heart is filled with respect like a diamond miracle.  
What absent minded fleshes  
-  
the boulevard is filled with it,  
flower heads for the bird feather and the insufferable saphire.  
Return to the homeland of the wells.  
The chimney in front of hers  
a history we speak in passing,  
with notions of honor  
and a passion for jouranlism and  
mountaineering  
a fog of wine bottles you drink my rabid hole  
like a changeless turkey  
to fresh cheesecake.
