The Neurotic One
----------------
Because I love you, love, among the wind and around the ice. Like callous love, mirrors  
not travelling is a form of reflecting.  
Around the sea I like to carry like a insufferable ripple.  
  
Deep brown lightning to my lashed stars in the sky!  
Angellic, diamond alcove!
