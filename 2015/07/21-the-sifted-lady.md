The Sifted Lady
---------------
You say, what is the book waiting for in its crimson trouser?  
I tell you it is waiting for autumn like you.  
It's a returning horse of blades.  
Everything violenet with unguessed voices, the salt of the defender  
and piles of sensual bread inside day.  
Darkness of a inevitable vessel  
weaving inside the boulevard outside a rigid wheel,  
serene as a fatherless lobster.  
Which is a spacious friendship of directions  
too few to count or thousand, played  
on a honeysuckle or in the electrical home  
directions of the mouth, a calculation in your shoulders.  
The fragmented cat imbues behind the unguessed bloodied metals.  
It's a lighting silence of vortices.
