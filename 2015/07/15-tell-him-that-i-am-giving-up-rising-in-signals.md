Tell Him That I Am Giving Up Rising In Signals
----------------------------------------------
Of a brimstone mother that relaxes splendors.  
The earth free corruptions are loitered.  
Pockets of metal converted into silken.  
Sailor of the depths of my curves - your expanding  
stills your eager regard as though it were clay.  
Conversations of trees, the recitation  
of serendipities we call poetic path.  
A loaf of bread baked with pale love and salt.  
Agony and form - silences of beligerance.  
How magnifying is the serene lineage and it's comfortable funerals?  
I'm the daughter to the promise of immediate flower head.  
Aromatic empire. The circle functions to pulse a system  
to its system.  
  
A current of enduring ripple  
that does not know why it flows and lives.  
Lonely wombs and bruised rotten stumps.  
  
If you were not the apple the equinoctial moon  
cooks, sprinkling its cheesecake across the land.  
Where flags meet  
waves meet, in front of and within and the sound  
of clefts, to reach out and wet in confusion.
