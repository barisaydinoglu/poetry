An Equally Angellic Uncle
-------------------------
For hoove was morbid and morally neutral.  
The guitars exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
outside it in darkness.  
Sincerity is gone, the subject has performed.  
Multitude of evening stars!  
In and out of the yellow the sand-colored and the transluscent blue  
The fleeting sailor  
imbues in the stationary morning.  
And so that its throats will entangle your shoulder.  
How carrying is the serene wall and it's incredulous vagabonds?  
In the smallest bolt of cedar fountain which is a vertical quilt of directions  
too few to count or thousand, magnified  
on  
a fountain or in the self-assured telegraph  
directions of the hand, a calculation in your fingers. Velvety, crystal drop!  
Inside the divisions like sand.
