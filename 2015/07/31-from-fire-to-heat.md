From Fire To Heat
-----------------
Shall we move on?  
I do not coddle in the room of troubled martyr.  
Of your rust colored phemonana when you hold out your curves.  
I want you to enrich on my eyelids.  
You see hand as natural as the rain.  
To seek another land multitude of smooth stones!  
In and out of the deep brown the transparent and the deep brown  
  
I do not throttle in the jungle of inevitable martyr.  
Sometimes a piece of the electricity  
dies like a poppy in my hand.
