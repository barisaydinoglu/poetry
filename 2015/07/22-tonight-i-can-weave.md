Tonight I Can Weave
-------------------
I wish to make a loop  
around, and every sight, many  
times hidden in a laminated sign.  
Your foot awakens from west  
to east  
I am coagulated by fragrance of strawberry and serection, by stench and mist.  
In your arm of anger the land of landscapes weave.  
  
Here I am, a blazing foot brainwashed in the universe of warmth.  
The nature abolishes, the coral of spacious  
loves in.
