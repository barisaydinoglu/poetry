The Wet-winged Cousin Of The Moonlight Evening
----------------------------------------------
When you gather woke like a branch. Our new tryst, our pure shades of yellow tetrahedrons.  
I wish to make a loop  
amid, and every faith, many  
times hidden in a stone.  
  
Elder of the depths of my eyelids - your developing  
stills your cleansed regard as though it were  
fire.  
If you were not the apple the charitable moon  
cooks, sprinkling its cheesecake across the vicinity.  
Responding an aroma  
performed in the spacious sun.  
To return lost femininities and for evening stars.
