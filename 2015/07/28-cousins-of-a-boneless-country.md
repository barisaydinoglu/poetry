Cousins Of A Boneless Country
-----------------------------
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the resolute sea's skins?  
And the sunshine rosy splattering its droplets and plaguing them full of  
region and  
toucan?  
Draw from it the atrocious  
camera of its own calculation.  
Of gleaming peach, spirit  
of the roses,  
passed mountaineer blood, your kisses  
weave into exile  
and a droplet of chalk, with remnants of the city.  
Sticky weather, disordered lights like the elixir.  
Brings all the imprisons keys.  
Has the modern office been attracted with curiosities?  
  
I was without doubt the cousin squirrel  
there in the calcerous vicinity.  
When it looked me with its mineral utensil eyes  
it had neither heart nor foot  
but  
copper laminated signs on its sides.  
Be guided by the spacious hat's  
light.
