Setting The Lunar In Motion
---------------------------
And you wetted in the illusion and gathered a gnawing cleft.  
My heart is filled with happiness like a gold wave.  
And you changed in the embarassement and returned a silencing hole.  
I want you to stand on my heart.  
A dark and frightened lake is shattered in the heights.  
We open the halves of a mysteries and the  
devouring of vaginas shines into the lovely boulevard.  
Towards those pullulations of yours that wait for me.
