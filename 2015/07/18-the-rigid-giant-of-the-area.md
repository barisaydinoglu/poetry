The Rigid Giant Of The Area
---------------------------
A current of wonderful branch  
that does not know why it flows and lights.  
What is this language but a memory overflowed of its bells?  
Towards those essences of yours that wait for me.  
Towards those books of yours that wait for me.  
You see tail as silent  
as the sunshine.  
I was without doubt the pioneer toucan  
there in the frightened moonlight evening.  
When it looked me with its starry fellowship eyes  
it had neither eyelids nor nose  
but silicon bells on its sides.  
Purity is gone, the subject has swam.  
A prize pulsing will circumscribe  
the violenet wind of a planet.  
I stayed protected and opaque cinnamon  
outside the archipeligos.  
My decisive fingernails rescues you always.
