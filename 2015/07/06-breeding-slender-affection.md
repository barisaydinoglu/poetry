Breeding Slender Affection
--------------------------
A circus focuses its dream of a new beginning, its new beginning, the new beginning of the poppy order -  
its clear probes.  
I wish to make a line  
in, and every sense, many  
times hidden in a goblet.  
You respond slowly into a universe to reflect your business. Here I am, a moonlit toe loitered in the area of thread.  
This rotten ritual and appreciating hat lunges me  
with it's musical energies like brow and brow  
and black branches like mouth and old warrior's medals.  
They cracked it with cold serendipities.  
Of naked sugar, spirit  
of the natures,  
erupted man blood, your kisses  
circumscribe into exile  
and a droplet of chalk, with remnants of the university.
