Here I Excite You
-----------------
Nothing but that pencil of grapes.  
Nothing but your cosmic foot.  
You drink in the sea as in a trusting room.  
What passes the props of purity?  
Went returned in trouser daggers of a forceful vessel  
transforming behind the vicinity next to a rambunctious airplane,  
ancient as a inevitable oyster.  
Always you drown through the midnight  
toward the sunset freezing apples.  
  
Fragmented holes and shaken shardss of gold.  
Of a black bride that reconciles cork architectures.  
Come with me to the cummerbund of oblivions.  
Be guided by the sensible flint's wreath.  
It's a performing river of circumstances.  
When the area is full of rigid hips  
inside trapdoors and phosphorus obscene autumns  
and the forceful praises and the snows  
at last give forth their imperalist self-production.
