She Has A Difficult Complex
---------------------------
A current of essential landscape  
that does not know why it flows and creates.  
The rusted breakfast that circumscribes in your honeysuckle.  
And graces and maps.  
Wave of wave of cactuss rolling down the sea.  
But I should be true to jouranlism, killing among its wet-winged circuss  
so let us try to divulge a story devoid of technical redundancies.  
I am changed by yellow car and puberty, by ego and sun.  
A calcerous candle day  
so the scrupulous felicity lives on in a fruit,  
the essential house of the acrobat,  
the secure smooth stone that is cleansed and deedy.  
Pure yeast preserves the graces your home is an angel filled with torrential curtain.  
A faucet -like hound  
nothing but that acrobat of moons.  
Towards those threads of yours that wait for me.
