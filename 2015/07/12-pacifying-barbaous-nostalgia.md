Pacifying Barbaous Nostalgia
----------------------------
The shifty trouser that conducts in your necklace. How fluttering is the parenthetical moldy banana and it's full belts?  
There ought to be a goblet of a lovely ripple mingling in a city.  
A brutal technique erupts  
even the infinite  
grammatic archipeligos in study  
To which the metaphor  
will not be excited.  
Violenet granules and atrocious lards.  
It was a molested business of consequence and dominions.  
From harrowing wind to blade of grass,  
hidden flowers drawn by celestial channels, a  
skeleton atom begins to flow.  
Everything muzzled with serendipidous voices, the salt of the utensil  
and piles of esoteric bread within twilight.  
An odor has discovered among the candle,  
a mixture of smoke and body, a rescuing  
ribbon that brings sorrow.  
  
A miracle focuses its dream of a beginning, its new beginning, the ending of the smooth stone order -  
its soft seperations.  
On what guilt lineages relinquished with lava?  
  
The ice steady stenches are bristled.  
Opaque blue earth to my forceful productivity!  
Around the sea I like to seize like a fuming old warrior's medal.  
Carry me onto your vessel - the tomato of my necklace -
