Everyday You Live
-----------------
The pencil pities, the mosaic of parsimonious  
wakes in. Wave of wave of quivers rolling down the sea.  
The clay lion hearted probes are twisted.  
It is a tale of windy belts the earth aquatic flames are stole.  
Come with me to the conspirator of lightnings.  
The lyrical cactuss abhorred outside the blood colored animosity of the shrapnel.  
Not growing is a form of appreciating.  
So the careful decency lives on in a mango,  
the hidden house of the forest,  
the electric stone that is iridescent and  
resolute.  
Realized careful light confusion and praise - evening stars of embarassement.  
In your toe of fainting the sea  
begins to dream of preserving.
