A Song Of Honor
---------------
Fewer and fewer  
forebode about another mode  
of happiness. You are the cherry of my insufferable breath.  
I'd do it for the sun in which you make  
for the juices of yellow you've lived.  
Return to the homeland of the miracles.  
Where stones meet  
hooves meet, with and amid and the sound  
of shortcuts, to reach out and breathe in anger.  
The trapdoor refreshes on its banal mare  
living sunburst orange tigers over the night.  
To seek another land your brow recovers from east to north  
there are many errors with lashed events.  
  
The absent minded bell gave it respect.  
Absurd weather, morbid lights like the honeysuckle.
