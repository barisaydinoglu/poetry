Distorted Burnt Umber Lake
--------------------------
In the insufferable region of insufferable telegraph. You say, what is the coral waiting for in its sand-colored door?  
I tell you it is  
waiting for silvery car like you.  
And meetings of lethargic eye when you wake set like a flag.  
The jungle in front of hers  
a story we divulge in passing,  
with notions of pride  
and a passion for jouranlism and oceanography  
I wish to make a square  
with, and every sight, many  
times hidden in a peace.
