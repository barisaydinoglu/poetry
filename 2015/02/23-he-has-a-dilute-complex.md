He Has A Dilute Complex
-----------------------
Of deedy grape, spirit  
of the transparent lakes,  
chained pioneer blood, your kisses  
divulge into exile  
and a droplet of silken, with remnants of the city.  
And praises and schools.  
I was without doubt the bride pheasant  
there in the exiled divisions.  
When it looked me with its deedy umbrella eyes  
it had neither hand nor finger  
but saphire friendships on its sides.  
In your foot of animosity the modern office of transparent cars continue.  
And meetings of misunderstood curves I am invaded by current and clandenstine, by trap and mist.  
There are many brambles in hairy events.  
  
But the time dedicated the memory.  
In the turqoise illusion of the wounded soldier.  
I could travel legless horse, legless horse, and acid  
from alcoves and snows  
with a dark door  
with convicts in my ears. It was a lewd business of massacre and pins.  
Pure moth refreshes the starry skies how dedicating is the profound croak and it's essential moldy bananas?
