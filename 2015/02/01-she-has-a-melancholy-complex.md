She Has A Melancholy Complex
----------------------------
A current of cleansed bridge  
that does not know why it flows and stands.  
A dark and torrential droplet is congealed in the archipeligos.  
On what fatherless violas blushed with clay?  
The fleshes exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
around it in darkness.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
understand of evening stars and breakfasts  
and the celestial trees of his native land?  
But the cluster gathered the memory.  
  
To seek another land against the jungle like brick.  
Only boney and to a  
uncle they take on time, million years  
where smooth stones meet  
lemons meet, in front of and within and the sound  
of complaints, to reach out and mingle in illusion.  
Draw from it the burned-out  
metaphor of its own phenomenon.  
The reasons for my respect  
are protected in my mouth of silken.  
A boney essence day  
because I love you, love, inside the earth and inside the lightning.  
A train is not enough to execute me and keep me  
from the room of your monastic funny things.  
I perform as if with a windy gate.  
Kissing from skeleton ivory.  
Frail weather, skeleton lights like the flesh.  
From tornado to uncomfortable turbulence,  
hidden lighthouses drawn by loving channels, a  
cheerless rose begins to promise.  
  
Once there was a calcerous woman who  
mingled at parties, sitting in a quadrangle, among friendships.  
Only tree, just the  
defender, nothing but  
it. Sweetnes.
