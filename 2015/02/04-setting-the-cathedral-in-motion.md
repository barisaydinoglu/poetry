Setting The Cathedral In Motion
-------------------------------
A candle -like alarm  
and you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
entertain of starlights and awes  
and the delicious atoms of his native land?  
I was without doubt the elder ostrich  
there in the sterile field.  
When it looked me with its warm momentum eyes  
it had neither heart nor nose  
but silken laws on its sides.  
What is this study but a memory cracked of its ivory architectures?  
My heart moves from being burned-out to being celestial.  
The heights among hers  
a history we divulge in passing,  
with notions of purity  
and a passion for engineering and oceanography  
what we say protects to  
carry some other gentleman  
what a camera may teach.  
From her tail and her heart store  
writings of the earth.  
For a day, maybe too few to count,  
I rested under a pillow of fog  
at a post office, waiting for the elder to be behind.  
Seeking from bitter cork.  
Astronaut of the depths of my eyeballs - your divulging  
stills your fleeting  
regard as though it were fire.  
I took on  
bruised farms.  
  
Be guided by the blazing friendship's  
mosaic.  
How inheriting is the hidden dust and it's moonlit alarms?  
Not the sepia moment  
when the late afternoon re-covers the stones.  
The poetic pullulations fell and you petrified in the embarassement and sought  
a twisting trap.  
A calcerous point of view executes  
even the mineral  
public chimney in machine  
to which the metaphor  
will not be gathered.
