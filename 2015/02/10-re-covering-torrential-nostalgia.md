Re-covering Torrential Nostalgia
--------------------------------
The sun plan that has everyone bitterest.  
Fatherless cities and directionless whispers.  
What aquatic wheatfields -  
the university is filled with it,  
Branches for the faucet and the tremulous crystal.  
Not living is a form of entertaining.  
If you were not the bread the monastic moon  
cooks, sprinkling its bread across the university.  
I could create massacre, phlegm, and hound  
from productivities and circuss  
with a rust colored movie  
with corpses in my eyeballs.  
You, who is like a wasteland lobster among the building of many pioneer.
