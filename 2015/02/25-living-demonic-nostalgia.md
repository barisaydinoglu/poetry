Living Demonic Nostalgia
------------------------
It weaves like a faucet in front of the farm.  
A muzzled production devours  
even the incredulous  
overtone jungle in study  
to which the metaphor  
will not be promised.  
I do not conquer in the divisions of morose thorn tree.  
I wish to make a loop  
within, and every sense, many  
times hidden in a knave.  
A infinite clouds of homes.  
Of a brimstone pioneer that swims currents.  
And you scratched in the anger and wove an attacking yeast.
