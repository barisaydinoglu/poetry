I Have Gone Perching
--------------------
Carry  
me onto your ship - the orange of my umbrella -  
against the guilt moonlight evening of frail pasture.  
On what obscene abyss played with lightning?  
Of angellic wine, spirit  
of the homes,  
pampered child blood, your kisses  
relax into exile  
and a droplet of glass, with remnants of the moonlight evening.  
  
A windy quilt day  
and around my hammock, during the night, I woke up naked  
and full of happiness.  
Of a gray cousin that reconciles sea's skins.  
Towards those faucets of yours that wait for me.  
Always you mourn through the holiday  
toward the holiday cracking sun rises.
