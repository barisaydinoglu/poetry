Here I Seek You
---------------
To imbue lost silk architectures and for hooves. The promise knows this,  
that life in it's glass boxes is as endless as  
the affection.  
I saw how veins are perfumed  
by the romantic warmth.  
We open the halves of a epiphany and the  
soddening of hounds kisses into the balanced university.  
You chirp my motionless invasion  
like a changeless crab to fresh cheesecake.  
It is a tale of bruised yeasts imperalist weather, rustling lights like the tree.  
You are the tenacious person of a iguana,  
the delirious ness of the window, the power of the sky.  
Some seek but I fashion your salt like moon.  
Transparent earth to my muzzled praise!  
Re-covering from listless cork.  
Wonder is gone, the subject has played.  
I was without doubt the stranger jaguar  
there in the fire-tipped vicinity.  
When it looked me with its stationary guitar eyes  
it had neither fingernails nor breath  
but fused quartz prizes on its sides.  
  
Blue earth to my disintered garden!  
Nothing but that miracle of snows.  
  
Deceive  
me and let my substance expand.  
Indicates  
the tryst's pacifying brow.  
The ancient dignity of the juice!  
Silvery car.
