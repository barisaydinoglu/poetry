Among Of Dew And Telegraph
--------------------------
In your curves of animosity the boulevard of smooth stones gallop.  
What coagulates the props of respect?  
  
The trusting dignity of the current!  
You perform headlong into a vicinity to build your business.  
Transluscent silvery alarms of vinegar,  
opaque marine seams above a inaccessible circus.  
Domestic empire. The circle functions to perfume a system  
to its system.  
I could perform city, saliva, and trash barge  
from railroad tracks and flints  
with a rust colored flint  
with evils in my hand.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the warm fellowships?  
And the clouds lovely splattering its femininities and deluding them full of  
heights and ostrich?
