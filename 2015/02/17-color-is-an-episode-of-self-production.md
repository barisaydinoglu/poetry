Color Is An Episode Of Self-production
--------------------------------------
Behind the heights like sand.  
Of eager grape, spirit  
of the roses,  
fainted custodian blood, your kisses  
crystallize into exile  
and a droplet of chalk, with remnants of the jungle.  
You've asked me what the oyster is imbuing there with his blue leg?  
I reply, the movie knows this.  
Silvery and soft father,  
Like the fragmented sand of movies you say, what is the pullulation waiting for in its blue starlight?  
I tell you it is waiting for warmth like you.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
dawn of bridges and rivers  
and the free threads of his native land?  
Towards those quivers of yours that wait for me.  
Stranger of the depths of my leg - your performing  
stills your self-assured regard as though it were earth.  
There are no lightnings but thirsty cycles of maternity and burnt umber  
mosaics of slender melancholy iron.  
Illusion and lighthouse - promises of embarassement.  
  
My indespensable shoulder flutters you always.  
What is this study but a memory abducted of its peaces?
