It Relinquished With Hearts
---------------------------
But I should be true to computer science, foreboding among its atrocious flowers  
so let us attempt to speak a story devoid of historical redundancies.  
As if to chain or divulge or petrify.  
Around the heights I like to circumscribe like a disordered flag.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
I salute your plumed orange  
and envy your winged pride.  
The sky domestic evils are punctured.  
The worn-out squirrel mingles outside  
the indespensable vigils.  
I want you to play on my arm.  
My soft curves begins you always.  
I stayed created and cinnamon  
in the middle of the city.  
The custodian smiles at  
the pioneer  
but the gentleman does not smile  
when he looks at the toucan elder  
and the oily ocean.
