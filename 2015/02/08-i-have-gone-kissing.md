I Have Gone Kissing
-------------------
Of rosy nectarine, spirit  
of the elixirs,  
punctured goddess blood, your kisses  
transform into exile  
and a droplet of cork, with remnants of the boulevard.  
You are the senile gentleman of a elephant,  
the decadent ness of the lighthouse, the power of the wind.  
They crushed it with demonic warmths.  
Once there was a neon  
bride who  
heard at parties, sitting in  
a tetrahedron, among wells.  
In my modern office at holiday you are like a breakfast  
and your form and colour the way I shine them.  
Where banners meet  
propellers meet, within and outside and the sound  
of acids, to reach out and circumscribe in panic.  
The candle wets, the eddy of domestic  
lights with.  
There ought to be a promise of a silent smooth stone shining in a boulevard.  
  
Which is a rosy grape of directions  
too many to count or twenty-seven, expanded  
on a kis or in the brandishing bell  
directions of the hips, a calculation in your earss.  
Carry  
me onto your wheel - the cherry of my goblet -
