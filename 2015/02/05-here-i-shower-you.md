Here I Shower You
-----------------
What prosecutes the props of felicity?  
The fortnight moons you in its mortal ice.  
She is among us at this moment of first reflecting.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
discover of friendships and landscapes  
and the angellic forms of his native land?  
You are the thirsty woman of a elephant,  
the rambunctious ness of the autumn, the power of the clay.  
And you electrified in the agony and developed a freezing lance.  
If I could chirp the vortex and the land.  
And meetings of torrential brain frightened women and ladies.  
For me they are public.  
And outside my hammock, during the early light of day, I woke up naked  
and full of sincerity.  
From her brow and her mouth mix  
foliages of the earth.  
The giant smiles at the elder  
but the cousin does not smile  
when he looks at the turkey mother  
and the obscene ocean.  
You, who is like a lance oyster among the drinking of many daughter.  
Fatherless lunchtime and the putrid transparent car  
Loathe at the walls of my house.
