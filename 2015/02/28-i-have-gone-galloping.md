I Have Gone Galloping
---------------------
In the face of so many extinctions to functionality.  
I stayed fluttered and burnt umber  
outside the region.  
A foam -like lamprey  
the I in productivity from tornado to ray of sunlight,  
hidden deep brown lakes drawn by honest channels, a  
chaotic serendipity begins to create.  
Here I am, a changeless ears deprived in the chimney of awe.  
As if to deform or flutter or plague.  
A irreducable clouds of umbrellas.  
  
You are the orange of my nauesous lip.  
In your fingernails of fainting the modern office begins to dream of refreshing.  
What we say kisses to  
divulge some other man  
what a camera may teach.  
Come with me to the funeral of howls.  
Outside the red illusion of the whisper.  
The ivory architecture wets in pulsing your eye.  
Always you chain through the night  
toward the twilight invading silences.  
Moonlit empire. The triangle functions to recover an architecture  
to its environment.
