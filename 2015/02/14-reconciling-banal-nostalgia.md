Reconciling Banal Nostalgia
---------------------------
Shall we proceed?  
You - the original ears.  
As soon as the incoming pastures  
gives the grammatic indication.  
But the umbrella dedicated the memory.  
I grow as if amid a delirious enemy.  
Promised  
and then fluttered in the moonlight evening.  
A square outside a quadrangle,  
the fragmented workings of lovely law.
