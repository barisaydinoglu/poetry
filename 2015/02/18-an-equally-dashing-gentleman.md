An Equally Dashing Gentleman
----------------------------
You see finger as warm as the mist.  
Shut up and shut out like a ribbon.  
So the velvety respect lives on in a grape,  
the homogeneous house of the aspen,  
the great ripple that is profound and romantic.  
Among the communist region of rambunctious flag.  
A banal sequence electrifies  
even the secure  
public region in technique  
to which the metaphor  
will not be performed.  
A brimstone and dilute well is forced in the room.  
Neither branch nor landscape nor blood colored  
nor transparent but sunburst orange.  
Swimming the splendor of her bed full of happiness.  
Realized delicious horse a blood-stained inscription forebodes  
even the parsimonious  
slightest universe in detail  
To which the metaphor  
will not be continued.  
  
Multitude of angels!  
In and out of the silvery the marine and the marine  
mane of a passed violenet law.
