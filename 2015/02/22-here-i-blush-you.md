Here I Blush You
----------------
Our new sun rise, our equinoctial cathedral tetrahedrons.  
A infinite rug making a wide thing of a likely meeting with a one.  
Return to the homeland of the bells.  
A cleansed wood paneling making a hopeful thing of a unlikely meeting with a gentleman.  
It's an awakening quilt of evils.  
Mixing a transluscent sand-colored lake  
loved in the romantic drizzle.  
The moonlight evening with hers  
a history we divulge in passing,  
with notions of tiredness  
and a passion for photography and oceanography  
within the splendor of the region where you sleep,  
a dream twists into details.  
Where clusters meet  
pastures meet, around and within and the sound  
of salts, to reach  
out and dawn in agony.  
The self-production imposes nessecity.  
A sun of smooth metals pockets of iron converted into emerald.  
  
Neither cluster nor cluster nor dark  
nor yellow but marine.  
In my divisions at late afternoon you are like a root  
and your form and colour the way I enrich them.  
I was without doubt the woman bird  
there  
in the spoiled region.  
When it looked me with its delicious prize eyes  
it had neither breath nor heart  
but bolt of gold alcoves on its sides.  
And the utensil to its productivity  
and among the lighthouses the unguessed one  
the stranger covered with nocturnal old warrior's medal.  
Your heart dawns from south to west  
a phosphorus landscape day  
you are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the affluent pencils?  
And the sunshine enchanting splattering its phemonanas and condemning them full of  
night and turkey?  
But I should be true to computer science, brainwashing among its melancholy jars  
so let us try to speak a story devoid of slightest redundancies.  
Carry me onto your wheel - the mango of my root -  
Closed off and closed off like a wave.  
Inside burnt umber water and marine keys.  
And so that its  
depths will deceive your brow.
