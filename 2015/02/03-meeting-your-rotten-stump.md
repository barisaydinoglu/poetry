Meeting Your Rotten Stump
-------------------------
Draw from it the dry  
language of its own point of view. To the delicious color of the saphire saxophone.  
I wish to make a triangle  
with, and every sight, many  
times hidden in a flag.  
  
Draw from it the hollow  
antenna of its own language.
