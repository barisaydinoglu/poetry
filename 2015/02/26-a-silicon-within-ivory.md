A Silicon Within Ivory
----------------------
Delude me and let my substance wet. A current of loving peace  
that does not know why it flows and connects.  
Recover on the oblivions that wait for you  
smearing the smothered chairs, gnawing the doors.  
Outside the rotten praise, many silent serections.  
A delirious detail steals  
even the charitable  
aerial field in machine  
to which the metaphor  
will not be enchanted.  
I stayed shone and cashmire  
under the vicinity.  
Nothing but that door of bird feathers.  
What mysteries does the oyster contain?  
How little we dawn and how much it carries the curiosities of this computer simulation.  
  
Fluttering toward the tryst only fellowship, just the  
smooth metal, nothing but  
it. Garden.  
I stayed continued and cinnamon  
inside the university.
