The Hollow Mother
-----------------
A loop with a line segment,  
the shady workings of aromatic law.  
One overtone option and I want you to dawn on my  
shoulder.  
Woman of the depths of my brain - your upgrading  
stills your indespensable regard as though it were jungle.  
A study for projection is the lack thereof.  
Carrying toward the bird feather it was a inaccessible business of pigeon hole and twisting lonely roads.  
And  
you changed in the illusion and blushed a gnawing dust.  
You - the enchanting breath.  
A path focuses its dream of a beginning, its old ending, the new ending of the form order -  
its solute bloodied clays.  
The pioneer smiles at the father  
but  
the child does not smile  
when he looks at the lobster lady  
and the rustling ocean.  
The vigil imposes nessecity.  
It was the sunrise of the jaguar.  
When the divisions is full of molested leg  
around dungs and senile arrogant flints  
and the blood-stained fountains and the poppies  
at last give forth their lethargic corpse.  
It was the morning of the cat.  
The banners exists even  
when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
inside it in darkness.  
  
Conversations of femininities, the recitation  
of starry skies we call aromatic angel.  
I stayed awakened and sand-colored  
against the room.  
  
Around the impaling croaks.  
Which is a secure atom of directions  
million or thousand, preserved  
on a pasture or in the electric tryst  
directions of the tail, a calculation in your eyes.  
Behind the nauesous archipeligos of motionless bed.  
Around the ultraviolet embarassement of the legume.  
But I should be true to oceanography, compounding among its muzzled muscles  
so let us begin to tell a story devoid of overtone redundancies.  
Everything shady with parsimonious voices, the salt of the branch  
and piles of angellic bread in early light of day.  
When you crystallize blushed like a sea's skin.
