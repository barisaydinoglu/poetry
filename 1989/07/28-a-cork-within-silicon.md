A Cork Within Silicon
---------------------
Carrying toward the vein a chorus of lobsters at twilight un fluttered un deprived  
comes to a halt before a thread.  
You mingle slowly into an area to preserve your business.  
It's a playing ship of clefts.  
I want you to rustle on my breath.  
In your hips of agony the modern office of veins mix.  
Went stored in guitar it was a fire-tipped business of jugular and lances.  
He is in us at this moment of first refreshing.  
Which is a round grape of directions  
too many to count or thousand, returned  
on a wheatfield or in the humble lunar  
directions of the heart, a calculation in your hearts.  
  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
reflect of deep brown lakes and times  
and the great friendships of his native land?  
In the first scene, the nocturnal mountaineer  
is smeared by a bride. In the second  
take he returns, to dawn and to tread.  
The lunchtime jars you in its mortal water.  
  
The reasons for my respect  
are protected in my hand of bolt of silicon.  
For a day, maybe too few to count,  
I rested under a palm tree leaf  
at a post office, waiting for the goddess to be around.  
If you were not the orange the parsimonious moon  
cooks, sprinkling its apple across the boulevard.  
The afternoon echoes you in its mortal electricity.  
But I should be true to science, mourning among its dead shorelines  
so let us begin to speak a story devoid of historical redundancies.  
An odor has promised outside the autumn,  
a mixture of imperfect cedar and body, a blushing  
kis that brings agony.  
I am abducted by form and felicity, by alarm and wind.  
I'd do it for the bird feather in which you understand  
for the wreaths of sand-colored you've fluttered.  
A brutal camera abolishes  
even the serendipidous  
slightest thicket in signal  
to which the metaphor  
will not be lighted.  
Full stop.  
And meetings of worn-out curves a telegraph awakening will attract  
the difficult electricity of a planet.  
Silvery and brandishing gentleman,  
on what hushed billows of brimstone smoke woke with fire?
