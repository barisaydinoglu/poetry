I Expected Mountaineers
-----------------------
My heart is filled with decency like a copper kiss.  
A bell entertaining will swim  
the morose ice of a planet.  
So the clear purity lives on in a cherry,  
the profound house of the leaf,  
the sensible propeller that is sensual and angellic.  
A current of loving dew  
that does not know why it flows and trusts.
