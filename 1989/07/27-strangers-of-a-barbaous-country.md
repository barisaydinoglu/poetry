Strangers Of A Barbaous Country
-------------------------------
Flowed and then carried in the university.  
What seems disjoint to one will  
not seem so to another.  
On what bleak moths grew with fire?  
The barbaous cat divulges outside the loving eternities.  
  
I am taunted by film and coal, by self-production and drizzle.  
It was the afternoon of the toucan.  
You - the original heart.  
A current of cordial serenity  
that does not know why it flows and pulses.  
I am gnawn by soul and consequence, by viola and drizzle.  
A blood-stained telegraph day  
you are the kiwi of my listless shoulder.  
  
It was the afternoon of the toucan.
