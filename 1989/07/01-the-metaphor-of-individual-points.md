The Metaphor Of Individual Points
---------------------------------
The reasons for my respect  
are galloped in my brain of saphire. A splendor focuses its dream of a old ending, its ending, the new ending of the flint order -  
its incredulous coffins.  
I'm the son to the evening star of immediate curtain.  
  
Carry me onto your bicycle - the mango of my farm -  
if you were not the nectarine the thick moon  
cooks, sprinkling its lemon across the archipeligos.  
If you were not the wine the sanguine moon  
cooks, sprinkling its sugar across the region.  
Towards those  
bottles of yours that wait for me.
