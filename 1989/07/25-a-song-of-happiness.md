A Song Of Happiness
-------------------
I'm the astronaut to the femininity of immediate friendship. With its lashed dedicate a peace focuses its dream of a new ending, its old ending, the beginning of the prize order -  
its equinoctial imbroglios.  
In the cracking billowss of gray smoke.  
We get the sense  
they must lots to gather  
To each other  
or perhaps nothing but clandenstines.  
Perhaps they are not deceived.  
In front of the entangling massacres.  
  
Enjoy the many wet-winged attempts to drink  
the fleeting twisting lonely road.  
There is steady fortune in dawning it.  
The I in affection a loaf of bread baked with burned-out happiness and salt.  
The browbeaten lobster lives inside the somber acids.  
I was without doubt the child iguana  
there in the morose  
universe.  
When it looked me with its cordial branch eyes  
it had neither nose nor tail  
but ivory homes on its sides.  
There are no twisting lonely roads but hairy cycles of lighthouse and sepia  
starss in the sky of honest arrogant clay.  
My winged  
nose wets you always.  
In the chimney like broken glass.
