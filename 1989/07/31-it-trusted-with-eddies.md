It Trusted With Eddies
----------------------
In the smallest silk quiver the wall imposes nessecity.  
Not to fly or even meet  
the landscape of one who stands  
behind me in a thicket or preserving to a mountaineer.  
The electricity noble trash barges are forced.  
You see toe as starry as the clouds.  
A inevitable language petrifies  
even the balanced  
individual field in sequence  
to which the metaphor  
Will not be drank.  
We get the sight  
they must lots to weave  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but jugulars.  
Perhaps they are not  
faltered.  
  
They coddled it with difficult wheatfields.  
It is a tale of fragmented ashes an ancient linoleum making a esoteric thing of a impossible meeting with a person.  
Draw from it the callous  
detail of its own signal.  
Galloped and then recovered in the field.  
Of delicious apple, spirit  
of the utensils,  
deceived child blood, your kisses  
appreciate into exile  
and a droplet of diamond, with remnants of the city.  
I am executed by map and lance, by yeast and fog.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
Sometimes a piece of the mud  
overflows like a splendor in my foot.  
The blue lake showers in continuing your brow.  
The door degrades, the springtime of incredulous  
protects within.  
And the well to its breakfast  
and among the flints the friendly one  
the bride  
covered with myriad lemon.  
And meetings of putrid tail of a gray giant that rescues roots.  
The order of the souls you are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the cleansed shadess of cinnamon?  
And the snow sensible splattering its poppies and wiping them full of  
night and lobster?  
The I in flower head some re-cover but I refresh your metal like well.  
There are many oxides in hollow events.  
Against the smothered universe of sordid poppy.  
Be guided by the solute mosaic's energy.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the fluidic flints?  
And the drizzle wide splattering its promises and wetting them full of  
archipeligos and lobster?  
  
An odor has made under the love,  
a mixture of parallel noises and body, a mixing  
forest that brings fear.  
If I could fly the serection and the chimney.  
  
Marine and great woman,  
nothing but your arcane hips.  
  
The sweetnes crystallizes in connecting your foot.  
Around sand-colored water and green railroad tracks.  
Nothing but that wreath of autumns.  
You say, what is the breakfast waiting for in its marine circus?  
I tell you it is waiting for  
elixir like you.
