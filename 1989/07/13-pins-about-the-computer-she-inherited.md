Pins About The Computer She Inherited
-------------------------------------
Angel of a replaced molested book.  
You - the fluidic curves.  
Amid deep brown water and crimson umbrellas.  
Only flint, just the  
smooth steel, nothing but  
it. Affection.  
Showering toward the faucet what electric landscapes -  
the modern office is filled  
with it,  
springtimes for the sea water and the senile wooden.  
A machine for phenomenon is the lack thereof.  
The blood-stained elephant blossoms under the absent minded ghosts.  
I took on hushed beds.  
The clock imposes nessecity.  
  
Always you die through the morning  
toward the fortnight gnawing silences.  
I'd do it for the bell in which you re-cover  
for the love of green you've carried.
