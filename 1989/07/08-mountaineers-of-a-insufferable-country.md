Mountaineers Of A Insufferable Country
--------------------------------------
I saw how warmths are preserved  
by the naked moon.  
Spoiled daggers and rotten violas.  
You - the celestial eyelids.  
Burnt umber and full one,  
someone here is waiting for the next elixir.  
Utensil. You relinquished yourself for preserving.
