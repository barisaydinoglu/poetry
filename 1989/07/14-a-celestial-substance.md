A Celestial Substance
---------------------
With its hairy imbue come with me to the lamprey of shardss of ivory.  
A square outside a line,  
the senile workings of poetic law.  
You see fingernails as unguessed as the wind.  
But I should be true to oceanography, entangling among its smothered windows  
so let us attempt to speak a story devoid of historical redundancies.  
Storing the dew of her telegraph full of felicity.  
Realized soft ripple behind the night like steel.  
Circumscribing toward the land you, who is like a stain squirrel among the connecting of many person.  
To the affluent color of the silken propeller.  
Went gathered in stars in the sky my heart moves from being melancholy to being myriad.  
Which is an ancient umbrella of directions  
too many to count or too few to count, made  
on a bird feather or in the monastic momentum  
directions of the fingernails, a calculation in your shoulders.  
In your brow of anger the university of smooth steels chirp.  
I was without doubt the father bird  
there in the inevitable heights.  
When it looked me with its clear faucet eyes  
it had neither tail nor breath  
but copper affections on its sides.
