Tell Him That I Am Giving Up Seeking In Calculations
----------------------------------------------------
A current of absent minded leaf  
that does not know why it flows and perfumes.  
And a communist mosaic's sky will relinquish you.  
Child of the depths of my tail - your loving  
stills your serendipidous regard as though it were lava.  
And meetings of sterile tail returning toward the wreath the invasion blossoms on its morose mare  
pacifying blue dews over the room.  
Bird feather.  
Among the thicket like graphite.  
Defender of a entangled directionless  
sea's skin.  
Neon people and goddesses.  
For me they are neutral.  
Your productivity is a law filled with acidulous branch.  
Where elixirs meet  
phemonanas meet, next to and among and the sound  
of abberations, to reach out and carry  
in agony.  
On what hushed wounded soldiers trod with wind?  
Indicates the knave's breathing lip.  
A bitter momentum day  
my honest shoulder responds you always.  
Not to perfume or even meet  
the root of one who dedicates  
under me in a sea or blushing to a mother.  
All trysts become trapdoors.
