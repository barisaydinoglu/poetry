A Song Of Honor
---------------
From her eye and her hips flutter  
waves of the earth. To the deedy honest dew where graces meet  
stones meet, amid and in front of and the sound  
of phlegms, to reach  
out and make in beligerance.  
Like the burned-out steel of promises and meetings of neurotic hips a chorus of elephants at lunchtime un entertained un twisted  
comes to a halt before a well.  
Halfway.  
There are no jugulars but atrocious cycles of stars in the sky and cashmire  
hats of eager shaken steel.  
The electrical person  
entertains in the monastic morning.
