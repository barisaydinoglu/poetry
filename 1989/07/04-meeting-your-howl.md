Meeting Your Howl
-----------------
Bride of the depths of my eyelids - your blossoming  
stills your self-assured regard as though it were earth.  
Explosive twilight and the neon fellowship  
forebode at the walls of my house.  
And so that its massacres will attack your brow.  
As soon as the incoming foams  
gives the side indication.  
In the first take, the vertical mountaineer  
is  
fell by a bride. In the second  
take he returns, to carry and to pulse.  
My angellic lip pulses you always.  
What brainwashes the props of happiness?  
The fountain breathing from my nose.  
  
Excited and then divulged in the heights.  
Careless men and goddesses.  
For me they are neutral.  
  
Enchanting from troubled emerald.  
To the lyrical secure necklace there  
ought  
to be a smooth stone of a fleeting eddy shining in a night.  
But the defender heard the memory.  
Nothing but your natural lip.
