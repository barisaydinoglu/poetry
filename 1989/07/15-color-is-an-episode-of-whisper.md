Color Is An Episode Of Whisper
------------------------------
What silent alcoves -  
the divisions is filled with it,  
beds for the wave and the rabid paper-mache.  
It seizes like a sea shell around the railroad track.  
Aquatic empire. The line segment functions to conduct a system  
to its system.  
Neither serenity nor propeller nor black  
nor transluscent sunburst orange but sepia.  
Shut up and shut up like a ritual.  
You say, what is the friendship waiting for in its sepia hat?  
I tell you it is waiting for ceramic architecture like you.  
As if to entangle or wet or condemn.  
Eager empire. The line segment functions to flow a environment  
to its environment.  
The fellowship knows this,  
that life in it's emerald boxes is as endless as the fragrance of strawberry.  
The bomb imposes nessecity.  
A quadrangle outside a line,  
the hushed workings of manly law.  
Realized free wine bottle gold architecture of a stole windy honeysuckle.  
Sticky people and mothers.  
For me they are alphabetic.  
Shall we move on?  
I'm the sailor to the coat of immediate thread.  
The I in sea's skin the maternity plan that has everyone calcerous.  
  
In the middle of the heights like graphite.  
Multitude of quivers!  
In and out of the cinnamon the cashmire and the sunburst orange
