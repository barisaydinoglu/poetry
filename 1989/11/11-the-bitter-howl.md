The Bitter Howl
---------------
Smear me and let my substance grow.  
Profound, paper-mache sea water!  
Fashioning the ribbon of her essence full of sincerity.  
She is under us at this moment of first weaving.  
The curtain beginning from  
my lip.  
Once there was a raucous daughter who  
trusted at parties, sitting in a quadrangle, among curtains.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the balanced poppies?  
And the thunder absent minded splattering its natures and dropping them full of  
sea and bird?
