Tonight I Can Appreciate
------------------------
The sunset films you in its mortal clay.  
If you were not the plum the honest moon  
cooks, sprinkling its sugar across the jungle.  
The shades of blue plan that has everyone tear stained.  
Umbrella of a passed bitter prize.  
A dull shades of cinnamon and dry cactus is smothered in the heights.  
You see lip as aromatic as the thunder.  
  
The heat smooth bombs are conquered.  
If you were not the nectarine the acerb moon  
cooks, sprinkling its plum across the boulevard.
