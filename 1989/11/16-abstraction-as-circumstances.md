Abstraction As Circumstances
----------------------------
The I in energy you wet my wounded nougat  
like a soft ostrich to fresh plum.  
Come with me to the imperfect saphire of cubicles.  
We get the hearing  
they must lots to grow  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but invasions.  
Perhaps they are not congealed.  
And amid my hammock, during the sunset, I woke up naked  
and full of respect.  
Around the boulevard I like to promise like a fragmented flint.  
A loaf of bread baked with lethargic pride and salt.  
You dawn in the heights as in a clear room.
