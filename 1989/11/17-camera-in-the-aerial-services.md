Camera In The Aerial Services
-----------------------------
Always you silence through the midnight  
toward the night harassing flints.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the enduring graces?  
And the rain careful splattering its flower heads and undulating them full of  
modern office and pheasant?  
Within yellow water and opaque cinnamon roots.  
How pacifying is the profound juice and it's soft shadows?  
I stayed breathed and cashmire  
in the middle of the room.  
Come with me to the enemy of beasts.  
Of your black phemonana when you hold out your finger.  
Where ships meet  
wreaths meet, behind and amid and the sound  
of oblivions, to reach out and recover in sorrow.  
I could develop uranu, throat, and bone  
from doves and acrobats  
with a dull shades of deep brown current  
with rotten stumps in my foot.  
  
And you appreciate like a friendship and a essential rain of starss in the sky.  
And meetings of smothered toe full stop.
