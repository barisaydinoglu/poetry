A Glass Within Paper-mache
--------------------------
Always you twist through the lunchtime  
toward the early light of day harassing burnt umber cars.  
From her shoulder and her eyelids dawn  
lakes of the earth.  
Like the morose aluminum of starss in the sky you've asked me what the elephant is creating there with his deep brown eyeballs?  
I reply, the smooth brick knows this. I'd do it for the current in which you live  
for the echoes of deep brown you've flowed.  
Nothing but that landscape of fleshes.
