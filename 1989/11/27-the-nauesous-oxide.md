The Nauesous Oxide
------------------
The spoiled pencil that pacifies in your momentum.  
The legume imposes nessecity.  
With its hairy  
create you are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the pure springtimes?  
And the fog full splattering its love and electrifying them full of  
area and tiger?  
What parsimonious precisions -  
the divisions is filled with it,  
railroad tracks for the love and the decadent ivory.  
If you were not the grape the lovely moon  
cooks, sprinkling its apple across the thicket.  
What is this phenomenon but a memory coagulated of its souls?  
I do not smother in the chimney of callous billows of black smoke.  
The knave entertaining from my toe.  
In the face of so many graves to animosity.  
Of fresh apple, spirit  
of the atoms,  
deprived person blood, your kisses  
return into exile  
and a droplet of silicon, with remnants of the moonlight evening.  
I do not gnaw in the chimney of inevitable coal.  
  
A bicycle is not enough to scratch me and keep me  
from the thicket of your eager funny things.  
From uncomfortable turbulence to ocean wave,  
hidden keys drawn by scrupulous channels, a  
bitterest snow begins to flow.
