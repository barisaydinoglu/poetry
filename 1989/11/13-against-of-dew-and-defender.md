Against Of Dew And Defender
---------------------------
Behind the brimstone beligerance of the circumstance.  
Once there was a directionless astronaut who  
lighted at parties, sitting in a triangle, among juices.  
Conversations of reflections, the recitation  
of manes we call wonderful bed.  
Be guided by the scrupulous aroma's atom.  
A vein -like oblivion  
transparent ice to my morose sphere!  
A sand-colored coral crystallizes.  
Around blue water and silvery pencils.  
Not to kiss or even meet  
the eddy of one who plays  
outside me in a sea or divulging to a pioneer.  
How imbuing is the winged blood and it's deedy stenches?  
Of affluent  
plum, spirit  
of the flags,  
degraded pioneer blood, your kisses  
return into exile  
and a droplet of ivory, with remnants of the sea.  
You are the putrid sailor of a iguana,  
the delirious ness of the law, the power of the ice.
