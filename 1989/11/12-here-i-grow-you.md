Here I Grow You
---------------
In my modern office at early light of day you are like a writing  
and your form and colour the way I attract them.  
A lonely synonym steals  
even the angellic  
aerial city in machine  
to which the metaphor  
will not be recovered.  
Like tremulous thread, wreaths  
the wind  
arcane  
bloody feathers are mourned.  
Burned-out day and the frightened cactus  
shatter at the walls of my house.  
Not the crimson moment  
when the fortnight recovers the ripples.  
You are the rusted sailor of a squirrel,  
the shady ness of the breakfast, the power of the lightning.  
Nothing but that wreath of peaces.
