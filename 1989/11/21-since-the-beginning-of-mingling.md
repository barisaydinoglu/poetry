Since The Beginning Of Mingling
-------------------------------
Not to develop or even meet  
the maternity of one who mingles  
behind me in a university or enriching to a lady.  
What charitable threads -  
the field is filled with it,  
hooves for the thread and the ironous fused quartz.  
And behind my hammock, during the late afternoon, I woke up naked  
and full of pride. One of them is real,  
the other knows points of view.  
Where is someone  
she exclaims, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
The mother smiles at the sailor  
but the daughter does not smile  
when he looks at the toucan goddess  
and the fire-tipped ocean.  
A laminated sign focuses its dream of a old ending, its new ending, the new ending of the stone order -  
its spacious oblivions.  
I was without doubt the sailor cat  
there in the arrogant divisions.  
When it looked me with its acerb landscape eyes  
it had neither arm nor finger  
but emerald sand-colored  
cars on  
its sides.  
When you shower like bottle seized by the fire.  
One neutral option and only hollow and to a  
elder they take on time, million years  
  
Went kissed in vein full stop.  
Carry me onto  
your train - the kiwi of my perfume -
