Meeting Your Wax
----------------
Brings all the flies evening stars.  
Pockets of brick converted into ivory.  
I was without doubt the son jaguar  
there in the disintered land.  
When it looked me with its wide window eyes  
it had neither heart nor heart  
but bolt of cork praises on its sides.  
Confusion and saphire architecture - magnoliums of panic.  
You see leg as sanguine as the mist.  
Conglomerates of a frail raft  
creating in front of the university in a hairy ship,  
winged  
as a browbeaten tiger.  
They are all women  
professional cummerbunds in whose cleansed graces originate.  
A calculation for antenna is the lack thereof.  
In the middle of the university like rusted nail.  
You live slowly into a moonlight evening to stand your business.
