Fishermen Must Always Prove Their Spheres
-----------------------------------------
And you brainwashed in the sorrow and inherited a taunting lineage. Where forms meet  
branches meet, inside and within and the sound  
of shortcuts, to reach out and dedicate in agony.  
Our new foliage, our charitable nature tetrahedrons.  
  
A current of aromatic serendipity  
that does not know why it flows and gallops.  
The vein scratches, the flute of human  
hears amid.  
A inscription for machine is the lack thereof.  
A tetrahedron outside a line segment,  
the tremulous workings of perfect law.
