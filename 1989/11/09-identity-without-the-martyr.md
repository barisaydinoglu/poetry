Identity Without The Martyr
---------------------------
Multitude of warmths of your body!  
In and out of the blue the cinnamon and the silvery  
with the acrobat of the land where you sleep,  
a dream degrades into phenomena.  
Not living is a form of gathering.  
They are all giants  
professional shadows in whose blazing paths originate.  
The domestic beds crushed but the dew relinquished the memory.
