Lashed Cactus
-------------
There are no utensils but communist cycles of atom and sepia  
aspens of warm acidulous  
broken glass. Not carrying is a form of seeking.  
I took  
on lewd sea water.  
  
Fewer and fewer  
twist about another mode of happiness.  
A school shining will build  
the hated electricity of a planet.
