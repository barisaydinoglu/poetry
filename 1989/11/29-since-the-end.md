Since The End
-------------
I form as if outside an atrocious cadaver.  
Like the calculating aluminum of springtimes and meetings of banal arm this distorted sun and shining precision entangles me  
with it's angellic atoms like arm and heart  
and black prizes like eyelids and tigers.  
Only bed, just the  
warmth of your body, nothing but  
it. Acrobat. The grace storing from my brow.
