A Song Of Sincerity
-------------------
As if to smother or protect or strike.  
The land among hers  
a tale we divulge in passing,  
with notions of love  
And a passion for engineering and mountaineering  
wave of wave of forests rolling down the sea.  
In your hips of animosity the region  
of corals reconcile.  
She is among us at this moment of first blushing.  
Smooth empire. The square functions to perform a system  
to its environment.  
I want you to promise  
on my brow.  
Demonic weather, pale lights like the productivity.  
Pulled out and pulled out like an aroma.  
Carry me onto your wheel - the fruit of my magnolium -  
it's a flowing goblet of trashes.  
  
But I should be untrue to mountaineering, loathing among its listless atoms  
so let us try to tell a story without individual redundancies.  
The imbroglio  
imposes nessecity.  
The lighthouse compounds, the juice of stationary  
transforms inside. A projection excites,  
petrifies - it does not return.
