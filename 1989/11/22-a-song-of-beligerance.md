A Song Of Beligerance
---------------------
But I should be true to photography, striking among its phosphorus old warrior's medals  
so let us try to divulge a story without side redundancies.  
I stayed reconciled and transparent  
against the divisions.  
Return to the homeland of the banners.  
Indicates the phemonana's developing brow.  
A decisive clouds of forms.  
A chorus of oysters at lunchtime un wove un abandoned  
comes to a halt before a key.  
  
Your sphere is a bottle filled with guilt light.  
And lakes and echoes.  
Flute of a trembled bitterest foam.  
To the infinite color of the cork mane.  
Pockets of clay converted into copper.  
Always you overflow through the late afternoon  
toward the sunrise hating currents.  
For dove was raucous and morally negative.  
Acidulous daggers and exiled whispers.  
  
From her foot and her lip mingle  
lunars of the earth.  
Pockets of metal converted into saphire.
