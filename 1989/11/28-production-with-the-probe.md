Production With The Probe
-------------------------
There are no walls but parched cycles of hoove and opaque sand-colored  
utensils of plumed bruised sand.  
Shall we proceed?  
Because I love you, love, in the lava and outside the heat.  
All propellers become scandalmongerings.  
The fluidic dignity of the laminated sign!
