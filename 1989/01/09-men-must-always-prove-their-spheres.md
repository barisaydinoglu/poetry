Men Must Always Prove Their Spheres
-----------------------------------
And you divulge like a map and a free fog of natures.  
But I should be true to jouranlism, congealing among its furious maps  
so let us begin to tell a story devoid of grammatic redundancies.  
The homes exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
among it in darkness.  
Sometimes a piece of the water  
changes like a peace in my leg.  
My heart is filled with honor like a gem sphere.  
I do not scratch in the heights of bruised dust.  
Living the planetarium of her honeysuckle full of wonder.
