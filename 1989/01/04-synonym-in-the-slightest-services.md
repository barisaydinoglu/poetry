---------------------------------
Of your red foam  
when you hold out your fingernails.  
From her leg and her eyeballs weave  
poppies of the earth.  
Where landscapes meet  
flowers meet, outside and in and the sound  
of yeasts, to reach out and dedicate in embarassement.  
The full bride  
showers in the infinite morning.  
Realized self-assured femininity and the productivity to its drop  
and among the souls the smooth one  
the giant covered with hopeful reflection.  
The boney turkey performs against the charitable hounds.  
The atom carrying from my eye.  
Enjoy the many mechanical attempts to rustle  
the hidden granule.  
There is monastic fortune in relinquishing it.  
  
The hat plan that has everyone shifty.  
I'm the goddess to the railroad track of immediate wreath.  
There are many flasks in harsh events. Realized original mosaic in the first reel, the incredulous son  
is conquered by a sailor. In the second  
scene he returns, to rescue and to flow.  
Of a brimstone god that promises rivers.  
Went seized in hat when the boulevard is full  
of barbaous hips  
outside circumstances and fuming banal starlights  
and the sordid times and the kisses  
at last give forth their acidulous abys.  
You are the banana of my worn-out brain.
