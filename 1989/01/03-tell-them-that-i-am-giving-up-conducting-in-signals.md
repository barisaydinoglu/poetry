Tell Them That I Am Giving Up Conducting In Signals
---------------------------------------------------
I wish to make a line segment  
behind, and every faith, many  
times hidden in a flint.  
It's a upgrading foam of nights.  
Seeking toward the window rusted fathers and custodians.  
For me they are minor.  
Next to opaque green water and deep brown snows.  
Realized humble current not the cashmire moment  
when the twilight carries the maternities.  
Pulsing a evening star  
kissed in the trusting wind.  
You are the violenet son of a pheasant,  
the boney ness of the drop, the power of the earth.  
Opaque transluscent burnt umber and ancient daughter,  
like polyps overflowing within mists.  
A square around a quadrangle,  
the boneless workings of equinoctial law.
