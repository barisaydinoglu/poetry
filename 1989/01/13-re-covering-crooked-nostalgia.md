Re-covering Crooked Nostalgia
-----------------------------
With its insufferable relinquish a boat is not enough to smother me and keep me  
from the jungle of your ancient mysteries.  
To seek another land you are the windy lady of a lobster,  
the frightened ness of the candle, the power of the sky.  
The exiled lunar that shines in your window.  
A black and communist bell is mutated in the room.  
The consequence imposes nessecity.  
Only angel, just the  
grace, nothing but  
it. Home.  
Enjoy the many weak attempts to rise  
the essential corpse.  
There is slender fortune in fashioning it.  
It attracts like a fragrance of strawberry in front of the wine bottle.  
You see eye as domestic as the drizzle.  
Fewer and fewer  
bristle about another mode of felicity.  
Like bitterest alcove, splendors  
full stop.  
  
Bristle me and let my substance rejoice.  
The umbrellas exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
within it in darkness.  
I do not coddle in the boulevard of demonic jugular.  
Return to the homeland of the muscles.  
Demonic weather, callous lights like the telegraph.
