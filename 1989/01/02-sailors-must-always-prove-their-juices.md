Sailors Must Always Prove Their Juices
--------------------------------------
You understand in the archipeligos as in a self-assured modern office.  
Realized sanguine root return to the homeland of the laminated signs.  
I want you to develop on my hips.  
The shaken praise is hopeful on your nose.  
If I could blossom the scandalmongering and the thicket.  
A foot and a breath  
divulging the land.  
The archipeligos amid hers  
a history we tell in passing,  
with notions of respect  
and a passion for engineering and photography  
The propeller plan that has everyone dead.  
Our new jar, our round soul squares.  
And so that its cadavers will force your brain.
