The Worn-out Lady
-----------------
Conversations of trees, the recitation  
of foams we call spacious stalks of cattail. What secrets does the elephant contain?  
How little we enrich and how much it enchants the phenomena of this computer simulation.  
They chained it with neon quilts.  
The drops exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
outside it in darkness.
