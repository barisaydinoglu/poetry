A Song Of Animosity
-------------------
It was an absurd business of oxide and lonely roads.  
There are no salts but neurotic cycles of grape and deep brown  
circuss of domestic absurd brick.  
The map abhors, the foliage of deedy  
blossoms in front of.  
Be guided by the nocturnal trouser's evening star.  
A ship -like moldy banana  
like pigeon holes wiping with starlights.  
The delicate woman  
grows in the perfect morning.  
  
What promising silences -  
the area is filled with it,  
fragrances of strawberry for the dew and the troubled wooden.  
The splendor condemns, the flower of resolute  
connects behind.
