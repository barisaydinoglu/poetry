Comfortable Theories Of Hooves
------------------------------
Hated billowss of opaque ultraviolet smoke and sordid cadavers.  
Sterile sunrise  
and the negligent mosaic  
steal at the walls of my house.  
And you kiss like a sea's skin and a handsome rug making a sanguine thing of a unlikely meeting with a sailor.  
The dashing dignity of the silence!  
Of irreducable sugar, spirit  
of the gardens,  
deceived mother blood, your kisses  
rescue into exile  
and a droplet of wooden, with remnants of the field.  
Transforming from hairy chalk.  
Thick, silken aspen!
