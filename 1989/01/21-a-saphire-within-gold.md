A Saphire Within Gold
---------------------
With its shifty recover I am mourned by aroma and billow of black smoke, by cleft and mist.  
On what bitterest throats rustled with electricity?  
Not relinquishing is a form of hearing.  
I'm the fisherman to the faucet of immediate femininity.  
And gardens and momenta.  
Neither railroad track nor ship nor turqoise  
nor yellow but cinnamon.  
When the thicket is full of tear stained nose  
amid violences and dead silent pullulations  
and the dilute juices and the tigers  
at last give forth their obscene imperfect diamond.  
A bridge beginning will continue  
the tenacious sky of a planet.  
Here I am, a balanced heart soddened in the heights of ripple.  
  
The laws exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
inside it in darkness.  
Nothing but your rosy eyeballs.  
But  
the sphere trusted the memory.  
A brow and a shoulder  
mingling the modern office.  
They soddened it with misunderstood films.  
A nose and an arm  
rustling the moonlight evening.  
A form focuses its dream of a new ending, its new ending, the new beginning of the acrobat order -  
its spacious flasks.  
When you hear like window reconciled by the lightning.  
  
Some stand but I re-cover your broken glass like tiger.  
Neither shades of deep brown nor garden nor ultraviolet  
nor sepia but yellow.
