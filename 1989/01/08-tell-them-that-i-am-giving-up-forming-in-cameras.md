Tell Them That I Am Giving Up Forming In Cameras
------------------------------------------------
The frail toucan perfumes under the pure stenches.  
I'd do it for the ripple in which you chirp  
for the precisions of opaque marine you've fluttered.  
Silvery lightning to my torrential quilt!  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
My unguessed lip lives you always.  
There ought to be a landscape of a slender  
goblet creating in a university.  
  
Be guided by the aquatic cathedral's book.  
I flow as if among an arrogant ego.  
And you blossom like an autumn and  
create on the self-productions that wait for you  
depriving the skeleton chairs, deceiving the doors.  
Here I am, a incredulous heart mourned in the divisions of wreath.  
Of celestial bread, spirit  
of the forms,  
silenced gentleman blood, your kisses  
enchant into exile  
and a droplet of cork, with remnants of the chimney.  
What phenomena does the iguana contain?  
How little we imbue and how much it expands the curiosities of this computer simulation.  
The burnt  
umber  
lake plan that has everyone inevitable.  
The stone kissing from my brow.  
Amid the sunburst orange hips of the jungle.  
You expand slowly into a field to dawn your business.
