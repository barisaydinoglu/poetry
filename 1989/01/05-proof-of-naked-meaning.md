Proof Of Naked Meaning
----------------------
I expand as if outside a sterile felicity. To create lost aromas and for branches.  
Pure moldy banana pulses the gardens of noble wine, spirit  
of the landscapes,  
degraded father blood, your kisses  
perfume into exile  
and  
a droplet of gem, with remnants of the moonlight evening.  
I saw how foams are stored  
by the myriad honeysuckle.  
I want you to swim on my tail.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the free springtimes?  
And the sun lovely splattering its jars and petrifying them full of  
field and jaguar?  
A tetrahedron behind a square,  
the frail workings of somber law.  
Devour me and let my substance kiss.  
A inscription for sequence  
is the lack thereof.  
The I in juice halfway.  
A blood colored and lashed lunar is plagued in the divisions.  
In the first scene, the secure astronaut  
is congealed by an astronaut. In the second  
take he returns, to perfume and to dawn.  
The salt perching from my lip.  
A burnt umber phemonana lights.  
  
It was the early light of day of the tiger.  
I stayed began and transluscent sand-colored  
inside the thicket.  
Realized angellic atom and a browbeaten tiger's jungle will gallop you.  
Spacious, glass river bank!  
And you light like a circus and pockets of rusted nail converted into glass.  
Of a rust colored daughter that wets spheres.  
Indicates the telegraph's reflecting toe.  
What natural necklaces -  
the heights is filled with it,  
miracles for the ritual and the sticky cedar.  
  
It was the day of the crab.  
The land crystallizing from my brow.
