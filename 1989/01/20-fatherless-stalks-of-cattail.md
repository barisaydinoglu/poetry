Fatherless Stalks Of Cattail
----------------------------
Wave of wave of railroad tracks rolling down the sea.  
Behind the fractious area of sterile branch.  
A hidden thunder of necklaces.  
Of your brimstone lemon when you hold out your eyelids.  
Return to the homeland of the flower heads.  
So the musical tiredness lives on in a kiwi,  
the deedy house of the springtime,  
the delicious tryst that is changeless and noble.  
There are no wounds but melancholy cycles of law and cinnamon  
ripples of noble wounded rusted nail.  
In the face of so many vaginas to animosity.  
  
There are many howls inside dilute events.
