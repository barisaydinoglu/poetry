Proof Of Absorbant Hearing
--------------------------
Because I love you, love, with the wind and in front of the mud.  
Pockets of metal converted into silicon.  
A chorus of crabs at morning un developed un loitered  
comes to a halt before a flint.  
Everything troubled with sensual voices, the salt of the tryst  
and piles of spacious bread around late afternoon.  
So the sanguine tiredness lives on in a fruit,  
the winged house of the kis,  
the ancient bottle that is solute and gleaming.  
Full stop.  
Like the motionless clay of telegraphs a film -like phlegm  
I stayed promised and yellow  
against the jungle.
