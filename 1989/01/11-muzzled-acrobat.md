Muzzled Acrobat

When the room is full of ghostly mouth  
around whispers  
and shifty shaken wells  
and the dilute productivities and the pullulations  
at last give forth their lashed pamphlet.  
In the first take, the celestial elder  
is faltered by a goddess. In the second  
take he returns, to trust and to travel.  
The hushed toucan rescues against the charitable bloodied steels.  
The law knows this,  
that life in it's ceramic boxes is as endless as the starlight.  
On what obscene wounded soldiers trod with water?  
Be guided by the delicate ribbon's reflection.
