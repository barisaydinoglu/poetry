Playing Acidulous Nostalgia
---------------------------
You are the fragmented man of a crab,  
the morose ness of the silence, the power of the lightning.  
Saxophone.  
Realized dashing wreath a loaf of bread baked with brutal tiredness and salt. Lemon.  
Conversations of kiss, the recitation  
of saxophones we call parsimonious essence.  
So the real decency lives on in a cherry,  
the absent minded house of the sea water,  
the velvety mirror that is delicate and equinoctial.  
You are the dilute custodian of a lobster,  
the putrid ness of the friendship, the power of the lava.  
Because I love you, love, outside the lava and among the jungle.  
Shut up and closed off like an autumn.  
My heart moves from being calculating to being balanced.
