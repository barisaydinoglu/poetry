Production Without The Extinction
---------------------------------
Around the region I like to light like a bruised farm.  
I could seek puberty, bloodied metal, and moldy banana  
from quilts and starss in the sky  
with a dull  
shades of green river  
with vagabonds in my brain.  
I could drink cadaver, grave, and blade  
from magnoliums and corals  
with a rust colored fragrance of strawberry  
with trash barges in my finger.  
Pockets of ash converted into glass.  
I wish to make a circle  
inside, and every faith, many  
times hidden in a propeller.  
Disordered fortnight and the guilt stalks of cattail  
deform at the walls of my house.  
The elder smiles at the sailor  
but the pioneer does not smile  
when he looks at the iguana elder  
and  
the mechanical ocean.  
And you buried  
in the embarassement and enriched a erupting lightning.  
And you respond like a foam and I saw how silences are attracted  
by the parsimonious foam.  
  
In the sea like aluminum.
