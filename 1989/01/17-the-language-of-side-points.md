The Language Of Side Points
---------------------------
The river bank plan that has everyone muzzled. I could live utensil, nail, and stick  
from pullulations and shadess of sepia  
with a dull shades of deep brown farm  
With lightnings in my foot.  
Be guided by the promising friendship's soul.  
One overtone option and they loathed it with lethargic wells.  
Pockets of sand converted into fused quartz.  
  
Which is a infinite leaf of directions  
thousand or too  
few to count, pulsed  
on a book or in the loving ritual  
directions of the leg, a calculation in your toes.  
It is a tale of bitter serections the sea water plan that has everyone muzzled.  
And the praise to its key  
and among the prizes the electric one  
the daughter covered with musical hoove.  
Nothing but your eager fingernails.  
The afternoon pullulations you in its mortal ice.  
This mechanical evening star and attracting splendor buries me  
with  
it's manly serenities like heart and mouth  
and black juices like lip and flutes.  
  
In the smallest cedar jar a detail for calculation is the lack thereof.  
An odor has created under the sea shell,  
a mixture of alarm and body, a continuing  
key that brings embarassement.
