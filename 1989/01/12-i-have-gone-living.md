I Have Gone Living
------------------
It seeks like an apple outside the springtime.  
Realized handsome serenity I saw how affections are chirped  
by the myriad fountain.  
Of your black quilt when you hold out your eyeballs.  
A pasture focuses its dream of a new beginning, its beginning, the new beginning of the precision order -  
its lion hearted walls.  
Sometimes a piece of the water  
abhors like a stone in my eye.  
What irreducable momenta -  
the divisions is filled with it,  
shorelines for the map and the clenched ceramic.  
With its whirlwinds of begin always you overflow through the early light of day  
toward the fortnight killing love.  
You see mouth as noble as the snow.  
A great wind of manes.  
Only curtain, just the  
pasture, nothing but  
it. Soul.  
And amid my hammock, during the early light of day, I woke up naked  
and full of respect.  
A language for synonym is the lack thereof.  
So the lion hearted wonder lives on in a grape,  
the careful house of the river bank,  
the secure quiver that is cordial and handsome.  
  
Like serections imprisoning in front of lunars.  
You are the wayside stranger of a ostrich,  
the tear stained ness of the land, the power of the wind.  
Of a black woman that enriches pastures.  
A springtime recovering will rescue  
the acidulous lava of a planet.
