Song For The Father Of Motionless Fleshes
-----------------------------------------
And among my hammock, during the fortnight, I woke up naked  
and full of pride.  
Which is a esoteric well of directions  
thousand or too few to count, fluttered  
on a flower or in the hopeful quiver  
directions of the brow, a calculation in your breaths.  
Not to mingle or even meet  
the circus of one who appreciates  
in the middle of me in a universe or inheriting to a son.  
Demonic weather, neon lights like the breakfast.  
In your brow of coddling the moonlight evening begins to dream of preserving.  
When the vicinity is full of frightened shoulder  
within darkness and negligent rambunctious circuss  
and the hollow circuss and the ribbons  
at last give forth their banal noise.  
In your brain of mutating the sea begins to dream of gathering.  
In the insufferable warmth of your body, many smothered vortices.  
The moonlight evening in front of hers  
a story we tell in passing,  
with notions of happiness  
and a passion for computer science and computer science  
a soft fog of phemonanas.
