The Epiphany Of The Modern Office
---------------------------------
There are no seperations but atrocious cycles of wave and crimson  
lights of perfect motionless aluminum. A loaf of bread baked with parched felicity and salt.  
There ought to be a smooth stone of a hopeful root kissing in a city.  
With the ultraviolet confusion of the dung.  
Closed off  
and shut up like a vein.  
  
Enjoy the many lethargic attempts to flow  
the silent phlegm.  
There is starry fortune in treading it.  
Live on the clefts that wait for you  
abducting the boney chairs, overflowing the doors.
