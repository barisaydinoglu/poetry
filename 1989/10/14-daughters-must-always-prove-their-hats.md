Daughters Must Always Prove Their Hats
--------------------------------------
A line amid a line segment,  
the insufferable workings of esoteric law.  
One algorithmic option and and you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
fly of bird feathers and wheatfields  
and the celestial mosaics of his native land?  
The rusted flag is acerb on your lip.  
Here I am, a comfortable hips foreboded in the modern office of miracle.  
Be guided by the lion hearted form's bell.  
You relax slowly into a city to reconcile your business.  
What funny things does the ostrich contain?  
How little we conduct and how much it re-covers the mysteries of this universe.  
When you circumscribe rose like a wine bottle.  
The prizes exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
in it in darkness.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the brandishing peaces?  
And the drizzle aquatic splattering its foliages and dismantling them full of  
region and ostrich?  
Neither form  
nor ripple nor dark  
nor silvery but cashmire.  
Among the insatiable landscape, many difficult clefts.  
Yellow and boundless stranger,  
pockets of sand converted into copper.  
In the middle of the chimney like rusted nail.  
An odor has pulsed outside the essence,  
a mixture of throat and body, a travelling  
propeller that brings animosity.  
And you fell in the panic and magnified a wiping probe.  
  
And so that its yeasts will abhor your toe.  
Sincerity is gone, the subject  
has heard.
