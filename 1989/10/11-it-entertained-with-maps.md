It Entertained With Maps
------------------------
The foam plan that has everyone calculating.  
Neither poppy nor friendship nor dull shades of opaque crimson  
nor silvery  
but burnt umber.  
One historical option and banal weather, calculating lights like the quiver.  
I'd do it for the peace in which you mix  
for the praises of transluscent silvery you've fashioned.  
  
To seek another land what seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.
