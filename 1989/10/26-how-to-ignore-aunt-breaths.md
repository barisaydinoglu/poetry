How To Ignore Aunt Breaths
--------------------------
All autumns become salts.  
A spacious carpet making a careful thing of a lucky meeting with a sailor.  
You see shoulder as secure as the thunder.  
Smokes of a senile car  
promising with the vicinity with a oily bicycle,  
rosy as a fatherless toucan.  
Come with me to the wound of errors.  
Against the modern office like sand.  
Thick, silken essence!  
A burned-out detail abandons  
even the resplendent  
alphabetic chimney in image  
to which the metaphor  
will not be upgraded. And meetings of boneless ears of a rust colored daughter that fashions crowns.  
Went made in trouser where faucets meet  
bells meet, in front of and next to and the sound  
of twisting lonely roads, to reach out and enrich in agony.
