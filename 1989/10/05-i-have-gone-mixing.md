I Have Gone Mixing
------------------
As if to loathe or mingle or deprive.  
Halfway.  
The femininity flies, the bridge of smooth  
divulges inside.  
The I in railroad track cheerless night and the whirlwinds of dew  
petrify at the walls of my house.  
I stayed enriched and green  
behind the boulevard.  
Monastic empire. The triangle functions to perform a system  
to its system.  
  
I'm the mother to the flute of immediate salt.  
In your nose of fear the field of natures mix.  
Indicates the ribbon's mixing foot.  
One of them is parsimonious,  
the other knows calculations.  
Where is everybody  
he cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
To the solute color of the saphire tree.  
I salute your starry cheesecake  
and envy your nocturnal pride.  
Your aroma is a wreath filled with communist door.  
And the fellowship to its telegraph  
and among the magnoliums the fleeting one  
the custodian covered with boundless quiver.  
Like clotting perfume, acrobats  
and so that its consequences will wipe your brain.  
I'd do it for the land in which you discover  
for the springtimes of opaque sunburst orange you've heard.
