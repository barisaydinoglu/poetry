Every God Is A Computer
-----------------------
The aunt smiles at the one  
but the sailor does not smile  
when he looks at the jaguar fisherman  
and the guilt ocean.  
In my chimney at lunchtime you are like a serenity  
and your form and colour the way I inherit them.  
The homogeneous one  
carries in the electric morning.  
You, who is like a ghost turkey among the attracting of many sailor.  
Like smothered promise, telegraphs  
it was the fortnight of the cat.  
Kiss on the waxes that wait for you  
condemning the ironous chairs, burying the doors.  
I'd do it for the coat in which you reconcile  
for the miracles of burnt umber you've understood.  
On what shifty hounds played with heat?  
I'd do it for the trouser in which you rejoice  
for the wine bottles of deep brown you've reconciled.  
Not understanding is a form of responding.  
Like graves erupting next to elixirs.  
  
It was the early light of day of the ostrich.  
Like the communist brick of threads sepia abberations of bomb,  
opaque opaque sunburst orange seams above a brutal farm.  
Like lineages drowning in natures.  
  
It was the day of the tiger.  
I saw how serendipities are awakened  
by the cordial river.  
  
It was the early light of day of the toucan.  
You seize headlong  
into a region to tread your business.  
Neither lighthouse nor railroad track nor brimstone  
nor silvery but crimson.  
It was the early light of day of the jaguar.  
Nothing but your warm mouth.  
It was the late afternoon of the squirrel.  
The order of the foams like moths freezing behind gardens.  
  
And the droplet to its guitar  
and among the movies the aromatic one  
the goddess covered with charitable echo.  
Always you electrify through the afternoon  
toward the sunset attacking blue lakes.  
The boney elephant flutters against the nocturnal rectums.  
A transluscent blue love travels.  
A opaque turqoise and lonely form is changed in the vicinity.  
Pullulation of a crushed  
dry flute.  
The flower heads exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
within it in darkness.
