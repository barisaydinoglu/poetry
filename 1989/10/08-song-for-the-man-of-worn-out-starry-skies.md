Song For The Man Of Worn-out Starry Skies
-----------------------------------------
As soon  
as the incoming fleshes  
gives the public indication. An odor has swam under the movie,  
a mixture of seperation and body, a entertaining  
window that brings agony.  
To seek another land a chorus of iguanas at afternoon un sought un abducted  
comes to a halt before a paper-mache architecture.  
Neither bottle nor aroma nor turqoise  
nor cinnamon but marine.
