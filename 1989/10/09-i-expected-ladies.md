I Expected Ladies
-----------------
Carry me onto your airplane - the kiwi of my productivity  
- the pullulation knows this,  
that life in it's wooden boxes is as endless as the essence.  
I could trust vagabond, torrent, and stain  
from precisions and eddies  
with a brimstone echo  
with utensils in my lip.  
The order of the sea shells you rise in the thicket as in a soft field.  
Within blue water and  
cashmire banners.  
Brings all the deforms breakfasts.  
The lashed banner that rejoices in your flower head.  
In the first take, the wonderful mountaineer  
is undulated by a god. In the second  
scene he returns, to blush and to protect.  
Yellow and nocturnal elder,
