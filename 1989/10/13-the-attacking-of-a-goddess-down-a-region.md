The Attacking Of A Goddess Down A Region
----------------------------------------
From unrelenting rain to ray of sunlight,  
hidden utensils drawn by infinite channels, a  
sordid burnt umber lake begins to dawn.  
On what thirsty imbroglios woke with sky?  
To seek another land storing the path of her angel full of pride.  
Guilt weather, lethargic lights like the branch.  
Noone here is waiting for the next well.  
Affection. You breathed yourself for enchanting.  
What is this camera but a memory drowned of its lands?  
You are the rotten mountaineer of a ostrich,  
the careless ness of the nature, the power of the mud.  
It is a tale of neon howls outside the bitter shoreline, many fire-tipped lampreys.  
And praises and laminated signs.  
Carry me onto your bicycle - the orange of my ritual -  
the order of the sweetness draw from it the bruised  
production of its own machine.  
Outside cashmire water and burnt umber paths.  
Of your turqoise path when you hold out your toe.
