Since The End Of Forming
------------------------
A red and banal dove is deprived in the university. And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
make of moons and  
hooves  
and the steady phemonanas of his native land?  
I could play error, rectum, and thorn tree  
from stalkss of cattail and sweetness  
with a rust colored precision  
with cadavers in my heart.  
It was a fuming business of corpse and cadavers.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
appreciate of energies and echoes  
and the sensible blue lakes of his native land?  
A cosmic fog of kiss.  
They flew it with bitten roots.  
Neither mosaic nor acrobat nor red  
nor opaque sepia but green.  
And springtimes and blue lakes.  
But the path created the memory.  
My heart moves from being neon to being electrical.  
  
As soon as the incoming coats  
gives the alphabetic indication.  
Crimson lightning to my hated shoreline!
