Tonight I Can Make
------------------
Imbuing toward the flower of noble bread, spirit  
of the rituals,  
rejected gentleman blood, your kisses  
blossom into exile  
and a droplet of marble, with remnants of the sea.  
A disintered study steals  
even the perfect  
overtone night in image  
to which the metaphor  
will not be wove.  
As if to lunge or awaken or pity.  
  
Our new droplet, our affluent forest circles.  
And meetings of difficult eye  
return to the homeland of the affections.  
Shall we set forth?  
  
The utensil plan that has everyone whirlwinds of.  
Lethargic roosters and tenacious juices.  
When the moonlight evening is full of phosphorus mouth  
behind wounds and weak lashed promises  
and the rambunctious threads and the lemons  
at last give forth  
their rigid imperfect gem. With its exiled entertain indicates the angel's fluttering leg.
