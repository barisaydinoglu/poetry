Every Goddess Is A Language
---------------------------
Love is gone, the subject has relinquished.  
Be guided by the scrupulous mirror's mist.  
The jungle arcane conspirators are deformed.  
A loaf of bread baked with spoiled pride and salt.  
If I could wake the havoc and the land.  
Flutter on the pins that wait for you  
dismantling the tear stained chairs, pitying the doors.  
Confusion and jar - bird feathers of embarassement.  
You enrich my shifty nail  
like a homogeneous lobster to fresh orange.  
How refreshing is the wide corpse and it's cordial wounds?  
You are the kiwi of my tear stained nose.  
The man smiles at  
the father  
but the uncle does not smile  
when he looks at the tiger elder  
and the weak ocean.  
When you live dawned like a home.  
But the lake shone the memory.
