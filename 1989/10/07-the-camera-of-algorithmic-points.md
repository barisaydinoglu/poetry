The Camera Of Algorithmic Points
--------------------------------
When the chimney is full of phosphorus breath  
next to bombs and imperalist rabid farms  
and the listless rivers and the fountains  
at last give forth their hated darknes.  
Cinnamon and naked pioneer,  
some stand but I weave your graphite like droplet.  
The serene smooth stone gave it respect.  
For a day, maybe too few to count,  
I rested under a palm tree leaf  
at a post office, waiting for the father to be among.  
I saw how grapes are rescued  
by the cordial mirror.  
  
You dedicate slowly into a city to appreciate your business.  
Which is a resolute guitar of directions  
twenty-seven or thousand, upgraded  
on a warmth or in the decisive pullulation  
directions of the finger, a calculation in your legs.  
Wave of wave of starry skies rolling down the sea. All sea's skins become brambles.  
The reasons for my respect  
are developed in my shoulder of silk.
