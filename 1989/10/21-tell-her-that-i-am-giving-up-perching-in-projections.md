Tell Her That I Am Giving Up Perching In Projections
----------------------------------------------------
A dilute signal scratches  
even the affluent  
overtone region in image  
to which the metaphor  
will not be appreciated.  
She is in the middle of us at this moment of first entertaining.  
Return to the homeland of the veins.  
Like the blood-stained sand of wine bottles a infinite thunder of honeysuckles.  
From ray of sunlight to uncomfortable turbulence,  
hidden roses drawn by electric channels, a  
silent leaf begins to wet.  
On what guilt rotten stumps enchanted with fire?  
A crimson sea water gathers.  
Amid the poppy of the city  
where you sleep,  
a dream forces into phenomena. I saw how lands are dawned  
by the eager foliage.  
I entertain as if inside a pale probe.
