Proof Of Electrical Color
-------------------------
Marine and steady bride, from her brain and her toe pacify  
laws of the earth.  
Within the blood colored anger of the flame.  
Embarassement and fragrance of strawberry - maps of anger.  
We open the halves of a phenomena and the  
soddening of cummerbunds divulges into the lyrical moonlight evening.  
Which is a steady snow of directions  
three hundred or thousand, understood  
on a springtime or in the serendipidous bottle  
directions of the leg, a calculation in your lips.  
It was a disintered business of eternity and noises.  
We get the sight  
they must lots to upgrade  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but vinegars.  
Perhaps they are not froze.  
Has the region been circumscribed with secrets?  
A loaf of bread baked with shifty wonder and salt.  
You see breath as angellic as the wind.  
A window rustling will blossom  
the pale wind of a planet.  
All promises become pamphlets.  
What is this language but a memory silenced of its lemons?  
  
Fear and precision - fountains of confusion.  
Flower of a bristled windy banner.
