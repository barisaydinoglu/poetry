From Lava To Clay
-----------------
Of a ultraviolet mother that excites honeysuckles.  
The original one  
returns in the dashing morning.  
They stole it with demonic curtains. Carry me onto your bicycle - the tomato of my mosaic -  
I wish to make a loop  
behind, and every faith, many  
times hidden in a horse.
