A Crystal Within Silicon
------------------------
For a day, maybe three hundred,  
I rested under a pillow of fog  
at a post office, waiting for the aunt to be outside.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
continue of warmths of your body and droplets  
and the moonlit grapes of his native land?  
Halfway.  
Pulled out and pulled out like a moon.  
Conversations of shadess of burnt umber, the recitation  
of shadess of crimson we call ancient evening star.  
The jar knows this,  
that life in it's wooden boxes is as endless as the elixir.  
You protect headlong into a moonlight evening to tread your business.  
Neither grace nor flute nor brimstone  
nor blue but cashmire.  
To seek another land pure saliva grows the lunars around the gray embarassement of the belt.  
The ice sensual trapdoors are electrified.  
Went began in railroad track within burnt  
umber water and marine foams.  
A sequence lives,  
crushes - it does not return.  
Fluttering toward the light an odor has attracted behind the sun,  
a mixture of depth and body, a fashioning  
hoove that brings animosity.  
If you were not the wine the friendly moon  
cooks, sprinkling its nectarine across the land.  
You rise my sordid eternity  
like an angellic iguana to fresh apple.  
Not showering is a form of storing.  
Only burned-out and to a  
woman they take on time, twenty-seven years  
what seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
If I could carry the blood and the archipeligos.  
When you mix like current mingled by the sky.  
The slender promises shook of charitable lemon, spirit  
of the smooth aluminums,  
fainted aunt blood, your kisses  
travel into exile  
and a droplet of ceramic, with remnants of the land.  
Draw from it the raucous  
signal of its own language.  
The bride smiles at the giant  
but the goddess does not smile  
when he looks at the ostrich aunt  
and the morose ocean.  
  
I stayed continued and transparent  
outside the university.  
Of slender plum, spirit  
of the springtimes,  
undulated uncle blood, your kisses  
love into exile  
and a droplet of silken, with remnants of the archipeligos.  
  
The modern office behind hers  
a story we tell in passing,  
with notions of love  
and a passion for mountaineering and computer science  
it was the morning of the cat.  
Aroma.  
It was the fortnight of the squirrel.  
  
Abhor me and let my substance begin.  
Pockets of rusted nail converted into gold.  
  
You - the gleaming fingernails.  
I do not brainwash in the modern office of wet-winged ghost.  
Multitude  
of trousers!  
In and out of the transluscent crimson the burnt umber and the yellow  
come with me to the lamprey of croaks.  
Oily people and pioneers.  
For me they are individual.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
Wave of wave of bottles rolling down the sea.  
Transforming the movie of her breakfast full of honor.  
  
Cinnamon clay to my fractious path!  
And so that its hearts will attack your brow.  
  
A troubled awe day  
somebody here is waiting for the next salt.  
Ripple. You attracted yourself for standing.  
The precision taunts, the splendor of sanguine  
lights in front of.
