Since The Beginning
-------------------
Calcerous sons and people.  
For me they are technical.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
If you were not the peach the electrical moon  
cooks, sprinkling its plum across the vicinity.  
From unrelenting rain to unrelenting rain,  
hidden smooth stones drawn by musical channels, a  
misunderstood law begins to fashion.
