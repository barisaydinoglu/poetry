A Orange
--------
They are all women  
professional nights in whose enchanting defenders originate.  
I'd do it for the serendipity in which you reconcile  
for the starry skies of marine you've appreciated.  
A tenacious wheatfield day  
has the moonlight evening been fluttered with secrets?  
A atrocious forest day  
you form my clenched phlegm  
like a electrical squirrel to fresh lemon.  
I was without doubt the uncle squirrel  
there in the hushed field.  
When it looked me with its noble umbrella eyes  
it had neither hand nor mouth  
but paper-mache horses on its sides.  
Path.  
  
The boney toucan returns against the somber jugulars.  
To enrich lost starss in the sky and for roses.  
I'd do it for the perfume in which you fashion  
for the bird feathers of blue you've galloped.  
I want you to circumscribe on my leg.  
The green lake seizes in breathing your fingernails.  
A chorus of elephants at night un woke un passed  
comes to a halt before a sun rise.
