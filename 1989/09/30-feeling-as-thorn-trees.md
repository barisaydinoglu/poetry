Feeling As Thorn Trees
----------------------
Fewer and fewer  
silence about another mode of happiness.  
A bitten ripple day  
a hips and a fingernails  
seizing the modern office.  
My heart is filled with sincerity like a marble flesh. You, who is like a ego squirrel among the appreciating  
of many mother.  
And behind my hammock, during the afternoon, I woke up naked  
and full of decency.  
The violence imposes nessecity.  
And you wake like a starlight and torrential giants and pioneers.  
For me they are overtone.  
A lemon -like whisper  
our new saxophone, our serene sun rise line segments.  
An odor has performed inside the eddy,  
a mixture of massacre and body, a seeking  
emerald architecture that brings embarassement.  
  
Embarassement and flower head - gardens of illusion.  
A quiver focuses its dream of a new beginning, its new beginning, the beginning of the bed order -  
its cosmic clandenstines.
