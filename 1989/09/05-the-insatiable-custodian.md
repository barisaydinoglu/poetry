The Insatiable Custodian
------------------------
Like nougats conquering behind miracles.  
Sunburst orange and cordial stranger,  
Inside the chaining blades.  
Noble, diamond starry sky!  
You, who is like a dust tiger among the awakening of many giant.  
Next to the yellow tail of the sky.  
  
The morose cactus that dawns in your hoove.  
A window focuses its dream of a old ending, its beginning, the old ending of the grape order -  
its myriad evils.  
To carry lost mists and for salts.  
Come with me to the polyp of bones.
