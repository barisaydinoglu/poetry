Everyday You Mix
----------------
My heart is filled with respect like a cedar ritual. An odor has woke inside the salt,  
a mixture of lance and body, a creating  
pasture that brings beligerance.  
You've asked me what the oyster is fashioning there with his marine hand?  
I reply, the telegraph knows this.  
The I in faucet pure imperfect emerald protects the momenta we open the halves of a secrets and the  
hating of granules dedicates into the absent minded modern office.  
Around the area I like to hear like an atrocious window.  
One of them is resolute,  
the other knows details.  
Where is everybody  
she cries, and when can we  
see what  
is going to happen?  
The sea's skin smothers, the fountain of brandishing  
flutters amid.  
Nocturnal, bolt of ceramic time!  
Behind blue water and burnt umber horses.  
  
Love is gone, the subject has drank.  
From her arm and her mouth kiss  
warmths of your body of the earth.  
  
Nothing but your great breath.  
The magnolium crystallizing from my eye.
