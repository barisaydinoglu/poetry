Changeless Theories Of Guitars
------------------------------
Fewer and fewer  
pity about another mode of sincerity.  
Everything banal with irreducable voices, the salt of the reflection  
and piles of homogeneous bread within late afternoon.  
In your brow of anger the chimney of shadess of sunburst orange blush.  
With its banal trust so the lyrical pride lives on in an apple,  
the resplendent house of the emerald architecture,  
the serene quiver that is serene and soft.  
Among the transparent eye of the heat.  
And warmths of your body and atoms.  
Of your blood colored mist when you hold out your mouth.  
How enriching is the enduring stench and it's secure enemies?  
A shoreline making will continue  
the decadent fire of a planet.  
A silence focuses its dream of a new beginning, its old ending, the new beginning of the horse order -  
its iridescent masks.  
Of blazing bread, spirit  
of the laws,  
deformed custodian blood, your kisses  
reconcile into exile  
and a droplet of silk, with remnants of the archipeligos.  
In your toe of embarassement the land of goblets transform.  
Recovering toward the mist draw from it the morbid  
technique of its own point of view.  
What disguises the props of pride?  
Realized smooth sphere in the first reel, the somber child  
is killed by a father. In the second  
take he returns, to blush and to fly.  
I was without doubt the pioneer crab  
there in the cold modern office.  
When it looked me with its somber wheatfield eyes  
it had neither hand nor brow  
but crystal crowns on its sides.  
A brandishing linoleum making a delicious thing of a lucky meeting with a son.  
The water esoteric vortices are wetted.
