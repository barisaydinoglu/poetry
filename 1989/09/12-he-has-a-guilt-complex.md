He Has A Guilt Complex
----------------------
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
kiss of times and love  
and the celestial sea shells of his native land?  
Return to the homeland of the friendships.  
Nothing but your profound shoulder.  
A crooked detail cracks  
even the friendly  
minor divisions in image  
to which the metaphor  
will not be appreciated.  
From tornado to ocean wave,  
hidden  
dews drawn by deedy channels, a  
lethargic book begins to rustle.  
A arm and a eye  
weaving the moonlight evening.  
There are no beasts but sterile cycles of wave and sand-colored  
shorelines of spacious imperalist ash.  
Your reflection is a quiver filled with worn-out flower head.  
What we say divulges to  
pulse some other astronaut  
what a synonym may teach.  
Thirsty weather, bitterest lights like the path.  
As soon as the incoming silences  
gives the technical indication.  
Amid the transluscent sand-colored arm of the fire.  
Nothing but your angellic mouth.  
Garden of an abandoned  
explosive serendipity.  
A airplane is not enough to twist me and keep me  
from the modern office of your affluent mysteries.  
A camera for language is the lack thereof.
