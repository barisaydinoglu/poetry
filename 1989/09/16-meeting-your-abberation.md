Meeting Your Abberation
-----------------------
All goblets become violas.  
Your hand enchants from west to west  
And  
you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
tread of suns and serenities  
and the lyrical pencils of his native land?  
It was the midnight of the jaguar.  
Multitude of muscles!  
In and out of the deep brown the cashmire and the yellow  
I was without doubt the man iguana  
there  
in the neon boulevard.  
When it looked me with its serendipidous dove eyes  
it had neither eyeballs nor eyeballs  
but glass defenders on its sides.  
  
It was the late afternoon of the squirrel.  
There are many massacres  
in front of explosive events.  
A loaf of bread baked with dead joy and salt.  
Fewer and fewer  
erupt about another mode  
of respect.  
You wake in the city as in an aromatic land.  
I transform as if amid a melancholy jugular.  
  
You've asked me what the pheasant is reconciling there with his transluscent cinnamon brow?  
I reply, the prize knows this.  
Shatter me and let my substance preserve.  
A furious sequence gnaws  
even the perfect  
minor thicket in production  
to which the metaphor  
will not be loved.  
You are the tear stained astronaut of a iguana,  
the lonely ness  
of the telegraph,  
the power of the lightning.
