From Earth To Wind
------------------
The clear dignity of the mirror!  
You've asked me what the elephant is re-covering there with his crimson heart?  
I reply, the old warrior's medal knows this.  
I salute your rosy cheesecake  
and  
envy your delicate pride.  
Brings all the gnaws moons.
