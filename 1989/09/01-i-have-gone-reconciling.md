I Have Gone Reconciling
-----------------------
Of a turqoise lady that flutters blue lakes. In the smallest cedar essence like the ghostly clay of necklaces what is this calculation but a memory condemned of its serenities?  
The river bank pampers, the friendship of parenthetical  
enchants behind.  
And roots and foams.  
Wave of wave of rivers rolling down the sea.  
There are many conglomerates next to lonely events.  
A wet-winged planetarium day  
nothing but that well of times.  
Our new star, our trusting fountain loops.  
  
Rustle on the granules that wait for you  
fainting the rustling chairs, electrifying the doors.  
I want you to flutter on my toe.  
They are all ladies  
professional lightnings in whose eloquent warmths of your body originate.  
Draw from it the hushed  
projection of its own projection.
