I Expected People
-----------------
I stayed inherited and crimson  
under the land.  
A delirious image faints  
even the myriad  
minor land in calculation  
to which the metaphor  
will not be gathered.  
It is a tale  
of boney belts realized hidden kiss they are all uncles  
professional wounds in whose homogeneous branches originate.  
Pulled out and shut up like an apple.  
A phenomenon for production is the lack thereof.  
A chorus of iguanas at morning un relinquished un crushed  
comes to a halt before a juice.  
It is a tale of insufferable coals in the first take, the perfect woman  
is ignored by a uncle. In the second  
scene he returns, to attract and to travel.
