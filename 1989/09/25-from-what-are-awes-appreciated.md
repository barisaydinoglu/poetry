From What Are Awes Appreciated
------------------------------
To the plumed color of the gem rose.  
Our new curtain, our balanced droplet line segments.  
Shortcuts of a pale ship  
awakening amid the land inside a furious car,  
starry as a sordid cat.  
You - the full curves.  
My parenthetical hips rejoices you always.  
I wish to make a triangle  
in, and every hearing, many  
times hidden in a forest.  
  
If you were not the sugar the myriad moon  
cooks, sprinkling its sugar across the moonlight evening.  
A serene carpet making a spacious thing of a impossible meeting with a father.
