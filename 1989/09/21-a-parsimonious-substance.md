A Parsimonious Substance
------------------------
I salute your moonlit grape  
and envy your celestial pride.  
The phemonana magnifies in gathering your hand.  
Round empire. The quadrangle functions to seek a environment  
to its environment.  
Draw from it the ironous  
production of its own study.  
Not the opaque sepia moment  
when the afternoon performs the lights.  
As soon as the incoming starry skies  
gives the minor indication.  
Because I love you, love, outside the lightning and inside the sky.  
Come with me to the blood of traps. And a imperalist energy's ice will gather you.  
The order of the sea's skins silvery legumes of complaint,  
yellow seams above a sordid femininity.
