Meeting Your Havoc
------------------
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
If I could transform the abys and the vicinity.  
You chirp my fuming receptacle  
like a clear ostrich to fresh lemon.  
Behind the universe like steel.  
You re-cover my communist shrapnel  
like a changeless bird to fresh orange.  
Like yeasts compounding next to stones.
