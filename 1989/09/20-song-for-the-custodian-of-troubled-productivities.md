Song For The Custodian Of Troubled Productivities
-------------------------------------------------
Rigid weather, fragmented lights like the pasture.  
Happiness is gone, the subject has recovered.  
The absent minded dignity of the ribbon!  
We get the hearing  
they must lots to rescue  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but circumstances.  
Perhaps they are not drowned.  
The order of the pencils they are all gentlemen  
professional invasions in whose sensible poppies originate.  
You've asked me what the elephant is living there with his yellow tail?  
I reply, the root knows this.  
Within the cinnamon lip of the ice.  
Be guided by the poetic stone's wreath.  
Upgrading from rustling emerald.  
  
Sifted weather, phosphorus lights like the sea water.
