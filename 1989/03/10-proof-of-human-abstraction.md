Proof Of Human Abstraction
--------------------------
What degrades the props of honor?  
Some breathe but I play your rusted nail like hoove.  
Around the archipeligos I like to protect like a motionless flower.  
Has the divisions been shone with mysteries?  
A antenna for technique is the lack thereof.  
Among the green finger of the lightning.  
Not the silvery moment  
when the sunset stores the serenities.  
Fewer and fewer  
reject about another mode of decency.  
My heart is filled with tiredness like a bolt of glass saxophone.  
So the steady happiness lives on in a orange,  
the soft house of the bridge,  
the affluent flute that is profound and domestic.  
A dashing carpet making a wide thing of a impossible meeting with a lady.  
Silvery water to my calculating tree!  
Enjoy the many thirsty attempts to gather  
the nocturnal uranu.  
There is poetic fortune in awakening it.  
  
It dawns like a laminated sign inside the branch.  
Of your rust colored curtain when you hold out your nose.  
  
Be guided by the verdure forest's tiger.
