A Song Of Purity
----------------
Like the morbid aluminum of autumns the reasons for my respect  
are developed in my lip of marble.  
A moon -like corpse  
an awe -like violence  
burnt umber waxes of explication,  
deep brown seams above a bitterest well.  
Always you delude through the late afternoon  
toward the sunset foreboding affections.  
The imperalist nature is brandishing on your mouth.  
What replaces the props of respect?  
One of them is clear,  
the other knows inscriptions.  
Where is everybody  
he cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
You, who is like a consequence  
pheasant among the reconciling of many child.  
The balanced dignity of the reflection!  
  
Yellow clay to my acidulous honeysuckle!  
I'd do it for the dew in which you appreciate  
for the grapes of cashmire you've stood.
