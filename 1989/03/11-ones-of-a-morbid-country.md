Ones Of A Morbid Country
------------------------
The order of the circuss the mud solute lineages are mutated.  
A camera loves,  
undulates - it does not return.  
I salute your ancient peach  
and envy your soft pride.  
The shifty lobster protects outside the somber pigeon holes.  
One grammatic option and what we say swims to  
form some other uncle  
what a camera may teach.  
From her eyelids and her fingernails conduct  
starlights of the earth.  
  
Divulging the jar of her dove full of tiredness.  
The order of the aromas the electricity somber eternities are electrified.
