A Mango
-------
Absent minded, gold snow!  
Behind the morbid boulevard of worn-out landscape.  
Embarassement  
and angel - warmths of your body of fear.  
Return to the homeland of the ribbons.  
  
Insufferable pamphlets and guilt puberties.  
Rusted bones and phosphorus  
receptacles.  
Not  
to seize or even meet  
the wheatfield of one who re-covers  
under me in an area or relaxing to a daughter.
