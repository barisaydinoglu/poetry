The Arrogant Mother Of The Moonlight Evening
--------------------------------------------
Careless sailors and aunts.  
For me they are algorithmic.  
What is this phenomenon but a memory petrified of its trysts?  
The garden brainwashes, the maternity of romantic  
inherits around.  
Behind the peace of the divisions where you sleep,  
a dream deludes into inscriptions.  
In my city at midnight you are like a serendipity  
and your form and colour the way I swim them.  
Draw from it the fire-tipped  
sequence of its own signal.
