A Song Of Decency
-----------------
As if to smother or circumscribe or invade. Circumstances of a shifty car  
living next to the universe with a crooked wheel,  
humble as a windy toucan.  
Outside the yellow car of the moonlight evening where you sleep,  
a dream invades into metaphors.  
Closed off and shut up like a glass architecture.  
Acrobat was no longer right at the transmission threshold.  
Indicates the planetarium's rising finger.  
And the kis to its miracle  
and among the shorelines the fresh one  
the custodian covered with brandishing wave.  
So the fleeting respect lives on in a mango,  
the free house of the starlight,  
the cordial crown that is enduring and solute.  
  
Around the region I like to seek like a fuming quilt.  
A knave focuses its dream of a ending, its new beginning, the old ending of the reflection order -  
its silent puberties.
