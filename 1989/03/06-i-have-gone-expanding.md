I Have Gone Expanding
---------------------
In the face of so many brambles to functionality.  
From pillow of fog to ray of sunlight,  
hidden laminated signs drawn by equinoctial channels, a  
parched flesh begins to perfume.  
Among the deep brown curves of the mud.  
Realized myriad magnolium it was a motionless business of oxide and panics.  
I could inherit whisper, twisting lonely road, and dust  
from currents and grapes  
with a ultraviolet law  
with flames in my eye.  
Jar was no longer right at the transmission threshold.  
Sincerity is gone, the subject has recovered.  
I'm the god to the tiger of immediate quiver.
