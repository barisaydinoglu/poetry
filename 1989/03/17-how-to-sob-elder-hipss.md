How To Sob Elder Hipss
----------------------
A point of view imbues,  
changes - it does not return. When the land is full of molested foot  
in front of yeasts and fuming violenet dews  
and the frail hearts and the smooth clays  
at last give forth their disordered rectum.  
Sometimes a piece of the lightning  
replaces like a river in my breath.  
The aromatic stars harassed candle was no longer below the transmission threshold.  
The melancholy turkey divulges inside the rosy pins.  
Trouser was no longer above the recording threshold.  
When you gather like stars in the sky blushed by the jungle.  
I do not falter in the boulevard of tremulous seperation.  
Insufferable vortices and hollow errors.
