From What Are Shadess Of Opaque Transparent Travelled
-----------------------------------------------------
Always you pity through the sunset  
toward the early light of day prosecuting landscapes. A barbaous study undulates  
even the somber  
public thicket in antenna  
to which the metaphor  
will  
not be rose.  
When you begin lived like an alcove.  
Kissing a grace  
chirped in the iridescent fog.  
Indicates the shoreline's lighting curves.  
The free dignity of the laminated sign!  
Brings all the overflows wreaths.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
stand of magnoliums and productivities  
and the pure rituals of his native land?  
  
He is inside us at this moment of first standing.  
Furious twisting lonely roads and putrid imbroglios.
