I Have Gone Reflecting
----------------------
One of them is enchanting,  
the other knows languages.  
Where is noone  
he says, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Not the silvery moment  
when the holiday relinquishes the promises.  
Towards those jars of yours that wait for me.  
I stayed kissed and blue  
behind the land.
