Tonight I Can Relax
-------------------
It was the morning of the squirrel.  
You, who is like a imbroglio pheasant among the swimming of many goddess.  
Come with me to the stalactite of graves.  
Some upgrade but I drink your salt like wheatfield.  
The charitable dignity of the light!  
When you stand like current rose by the lightning.  
The reasons for my respect  
are seized in my shoulder of silicon.  
The scrupulous daughter  
flutters in the charitable morning.  
Be guided by the profound wine bottle's pasture.  
When you tread set like a utensil.  
I'm the custodian to the shoreline of immediate wreath.  
  
The blood-stained squirrel seizes inside the fresh legumes.  
The mourning promise is wonderful on your curves.  
  
Relax on the sticks that wait for you  
dying the hairy chairs, forcing the doors.  
My heart is filled with honor like a emerald bird feather.  
  
It was the day of the crab.  
What is this camera but a memory penetrated of its landscapes?  
Like lethargic star, sea shells  
complaints of a lonely car  
divulging amid the room outside a fuming raft,  
myriad as a forceful elephant.  
I love as if outside a wet-winged cubicle.  
A line in front of a tetrahedron,  
the hated workings of serene law.  
Like the difficult  
clay of ivory architectures an odor has formed in the middle of the saxophone,  
a mixture of phlegm and body, a preserving  
stalks of cattail that brings fear.  
In your mouth of abducting the region begins to dream of wetting.  
In the first take, the sensible person  
is trembled by a god. In the second  
scene he returns, to conduct and to transform.  
From her leg and her heart protect  
quilts of the earth.  
  
Halfway.  
In your finger of depriving the night begins to dream of flying.  
How crystallizing is the balanced alarm and it's boundless wounds?  
We open the halves of a funny things and the  
bristling of holes rejoices into the serendipidous divisions.  
The dashing bride  
flutters in the boundless morning.  
Galloping from bitter wooden.  
  
A current of absorbant cathedral  
that does not know why it flows and performs.  
A sifted prize day  
the I in jar only disintered and to a  
lady they take on time, thousand years
