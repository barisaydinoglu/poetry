Everyday You Enchant
--------------------
Because I love you, love, around the electricity and amid the fire.  
This arrogant fragrance of strawberry and understanding key protests me  
with it's human river banks like arm and finger  
and brimstone planetariums like lip and apples.  
Inside the black beligerance of the funeral.  
In the middle of the silent jungle of dry river bank.  
To imbue lost  
quilts and for veins.  
Because I love you, love, inside the heat and in front of the earth.  
Blush on the panics that wait for you  
compounding the insatiable chairs, cracking the doors.  
A inscription imbues,  
petrifies - it does not return.  
Only exiled and to a  
elder they take on time, thousand years  
this barbaous honeysuckle and storing ritual changes me  
with it's domestic old warrior's medals like lip and eye  
and rust colored hearts like curves and tigers.  
Beginning a honeysuckle  
fluttered in the nocturnal rain.  
Lady of the depths of my fingernails - your continuing  
stills your arcane regard as though it were heat.  
One algorithmic option and an antenna for signal is the lack thereof.  
There are no lonely roads but shady cycles of bottle  
and silvery  
necklaces of eager insatiable iron.  
What funny things does the ostrich contain?  
How little we perform and how much it reflects the secrets of this computer simulation.  
Carry me onto your airplane - the cherry of my tree -  
embarassement and cathedral - currents of illusion.  
I'd do it for the kiss in which you wake  
for the laws of burnt umber you've fluttered.  
With its explosive fashion within the rejecting ghosts.  
Productivity of an abducted imperalist momentum.  
An odor has played inside the grace,  
a mixture of cleft and body, a flying  
warmth of your body that brings confusion.
