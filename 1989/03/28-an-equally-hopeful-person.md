An Equally Hopeful Person
-------------------------
Went chirped in hoove carry me onto your helicopter - the kiwi of my grace -  
one of them is great,  
the other knows calculations.  
Where is everybody  
she cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
A saxophone focuses its dream of a beginning, its old ending, the beginning of the shoreline order -  
its honest brambles. The night relaxes on its phosphorus mare  
understanding sunburst orange warmths of your body over the field.  
In the smallest silken sea water there are no cadavers but muzzled cycles of sea shell and burnt umber  
roots of musical disordered salt.  
And a mourning cactus's lava will dedicate you.  
Drop.  
Pockets of graphite converted into gem.  
Neither law nor juice nor gray  
nor opaque marine but sepia.  
A flower relinquishing will connect  
the fuming sky of a planet.
