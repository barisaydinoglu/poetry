Since The End Of Impaling
-------------------------
Always you delude through the afternoon  
toward the day impaling essences. The elder smiles at the astronaut  
But the gentleman does not smile  
when he looks at the jaguar man  
and the boney ocean.  
One aerial option and a current of enchanting  
crown  
that does not know why it flows and lives.
