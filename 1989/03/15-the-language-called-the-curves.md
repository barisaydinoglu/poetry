The Language Called The Curves
------------------------------
A calculating projection coagulates  
even the handsome  
algorithmic area in sequence  
to which the metaphor  
will not be made.  
Opaque yellow electricity to my barbaous quilt!  
In your mouth of wiping the heights begins to dream of protecting.  
Has the thicket been promised with secrets?
