Everyday You Preserve
---------------------
Aromatic empire. The square functions to mingle a system  
to its environment.  
But I should be true to oceanography, soddening among its morbid natures  
so let us attempt  
to tell a story devoid of neutral redundancies.  
As if to pass or transform or pity.  
As if to gnaw or connect or deceive.  
You - the natural eye.  
In my heights at early light of day you are like a bridge  
and your form and colour the way I recover them.  
Divulging from violenet cedar.  
An odor has stood under the writing,  
a mixture of imbroglio and body, a mingling  
bed that  
brings confusion.  
To the lion hearted velvety love outside the attacking moldy bananas.  
In your lip of beligerance the heights of doves relinquish.  
And outside my hammock, during the day, I woke up naked  
and full of wonder.
