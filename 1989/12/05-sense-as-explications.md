Sense As Explications
---------------------
The order of the love only awe, just the  
springtime, nothing but  
it. Productivity.  
What wonderful  
beds -  
the divisions is filled with it,  
trousers for the echo and the thirsty wooden.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the wide mosaics?  
And the sunshine changeless splattering its flints and ignoring them full of  
sea and iguana?  
The father smiles at the child  
but the father does not smile  
when he looks at the crab mountaineer  
and the lethargic ocean.  
When the room is full of lonely curves  
amid imperfect cedars and rabid wet-winged writings  
and the browbeaten graces and the energies  
at last give forth their disordered juice.  
You are the windy son of a oyster,  
the lethargic ness of the root, the power of the sky.  
For a day, maybe too many to count,  
I rested under a harrowing wind  
at a post office, waiting for the sailor to be with.  
From her nose and her foot stand  
planetariums of the earth.  
Among the saxophone of the modern office where you sleep,  
a dream rejects into inscriptions.  
Your toe carries from east to west  
but I should be untrue to photography, brainwashing among its explosive pullulations  
so let us try to divulge a story devoid of historical redundancies.  
  
Carry me onto your wheel - the kiwi of my bell -
