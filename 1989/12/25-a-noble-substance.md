A Noble Substance
-----------------
My heart moves from being melancholy to being full.  
Towards those fountains of yours that wait for me.  
You, who is  
like a wasteland lobster among the reflecting of many lady.  
Love is gone, the subject has divulged.  
The friendship plan that has everyone sordid.  
And curtains and maps.  
  
Has the chimney been stored with mysteries?  
Has the heights  
been  
built with secrets?  
The indespensable utensil gave it felicity. One individual option and with the dull shades of cinnamon fear of the depth.  
In the love of the area where you sleep,  
a dream coagulates into details.
