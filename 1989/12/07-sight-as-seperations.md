Sight As Seperations
--------------------
You reconcile my neon martyr  
like a irreducable elephant to fresh grape.  
You've asked me what the bird is appreciating there with his green eye?  
I reply, the lake knows this.  
Brings all the coagulates horses.  
Gnaw me and let my  
substance chirp.  
Of a rust colored person that flies currents.  
Draw from it the rabid  
calculation of its own sequence.
