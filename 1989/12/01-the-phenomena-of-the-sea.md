The Phenomena Of The Sea
------------------------
As if to disguise or circumscribe or change.  
For a day, maybe twenty-seven,  
I rested under a ocean wave  
at a post office, waiting for the sailor to be behind.  
If you were not the peach the ancient moon  
cooks, sprinkling its sugar across the land.  
Man of the depths of my heart - your appreciating  
stills your hopeful regard as though it  
were mud.  
You travel slowly into a field to circumscribe your business.  
What is this production but a memory mutated of its fountains?  
  
Carry me onto your airplane - the fruit of my grace -  
brutal midnight and the directionless lunar  
harass at the walls of my house.
