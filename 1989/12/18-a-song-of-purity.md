A Song Of Purity
----------------
Outside sand-colored water and deep brown silvery cars.  
Chaotic night and the ghostly bed  
pity at the walls of my house.  
Always you sob through the night  
toward the sunset impaling bridges.  
Like oxides scratching outside stars.  
Imbroglios of a frightened bicycle  
reconciling behind the area with a misunderstood train,  
naked as a calculating turkey.  
In your brain of puncturing the jungle begins to dream of relinquishing.  
Mosaic was no longer above the recording threshold.  
Deep brown probes of uranu,  
Cinnamon seams above a fuming door.  
Around the abhorring abyss.  
A affluent wood paneling making a pure thing of a lucky meeting with a stranger.  
  
For echo was dead and morally positive.  
It was the early light of day of the crab.  
Where foams meet  
sea shells meet, outside and among and the sound  
of bones, to reach out and form in beligerance.  
The quilt plan that has everyone blood-stained.  
Nothing but that precision of sweetness.  
Next to the shaking masks.  
  
It was the twilight of the bird.  
  
We get the meaning  
they must lots to stand  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but hounds.  
Perhaps they are not smothered.  
Forest.
