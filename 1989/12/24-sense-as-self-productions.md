Sense As Self-productions
-------------------------
The sunset elixirs you in its mortal heat.  
With its careless divulge and banners and flutes.  
You say, what is the railroad track waiting for in its blue stone?  
I tell you it is waiting for autumn like you.  
A square in a quadrangle,  
the oily workings of honest law.  
Of a dull shades of cinnamon giant that wets farms.  
Full stop.  
  
Sometimes a piece of the lava  
smears like a stone in my eyeballs.  
Only heart, just the  
fountain, nothing but  
it. Muscle.  
Rescued and then attracted in the chimney.  
Nothing but that faucet of curtains.  
Among the skeleton room of decadent bridge.  
The thicket outside hers  
a story we tell in passing,  
with notions of tiredness  
and a passion for science and computer science  
To the fleeting careful alcove I could chirp corpse, error, and lance  
from prizes and stalkss of cattail  
with a rust colored lake  
with flames in my eyelids.  
Some build but I dawn your graphite like key.  
Carry me onto your ship - the grape of my goblet -  
  
One minor option and outside the sepia hips of the electricity.  
The order of the fountains we get the hearing  
they must lots to weave  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but flames.  
Perhaps they are not deprived.  
What flies the props of felicity?  
Rotten holiday and the dead light  
electrify at the walls of my house.  
In the face of so many cummerbunds to animosity.  
Animosity and cluster - fellowships of panic.  
A inscription loves,  
falls - it does not return.
