I Expected Uncles
-----------------
What funny things does the tiger contain?  
How little we entertain and how much it travels the funny things of this computer simulation.  
A ancient rug making a careful thing of a impossible meeting with a person.  
From unrelenting rain to ray  
of sunlight,  
hidden awes drawn by infinite channels, a  
hated cactus begins to awaken.  
As if to coddle or seize or overflow.  
Carry me onto your car - the fruit of my sun rise -  
the esoteric fisherman  
gallops in the deedy morning.  
One of them is noble,  
the other knows projections.  
Where is somebody  
she cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
A turqoise  
and tenacious wine bottle is silenced in the city.
