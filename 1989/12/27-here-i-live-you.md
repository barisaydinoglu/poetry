Here I Live You
---------------
The university around hers  
a story we speak in passing,  
with notions of tiredness  
and a passion for jouranlism and jouranlism  
I stayed fashioned and cinnamon  
behind the university.  
Recovered and then drank in the universe.  
Behind the salt of the thicket where you sleep,  
a dream petrifies into languages.  
This decadent flute and living film soddens me  
with it's clear mirrors like heart and eyelids  
and rust colored ribbons like brow and warmths of your body.  
From tornado to blade of grass,  
hidden peaces drawn  
by thick channels, a  
bitterest sweetnes begins to love.  
Carry me onto your bicycle - the mango of my forest -  
when you refresh like propeller promised by the earth.  
Which is a profound sea shell of directions  
thousand or too few to count, set  
on a phemonana or in the decisive momentum  
directions of the leg, a calculation in your legs.  
Halfway.  
When you divulge perfumed like a eddy.  
To carry lost atoms and for hats.  
So the smooth respect lives on in a orange,  
the decisive house of the flute,  
The monastic sun rise that is romantic and enduring.
