I Expected Ones
---------------
There ought to be an alcove of a irreducable  
current promising in a land.  
Dry pioneers and gods.  
For me they are public.  
There ought to be a pencil of an absent minded bolt of fused quartz architecture blossoming in a land.  
Lighting toward the affection you divulge headlong into a universe to store your business.  
Multitude of blue lakes!  
In and out of the sunburst orange  
the yellow and the green  
what is this study but a memory smeared of its phemonanas?  
And the telegraph to its shades of crimson  
and among the rituals the arcane one  
the gentleman covered with spacious snow.
