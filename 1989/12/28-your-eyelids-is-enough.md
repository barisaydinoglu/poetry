Your Eyelids Is Enough
----------------------
There are no dusts but listless cycles of sweetnes and deep brown  
saxophones of lovely troubled clay. Happiness is gone, the subject has discovered.  
In my university at morning you are like a sea's skin  
and your form and colour the way I reflect them.  
Halfway.  
I was without doubt the custodian squirrel  
there in the rustling divisions.  
When it looked me with its lyrical thread eyes  
it had neither heart nor foot  
but gem sea shells on its sides.
