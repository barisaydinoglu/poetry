I Have Gone Conquering
----------------------
A lashed point of view dismantles  
even the serene  
algorithmic boulevard in computer  
to which the metaphor  
will not be heard.  
Halfway.  
And next to my hammock, during the sunrise, I woke up naked  
and full of happiness.  
And essences and river banks.  
The aroma knows this,  
that life in it's silk boxes is as endless as the serenity.  
A flute -like corruption  
a wreath focuses its dream of a ending, its new beginning, the old ending of the bottle order -  
its irreducable violas.
