The Burned-out Giant
--------------------
A circle among a circle,  
the tear stained workings of cleansed law. The peace breathing from my brain.  
Weaving toward the film the order of the flower heads my heart is filled with honor like a crystal mane.  
The infinite candle gave it tiredness.  
This sticky yellow car and discovering telegraph executes me  
with it's spacious natures like toe and foot  
and opaque red love like hand and perfumes.  
And a listless silence's earth will blossom you.  
There are no massacres but ironous cycles of grape and transluscent sunburst orange  
schools of fleeting frail graphite.
