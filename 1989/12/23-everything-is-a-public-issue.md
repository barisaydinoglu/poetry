Everything Is A Public Issue
----------------------------
The reasons for my respect  
are protected in my shoulder of ceramic.  
Went reflected in curtain I was without doubt the giant bird  
there in the fragmented area.  
When it looked me with its essential ripple eyes  
it had  
neither mouth nor brain  
but ivory energies on its sides.
