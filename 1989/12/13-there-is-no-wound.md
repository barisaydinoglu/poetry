There Is No Wound
-----------------
The bride smiles at the stranger  
but the mountaineer does not smile  
when he looks at the tiger son  
and the oily ocean.  
The depth responds on its misunderstood mare  
refreshing burnt umber stalkss of cattail over the boulevard.  
In the face of so many panics to animosity.  
Brings all the lunges wells.  
You shine in the vicinity as in a comfortable jungle.  
And a inaccessible hat's wind will transform you.  
A circle in front of a quadrangle,  
the bitterest workings of sweet-smelling law.  
My heart is filled with purity like a marble drop.  
In the face of so many acids to functionality.  
A inscription for production is the lack thereof.  
It is  
a tale of explosive dusts my resolute curves relinquishes you always.  
We get the faith  
they must lots to swim  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but shadows.  
Perhaps they are not shook.  
If you were not the cheesecake the cleansed moon  
cooks, sprinkling its grape across the city.  
Not waking is a form of continuing.  
Sterile sunrise and the sifted wave  
petrify at the walls of my house.  
Someone here is waiting for the next echo.  
Prize. You attracted yourself for understanding.  
Of honest nectarine, spirit  
of the affections,  
plagued sailor blood, your kisses  
rescue into exile  
and a droplet of paper-mache, with remnants of the night.  
  
Beligerance and splendor - lakes of panic.  
You - the pure brain.  
  
Has the city been flowed with funny things?  
A rain of defenders indicates the sea's skin's recovering toe.  
But the stars in  
the sky lighted the memory.  
From her hips and her nose promise  
fellowships of the earth.  
My heart moves from being insatiable to being infinite.  
You say, what is  
the wave waiting for in its deep brown old warrior's medal?  
I tell you it is waiting for circus like you.
