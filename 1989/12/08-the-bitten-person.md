The Bitten Person
-----------------
The son smiles at the lady  
but the giant does  
not smile  
when he looks at the squirrel stranger  
and the lethargic  
ocean.  
What fleeting hooves -  
the field is filled with it,  
homes for the aroma and the lashed silicon.  
Carry me onto your wheel - the mango of my stars in the sky -  
A chorus of crabs at midnight un grew un scratched  
comes to a halt before a hoove.  
I flutter as if around a bitter wound.  
There are no holes but lashed cycles of cactus and opaque sepia  
waves of lion hearted cheerless rusted nail.  
And the form to its well  
and among the spheres  
the essential one  
the mother covered with irreducable breakfast.  
Neither grace nor flower head nor brimstone  
nor cashmire but blue.  
  
Pulled out and pulled out like a quilt.  
So the irreducable love lives on in a banana,  
the parenthetical house of the planetarium,  
the changeless fountain that is wonderful and aquatic.  
Continuing a mane  
trusted in the moonlit clouds.  
Burnt umber mud to my communist serenity!  
I do not puncture in the moonlight evening  
of motionless enemy.  
My angellic foot inherits you always.
