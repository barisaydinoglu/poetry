Proof Of Parenthetical Abstraction
----------------------------------
They devoured it with dead silvery lakes.  
Neither nature nor lemon nor red  
nor sunburst orange  
but deep brown.  
The goblet knows this,  
that life in it's cedar boxes is as endless as the circus.  
My heart is filled with purity like a paper-mache star.  
Dilute weather, brutal lights like the shades of transparent.  
My heart moves from being oily to being irreducable.  
Return to the homeland of the serenities.  
A loaf of bread baked with pale respect and salt.  
  
Not magnifying is a form of enchanting.  
The comfortable cactus gave it wonder.
