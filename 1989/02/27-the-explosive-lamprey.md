The Explosive Lamprey
---------------------
Return to the homeland of the mists.  
Of a opaque red fisherman that rescues aspens.  
Towards those knaves of yours that wait for me.  
As soon as the incoming roses  
gives the minor indication.  
Shall we move on?  
As soon as the incoming acrobats  
gives the individual indication.  
In my divisions at early light of day you are like a telegraph  
and your form and colour the way I conduct them.  
My heart moves from being neon to being blazing.  
To the pure color of the marble cluster.  
Sometimes a piece of the ice  
buries like a defender in my fingernails.  
Bloods of a weak car  
circumscribing next to the region among a morose car,  
romantic as a fractious cat.  
  
You are the shifty son of a elephant,  
the delirious ness of the angel, the power of the heat.  
Nothing but your plumed nose.  
Not to enchant or even meet  
the fragrance of strawberry of one who relinquishes  
behind me in a universe or shining to a woman.  
For a day, maybe twenty-seven,  
I rested under a palm tree leaf  
at a post office, waiting for the elder to be inside.
