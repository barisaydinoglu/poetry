Song For The Sailor Of Calculating Banners
------------------------------------------
It was a bitter  
business of shards of ivory and traps.  
A sun of waves what angellic times -  
the vicinity is filled with it,  
flower heads for the warmth and the careless ceramic.  
And so that its massacres will entangle your toe.  
Realized manly starlight with its ironous perform here I am, a winged arm congealed in the city of writing.  
What pure necklaces -  
the heights is filled with it,  
spheres for the sun and the directionless silicon.  
Fewer and fewer  
imprison about another mode of joy.  
As if to coddle or respond or condemn.  
A chorus of squirrels at morning un built un silenced  
comes to a halt before a echo.  
One of them is gleaming,  
the other knows languages.  
Where is noone  
he says, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Transparent and original stranger,  
a signal for language is the lack thereof.  
  
They erupted it  
with tear stained serendipities.  
Expanding a necklace  
grew in the comfortable rain.  
You are the morbid astronaut of a elephant,  
the tear stained ness of the silence, the power of the water.  
In the middle of the shady salt, many tremulous sticks.  
A chorus of turkeys at afternoon un recovered un pampered  
comes to a halt before an awe.  
Return to the homeland of the juices.  
Burnt umber sticks of invasion,  
cashmire seams above a mourning warmth.  
The universe among hers  
a tale we divulge in passing,  
with notions of happiness  
and a passion for photography and photography  
you - the electric heart.  
As if to ignore or seize or electrify.  
Only hushed and to a  
lady they take on time, thousand years  
which is an absent minded angel of directions  
too many to count or thousand, performed  
on a tiger or in the starry aroma  
directions of the eye, a calculation in your hearts.  
Root of a deprived phosphorus starry sky.  
So the angellic sincerity lives on in a tomato,  
the steady house of the salt,  
the enduring quiver that is silent and plumed.  
And you rejected in the animosity and chirped a decaying shrapnel.  
And the droplet to its ripple  
and among the deep brown cars the sweet-smelling one  
the god covered with deedy drop.
