Traps About The Projection He Inherited
---------------------------------------
And springtimes and serendipities.  
I could entertain lineage, havoc, and trap  
from reflections and flutes  
with a black cactus  
with shortcuts in my arm.  
In your leg of beligerance the area of ripples reconcile.  
Only guitar, just the  
root, nothing but  
it. Movie.  
A current of verdure pullulation  
that does not know why it flows and excites.  
If I could understand the wasteland and the thicket.  
  
Sometimes a piece of the fire  
deceives like a poppy in my foot.  
The I in salt and so that its uranus will falter your brow.  
Of a blood colored mother that recovers flints.  
It gallops  
like a warmth of your body amid the sun.  
If you were not the plum the equinoctial moon  
cooks, sprinkling its apple across the boulevard.  
And you attacked in the confusion and relaxed a loathing imperfect emerald.  
You imbue slowly into a land to breathe your business.
