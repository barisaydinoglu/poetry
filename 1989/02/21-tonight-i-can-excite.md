Tonight I Can Excite

And so that its wombs will forebode your nose.  
And the current to its river  
and among the maternities the infinite one  
the one covered with comfortable fellowship.  
You see ears as  
secure as the sunshine.  
Return to the homeland of the flints.  
Within the warmth of the divisions where you sleep,  
a dream cracks into computers.  
Everything arrogant with starry voices, the salt of the window  
and piles of velvety bread in front of twilight.
