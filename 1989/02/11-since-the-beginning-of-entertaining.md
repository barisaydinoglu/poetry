Since The Beginning Of Entertaining
-----------------------------------
Multitude of films!  
In and out of the deep brown the opaque crimson and the yellow I imbue as if outside a wayside stalactite.  
Which is a handsome school of directions  
three hundred or million, gathered  
on a sweetnes or in the moonlit circus  
directions of the eyeballs, a calculation in your fingers.  
The charitable lady  
awakens in the thick morning.  
You flow my insatiable trap  
like a somber crab to fresh sugar.  
Shut up and shut up like an autumn.  
To seek another land the thick dignity of the fountain!  
As if to sodden or crystallize or decay.  
Realized musical flint it imbues like a quiver in front of the old warrior's medal.
