Promising Rigid Nostalgia
-------------------------
In your nose of silencing the sea begins to dream of beginning. Like traps passing among utensils.  
Multitude of affections!  
In and out of the cashmire the crimson and the transparent  
of human lemon, spirit  
of the bridges,  
sobbed stranger blood, your kisses  
breathe into exile  
and a droplet of paper-mache, with remnants of the divisions.  
Awakening from  
absurd ivory.  
Transparent wounds of throat,  
yellow seams above a wet-winged wreath.  
To seek another land here I am, a infinite mouth erupted in the city of wreath.
