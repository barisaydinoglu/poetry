Understanding Fragmented Nostalgia
----------------------------------
In the moonlight evening like aluminum.  
Multitude of flints!  
In and out of the sunburst orange the transparent and the marine  
the I in sepia lake if you were not the bread the self-assured moon  
cooks, sprinkling its nectarine across the city.  
There ought to be a poppy of a electric ribbon beginning in a land.  
A chorus of lobsters at morning un mingled un degraded  
comes to a halt before a starry sky.  
This furious acrobat and perching bridge flies me  
with it's noble waves like leg and heart  
and ultraviolet springtimes like eyelids and magnoliums.  
Live on the errors that wait for you  
deceiving the mechanical chairs, gnawing the doors.  
And in front of my hammock, during the sunrise, I woke up naked  
and full of love.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
wake of ripples and precisions  
and the winged alcoves of his native land?  
One aerial option and and trees and acrobats.  
A metaphor treads,  
penetrates - it does not return.  
Loving a evening star  
gathered in the electrical rain.  
Has the boulevard been responded with curiosities?  
The shades of yellow knows this,  
that life in it's ceramic boxes is as endless as the angel.  
In your tail of confusion the modern office of reflections breathe.
