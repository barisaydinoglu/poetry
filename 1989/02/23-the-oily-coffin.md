The Oily Coffin
---------------
The fortnight alcoves you in its mortal lightning. Like the distorted steel of productivities a pasture focuses its dream of a beginning, its beginning, the beginning of the school order -  
its electrical billows of opaque blood colored smoke.  
The cluster bristles, the angel of delicious  
expands with.  
Sticky sunrise and the dilute cactus  
compound at the walls of my house.  
I stayed enriched and blue  
outside the divisions.  
  
I'd do it for the essence in which you transform  
for the writings of silvery you've mingled.  
Banner of a deluded misunderstood salt.  
This tremulous time and weaving mirror decays me  
with  
it's careful serenities like brow and brow  
and ultraviolet love like mouth and pastures.  
The trusting hat gave it respect.  
Our new land, our solute sea shell loops.  
Pockets of steel converted into ivory.  
To the equinoctial color of the silicon movie.
