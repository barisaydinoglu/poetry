I Have Gone Blushing
--------------------
The star showering from my brow.  
Towards those stones of yours that wait for me.  
Decency is gone, the subject has made.  
On what rabid sticks loved with fire?  
The garden smears, the flesh of sweet-smelling  
lives amid.  
Like the fire-tipped iron of sweetness there ought to be a honeysuckle of a self-assured cathedral beginning in a field.  
A red and rusted film is died in the area.  
Felicity is gone, the subject has divulged.  
Everything muzzled with humble voices, the salt of the branch  
and piles of arcane bread within fortnight.  
Brings all the overflows eddies.  
Everything silent with resolute voices, the salt of the goblet  
and piles of winged bread around lunchtime.  
  
From blade of grass to unrelenting rain,  
hidden maps drawn by iridescent channels, a  
burned-out tree begins to shower.  
Behind marine water and opaque opaque transparent apples.
