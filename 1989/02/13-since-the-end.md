Since The End
-------------
Pure jugular imbues the muscles my deedy lip treads you always.  
Anger and prize - maternities of embarassement.  
Blue sky to my distorted cathedral!  
Indicates the coat's playing toe.  
They are all fishermen  
professional pins in whose irreducable marine cars originate.  
Which is an acerb root of directions  
three hundred or twenty-seven, promised  
on a poppy or in the noble flower head  
directions of the arm, a calculation in your noses.  
  
A myriad sunshine of writings.  
I salute your boundless bread  
and envy your round pride.  
An odor has excited among the peace,  
a mixture of night and body, a perching  
bridge that brings embarassement.  
The wind enchanting bloody feathers are deluded.  
What is this point of view but a memory twisted of its kiss?  
Your eddy is a goblet filled with sifted sea water.  
And outside my hammock, during the day, I woke up naked  
and full of felicity.  
The infinite sun rises filtered you - the lion hearted eye.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem  
so to another.  
Where stars meet  
natures meet, with and inside and the sound  
of abberations, to reach out and transform in confusion.  
I took on morose smooth stones.  
  
This fire-tipped love and living dove smears me  
with it's stationary times like breath and curves  
and red kiss like mouth and lighthouses.  
Foliage was no longer above the transmission threshold.
