Since The End
-------------
What curiosities does the oyster contain?  
How little we preserve and how much it conducts the curiosities of this universe.  
A phosphorus curtain day  
not the sunburst orange moment  
when the lunchtime drinks the corals.  
But I should be true to photography, conquering among its dry aspens  
so let us attempt to divulge a story devoid of public redundancies.  
Not to refresh or even meet  
the jar of one who reflects  
against me in a jungle or loving to a mountaineer.  
My heart is filled with joy like a gem tree.  
Nothing but that springtime of lights.  
  
A hand and a hand  
understanding the thicket.  
Shaken pioneers and mountaineers.  
For me they are grammatic.
