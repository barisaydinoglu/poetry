From What Are Bells Lighted
---------------------------
Neither juice nor honeysuckle nor red  
nor cashmire but silvery.  
And souls and kiss.  
My heart is filled with tiredness like a paper-mache snow.  
Yellow salivas of trap,  
cashmire seams above a bruised drop.  
You are the apple of my careless fingernails.  
Pure panic plays the snows I do not deform in the thicket of putrid probe.  
Conversations of energies, the recitation  
of transluscent transluscent yellow lakes we call irreducable nature.  
My heart is filled with decency like a marble  
magnolium.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the parenthetical aspens?  
And the sun essential splattering its love and soddening them full of  
field and crab?  
Rescuing the poppy of her quilt full of sincerity.  
The molested turkey lights in the vertical nails.  
Against the archipeligos like graphite.  
Troubled weather, tenacious lights like the tryst.
