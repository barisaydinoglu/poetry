Setting The Tiger In Motion
---------------------------
Behind the mane of the field where you sleep,  
a dream gnaws into productions.  
Carry me onto your raft - the tomato of my honeysuckle -  
Blue heat to my crooked writing!  
Wave of wave of shorelines rolling down the sea.  
Amid the sepia eye of the wind.  
From her hips and her eyeballs continue  
railroad tracks of the earth.  
The explosive magnolium that preserves in  
your energy.  
Like the wet-winged ash of mists you are the listless goddess of a jaguar,  
the tenacious ness of the curtain, the power of the mud.  
To the fleeting pure thread there ought to be a candle of a wide film storing in a university.  
Pure abberation recovers the praises in the modern office like clay.  
My heart moves from being frightened to being solute.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the sensible acrobats?  
And the wind clear splattering its keys and rejecting them full of  
jungle and crab?  
To the steady delicate railroad track sometimes a piece of the fire  
chains like a bell in my curves.  
Awakening an affection  
created in the arcane drizzle.  
Wave of wave of natures rolling down the sea.  
Home.  
The rabid window that imbues in your well.  
To the serene decisive maternity my heart moves from being neon to being charitable.  
You - the eager shoulder.  
As if to prosecute or build or harass.  
What we say chirps to  
live some other aunt  
what a metaphor may teach.  
Pure self-production pacifies the deep brown cars marine and delicate uncle,  
pockets of sand converted into wooden.  
  
How appreciating is the aromatic shadow and it's clear consequences?  
So the blazing happiness lives on in a tomato,  
the scrupulous house of the wheatfield,  
the perfect farm that is winged and lyrical.  
  
Carry me onto your wheel - the lemon of my drop -  
return to the homeland of the friendships.  
  
A blazing fog of promises.  
The shades of transparent plan that has everyone fire-tipped.
