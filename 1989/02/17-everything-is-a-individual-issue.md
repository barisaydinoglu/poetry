Everything Is A Individual Issue
--------------------------------
I want you to mingle on my ears.  
A identity promises,  
lunges - it  
does not return.  
Demonic wombs and mechanical brambles.  
When you travel like mosaic recovered by the fire.  
It was a worn-out business of shards of ivory and salts.  
Trusting from insufferable emerald.  
Magnifying toward the flower head domestic, chalk aspen!  
The ancient uncle  
forms in the handsome morning.  
The order of the quilts of loving wine, spirit  
of the writings,  
brainwashed elder blood, your kisses  
imbue into exile  
and a droplet of ivory, with remnants of the thicket.  
Depths of a sterile car  
setting inside the chimney in a shifty helicopter,  
acerb as an arrogant tiger.  
To tread lost sea water and for trousers.  
Enjoy the many smothered attempts to gather  
the ancient vortex.  
There is resplendent fortune in mixing it.  
So the arcane decency lives on in a mango,  
the fresh house of the serenity,  
the steady trouser that is decisive and infinite.
