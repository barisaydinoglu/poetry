What Is True Of The Praise Is True Of Everything

I took on whirlwinds of stars. A machine responds,  
degrades - it does not return.  
Everything chaotic with iridescent voices, the salt of the ribbon  
and piles of affluent bread with twilight.  
I could conduct stick, seperation, and stench  
from laminated signs and sea water  
with a gray ribbon  
with jackals in my ears.
