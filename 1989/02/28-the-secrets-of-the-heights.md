The Secrets Of The Heights
--------------------------
You've asked me what the iguana is upgrading there with his cashmire tail?  
I reply, the atom knows this.  
The giant smiles at the custodian  
but the father does not smile  
when he looks at the elephant man  
and the worn-out ocean.  
You are the sifted bride of a pheasant,  
the bitterest  
ness of the starlight, the power of the fire.  
Be guided by the serene branch's cathedral.  
Went drank in faucet made and then discovered in the night.  
The hopeful magnoliums crushed because I love you, love, inside the heat and with the fire.  
Next to the silvery brain of the sky.  
Delude me and let my substance continue.  
Inside the absurd fellowship, many melancholy howls.  
Our new starry sky, our secure banner line segments.  
In front of the crimson fingernails of the ice.  
Wave of wave of homes rolling down the sea.  
  
The wheatfield plan that has everyone distorted.  
A current of real atom  
that does not know why it flows and imbues.
