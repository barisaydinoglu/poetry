Since The Beginning Of Soddening
--------------------------------
A ship rustling will divulge  
the sterile clay of a planet. A troubled bottle day  
but the fountain perched the memory.  
Where knaves meet  
dews meet, in and in front of and the sound  
of clandenstines, to reach out and entertain in sorrow.
