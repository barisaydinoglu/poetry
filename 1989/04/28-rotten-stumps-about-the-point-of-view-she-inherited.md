Rotten Stumps About The Point Of View She Inherited
---------------------------------------------------
It is a tale of senile clocks the ritual knows this,  
that life in it's chalk boxes is as endless as the leaf.  
When you carry like miracle relinquished by the earth.  
As if to deceive or breathe or reject.  
Like dominions coagulating inside hearts.  
It's a storing precision of trash barges.  
You say, what is the maternity waiting for in its transluscent yellow quilt?  
I tell you it is waiting for fellowship like you.  
But the home perched the memory.  
The pioneer smiles at the goddess  
but the custodian does not smile  
when he looks at the iguana uncle  
and the lewd ocean.  
A current of fleeting tiger  
that does not know why it flows and swims.  
Shall we set forth?
