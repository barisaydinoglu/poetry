A Song Of Love
--------------
Absorbant empire. The tetrahedron functions to reflect a environment  
to its system.  
The resolute one  
weaves in the resolute morning.  
Waking toward the necklace I was without doubt the one pheasant  
there in the banal divisions.  
When it looked me with its delicate friendship eyes  
it had neither brow nor toe  
but crystal  
corals on its sides.  
From her fingernails and her finger awaken  
smooth stones of the earth.  
To seek another land yellow lava to my torrential form!  
Rise on the alarms that wait for you  
deluding the sordid chairs, pitying the doors.  
For a day, maybe too few to count,  
I rested under a harrowing wind  
at a post office, waiting for the cousin to be around.  
It was the twilight of the ostrich.  
My  
heart  
moves from being explosive to being aromatic.  
Sand-colored wind to my boney kis!  
Like barbaous breakfast, productivities  
joy is gone, the subject has recovered.  
And  
the wine bottle to its alcove  
and among the flutes the equinoctial one  
the mountaineer covered with silent quilt.  
She is behind us at this moment of first inheriting.  
So the eloquent wonder lives on in a cherry,  
the hidden house of the goblet,  
the solute writing that is wonderful and boundless.  
  
I am froze by flesh and stalactite, by bloodied metal and sun.  
He is inside us at this moment of first divulging.  
  
It was the afternoon of the turkey.  
You see eyelids as incredulous as the sunshine.  
The order of the drops among the yellow curves of the wind.  
A circle around a circle,  
the atrocious workings of resolute law.  
Always you ignore through the late afternoon  
toward the midnight gnawing mists.  
I wish to make a line  
next to, and every abstraction, many  
times hidden in a moon.  
Not the crimson moment  
when the twilight chirps the tigers.  
I'm  
the pioneer to the stalks of cattail of immediate wreath.
