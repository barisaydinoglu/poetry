Pioneers Must Always Prove Their Wheatfields
--------------------------------------------
And crimson lakes and serendipities.  
You are the fuming custodian of a jaguar,  
the clotting ness of the alcove, the power of the fire.  
  
Misunderstood sunrise and the dry elixir  
congeal at the walls of my house.  
Because I love you, love, in the ice and next to the water.
