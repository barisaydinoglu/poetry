Your Mouth Is Enough
--------------------
If you were not the sugar the sensible moon  
cooks, sprinkling its nectarine across  
the vicinity. I salute your resolute lemon  
and envy your fluidic pride.  
Only putrid and to a  
woman they take on time, million years  
and the warmth to its movie  
and among the shadess of cashmire the mineral one  
the mother covered with dashing jar.  
A springtime focuses its dream of a beginning, its new ending, the old ending of the serendipity order -  
its perfect wounded soldiers.  
  
Shut out and shut up like a jar.  
Your trouser is a love filled with dilute star.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
return of droplets and salts  
and the cosmic quivers of his native land?  
It's a storing praise of holes.  
And the path to its wreath  
and among the saxophones the romantic one  
the person covered with warm ivory architecture.  
Sometimes a piece of the electricity  
invades like a moon in  
my lip.  
I want you to continue on my fingernails.
