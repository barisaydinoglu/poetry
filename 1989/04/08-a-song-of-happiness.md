A Song Of Happiness
-------------------
Performing from hushed wooden.  
I could entertain enemy, moth, and vortex  
from knaves and starss in the sky  
with a dark starry sky  
with vortices in my fingernails.  
Brings all the throttles kiss.  
In your hips of agony the night of railroad tracks reflect.  
She is in the middle of us at this moment of first discovering.  
Draw from it the neurotic  
projection of its own production.  
A foliage -like trapdoor  
we open the halves of a mysteries and the  
erupting of rotten stumps drinks into the aromatic land.  
He is in us  
at this moment of first pulsing.  
For a day, maybe too few to count,  
I rested under a tornado  
at a bus stop, waiting for the man to be around.  
  
Where trees meet  
currents meet, amid and in front of and the sound  
of egoes, to reach out and entertain in anger.  
To the delicious eager well the I in stone an airplane is not enough to hate me and keep me  
from the university of your smooth phenomena.
