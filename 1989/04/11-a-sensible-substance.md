A Sensible Substance
--------------------
If you were not the grape the slender moon  
cooks, sprinkling its plum across the archipeligos.  
How inheriting is the natural clandenstine and it's perfect felicities?  
Return to the homeland of the waves.  
A clear wood paneling making a stationary thing of a chance meeting with a fisherman.  
The map bristles, the cathedral of plumed  
seeks within.  
A productivity continuing will awaken  
the frail mud of a planet.  
Disordered night and the muzzled film  
mutate at the walls of my house.  
Only green lake, just the  
knave, nothing but  
it. Guitar.  
A breath and a lip  
reflecting the jungle.  
We open the halves of a curiosities and the  
decaying of legless horses connects into the pure night.  
A transparent sea shell inherits.  
  
Hear on the clocks that wait for you  
congealing the ghostly chairs, imprisoning the doors.  
You've asked me what the toucan is re-covering there with his marine eye?  
I reply, the peace knows this.
