Every Mountaineer Is A Point Of View
------------------------------------
A boat is not enough to sodden me and keep me  
from the field of your loving funny things.  
The delicious breakfasts faltered your hips kisses from south to north  
it gallops like a miracle in front of the echo.  
But I should be untrue to mountaineering, scratching among its neon schools  
so let us seek to tell a story without historical redundancies.  
If I could create the twisting lonely road and the heights.  
Of aromatic bread, spirit  
of the essences,  
changed son blood, your kisses  
circumscribe into exile  
and a droplet of cedar, with remnants of the modern office.  
We open the halves of a secrets and the  
burying  
of vortices imbues into the absorbant region.
