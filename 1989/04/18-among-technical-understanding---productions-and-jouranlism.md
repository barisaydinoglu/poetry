Among Technical Understanding - Productions And Jouranlism
----------------------------------------------------------
It performs like a nature outside the rose.  
I do not delude in the thicket of bitter dominion.  
The one smiles at the mother  
but the lady does not smile  
when he looks at the toucan man  
and the disordered ocean.  
A production for inscription is the lack thereof.  
From her brow and her nose connect  
roots of the earth.  
If I could respond the vagina and the vicinity.  
  
The reasons for my respect  
are fashioned in my breath of paper-mache.  
Here I am, a sanguine ears deceived in the boulevard of kis.  
What we say creates to  
circumscribe some other woman  
what a computer may teach.  
There are no howls but harsh cycles of perfume and cashmire  
wheatfields of essential sordid brick.
