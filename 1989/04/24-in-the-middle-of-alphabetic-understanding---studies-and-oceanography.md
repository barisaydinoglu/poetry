In The Middle Of Alphabetic Understanding - Studies And Oceanography
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Carry me onto your raft - the tomato of my prize -  
sometimes a piece of the heat  
petrifies like a wave in my mouth.  
Attracting toward the pullulation embarassement and river bank - jars of beligerance.  
He is in us at this moment of first trusting.  
Draw from it the spoiled  
point of view of its own signal.  
A technique for identity is the lack thereof.  
What is this projection but a memory wiped of its manes?  
We  
open the halves of a epiphany and the  
penetrating of moths forms into the aquatic heights.  
Around the sea I like to dedicate like a senile river.  
  
The cosmic starlights degraded you are the apple of my burned-out finger.  
For a day, maybe million,  
I rested under a pillow of fog  
at a bus stop, waiting for the one to be in.
