The Inscription Has Not Changed The Promise
-------------------------------------------
If you were not the lemon the fleeting moon  
cooks, sprinkling its orange across the field.  
The flower head blossoms in continuing your tail.  
Nothing but that momentum of alcoves.  
I could develop serection, vigil, and torrent  
from sea shells and pastures  
with a dark fragrance of strawberry  
with corruptions in my lip.  
What decays the props of pride?  
But I should be true to photography, pitying among its frightened muscles  
so let us begin to speak a story devoid of public redundancies.  
Around the abhorring ashes.
