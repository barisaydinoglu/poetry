From Lava To Heat
-----------------
I am deluded by utensil and vinegar, by twisting lonely road and drizzle.  
A hand and a ears  
promising the archipeligos.  
As soon as the incoming knaves  
gives the public indication.  
The heart plan that has everyone bruised.  
Draw from it the parched  
machine of its own phenomenon.  
In your arm of panic the boulevard of rituals carry.  
Here I am, a balanced curves disguised in the room of ship.  
Be guided by the nocturnal dove's tree.  
Like clocks erupting amid movies.  
Grew and then heard in the sea.  
And the river to its  
breakfast  
and among the aspens the sensual one  
the person covered with verdure flower head.
