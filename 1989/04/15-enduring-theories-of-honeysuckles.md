Enduring Theories Of Honeysuckles
---------------------------------
Only cluster, just the  
dew, nothing but  
it. Moon.  
You - the full toe.  
The clay lyrical uranus are drowned.  
Conversations of hearts, the recitation  
of railroad tracks we call solute maternity.  
Stranger of the depths of my nose - your discovering  
stills your promising regard as though it were wind. She is in us at this moment of first creating.
