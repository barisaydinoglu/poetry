The Bristling Of A Custodian Down A Chimney
-------------------------------------------
Only sun, just the  
springtime, nothing but  
it. Starlight.  
There are no clocks but brutal cycles of jar and blue  
apples of original morose ash.  
Law.  
In your brow of passing the heights begins to dream of refreshing.  
A current of serendipidous smooth stone  
that does not know why it flows and crystallizes.  
Nothing but your noble lip.  
You see shoulder as equinoctial as the thunder.  
The fortnight river banks you in its mortal fire.  
There  
are no panics but calculating cycles of peace and cashmire  
lighthouses of natural brutal broken glass.  
I saw how cathedrals are entertained  
by the angellic telegraph.
