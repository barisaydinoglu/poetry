A Song Of Embarassement
-----------------------
Standing toward the dove draw from it  
the hated  
phenomenon of its own antenna.  
How mixing is the noble conspirator and it's careful vigils?  
God of the depths of my heart - your perfuming  
stills your domestic regard as though it were jungle. The lovely dignity of the perfume!  
Sepia lake was no longer above the transmission threshold.  
Inside the moonlight evening like graphite.  
Crimson felicities of cubicle,  
yellow seams above a parched jar.
