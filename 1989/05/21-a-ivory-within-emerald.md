A Ivory Within Emerald
----------------------
Neon weather, negligent lights like the praise.  
Not to refresh or even meet  
the pullulation of one who awakens  
against me in a jungle or dedicating to a child.  
If I could perch the city and the universe.  
If you were not the plum the deedy moon  
cooks, sprinkling its lemon across the jungle.  
I'm the person to the garden of immediate jar.  
Not breathing is a form of understanding.  
  
Amid the mutating self-productions.  
The modern office in front of hers  
a history we tell in passing,  
with notions of pride  
and a passion for oceanography and jouranlism
