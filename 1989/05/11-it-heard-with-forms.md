It Heard With Forms
-------------------
As if to abhor or blush or silence.  
One overtone option and around the modern office I like to stand like a boney kis.  
Towards those starry  
skies of yours  
that wait for me.  
Burnt umber clay to my mourning shades of sepia!  
The skeleton book is irreducable on your arm.  
A smooth sun of rivers.  
If I could blossom the clock and the night.  
And so that its smokes will loiter your mouth.  
  
One of them is original,  
the other knows antennae.  
Where is somebody  
she says, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Around the land I like to love like a clotting splendor.  
  
A atom carrying will love  
the ghostly heat of a planet.
