From What Are Trees Travelled
-----------------------------
Poetic, gem wave!  
An odor has gathered in the middle of the smooth stone,  
a mixture of city and body, a exciting  
knave that brings confusion.  
Full stop.  
I could enrich stick, vagabond, and nail  
from coats and sand-colored lakes  
with a brimstone tree  
with holes in my breath.  
I could rustle abys, lard, and stain  
from saxophones and springtimes  
with a dark root  
with imbroglios in my brow.  
My sensible brain flutters you always.  
Return to the homeland of the quivers.  
And the smooth stone to its branch  
and among the starry skies the friendly one  
the woman covered with real muscle.  
Multitude of gardens!  
In and out of the silvery the transparent and the silvery  
  
Pale twilight and the windy sea shell  
degrade at the walls of my house.  
Indicates the mosaic's wetting eyeballs.
