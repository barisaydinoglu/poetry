Song For The Elder Of Morose Curtains
-------------------------------------
A synonym blossoms,  
shatters - it does not return.  
In the middle of the modern office like clay.  
In the smallest ceramic bridge the precision crystallizes in playing your eyeballs.  
The reasons for my respect  
are continued in my curves of diamond.
