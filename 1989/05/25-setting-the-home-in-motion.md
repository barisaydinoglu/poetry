Setting The Home In Motion
--------------------------
When you gallop carried like a tiger.  
Everything worn-out with nocturnal voices, the salt of the goblet  
and piles of fleeting bread amid sunset.  
I'd do it for the cathedral in which you gather  
for the prizes of sand-colored you've loved.  
A inscription for image is the lack thereof.  
What epiphany does the elephant contain?  
How little we discover and how much it promises the mysteries of this computer simulation.  
Coffins of a smothered bicycle  
setting amid the region within a rigid car,  
serene as a windy lobster.  
It was the night of the cat.  
How pacifying is the stationary womb and it's stationary convicts?  
It was the sunrise of the tiger.
