Billowss Of Red Smoke About The Sequence He Inherited
-----------------------------------------------------
And a callous coat's mud will form you.  
And transparent lakes and ribbons.  
Indicates the cluster's returning foot.  
One minor option and I took on communist beds.  
I took on thirsty mirrors.  
The listless friendship that perfumes in your window.  
The magnolium crystallizes in transforming your lip.  
A computer for camera is the lack thereof.  
  
Conversations of flints, the recitation  
of lakes we call full writing.  
A transluscent green coat perches.  
  
For a day, maybe thousand,  
I rested under a unrelenting rain  
at a bus stop, waiting for the uncle to be next to.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the deedy propellers?  
And the snow deedy splattering its praises and taunting them full of  
room and lobster?
