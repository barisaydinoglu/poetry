Since The Beginning Of Smothering
---------------------------------
The furious time that understands in your quilt.  
I stayed woke and transparent  
among the heights.  
And meetings of frail eyelids what promising umbrellas -  
the moonlight evening is filled with  
it,  
reflections for the thread and the shaken marble.  
The key harasses, the saxophone of soft  
reconciles with.  
The awe knows this,  
that life in it's silken boxes is as endless as the flag.
