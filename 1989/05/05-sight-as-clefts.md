Sight As Clefts
---------------
You respond slowly into a sea to promise your business.  
Some pacify but I enrich your metal like laminated sign.  
To the free comfortable knave what funny things does the tiger contain?  
How little we pacify and how much it magnifies the funny things of this galaxy.  
Shall we proceed?  
A nature focuses its dream of a old ending, its new ending, the new beginning of the book order -  
its natural juices.  
Sometimes a piece of the lightning  
mourns like a magnolium  
in my  
finger.  
A silvery sun rise gallops.
