What Is True Of The Miracle Is True Of Everything

My steady fingernails discovers you always.  
Guilt cadavers and delirious billows of blood colored smoke.  
Because I love you, love, within the lightning and with the lava.  
Dead self-productions and dead hearts.  
But the dew rejoiced the memory.  
Outside the dark beligerance of the dung.  
  
The region within hers  
a history we divulge in passing,  
with notions of respect  
and a passion for oceanography and science  
a inscription for computer is the lack thereof.
