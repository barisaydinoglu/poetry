Under Of Guitar And Transluscent Green Car
------------------------------------------
Like windy grape, pastures  
what petrifies the props of sincerity? A airplane is not enough to steal me and keep me  
from the universe of your moonlit curiosities.  
Cashmire bloods of billow of gray smoke,  
transparent seams above a neurotic well.  
You are the fruit of my tremulous fingernails.  
This guilt land and galloping form freezes me  
with it's myriad maps like leg and finger  
and dark aromas like hand and sea shells.  
Multitude of trysts!  
In and out of the yellow the sand-colored and the burnt umber  
Barbaous pioneers and aunts.  
For me they are minor.  
Everything chaotic with thick voices, the salt of the key  
and piles of great bread outside day.  
When you transform heard like a root.  
I saw how sea shells are wove  
by the decisive candle.
