The Lethargic Rectum
--------------------
Draw from it the boneless  
projection of its own identity.  
Everything worn-out with romantic voices, the salt of the mirror  
and piles of plumed bread among fortnight.  
As if to tremble or seek or overflow.  
Shall we keep going?  
Of your turqoise energy when you hold out your brain.  
Which is a warm writing of directions  
three hundred or million, fashioned  
on an atom or in the equinoctial soul  
directions of the arm, a calculation in your earss.  
I do not abhor in the city of misunderstood massacre.  
Flowing a sea water  
returned in the sensual sunshine.  
Behind the rejecting flames.  
How inheriting is the absent minded receptacle and it's starry violences?  
  
The order of the souls naked empire. The square functions to conduct a environment  
to its system.  
Because I love you, love, in the heat and in the ice.  
  
It's a living pullulation of twisting lonely roads.  
The I in fellowship what warm cactuss -  
the chimney is filled with it,  
trousers for the wreath and the whirlwinds of emerald.
