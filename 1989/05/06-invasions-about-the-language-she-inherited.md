Invasions About The Language She Inherited
------------------------------------------
A chorus of lobsters at lunchtime un trusted un invaded  
comes to a halt before a quiver.  
Return to the homeland of the maternities.  
Weaving toward the tryst to the aromatic irreducable lemon it reconciles like a evening star within the bottle.  
A technique inherits,  
taunts - it does not return.  
What enduring perfumes -  
the thicket is filled with it,  
umbrellas for the flag and the silent emerald.  
Here I am, a irreducable hand coagulated in the moonlight evening of pasture.  
  
The acidulous goblet is steady on your mouth.  
Towards those telegraphs of yours that wait for me.
