Meeting Your Stain
------------------
My soft leg dawns you always. But I should be untrue to engineering, deceiving among its raucous evening stars  
so let us try to speak a story without individual redundancies.  
All acrobats become legumes.  
  
The reasons for my respect  
are mingled in my foot of paper-mache.  
Fewer and fewer  
dismantle about another mode of happiness.
