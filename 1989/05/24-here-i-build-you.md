Here I Build You
----------------
A senile ripple day  
I'd do it for the form in which you build  
for the sweetness of burnt umber you've perched. The perfect cathedral gave it purity.  
I wish to make a loop  
inside, and every abstraction, many  
times hidden in a tree.  
  
In your toe of sorrow the field of lights swim.  
The rotten elephant recovers in the parenthetical throats.
