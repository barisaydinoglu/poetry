I Have Gone Entertaining
------------------------
You've asked me what the tiger is recovering there with his transparent fingernails?  
I reply, the dove knows this.  
If you were not the plum the parenthetical moon  
cooks, sprinkling its wine across the universe.  
Not beginning is a form of promising.  
And love and umbrellas.  
Embarassement and miracle - circuss of animosity.  
I was without doubt the goddess crab  
there in the delirious thicket.  
When it looked me with its aquatic time eyes  
it had neither eyeballs nor eyeballs  
but chalk corals on its sides.  
The field outside hers  
a history we divulge in passing,  
with notions of purity  
and a passion for photography and mountaineering
