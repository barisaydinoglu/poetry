The Sequence Called The Foot
----------------------------
On what oily acids played with jungle?  
Violences of a tear stained wheel  
drinking among the area around a skeleton car,  
cordial as a dead turkey.  
Reflecting a juice  
appreciated in the hopeful rain.  
A wind of apples where telegraphs meet  
bridges meet, among and among and the sound  
of complaints, to reach out and promise in embarassement.  
With its fractious love on what fatherless corruptions pulsed with mud?  
I awaken as if amid a lashed corpse.  
  
Pure stain re-covers the hats the moonlit dignity of the reflection!
