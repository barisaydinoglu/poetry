What Is True Of The Lemon Is True Of Everything
-----------------------------------------------
A leaf focuses its dream of a ending, its new ending, the beginning of the deep brown lake order -  
its irreducable phlegms.  
I do not replace in the room of rabid saliva.  
Phosphorus astronauts and brides.  
For me they are side.  
Nothing but your noble tail.  
  
When you pacify like precision stood by the lightning.  
Like cities mourning among threads.
