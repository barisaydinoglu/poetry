The Smoke Fallen Into The Sea
-----------------------------
He is in the middle of us at this moment of first preserving.  
As soon as  
the incoming green cars  
gives the overtone indication.  
It's a returning copper architecture of lances.  
In the first scene, the sanguine stranger  
is brainwashed by a one. In the second  
scene he returns, to appreciate and to rise.  
What curiosities does the oyster contain?  
How little we excite and how much it seizes the funny things of this galaxy.  
It was a wounded business of lightning and acids.  
Your ears makes from west to east  
you perform in the archipeligos as in a hopeful heights.  
If you were not the plum the honest moon  
cooks, sprinkling its wine across the room.  
The flute plan that has everyone parched.  
To the verdure color of the glass poppy.  
Like exiled lunar, movies  
in the thirsty fountain, many pale graves.  
Root was no longer above the recording threshold.  
  
Not the blue moment  
when the morning expands the shadess of silvery.  
A splendor focuses its dream of a ending, its new beginning, the ending of the coral order -  
its cosmic rotten stumps.  
You are the rambunctious mountaineer of a toucan,  
the inaccessible ness of the lighthouse, the power of the sky.  
The order of the alcoves deceive me and let my substance swim.
