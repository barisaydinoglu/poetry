The Self-production Fallen Into The Sea
---------------------------------------
In your hand of beligerance the boulevard of angels dedicate.  
I could gallop night, wax, and viola  
from moons and stalkss of cattail  
with a dark door  
with cubicles in my eye.  
Inside the violenet boulevard of inevitable eddy.  
I took on mechanical threads.  
The acid entertains on its nauesous mare  
relaxing transluscent sunburst orange coats over the universe. I want you to seek on my brow.  
Transluscent opaque silvery shadows of clandenstine,  
marine seams above a putrid sphere.  
A tetrahedron outside a square,  
the rambunctious workings of honest law.  
I am decayed by elixir and oxide, by ghost and sun.
