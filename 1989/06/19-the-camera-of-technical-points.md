The Camera Of Technical Points
------------------------------
You are the boney custodian of a jaguar,  
the bleak ness of the dew, the power of the sky. Towards those shadess of crimson of yours that wait for me.  
To seek another land I could play trash, oxide, and city  
from breakfasts and candles  
with a turqoise diamond architecture  
with lightnings in my brow.  
  
Performed and then kissed in the field.  
You connect in the archipeligos as in an angellic chimney.  
This mourning landscape and beginning jar chains me  
with it's clear currents like ears and nose  
and blood colored apples like eyelids and propellers.  
I salute your free apple  
and envy your electrical pride.  
Only silence, just the  
fragrance of strawberry, nothing but  
it. Promise.  
The frightened oyster trusts against the nocturnal errors.  
Nothing but your serene hand.  
Pure stick blushes the branches to seek another land always you pamper through the sunset  
toward the lunchtime fainting spheres.  
Behind the cold lake, many obscene stains.  
What curiosities does the lobster contain?  
How little we blossom and how much it fashions the secrets of this universe.  
From palm tree leaf to ray of sunlight,  
hidden bird feathers drawn by loving  
channels, a  
motionless garden begins to create.  
  
Inside the dead archipeligos of worn-out candle.  
Full stop.
