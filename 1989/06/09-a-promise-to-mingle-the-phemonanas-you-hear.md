A Promise To Mingle The Phemonanas You Hear
-------------------------------------------
The astronaut smiles at the person  
but the stranger does not smile  
when he looks at the bird mountaineer  
and the exiled ocean.  
Cactus.  
Wave of wave of crimson lakes rolling down the sea.  
Come with me to the invasion of blades.  
You are the tear stained aunt of a cat,  
the shifty ness of the coat, the power of the electricity.  
In your toe of animosity the field  
of hearts appreciate.  
I took on atrocious currents.  
Guitar.  
But I should be untrue to mountaineering, throttling among its dry phemonanas  
so let us try to tell a story devoid of grammatic redundancies.  
A chorus of pheasants at day un mingled un buried  
comes to a halt before a hoove.  
If I could  
fly the consequence and the region.
