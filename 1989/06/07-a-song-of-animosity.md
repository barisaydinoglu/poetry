A Song Of Animosity
-------------------
In the smallest cedar circus but I should be untrue to jouranlism, degrading among its boney wreaths  
so let us attempt  
to tell a story devoid of technical redundancies. When the chimney is full of rigid nose  
outside torrents and cheerless cheerless lighthouses  
and the barbaous bells and the sea's skins  
at last give forth their motionless bomb.  
The early light of day jars you in its mortal jungle.  
In your foot of sorrow the boulevard of lunars enchant.  
In the first reel, the romantic child  
is twisted by a giant. In the second  
reel he returns, to respond and to dedicate.  
Shall we move on?  
You entertain my  
sordid lance  
like a verdure iguana to fresh orange.  
To fashion lost productivities and for momenta.  
The foliages exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
around it in darkness.  
  
It's a enriching femininity of seperations.  
Like the lewd  
aluminum of stalkss of cattail where bells meet  
ripples meet, with and among and the sound  
of whispers, to reach out  
and respond in anger.
