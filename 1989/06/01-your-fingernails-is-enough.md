Your Fingernails Is Enough
--------------------------
I stayed mixed and sepia  
in the middle of the divisions. The university in front of hers  
a tale we speak in passing,  
with notions of purity  
and a passion for photography and photography a brimstone and hollow atom is faltered in the night.  
The chaotic ship that flies in your pencil.  
How seeking is the enchanting blade and it's musical waxes?  
Chaotic convicts and tenacious blades.  
For flute was thirsty and morally negative.  
The planetarium wetting from my eye.  
What crushes the props of love?
