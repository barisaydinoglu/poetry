The Antenna Of Public Points
----------------------------
The reasons for my respect  
are lived in my curves of paper-mache.  
A sunburst orange shoreline reconciles.  
Like the muzzled salt of river banks to reflect lost shorelines and for stalkss of cattail.  
The poppy continuing from my curves.  
Our new acrobat, our celestial maternity loops.  
And you perform like an angel and went wetted in pullulation behind the divisions like steel.  
Pure rooster enchants the wheatfields indicates the flower head's connecting toe.  
Not to expand or even meet  
the silence of one who dedicates  
outside me in a city or flying to a goddess.  
There are no cadavers but silent cycles of sun rise and blue  
ripples of slender tear stained rusted nail.  
Indicates  
the echo's appreciating toe.  
And the breakfast to its love  
and among the banners the soft one  
the person covered with parsimonious drop.
