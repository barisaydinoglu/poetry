Abstraction Is An Episode Of Stick
----------------------------------
When you hear like fountain crystallized by the fire. If I could gallop the legless horse and the sea.  
A lyrical linoleum making an acerb thing of a probable meeting with a giant.  
Like martyrs depriving inside dews.  
Carry me onto your raft - the grape of my echo -  
only land, just the  
gem architecture, nothing but  
it. Perfume.  
Outside the dead university of boneless law.  
When you understand like elixir reflected by the clay.  
Draw from it the obscene  
inscription of its own projection.  
As if to shatter or trust or erupt.
