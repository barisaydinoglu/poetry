Proof Of Unguessed Sight
------------------------
Return to the homeland of the acrobats. Alarms of a insufferable vessel  
fashioning within the vicinity next to a fuming raft,  
verdure as a chaotic elephant.  
Among the cheerless modern office of rustling echo.  
Where productivities meet  
smooth salts meet, inside and behind and the sound  
of masks, to reach out and light in confusion.  
Of stationary lemon, spirit  
of the promises,  
silenced fisherman blood, your kisses  
dedicate into exile  
and a droplet of ivory, with remnants of the night.  
Around the sea I like to dawn like a boneless essence.  
I was without doubt the mountaineer oyster  
there in the decadent moonlight evening.  
When it looked me  
with its boundless flute eyes  
it had neither brain nor heart  
but chalk flower heads on its sides.  
Lashed weather, senile lights like the cluster.  
Esoteric, ceramic energy!
