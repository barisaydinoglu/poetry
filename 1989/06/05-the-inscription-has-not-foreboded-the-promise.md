The Inscription Has Not Foreboded The Promise
---------------------------------------------
Like the windy broken glass of clusters sea  
water of an abducted mechanical silence. We open the halves of a mysteries and the  
burying of evils plays into the delicious land.  
And you conduct like a sea shell  
and blue noises of moldy banana,  
green seams above a hated garden.  
The fountain congeals, the circus of sensible  
connects inside.
