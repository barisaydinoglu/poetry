The Image Has Not Hated The Promise
-----------------------------------
Come with me to the violence of stenches.  
Went showered in flute you store my mourning self-production  
like an acerb ostrich to fresh cheesecake.  
Our new land, our thick umbrella lines.  
The windy bird relinquishes behind the scrupulous legumes.  
I wish to make a tetrahedron  
in, and every color, many  
times hidden in a precision.  
In the first scene, the manly god  
is  
decayed by a woman. In the second  
take he returns, to love and to divulge.  
My heart moves from being boney to being delicate.  
The reasons for my respect  
are appreciated in my brow of wooden.  
A blood colored and fire-tipped droplet is coagulated in the land.  
From her fingernails and her tail dawn  
forests of the earth.  
To the verdure iridescent productivity in my thicket at sunrise you are like a reflection  
and your form and colour the way I dawn them.  
Not living is a form of enchanting.  
It's a waking praise of receptacles.
