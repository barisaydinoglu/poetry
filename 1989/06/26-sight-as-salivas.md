Sight As Salivas
----------------
A train is not enough to decay me and keep me  
from the field of your round curiosities.  
The lava loving oxides are coagulated.  
Beligerance and laminated sign - windows of animosity.  
The I in crown when the universe is full of hushed heart  
next to granules and absurd hushed prizes  
and the silent warmths of your body and the river banks  
at last give forth their cheerless trash barge.  
And outside my hammock, during the lunchtime, I woke up naked  
and full of happiness.  
They ignored it with misunderstood keys.  
But I should be true to jouranlism, abandoning among its muzzled miracles  
so let us begin to divulge a story devoid of side redundancies.
