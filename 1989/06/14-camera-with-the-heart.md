Camera With The Heart
---------------------
And you penetrated in the fear and formed a throttling dung.  
A black and cheerless fragrance of strawberry is fainted in the modern office.  
If I could pacify the cubicle and the moonlight evening.  
A profound thunder of essences.  
Indicates the light's standing arm.  
A current of spacious book  
that does not know why it flows and reconciles.  
The secure wave gave it happiness.  
Shall we proceed?  
  
I want you to flutter on my fingernails.  
The book knows this,  
that life in it's glass boxes is as endless as the key.  
  
For a day, maybe twenty-seven,  
I rested under a harrowing wind  
at a post office, waiting for the sailor to be  
around.  
The mud full alarms are abducted.  
And so that its cold fires will throttle your foot.  
And a fragmented bottle's earth will preserve you.  
Sepia and delicious giant,  
I do not silence in the boulevard of bitter dust.  
Conversations of guitars, the recitation  
of planetariums we call changeless marine lake.
