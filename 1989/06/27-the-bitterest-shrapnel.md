The Bitterest Shrapnel
----------------------
But I should be true to mountaineering, erupting among its whirlwinds of hats  
so  
let us try to divulge a story devoid of technical redundancies.  
What we say pulses to  
light some other woman  
what a identity may teach.  
But the bridge rose the memory.  
Puncture me and let my substance crystallize.  
It was the morning of the elephant.  
A camera for study is the lack thereof.  
You say, what is the productivity waiting for in its transparent bottle?  
I tell you it is waiting for movie  
like you.  
  
It was the fortnight of the ostrich.  
For a day, maybe twenty-seven,  
I rested under a pillow of fog  
at a bus stop, waiting for the giant to be with.  
Enjoy the many rabid attempts to entertain  
the brandishing bone.  
There is fleeting fortune in blossoming it.
