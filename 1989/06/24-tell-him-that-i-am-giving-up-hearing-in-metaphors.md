Tell Him That I Am Giving Up Hearing In Metaphors
-------------------------------------------------
Like mourning splendor, pullulations  
what we say begins to  
magnify some other custodian  
what a phenomenon may teach.  
An odor has stood in the sun,  
a mixture of corpse and body, a fashioning  
dew that brings embarassement.  
  
Form on the havocs that wait for you  
passing the hushed chairs, killing the doors.  
Nobody here is waiting for the next river.  
Leaf. You connected yourself for discovering.  
Here I am, a domestic shoulder flew in the region of pullulation.  
Multitude of necklaces!  
In and out of the burnt umber the cinnamon and the sepia
