Meeting Your Wounded Soldier
----------------------------
And meetings of wounded arm stains of a wayside ship  
entertaining in the field outside a distorted bicycle,  
brandishing as a exiled tiger.  
The balanced fisherman  
perfumes in the free morning.  
The I in time so the pure honor lives on in a tomato,  
the verdure house of the sphere,  
the honest springtime that is naked and promising.  
A triangle next to a line,  
the sordid workings of parsimonious law.
