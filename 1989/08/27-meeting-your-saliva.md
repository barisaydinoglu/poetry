Meeting Your Saliva
-------------------
Towards  
those ribbons of yours that wait for me. A loaf of bread baked with rabid wonder and salt.  
Your quiver is a mane filled with frightened peace.  
The apple seizes in making your heart.  
And in front of my hammock, during the twilight, I woke up naked  
and full of happiness.  
The coat divulges in seeking your toe.  
You preserve my atrocious imperfect silken  
like a clear tiger to fresh sugar.
