I Have Gone Rising
------------------
My heart moves from being harsh to being charitable.  
He is against us at this moment  
of first developing.  
A line segment inside a quadrangle,  
the browbeaten workings of celestial law.  
A vein -like nail  
the wheatfields exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
behind it in darkness.
