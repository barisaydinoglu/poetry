Everything Is A Technical Issue
-------------------------------
In the first scene, the somber cousin  
is fell by a one. In the second  
reel he returns, to live and to reconcile.  
Always you decay through the lunchtime  
toward the afternoon replacing veins.  
A circle outside a line,  
the blood-stained workings of mineral law.  
And you stole in the agony and lived a pitying womb.  
Carry me onto your bicycle - the lemon of my nature -  
our new wave, our nocturnal tree triangles.  
A opaque brimstone and wounded candle is drowned in the universe.  
In front of the dark anger of the martyr.  
A chorus of tigers at late afternoon un inherited un compounded  
comes to a halt before a writing.  
Realized sweet-smelling friendship pockets of broken glass converted into silicon.
