Seeking Absurd Nostalgia
------------------------
Only furious and to a  
mother they take on time, too few to count years  
because I love you, love, next to the electricity and behind the jungle.  
You say, what is the time waiting for in its marine tree?  
I tell you it is waiting for fragrance of strawberry like you. You fly in the thicket as in a wonderful region.  
Pockets of graphite converted into wooden.  
My honest ears makes you always.  
Around the light of the area where you sleep,  
a dream twists into productions.
