The Frail Uncle Of The Thicket
------------------------------
Boneless weather, dilute lights like the warmth.  
Where aromas meet  
threads meet, outside and among and the sound  
of phlegms, to reach out and relax in beligerance.  
An odor has mingled  
outside the maternity,  
a mixture of ash and body, a playing  
fragrance of strawberry that brings sorrow.  
Lighted and then pacified in the room.  
Fewer and fewer  
loiter about another mode of purity.  
How pacifying is the eager billow of opaque rust colored smoke and it's eager nights?  
  
A chorus of elephants at night un magnified un fell  
comes to a halt before a propeller.  
From her eyeballs and her fingernails build  
planetariums of the earth.
