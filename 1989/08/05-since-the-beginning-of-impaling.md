Since The Beginning Of Impaling
-------------------------------
Travelled and then rose in the field.  
Crimson and angellic one,  
but I should be true to science, deluding among its boneless moons  
so let us seek to divulge a story without side redundancies.  
It's a returning tree of gates.  
I salute  
your lovely plum  
and envy your cordial pride.  
On what mourning lineages built with lightning?  
  
Wave of wave of maternities rolling down the sea.  
If you were not the plum the verdure moon  
cooks, sprinkling its lemon across the chimney.  
Mechanical weather, delirious lights like the femininity.  
What rosy doves -  
the field is filled with it,  
defenders for the book and the disintered gold.  
  
Sometimes a piece of the lava  
steals like a cathedral in my lip.  
The essential dignity of the essence!  
The flower head awakening from my brow.  
Carry me onto  
your vessel - the orange of my springtime -  
You've asked me what the bird is shining there with his cashmire leg?  
I reply, the soul knows this.  
Gem architecture of a compounded rigid key.  
You are the apple of my cold toe.
