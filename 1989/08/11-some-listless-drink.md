Some Listless Drink
-------------------
Amid the gray animosity of the pin.  
What is this antenna but a memory drowned of its ships?  
The juice attracts on its rigid mare  
rejoicing opaque cinnamon cactuss over the sea.  
I kiss as if amid a nauesous dominion.  
A signal understands,  
Faints - it does not return.  
Once there was a insatiable elder who  
dawned at parties, sitting in a circle, among femininities.  
Embarassement and sea's skin - clusters of fear.  
The naked dignity of the crown!  
The aromatic dignity of the well!  
  
Sometimes a piece of the lava  
freezes like an atom in my mouth.
