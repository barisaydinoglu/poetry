She Has A Molested Complex
--------------------------
Living a starlight  
expanded in the blazing rain.  
Nothing but that productivity of productivities.  
You've asked me what the tiger is carrying there with his transparent brain?  
I reply, the river knows this.  
They are all pioneers  
professional salivas in whose smooth serenities originate.  
Wonder is gone, the subject has kissed.  
Continued and then enchanted in the city.  
In the first scene, the perfect stranger  
is ignored by a elder. In the second  
reel he returns, to dedicate and to weave.  
To seek another land in the smallest silken light you are the rigid custodian of a pheasant,  
the troubled ness of the lighthouse, the power of the water.  
A chorus of cats at midnight un enriched un invaded  
comes to a halt  
before a bottle.  
  
Full stop.  
What is this metaphor but a memory twisted of its  
bird feathers?  
Crimson massacres of noise,  
silvery seams above a rusted bell.  
Everybody here is waiting for the next banner.  
Stalks of cattail. You rose yourself for hearing.  
It's a enchanting knave of cubicles.  
Conversations of schools, the recitation  
of gardens we call humble kiss.  
Which is a loving sea water of directions  
twenty-seven or too few to count, imbued  
on a hat or in the cleansed foliage  
directions of the hips, a calculation in your toes.  
In silvery water and green warmths.  
If you were not the grape the humble moon  
cooks, sprinkling its cheesecake across the city.  
Towards those pullulations of yours that wait for me.  
And meetings of sticky breath full stop.  
  
In the forceful defender, many delirious puberties.  
From harrowing wind to tornado,  
hidden forms drawn by iridescent channels, a  
obscene stalks of cattail begins to return.
