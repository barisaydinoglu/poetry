What Is True Of The Magnolium Is True Of Everything
---------------------------------------------------
Not to upgrade or even meet  
the stars in the sky of one who stands  
in the middle of me in a city or expanding to a gentleman.  
Wave of wave of times rolling down the sea.  
A current of angellic sea's skin  
that does not know why it flows and preserves.  
Not flying is a form of wetting.
