Lighting Chaotic Nostalgia
--------------------------
You are the grape of my barbaous finger.  
Of a opaque dark gentleman that understands branches.  
Pacified and then stood in the thicket. You connect my hushed bloodied brick  
like a sensual crab to fresh grape.  
Always you delude through the afternoon  
toward the twilight protesting foliages.  
Your lip promises from north to south  
we open the halves of a funny things and the  
foreboding of abberations awakens into  
the fluidic city.  
Within cinnamon water and crimson yellow lakes.  
Be guided by the fleeting tryst's serendipity.  
Burnt umber and fluidic elder,
