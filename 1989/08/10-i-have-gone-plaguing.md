I Have Gone Plaguing
--------------------
Not the cinnamon moment  
when the fortnight gathers the maps.  
My heart moves from being rusted to being moonlit.  
In front of crimson water and burnt umber clusters. We get the faith  
they must lots to rejoice  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but bloody feathers.  
Perhaps they are not congealed.  
In your breath of anger the field of farms stand.  
In the chimney like brick.  
Only friendship, just the  
honeysuckle, nothing but  
it. Shoreline.  
The I in flower but the muscle preserved the memory.  
I could gallop martyr, complaint, and womb  
from ivory architectures and natures  
with a dull shades of silvery garden  
with felicities in my eye.  
And a burned-out path's water will dawn you.
