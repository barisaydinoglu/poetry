A Song Of Agony
---------------
The vicinity among hers  
a tale we tell in passing,  
with notions of happiness  
and a passion for engineering and oceanography  
not trusting is a form of recovering.  
A rain of sea's skins a current of profound mosaic  
that does not know why it flows and imbues.  
We get the sense  
they must lots to make  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but pins.  
Perhaps they are not pampered.  
Inside the opaque sunburst orange breath of the mud.  
The callous bird plays among the indespensable bloodied bricks.
