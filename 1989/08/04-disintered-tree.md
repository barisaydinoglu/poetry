Disintered Tree
---------------
You seek headlong into a vicinity to store your business.  
Giant of the depths of my toe - your recovering  
stills your blazing regard as though it were lightning.  
A cinnamon guitar flows.  
In the smallest wooden path around the night I like to swim like a morbid mosaic.  
A cashmire pencil flutters.  
A chorus of pheasants at lunchtime un divulged un plagued  
comes to a halt before a serenity.  
The reasons for my respect  
are chirped in my finger of gem.  
A current of trusting bottle  
that does not know why it flows and shines.  
Realized manly bed responding toward the moon among the furious universe of calcerous map.  
The fresh curtains froze with its ironous love amid the echo of the thicket where you sleep,  
A dream condemns into languages.  
Upgrade on the clocks that wait for you  
crushing the dead chairs, deluding the doors.  
  
And flower heads and times.
