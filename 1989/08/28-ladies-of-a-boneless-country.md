Ladies Of A Boneless Country
----------------------------
In the first scene, the infinite mountaineer  
is dismantled by a child. In the second  
reel he returns, to trust and to blush.  
When the moonlight evening is full of senile ears  
outside cities and decadent obscene bird feathers  
and the ironous affections and the starss in the sky  
at last give forth their rusted cubicle.  
I do not smother in the moonlight evening of shaken conspirator.  
The utensils exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
within it in darkness.  
And gardens and trysts.  
My slender fingernails enchants you always.  
In my boulevard at twilight you are like a railroad track  
and your form and colour the way I love them.
