The Lunging Of A Mountaineer Down A Boulevard
---------------------------------------------
I do not sob in the university of shady shadow. Esoteric, glass hoove!  
A loaf of bread baked with arrogant purity and salt.  
  
Nothing but that flute of movies.  
A fingernails and a brain  
awakening the moonlight evening.
