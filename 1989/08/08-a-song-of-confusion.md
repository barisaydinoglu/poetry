A Song Of Confusion
-------------------
It is a tale of lewd clandenstines a lip and a finger  
seizing the land.  
A train is not enough to throttle  
me and keep me  
from the field of your parenthetical curiosities.  
Pulled out and shut up like a key.  
And outside my hammock, during the late afternoon, I woke up naked  
and full of wonder.  
You say, what is the serenity waiting for in its transparent school?  
I tell you it is waiting for warmth like you.  
From her mouth and her shoulder awaken  
coats of the earth.  
One alphabetic option and well.  
Outside the school of the archipeligos where you sleep,  
a dream soddens into inscriptions. A opaque transluscent sand-colored breakfast relinquishes.  
For stone was tear stained and morally neutral.
