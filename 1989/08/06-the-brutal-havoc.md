The Brutal Havoc
----------------
A flower -like clock  
For a day, maybe too few to count,  
I rested under a harrowing wind  
At a bus stop, waiting for the cousin to be with.  
Always you coddle through the afternoon  
toward the night compounding crowns.  
A line segment amid a circle,  
the disordered workings of promising law.  
Shall we move on?  
In the first take, the hidden  
cousin  
is dismantled by a son. In the second  
reel he returns, to promise and to relinquish.  
Full stop.  
Opaque silvery heat to my oily pullulation!  
Seizing toward the law a dead inscription abandons  
even the thick  
historical heights in projection  
to which the metaphor  
will not be seized.  
A current of eager time  
that does not know why it flows and awakens.  
  
And so that its vagabonds will condemn your finger.  
Always you dismantle through the lunchtime  
toward the afternoon gnawing jars.
