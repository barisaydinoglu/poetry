Tell Him That I Am Giving Up Mingling In Studies
------------------------------------------------
Once there was a rustling lady who  
inherited at parties, sitting in a square, among graces.  
To the parsimonious color of the gem telegraph.  
Against the lonely garden, many  
worn-out bombs.  
Conduct on the vigils that wait  
for you  
disguising the smothered chairs, throttling the doors.  
You say, what is the door waiting for in its cinnamon starry sky?  
I tell you it is waiting for rose  
like you.  
Chain me and let my substance excite.  
Multitude of beds!  
In and out of the green the marine and the transluscent deep brown  
A monastic wind of rivers.  
Here I am, an arcane brow froze in the area of path.  
The bird feather harasses, the flower of arcane  
shines behind.
