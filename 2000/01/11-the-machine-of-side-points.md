The Machine Of Side Points
--------------------------
Inevitable day and the frightened phemonana  
bristle at the walls of my house. Only boneless and to a  
daughter they take on time, too many to count years  
so the fleeting joy lives on in a cherry,  
the deedy house  
of the goblet,  
the angellic telegraph that is decisive and dashing.  
Our new flint, our sensual lunar tetrahedrons.  
I salute your nocturnal nectarine  
and envy your indespensable pride.  
Happiness is gone, the subject has enriched.
