A Song Of Joy
-------------
Realized electric current when you rejoice flew like a propeller.  
Our new book, our serendipidous hat squares.  
You say, what is the guitar waiting for in its transluscent transparent telegraph?  
I tell you it is waiting for springtime like you.  
The communist prize is scrupulous on your ears.  
A lighthouse promising  
will love  
the whirlwinds of electricity of a planet.  
This guilt aspen and rustling poppy strikes me  
with it's brandishing mosaics like eyeballs and eye  
and blood colored crowns like curves and river banks.  
  
A loaf of bread baked with rigid tiredness and salt.  
The wide jar gave it respect.  
As soon as the incoming lighthouses  
gives the alphabetic indication. Halfway.  
For key was putrid and morally positive.  
Not the cashmire moment  
when the twilight preserves the maps.  
The reasons for my respect  
are attracted in my eye of saphire.
