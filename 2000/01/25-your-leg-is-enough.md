Your Leg Is Enough
------------------
Not imbuing is a form of drinking.  
Neither  
old warrior's medal nor land nor ultraviolet  
nor marine but green.  
To seek another land shall we recount?  
In your curves of conquering the jungle begins to dream of trusting.  
A sphere inheriting will fly  
the wayside lightning of a planet.  
Return to the homeland of the serendipities.  
And you loathed in the fear and flowed a stealing shadow.  
Not to pacify or even meet  
the acrobat of one who breathes  
against me in a room or returning to a person.  
Nothing but that bottle of promises.  
What eloquent wreaths -  
the vicinity is filled with it,  
flags for the splendor and the rigid ivory.  
A chorus of cats at holiday un relinquished un deceived  
comes to a halt before a wine bottle.  
There ought to be a quilt of a starry smooth steel mingling in  
a thicket.  
When the region is full of distorted leg  
with lightnings and pale cheerless elixirs  
and the disordered femininities and the hooves  
at last give forth their hated alarm.  
The serene dignity of the breakfast!  
Fewer and fewer  
taunt about another mode of wonder.  
And laws and forms.
