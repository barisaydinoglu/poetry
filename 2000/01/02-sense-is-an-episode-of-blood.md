Sense Is An Episode Of Blood
----------------------------
A green flag attracts.  
To the aquatic poetic fused  
quartz architecture pockets of rusted nail converted into paper-mache.  
Neither garden nor magnolium nor turqoise  
nor opaque cinnamon but deep brown.  
The scrupulous dignity of the wreath!  
The guilt juice is mineral on your ears.  
Disordered fathers and aunts.  
For me they are side.  
One slightest option and I took on listless planetariums.
