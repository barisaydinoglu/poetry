The Vortex Fallen Into The Sea
------------------------------
Brings all the falls currents.  
The bottle plan that has everyone dead.  
There are many trapdoors behind inaccessible events.  
Neither sand-colored  
car nor aroma nor black  
nor  
sand-colored but yellow.  
And so that its vagabonds will faint your tail.  
Not the sunburst orange moment  
when the lunchtime loves the promises.  
I could seize corpse, pigeon hole, and polyp  
from maps and friendships  
with a black perfume  
with cold fires in my ears.  
Draw from it the fragmented  
study of its own sequence.  
When the chimney is full of obscene arm  
behind phlegms and raucous listless wreaths  
and the hollow serendipities and the curtains  
at last give forth their barbaous coffin.  
Which is a sweet-smelling bird feather of directions  
twenty-seven or million, stood  
on a home or in the acerb bird feather  
directions of the arm, a calculation in your fingernailss.  
Your foot begins from north to east  
outside the trembling egoes.
