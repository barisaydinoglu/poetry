The Dagger Fallen Into The Sea
------------------------------
We open the halves of a epiphany and the  
decaying of rotten stumps plays into the secure field.  
Celestial empire. The loop functions to transform a environment  
to its system.  
If I could conduct the vigil and the heights.  
The ribbon drowns, the femininity  
of rosy  
shines around.  
Enjoy the many barbaous  
attempts to dedicate  
the poetic flask.  
There is parenthetical fortune in wetting it.  
I salute your plumed grape  
and envy your moonlit pride.  
  
It was a wayside business of stalactite and uranus.  
The aunt smiles at the woman  
but the mountaineer does not smile  
when he looks at the cat fisherman  
and the rusted ocean.  
You are the grape of my delirious hand.  
Of your turqoise quilt  
when you hold out your foot.  
Your eyelids wakes from east to south  
it returns like a lunar outside the flower head.  
As if to entangle or grow or pass.  
Of your gray ribbon when you hold out your arm.  
Which is a monastic key of directions  
too few to count or three hundred, grew  
on a river or in the velvety smooth stone  
directions of the leg, a calculation in your brows.  
With its disintered continue the mud silent polyps are disguised.  
And a rotten rose's earth will appreciate you.  
Under the brutal region of rabid nature.  
We open the halves of a secrets and the  
overflowing of parallel  
thorn treess grows into the humble room.
