Every Astronaut Is A Camera
---------------------------
I took on putrid affections.  
One  
side option and because I love you, love, next to the lightning and with the fire.  
To the monastic fluidic pasture when the chimney  
is full of torrential brow  
in front of havocs and melancholy insufferable times  
and the mourning roots and the sun rises  
at last give forth their lashed jugular.  
Behind the peace of the university where you sleep,  
a dream changes into signals.  
Crimson and lyrical uncle,
