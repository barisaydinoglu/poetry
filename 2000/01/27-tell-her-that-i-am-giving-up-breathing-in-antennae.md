Tell Her That I Am Giving Up Breathing In Antennae
--------------------------------------------------
The bottles exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
amid it in darkness. The mosaics exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
within it in darkness.  
Rusted uncles and mothers.  
For me they are minor.  
There are many traps in front of dead events.  
Transparent and loving mother,  
some entertain but I perfume your steel like mirror.  
A ship is not enough to filter me and keep me  
from the night of your balanced epiphany.  
An odor has loved among the stars in the sky,  
a mixture of dominion and body, a entertaining  
phemonana that brings confusion.  
Return to the homeland of the pastures.  
Winged empire. The circle functions to mingle a environment  
to its system.
