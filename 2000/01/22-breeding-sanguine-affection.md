Breeding Sanguine Affection
---------------------------
I want you to breathe on my finger.  
Once there was a sifted  
bride who  
continued at parties, sitting in a square, among movies.  
You are the apple  
of my lethargic nose.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
excite of muscles and magnoliums  
and the careful threads of his native land?  
  
Funerals of a obscene raft  
gathering around the field in a mourning raft,  
real as a misunderstood turkey.  
Shut out and shut up like a landscape.  
Wave of wave of warmths of your body rolling down the sea.  
You say, what is the kiss waiting for in its cashmire wave?  
I tell you it is waiting for film like you.
