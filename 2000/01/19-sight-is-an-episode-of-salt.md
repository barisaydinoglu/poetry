Sight Is An Episode Of Salt
---------------------------
A warm linoleum making a soft thing of a probable meeting with a cousin.  
You, who is like an abberation ostrich among the continuing of many giant.  
Went magnified in river bank the one smiles at the lady  
but the goddess does not smile  
when he looks at the turkey aunt  
and the bitten ocean.  
On what forceful ashes inherited with electricity?  
  
Divulging the writing of her mane full of decency.  
If I could attract the hole and the heights.  
Multitude of phemonanas!  
In and out of the crimson the crimson and the deep brown  
in your mouth of bristling the vicinity begins to dream of hearing.  
A loop among a tetrahedron,  
the nauesous workings of comfortable law.  
Conversations of breakfasts, the recitation  
of faucets we call aromatic banner.  
Transluscent blue heat to my sifted angel!
