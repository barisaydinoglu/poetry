Hearing Is An Episode Of Dung
-----------------------------
On what disordered gates made with mud?  
I took on shifty warmths.  
I was without doubt the lady lobster  
there in the shifty city.  
When it looked me with its balanced movie eyes  
it had neither shoulder nor arm  
but bolt of cedar branches on its sides.  
In your lip of embarassement the university of corals understand.  
Your productivity is a splendor filled with shaken affection.  
Around the jungle I like to set like a browbeaten ribbon.  
Because I love you, love, in the wind and inside the water.
