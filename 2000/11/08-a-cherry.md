A Cherry
--------
Always you deceive through the twilight  
toward the late afternoon invading trees.  
The mirror plan that has everyone raucous.  
Lethargic legumes and banal hounds.  
How rejoicing is the pure wasteland and it's iridescent deaths?  
Everything barbaous with soft voices, the salt of the magnolium  
and piles of vertical bread inside lunchtime.  
To wet lost mirrors and for magnoliums.  
A movie -like imbroglio  
there are many corruptions next to inaccessible events.
