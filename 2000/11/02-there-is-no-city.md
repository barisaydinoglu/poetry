There Is No City
----------------
The night among hers  
a history we speak in passing,  
with notions of respect  
and a passion for oceanography and mountaineering  
neither sun nor foliage nor blood colored  
nor cinnamon but opaque opaque green.  
You've asked me what the ostrich is dawning there with his yellow lip?  
I reply, the reflection knows this.  
Promising the pasture of her perfume full of felicity.  
When you magnify circumscribed like a coral.  
What funny things does the toucan contain?  
How little we develop and how much it sets the mysteries of this universe.  
  
They are all fishermen  
professional flames in whose somber umbrellas originate.  
The eddy inheriting from my toe.  
The telegraph plan that has everyone neurotic.  
Tremulous lunchtime and the putrid essence  
petrify at the walls of my house.  
The insatiable ostrich begins under the monastic pigeon holes.  
Enjoy the many communist attempts to promise  
the enchanting corruption.  
There is smooth fortune in creating it.  
To the starry color of the emerald old warrior's medal.
