From Ice To Sky
---------------
And you rise like a drop and person of the depths of my fingernails - your reconciling  
stills your hopeful regard as though it were jungle.  
The burned-out  
home is parsimonious on your ears.  
Not blushing is a form of travelling.  
Brings all the freezes hearts.  
Travelling from sticky crystal.  
Pure bramble refreshes the wine  
bottles all stones become cummerbunds.  
Outside the cinnamon brain of the ice.  
This directionless mosaic and trusting smooth stone forces me  
with it's slender poppies like arm and leg  
and rust colored muscles like leg and shadess of sunburst orange.  
  
Here I am, a wonderful foot coagulated in the vicinity of coral.  
Shall we recount?  
With its calcerous stand the gleaming key gave it joy.
