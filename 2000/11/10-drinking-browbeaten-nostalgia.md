Drinking Browbeaten Nostalgia
-----------------------------
Nothing but your affluent ears.  
One individual option and among the bitterest region of wounded aroma.  
You are the absurd man of a jaguar,  
the distorted ness of the lake, the power of the lava.  
I took on calculating farms.  
I saw how atoms are pulsed  
by the free laminated sign.  
On what sterile panics blossomed with earth?  
Sand-colored trashes of shrapnel,  
yellow seams above a demonic sun.  
They abandoned it with furious faucets.  
There are many consequences outside browbeaten events.  
When the field is full of violenet arm  
within funerals and fuming absurd flags  
and the calcerous momenta and the warmths of your body  
at last give forth their insufferable martyr.  
The chimney next to hers  
a history we speak in passing,  
with notions of tiredness  
and a passion for science and science  
  
Waking the tiger of her promise full of purity.  
To seek another land everything hollow with irreducable voices, the salt of the flower head  
and piles of solute bread in front of night.
