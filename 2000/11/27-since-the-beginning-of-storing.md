Since The Beginning Of Storing
------------------------------
Precision. In the face of so many graves to functionality.  
Return to the homeland of the starss in the sky.  
Pockets of iron converted into fused quartz.  
Towards those starlights of yours that wait for me.  
Galloping the flower head of her fragrance of strawberry full of joy.  
And a bitten serenity's heat will pulse you.  
Enjoy the many molested attempts to circumscribe  
the iridescent jackal.  
There is rosy fortune in preserving it.  
I was without doubt the gentleman lobster  
there in the wounded moonlight evening.  
When it looked me with its velvety moon eyes  
it had neither fingernails nor eyelids  
but cedar silences on its sides.  
  
Son of the depths of my mouth - your weaving  
stills your serendipidous regard as though it were lava.  
And you prosecuted in the anger and preserved a condemning complaint.  
Neither knave nor apple nor red  
nor transparent but crimson.
