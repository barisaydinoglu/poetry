She Has A Silent Complex
------------------------
Brings all the invades times.  
As if to sodden or begin or deprive.  
There ought to be a form of a irreducable drop relinquishing in a field.  
Pockets of clay converted into copper.  
From her eye and her hips rescue  
flags of the earth.  
As if to abolish or form or delude.  
Beligerance and acrobat - landscapes of agony.  
And next to my hammock, during the sunset, I  
woke up naked  
and full of purity.  
The delicious dignity of the hat!  
And grapes and silences.  
But I should be untrue to photography, erupting among its shaken times  
so let us try to speak a story without individual redundancies.  
A tenacious metaphor smothers  
even the fresh  
public moonlight evening in inscription  
to which the metaphor  
will not be blushed.  
The magnoliums exists even when there is  
little to say, and it  
ceases  
in front of it in darkness.  
I wish to make a square  
amid, and every faith, many  
times hidden in a love.  
You dedicate in the moonlight evening as in an aquatic city.
