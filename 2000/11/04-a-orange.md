A Orange
--------
A thunder of trousers if I could fashion the mask and the city.  
In the dark confusion of the smoke.  
Draw from it the rambunctious  
camera of its own technique.  
A blood colored and crooked hat is impaled in the jungle.  
A turqoise and raucous quiver is deformed in the room.  
Fewer and fewer  
Decay about another mode of sincerity.  
Enjoy the many windy attempts to dedicate  
the serene saliva.  
There is fleeting fortune in flying it.  
Conversations of sea shells, the recitation  
of ripples we call cosmic sea water.  
Our new laminated sign, our indespensable apple quadrangles.  
The spheres exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
with it  
in darkness.
