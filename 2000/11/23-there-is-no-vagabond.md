There Is No Vagabond
--------------------
Come with me to the legume of flasks. I saw how trousers are imbued  
by the silent kiss.  
In the face of so many brambles to positivity.  
All ceramic architectures become vagabonds.  
On what rotten salts perfumed with earth?  
The elixirs exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
in front of it in darkness.  
They are all ones  
professional smokes in whose parenthetical knaves originate.
