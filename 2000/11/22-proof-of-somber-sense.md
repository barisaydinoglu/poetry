Proof Of Somber Sense
---------------------
Entertaining from dead fused quartz.  
Like the acidulous graphite of keys so the velvety love lives on in a lemon,  
the irreducable house of the home,  
the electric quilt that is delicious and deedy.  
Among the negligent thicket of inaccessible heart.  
Because I love you, love, with the lava and outside the ice.  
  
What we say  
enchants to  
love  
some other stranger  
what a production may teach.  
Your sweetnes is a sea water filled with calculating perfume.
