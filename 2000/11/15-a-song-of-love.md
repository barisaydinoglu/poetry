A Song Of Love
--------------
An odor has flew against the praise,  
a mixture of howl and body, an attracting  
dove that brings illusion.  
To the sensible color of the saphire warmth of your body.  
The university amid hers  
a story we tell in passing,  
with notions of pride  
and a passion for engineering and photography  
for essence was arrogant and morally negative.
