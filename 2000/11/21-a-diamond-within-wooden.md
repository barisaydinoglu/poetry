A Diamond Within Wooden
-----------------------
The reasons for my respect  
are showered in my eye of gem.  
Here I am, a mineral brow shattered in the room of foam.  
In the rust colored sorrow of the violence.  
And roots and drops.  
The path galloping from my hips.  
For a day, maybe twenty-seven,  
I rested under a ocean wave  
at a bus stop, waiting for the lady to be next to.  
  
Here I am, a promising ears  
disguised in the jungle of bridge.  
There are no brambles but rigid cycles of stone and marine  
branches of romantic clenched salt.  
Neither tryst nor angel nor red  
nor marine but blue. Our new defender, our full dove lines.  
Realized human autumn when you expand like quiver fashioned by the lava.
