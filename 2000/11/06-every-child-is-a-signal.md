Every Child Is A Signal
-----------------------
Has the university been perched with epiphany? The ribbon continues in re-covering your tail.  
I'd do it for the wreath in which you swim  
for the reflections of crimson you've stored.  
  
Your fellowship is a window filled with frail serenity.  
Among the brimstone animosity of the shrapnel.
