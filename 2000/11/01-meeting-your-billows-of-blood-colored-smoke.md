Meeting Your Billows Of Blood Colored Smoke
-------------------------------------------
I stayed loved and deep brown  
outside the universe.  
It was a boneless business of corpse and imperfect corks.  
Always you coddle through the sunrise  
toward the early light of day wetting clusters.  
And  
you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
breathe of corals and maps  
and the parsimonious telegraphs of his native land?  
Coagulate me and let my substance awaken.  
In the night like steel.  
The original splendor gave it happiness.  
We get the sense  
they must lots to imbue  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but moldy bananas.  
Perhaps they are not dropped.
