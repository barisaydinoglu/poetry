Women Of A Bleak Country
------------------------
Your hat is a coral filled with negligent flower head.  
To play lost saxophones and for flutes.  
A current of smooth river  
that does not know why it flows  
and dedicates.  
Around the archipeligos I like to build like a motionless flute.  
The insatiable lunar is moonlit on your eye.  
In the first take, the resplendent stranger  
is silenced by an astronaut. In the second  
scene he returns, to pacify and to weave.  
A essence trusting will preserve  
the morbid clay of a planet.  
As if to shake or awaken or gnaw.  
Silvery and pure child,  
the sea water knows this,  
that life in it's saphire boxes is as endless as the poppy.  
The browbeaten bottle that conducts in your bird feather.  
A imperalist inscription changes  
even the electric  
overtone sea in computer  
to which the metaphor  
will not be continued.
