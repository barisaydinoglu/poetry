Meeting Your Complaint
----------------------
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the original old warrior's medals?  
And the sunshine somber splattering its hats and deluding them full of  
vicinity and toucan?  
We open the halves of a funny things and the  
flying of smokes reflects into the domestic land.  
Carry me onto your raft - the lemon of my key -  
you are the banana of my decadent curves.  
To blossom lost laminated signs and for kisses.  
Everything parched with deedy voices, the salt of the old warrior's medal  
And piles of secure bread next to morning.  
The magnolium plan that has everyone neurotic.  
A real rain of ribbons.  
Outside the red confusion of the stick.  
Full stop.  
  
And you return like a sphere and so the brandishing happiness lives on in a banana,  
the handsome house of the atom,  
the boundless trouser that is essential and homogeneous.  
In your finger of sorrow the moonlight evening of perfumes drink.  
Stored and then enchanted in the area.  
Of a black mother that divulges graces.  
You see mouth as unguessed as the rain.  
Among the black agony of the polyp.  
Agony and essence - tigers of confusion.  
Shut up and closed off like a cactus.  
Custodian of the depths of my tail - your rescuing  
stills your homogeneous regard as though it were electricity.
