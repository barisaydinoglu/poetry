A Paper-mache Within Copper
---------------------------
Hollow  
weather, imperalist lights like the bird feather.  
I want you to transform on my finger.  
Blood-stained giants and women.  
For me they are side.  
With its  
mechanical seize a computer for signal is the lack thereof.  
Only insatiable and to a  
child they take on time, twenty-seven years  
some perfume but I begin your aluminum like wave.  
Be guided by the brandishing garden's muscle.  
And you refresh like a propeller and towards those schools  
of yours that wait for me.  
Like guilt starry sky, poppies  
not rejoicing is a form of returning.  
And you coddled in the animosity and rose a stealing enemy.  
Nothing but that coral of faucets.  
Protecting the candle of her flesh full of felicity.
