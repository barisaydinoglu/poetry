An Equally Changeless Cousin
----------------------------
Your hat is a bell filled with obscene cathedral.  
You've asked me what the toucan is forming there with his opaque deep brown leg?  
I reply, the sea water knows this.  
Fewer and fewer  
pass about another mode of love.  
Went enchanted in flesh I took on bitter pencils.  
Only fellowship, just the  
thread, nothing but  
it. Pullulation.  
The area amid hers  
a history we divulge in passing,  
with notions of decency  
and a passion for computer science and science  
it was the fortnight of the squirrel.  
You are the lemon of my raucous toe.  
It was the night of the squirrel.  
The old warrior's medal plan that has everyone listless.  
  
I stayed shone and transparent  
in the middle of the field.  
There are no oxides but spoiled cycles of garden and cinnamon  
waves of parsimonious melancholy metal.
