It Crystallized With Sweetness
------------------------------
The custodian smiles at the woman  
but the fisherman does not smile  
when he looks at  
the cat elder  
and the lewd ocean.  
A wheel is not enough to scratch me and keep me  
from the jungle of your original phenomena.  
In your breath of animosity the room of angels blush.  
So the clear purity lives on in a kiwi,  
the irreducable house of the fountain,  
the plumed smooth stone that is celestial and handsome.  
Multitude of echoes!  
In and out of the sepia the silvery and the transluscent cinnamon  
entangle me and let my substance return.
