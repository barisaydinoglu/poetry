Song For The Mother Of Barbaous Laws
------------------------------------
Of a red custodian that recovers breakfasts.  
Return to the homeland of the corals.  
And you mix like a wave and I am entangled by warmth of your body and dung, by torrent and sunshine.  
The bitterest form that lights in your foam.  
But I should be true to science, petrifying among its banal forms  
so let us try to speak a story devoid of minor redundancies.  
A wind of rituals breathing the writing of her droplet full of decency.  
The sea shell knows this,  
that life in it's silk boxes is as endless as the essence.  
The electric bell gave it love.  
When you set like silence seized by the sky.  
It was a furious business of cleft and violences.  
A chorus of oysters at holiday un promised un mutated  
comes to a halt before a laminated sign.
