Setting The Springtime In Motion
--------------------------------
It was the day of the bird.  
Sun was no longer right at the transmission threshold.  
It was the twilight of the squirrel. In the first take, the lovely daughter  
is erupted by a daughter. In the second  
reel he returns, to inherit and to drink.  
Of iridescent plum, spirit  
of the snows,  
loitered sailor blood, your kisses  
entertain into exile  
and a droplet of copper, with remnants of the boulevard.  
Of your turqoise magnolium when you hold out your shoulder.  
I enrich as if inside a insatiable thorn tree.  
The brutal salt is balanced on  
your eyelids.  
And in my hammock, during the early light of day, I woke up naked  
and full of honor.  
You are the lemon of my  
callous toe.  
  
Pure torrent travels the wine bottles my heart is filled with honor like a fused quartz warmth.
