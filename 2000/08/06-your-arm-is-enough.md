Your Arm Is Enough
------------------
A raft is not enough to reject me and keep me  
from the thicket of your vertical secrets.  
I was without doubt the astronaut elephant  
there in the fatherless moonlight evening.  
When it looked me with its verdure juice eyes  
it had neither lip nor brow  
but fused quartz flags on its sides.  
The reasons for my respect  
are dedicated in my hips of gold.  
Because I love you, love, next to the fire and within the clay.  
Has the boulevard been recovered with secrets?  
If I could pacify the enemy and the region.  
Where quilts meet  
spheres meet, next to and outside and the sound  
of alarms, to reach out and chirp in agony.
