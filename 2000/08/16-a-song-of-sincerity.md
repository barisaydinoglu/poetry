A Song Of Sincerity
-------------------
The currents exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
outside it in darkness.  
Burnt umber electricity to my crooked apple!  
The electric cousin  
excites in the resplendent morning.  
The order of the sea water dashing empire. The line segment functions to perfume a system  
to its system.  
From ray of sunlight to ray of sunlight,  
hidden keys drawn by handsome channels, a  
listless bottle begins to seize.  
Behind the modern office like graphite.  
The jungle honest circumstances are conquered.  
Atrocious  
trash barges and communist violas.  
And energies and flutes.  
Outside the yellow hips of the wind.  
Gentleman of the depths of my nose - your enchanting  
stills your round regard as though it were mud.  
  
Transparent  
sky to my bitterest  
elixir!  
Only light, just the  
angel, nothing but  
it. Dew.
