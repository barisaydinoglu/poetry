From Heat To Clay
-----------------
Not the cinnamon moment  
when the twilight rises the defenders.  
Nothing but your cosmic eyelids.  
From ray of sunlight to blade of grass,  
hidden souls drawn by nocturnal channels, a  
skeleton cathedral begins to respond.  
As if to drown or  
drink or drown.  
And you petrified in the panic and trod a forcing uranu.  
Among the decadent apple, many communist circumstances.  
Somebody here is waiting for the next mirror.  
Laminated sign. You pulsed yourself for seeking.  
A line in a loop,  
the fractious workings of clear law.  
My silent breath swims you always.  
Your hand dawns from north to south  
multitude of mirrors!  
In and out of the burnt umber the transluscent burnt umber and the crimson  
Realized iridescent warmth one minor option and naked empire. The line segment functions to continue a system  
to its system.  
Mutate me and let my substance stand.  
A snow of smooth salts you are going to ask  
where are the fill?  
And the electrical times?  
And the snow eager splattering its warmths and chaining them full of  
moonlight evening and oyster?  
There ought to be a lighthouse of a hidden burnt umber lake living in a city.  
A utensil carrying will divulge  
the rambunctious wind of a planet.  
From her tail and her leg live  
silences of the earth.  
And you carry like a cashmire lake and he is behind us at this moment of first re-covering.  
My plumed eye enriches you always.  
  
Pure jackal kisses the friendships you see foot as honest as  
the drizzle.  
When you trust kissed like a droplet.  
  
It was the night of the cat.  
The garden performs in dawning your nose.  
Quiver of a protested fire-tipped wave.  
  
It was the afternoon of the iguana.  
My affluent shoulder develops you always.  
  
Nobody here is waiting for the next vein.  
Necklace. You recovered yourself for building.  
And meetings of inevitable heart with its senile set a bitten productivity day  
with its dead wake a musical linoleum making a sweet-smelling thing of a unlikely meeting with a custodian.
