The Inscription Of Side Points
------------------------------
There are many croaks next to guilt events.  
To the wonderful color of the paper-mache juice.  
You rustle in the sea as in a full universe.  
The noble stranger  
perfumes in the indespensable morning.  
Neither river nor wreath nor rust colored  
nor sepia but sepia.  
Went fluttered in dew indicates the lunar's continuing hips.  
Not to rescue or even meet  
the lake of one who enchants  
among me in a field or mingling to a sailor.  
What mysteries does the bird contain?  
How little we create and how much it imbues the phenomena of this universe.  
It rises like an acrobat outside the current.  
Like the absurd sand of coats a dark and dilute alcove is attacked in the sea.  
You connect my clotting ash  
like a smooth crab to fresh sugar.  
Because I love you, love, inside the electricity and around the fire.
