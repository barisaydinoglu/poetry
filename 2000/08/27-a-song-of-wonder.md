A Song Of Wonder
----------------
To relinquish lost apples and for suns.  
Our new river, our solute landscape squares.  
There are no jugulars but lonely cycles of candle and burnt umber  
beds of celestial ironous broken glass.  
A jar -like vigil  
only explosive and to a  
pioneer they take on time, three hundred years.  
Neither awe nor energy nor blood colored  
nor marine but transluscent deep brown.  
When the chimney is full of fatherless heart  
inside vigils and bleak crooked landscapes  
and the decadent grapes and the snows  
at last give forth their hated lance.
