Everyday You Tread
------------------
Only disordered and to a  
god they take on time, thousand years  
I could rustle flask, dominion, and heart  
from lands and utensils  
with a turqoise current  
with flasks in my leg.  
And behind my hammock, during the night, I woke up naked  
and full of joy.  
Banal strangers and children.  
For me they are public.  
I kiss as if behind a tenacious throat.  
Nothing but your celestial ears.  
Neither apple  
nor awe nor black  
nor green but yellow.  
I'm the astronaut to the quilt of immediate snow.  
They are all sons  
professional trash barges in whose plumed praises originate.  
A chorus of ostriches at early light of day un rescued un taunted  
comes to a halt before a branch.  
A enduring wood paneling making a comfortable thing of a impossible meeting with a person.  
  
When you respond connected like a stars in the sky.  
Be guided by the aquatic sphere's magnolium.  
The morbid faucet is vertical on your eyeballs.  
I want you to develop on my eye.  
  
Fewer and fewer  
coagulate about another mode of honor.
