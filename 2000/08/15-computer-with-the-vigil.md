Computer With The Vigil
-----------------------
To the round color of the cork breakfast.  
Nothing but your loving shoulder.  
So the absorbant purity lives on in a banana,  
the aquatic house of the eddy,  
the winged dew that is homogeneous and fluidic.  
A line in a loop,  
the silent workings of pure law.  
And meetings of mourning eye next to the decaying hounds.  
My heart moves from being disordered to being balanced.  
Not  
understanding is a form of forming.
