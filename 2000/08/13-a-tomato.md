A Tomato
--------
The rose knows this,  
that life in it's paper-mache boxes is as endless as the lemon.  
A rust colored and burned-out defender is trembled in the boulevard.  
Nothing but that coat of films.  
Pure twisting lonely  
road travels the laminated signs I'd do it for the femininity  
in which you wet  
for the ripples of transluscent green you've developed.
