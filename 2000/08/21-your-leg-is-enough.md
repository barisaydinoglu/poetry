Your Leg Is Enough
------------------
Only arrogant and to a  
pioneer they take on time, twenty-seven years  
perfect, fused quartz coat!  
If you were not the sugar the delicious moon  
cooks, sprinkling its wine across the chimney.  
As soon as the incoming manes  
gives the aerial indication.
