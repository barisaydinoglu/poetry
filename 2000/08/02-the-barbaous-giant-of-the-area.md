The Barbaous Giant Of The Area
------------------------------
This decadent sweetnes and dawning home filters me  
with it's domestic drops like curves and foot  
and dull shades of crimson lands like breath and apples.  
The morning homes you in its mortal wind.  
The holiday flags you in its mortal ice.  
So the sanguine happiness lives on in a lemon,  
the fleeting house of the tree,  
the clear apple that is manly and lyrical.  
Land of a throttled skeleton foam.  
Recovered and then perched in the modern office.  
As if to deprive or enchant or protest.  
The cathedral abhors, the lake of absent minded  
appreciates outside.
