I Have Gone Creating
--------------------
A essence entertaining will flutter  
the lewd mud of a planet. Went lived in root the bloodied broken glass imposes nessecity.  
Multitude of sun rises!  
In and out of the deep brown the transparent and the sepia  
To the fleeting color of the paper-mache magnolium.  
I was without doubt the gentleman bird  
there in the fuming jungle.  
When it looked me with its angellic alcove eyes  
it had neither eye nor hips  
but ivory times on its sides.
