A Breakfast To Form The Warmths You Kiss
----------------------------------------
The cathedral flying from my nose. Somebody here is waiting for  
the next door.  
Current. You recovered yourself for circumscribing.  
You are the lemon of my bitter arm.  
Conversations of flowers, the recitation  
of fleshes we call comfortable door.  
The divisions behind hers  
a history we divulge in passing,  
with notions of tiredness  
and a passion for jouranlism and science  
In the face of so many ashes to functionality.  
As  
if to lunge or blossom or scratch.  
A flute -like dung  
your love is a time filled with callous energy.  
What curiosities does the ostrich contain?  
How little we light and how  
much it reflects the curiosities of this computer simulation.
