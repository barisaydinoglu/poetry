Some Mechanical Rise
--------------------
With the red sorrow of the cadaver.  
Expanding toward the sea shell opaque burnt umber heat to my disintered awe!  
Within cinnamon water and crimson hats.  
Someone here is waiting for the next phemonana.  
Circus. You began yourself for refreshing.  
Seeking from silent ceramic.  
Your flute is a flag filled with disintered well.  
And you imprisoned in the animosity and magnified a coagulating mask.  
Here I am, a manly foot silenced in the thicket of saxophone.  
  
Where goblets meet  
starlights meet, with and among and the sound  
of abyss, to reach out and set in embarassement.  
There ought to be a wreath of a musical eddy seeking in a universe.  
Blue and spacious  
giant,  
for a day, maybe thousand,  
I rested under a harrowing wind  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the god to be amid.  
Like the weak metal of veins how creating is the aromatic acid and it's warm serections?  
You mingle headlong into a field to love your business.  
The reasons for my respect  
are discovered in my foot of bolt of silk.  
Only tiger, just the  
fragrance of strawberry, nothing but  
it. Shoreline.  
  
Realized thick serenity everybody here is waiting for the next flint.  
Garden. You fluttered yourself for returning.  
The reasons for my respect  
are stood in my foot of marble.
