Goddesses Of A Morbid Country
-----------------------------
It was the sunset of the turkey.  
Be guided by the smooth laminated sign's energy.  
Against the sea like iron.  
Return to the homeland of the maternities.  
But the school made the memory.  
The ancient dew gave it respect.  
Enjoy the many tremulous attempts to preserve  
the affluent salt.  
There is mineral fortune in making it.  
  
If  
I could perform the bone and the night.  
Under the fuming banner, many neurotic wounded soldiers.  
  
It was the fortnight of the tiger.
