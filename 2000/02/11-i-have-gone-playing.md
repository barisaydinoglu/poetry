I Have Gone Playing
-------------------
In the face of so many oblivions to positivity.  
To the full decisive door against the ironous boulevard of distorted mane.  
I'm the pioneer to the moon of immediate guitar.  
Around the area I like to refresh like a listless dew.  
And a thirsty mirror's mud will make you.  
I salute your sweet-smelling wine  
and envy your profound pride.  
Because I love you, love, next to the sky and in the mud.  
My sensual finger treads you always.  
Towards those movies of yours that wait for me.  
Not to awaken or even meet  
the elixir of one who sets  
against me in a land or divulging to a uncle.  
Perfect, crystal stalks of cattail!  
  
Promising from morbid silicon.  
In the deep brown eyeballs of the water.
