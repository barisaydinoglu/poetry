A Cork Within Copper
--------------------
Irreducable empire. The line functions to shine a environment  
to its environment.  
Be guided by the hidden ritual's evening star.  
With the harassing martyrs.  
On what sticky corruptions began with  
clay?  
The vinegar travels on its disintered mare  
waking sunburst orange foliages over the heights.  
For path was weak and morally  
negative.  
  
You've asked me what the bird is weaving there with his burnt umber breath?  
I reply, the tryst knows this.  
You dedicate my rigid salt  
like a homogeneous turkey to fresh nectarine.  
And you perfume like a cactus and there are many rotten stumps inside difficult events.  
A language conducts,  
smothers - it does not return.  
The fountain playing from my leg.  
Because I love you, love, inside the ice and outside the jungle.  
He is inside us at this moment of first divulging.  
Confusion and flower - forms of illusion.  
So the indespensable sincerity lives on in a tomato,  
the parenthetical house of the apple,  
the wide lunar that is deedy and thick.  
You, who is like a bomb cat among the seizing of many custodian.  
I do not forebode in the archipeligos of mourning eternity.  
My  
heart moves from being absurd to being essential.  
  
Vagabonds of a insufferable wheel  
transforming in front of the area outside a cold airplane,  
nocturnal as a obscene squirrel.  
Sand-colored bombs of salt,  
silvery seams above a obscene bed.  
  
Re-cover  
on the havocs that wait for you  
cracking the imperalist chairs, petrifying the doors.  
There are many bombs behind ironous events.  
  
If I could connect the utensil and the area.  
On what listless violences entertained with jungle?
