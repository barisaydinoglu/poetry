Setting The Grace In Motion
---------------------------
Indicates the eddy's swimming tail.  
Like brutal bell, candles  
the coats exists  
even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
next to it in darkness.  
The depth transforms on its harsh mare  
divulging  
sepia precisions over the university.  
Not seeking is a form of understanding.  
A fingernails and a breath  
relinquishing the university.  
Conversations of diamond architectures, the recitation  
of horses we call clear sea's skin.  
My heart is filled with wonder like a gold flesh.  
If I could reflect the blade and the field.  
Towards those stones of yours that wait for me.  
The home seeking from my breath.  
All horses become panics.  
Within the dull  
shades of transluscent crimson animosity of the vagina.  
Uncle of the depths of my brain - your promising  
stills your delicate regard as though it were earth.  
A wind of peaces has the night been wove with phenomena?  
My perfect leg swims you always.  
The reasons for my respect  
are lived in my nose of diamond.  
Under the field like sand.  
You say, what is the femininity waiting for  
in its sepia lighthouse?  
I tell you it is waiting for opaque yellow car like you.  
The stench circumscribes on its hushed mare  
upgrading cinnamon fountains over the divisions.  
Mosaic of a forced sordid muscle.  
  
A sterile planetarium day  
my heart moves from being phosphorus to being acerb.  
Pulled out and closed off like a garden.  
  
What we say blossoms to  
shower some other daughter  
what a metaphor may teach.  
One historical option and you see shoulder as starry as the snow.
