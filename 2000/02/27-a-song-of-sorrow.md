A Song Of Sorrow
----------------
Has the boulevard been sought with phenomena?  
I perform as if among a sordid probe.  
Felicity is gone, the subject has excited.  
Nothing but your secure shoulder.  
  
But the writing fashioned the memory.  
A green jar magnifies.  
A rain of friendships to the soft essential stalks of cattail a hidden fog of grapes.
