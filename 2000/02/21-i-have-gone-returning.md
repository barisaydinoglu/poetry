I Have Gone Returning
---------------------
I was without doubt the pioneer jaguar  
there in the blood-stained room.  
When it looked me with its enduring bird feather eyes  
it had neither eyeballs nor mouth  
but emerald keys on its sides.  
Calcerous weather, bitten lights like the landscape.  
He is in us at this moment of first divulging.  
Lighting from banal gem.  
Like disintered railroad track, fleshes  
realized humble smooth sand it's a inheriting star of stalactites.
