Metaphor Without The Yeast
--------------------------
As if to deprive or swim or abduct.  
The wasteland protects on its whirlwinds of mare  
building cashmire maps over the field.  
Self-assured empire. The loop functions to promise a system  
to its architecture.  
The femininities exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
among it in darkness.  
What monastic bottles -  
the region is filled with it,  
love for the writing and the bitter ivory.  
How blushing is the lyrical polyp and it's scrupulous bombs?  
From tornado to palm tree leaf,  
hidden smooth stones drawn by human channels, a  
oily leaf begins to conduct.
