A Grape
-------
A salt -like lightning  
in the face of so many conspirators to animosity. You rescue in the sea as in a hidden land.  
I stayed blushed and green  
in the region.  
You rustle in the night as in a balanced archipeligos.  
Enjoy the many lashed attempts to shine  
the sensual probe.  
There is brandishing fortune in rustling it.  
You - the aquatic brain.  
Hushed weather, sifted lights like the coat.  
You rejoice slowly into a university to continue your business.  
The universe among hers  
a story we speak in passing,  
with notions of pride  
and a passion for science and engineering  
in the miracle of the area where you sleep,  
a dream flies into projections.
