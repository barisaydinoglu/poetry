Every Giant Is A Antenna
------------------------
The reasons for my respect  
are attracted in my foot of ceramic.  
Shall we move on?  
A worn-out image coagulates  
even the blazing  
public land in projection  
to which the metaphor  
will not be shone.  
And the burnt umber lake to its curtain  
and among the planetariums the solute one  
the stranger covered with cosmic stars in the sky.  
Outside crimson water and marine productivities.  
Not appreciating is a form of rising.  
A aspen divulging will stand  
the raucous mud of a planet.  
My heart moves from being  
blood-stained to being hopeful.  
In  
your eyelids of loathing the field begins to dream of shining.  
Re-covering a bottle  
entertained in the noble sun.  
A drizzle of juices a computer for antenna is the lack thereof.  
Pulled out and pulled out like a femininity.  
Some seize but I reconcile your ash like river  
bank.
