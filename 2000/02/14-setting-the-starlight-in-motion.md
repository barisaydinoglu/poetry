Setting The Starlight In Motion
-------------------------------
Amid the honeysuckle of the thicket where you sleep,  
a dream pities into machines.  
Nothing but that wheatfield of movies.  
All friendships become graves.  
The gentleman smiles at the mother  
but the son does not smile  
when he looks at the jaguar child  
and the barbaous ocean.  
The cold echo is natural on your lip.  
Not swimming is a form of seizing.  
  
Return to the homeland of the foliages.
