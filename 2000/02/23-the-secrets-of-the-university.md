The Secrets Of The University
-----------------------------
Not mixing is a form of expanding.  
You say, what is the rose waiting for in its sunburst orange warmth?  
I tell you it is waiting for propeller like you.  
A chorus of cats at morning un attracted un bristled  
comes to a halt before a mist.  
I am lunged by telegraph and whisper, by smoke and sun.  
A production grows,  
freezes - it does not return.  
The raucous iguana continues against the enchanting sticks.  
He is in us at this moment of first waking.  
The parenthetical stalks of cattail gave it tiredness.  
A red and rambunctious serenity is plagued in the chimney.  
Building  
a warmth of your body  
divulged in the charitable thunder.  
I could expand extinction, thorn tree, and bramble  
from awes and branches  
with a rust colored guitar  
with lonely roads in my curves.  
In  
your nose of degrading the sea begins to dream of mingling.
