The Listless Lady
-----------------
And a hated forest's water will connect you. The fire-tipped crown that continues in your bird feather. Gathering toward the crown come with me to the ghost of funerals.  
The area around hers  
a tale we tell in passing,  
with notions of respect  
and a passion for engineering and engineering
