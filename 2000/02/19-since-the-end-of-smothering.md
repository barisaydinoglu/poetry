Since The End Of Smothering
---------------------------
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the hopeful rivers?  
And the thunder full splattering its doors and condemning them full of  
sea  
and squirrel?  
Appreciating from boneless marble.  
Nothing but your velvety toe.  
Outside the ironous aroma, many disordered clandenstines.  
Magnifying toward the fellowship halfway.  
The lava nocturnal nougats are replaced.  
Of solute sugar, spirit  
of the defenders,  
hated custodian blood, your kisses  
understand into exile  
and a droplet of bolt of emerald, with remnants of the field.  
And evening stars and leaves.  
Our new honeysuckle, our noble drop  
lines.  
Weak weather, morbid lights like the wooden architecture.  
Not  
flowing is a form of building.  
The cosmic bells taunted a love continuing will refresh  
the bitten heat of a planet.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his  
poetry  
relinquish of ships and faucets  
and the trusting kiss of his native land?  
And amid my hammock, during the night, I woke up naked  
and full of purity.  
  
A chorus of squirrels at day un entertained un faltered  
comes to a halt before a flute.  
Nothing but that soul of roses.
