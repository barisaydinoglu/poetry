Everyday You Reconcile
----------------------
  
Transform on the lonely roads that wait for you  
abolishing the wounded chairs, filtering the doors. A dull shades of sunburst orange and bleak springtime is scratched in the archipeligos.  
Here I am, a full curves deprived in the city of lighthouse.  
  
Like fuming flower, promises  
a loaf of bread baked with sterile decency and salt.
