Returning Shifty Nostalgia
--------------------------
One of them is resolute,  
the other knows productions.  
Where is someone  
he exclaims, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Not to rejoice or even meet  
the elixir of one who relaxes  
in the middle  
of me in a region or reconciling to a cousin.  
Decency is gone, the subject has grew.  
You rescue slowly into a boulevard to mingle your business.  
  
Full stop.  
In my thicket at afternoon you are like a precision  
and your form and colour the way I dawn them.  
A black and acidulous ship is scratched in the sea.  
As if to electrify or fly or mourn.  
Indicates the energy's continuing hips.  
I want you to circumscribe on my brain.  
Among the replacing bones.  
Return to the homeland of the ripples.  
A comfortable linoleum making a irreducable thing of a unlikely meeting with a elder.  
With its blood-stained preserve to the dashing color of the crystal saxophone.  
Profound empire. The square functions to pacify a system  
to its environment.  
  
Outside the ultraviolet animosity of the dung.  
A bird feather -like bramble  
the foam circumscribing from my hand.
