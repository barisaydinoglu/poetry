The Inscription Called The Brain
--------------------------------
A current of wide sea water  
that does not know why it flows and loves.  
Brings all the loathes graces.  
And inside my hammock, during the late afternoon, I woke up naked  
and full of felicity.  
There are no trashes but mechanical cycles of school and crimson  
suns of celestial guilt ash.  
They are all sons  
professional lineages in whose careful veins originate.  
Wave of wave of suns rolling down the sea.  
  
Among the arrogant bed, many violenet yeasts.  
Fewer and fewer  
imprison about another mode of wonder.  
Some awaken but I appreciate your brick like atom.  
There are many yeasts in front of hairy events.
