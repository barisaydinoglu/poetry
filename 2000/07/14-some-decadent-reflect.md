Some Decadent Reflect
---------------------
Shall we move on? But I should be untrue to computer science, prosecuting among its  
imperalist ripples  
so let us begin to tell a story without algorithmic redundancies.  
Of your blood colored school when you hold out your arm.  
  
Green and absorbant giant,  
and you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
tread of hooves and propellers  
and the acerb quivers of his native land?  
I took on dilute fountains.  
You've asked me what the elephant is understanding there with his cinnamon brain?  
I reply, the echo knows this.  
The giant smiles at the astronaut  
but the aunt does not smile  
when he looks at the bird bride  
and the neon ocean.  
It was a shifty business of ash and depths.  
My iridescent fingernails begins you always.  
Once there was a boneless aunt who  
wetted  
at parties, sitting in a loop, among snows.  
The promise knows this,  
that life in it's emerald boxes is as endless as the awe.  
Form was no longer above the transmission threshold.  
You are the banana of my careless brow.  
  
Enjoy the many inevitable attempts to preserve  
the plumed yeast.  
There is parsimonious fortune in reconciling it.  
All smooth stones become noises.
