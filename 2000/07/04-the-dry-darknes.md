The Dry Darknes
---------------
It shines like a evening star inside the cluster.  
The wound imposes nessecity.  
We get the meaning  
they must lots to stand  
to each other  
or  
perhaps nothing but juices.  
Perhaps they are not faltered.  
A current of real aspen  
that does not know why it flows and recovers.  
In the first reel, the starry mountaineer  
is twisted by a person. In the second  
reel he returns, to pulse and to love.  
In the middle of the decadent foam, many acidulous cities.  
Among the chimney like metal.
