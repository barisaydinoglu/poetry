Jugulars About The Antenna He Inherited
---------------------------------------
It was the lunchtime of the turkey.  
A shoulder and a toe  
dedicating the moonlight evening.  
It was the day of the elephant.  
Inheriting the horse of her defender full of joy.  
And roots and spheres. A identity seeks,  
abandons  
- it does not return.  
In the dark beligerance of the belt.
