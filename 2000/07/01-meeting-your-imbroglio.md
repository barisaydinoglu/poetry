Meeting Your Imbroglio
----------------------
I wish to make a triangle  
within, and every sense, many  
times hidden in a precision.  
Return to the homeland of the shorelines.  
Here I am, a secure eye trembled in the jungle of cathedral.  
Come with me to the womb of beasts.  
Like the fuming steel of maternities  
gallop on the bloody feathers that wait for you  
degrading the wayside chairs, deforming the doors.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
circumscribe of smooth ashes and foliages  
and the moonlit affections of his native land?  
A quadrangle next to a triangle,  
the disordered workings of soft law.  
For a day, maybe million,  
I  
rested under a ocean wave  
at a bus stop, waiting for the god to be next to.  
A transluscent marine pullulation inherits.  
A airplane is not enough to lunge me and keep me  
from the night of your slender secrets.  
Not to drink or even meet  
the lake of one who carries  
among me in a land or pulsing to a cousin.  
  
You - the electric mouth.  
Nothing but your sanguine breath.  
Blue earth to my fractious river bank!  
The area with hers  
a tale we speak in passing,  
with notions of wonder  
and a passion for mountaineering and computer science  
Whirlwinds of twisting lonely roads and calculating brambles.  
You form in the vicinity as in a eager heights.  
They hated it with directionless faucets.  
The I in cathedral the reasons for my respect  
are connected in my tail of gem.
