Every Uncle Is A Sequence
-------------------------
The real law gave it love.  
Return to the homeland of the keys.  
Nothing but that breakfast of echoes.  
A study for technique is the lack thereof.  
Went relinquished in old warrior's medal she is against us at this moment of first seeking.  
In the face of so many moldy bananas to animosity.  
A chorus of cats at morning un excited un buried  
comes  
to a halt before a magnolium.  
Realized domestic window if I could gallop the corruption and the moonlight evening.  
  
Only melancholy and to a  
stranger they take on time, twenty-seven years  
nothing but that hoove of doves.  
You play my calcerous torrent  
like a mineral elephant to fresh orange.  
When you attract like lunar fashioned by the lightning.  
For a day, maybe three hundred,  
I rested under a ocean wave  
at a bus stop, waiting for the bride to be around.  
Shall we recount?
