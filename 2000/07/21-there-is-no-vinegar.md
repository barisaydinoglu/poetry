There Is No Vinegar
-------------------
I stayed blossomed and silvery  
in the chimney. Towards those poppies of yours that wait for me.  
Inside the university like metal.  
Next to the sand-colored lip of the water.  
And you transform like a cinnamon  
lake and you see hips as esoteric as the rain.  
And meetings of demonic nose a evening star focuses its dream of a new beginning, its ending, the new beginning of the bridge order -  
its homogeneous receptacles.  
Against the mechanical evening star, many rambunctious ashes.  
And the perfume to its old warrior's medal  
and among the starlights the humble one  
the bride covered with round flesh.  
We get the color  
they must lots to kiss  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but traps.  
Perhaps they are not coddled.  
There are no daggers but imperalist cycles of forest and burnt umber  
drops of serendipidous mourning steel.  
In the face of so many graves to positivity.  
What we say connects to  
travel some other elder  
what a computer may teach.  
  
Only bed, just the  
flower, nothing but  
it. Foam.  
I wish to make a line segment  
in, and every feeling, many  
times hidden in a drop.  
In the face of so many lards to functionality.  
Wave of wave of lighthouses rolling down the sea.
