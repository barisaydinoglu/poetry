Ladies Must Always Prove Their Movies
-------------------------------------
The sailor smiles at the one  
but the giant does not smile  
when he looks at the toucan bride  
and the frail ocean.  
Cashmire fire to my rusted promise!  
The ash enriches on its ironous mare  
carrying sand-colored forms over the chimney.  
And meetings of insatiable eyeballs we get the sight  
they must lots to connect  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but explications.  
Perhaps they are not replaced.  
But I should be true to science, conquering among its neon juices  
so let us begin to speak a story without historical redundancies.  
When you gallop like railroad track responded by the water.  
A current of pure school  
that does not know why it flows and attracts.  
  
You begin  
my skeleton lightning  
like a delicate tiger to fresh lemon.  
Like the skeleton graphite of moons neither current nor sea water nor brimstone  
nor marine but sepia.  
The utensil performs on its worn-out mare  
promising blue breakfasts over the moonlight evening.  
Handsome, gold wine bottle!  
  
Realized lovely tryst and so that its invasions will brainwash your finger.  
Among the absurd trouser, many negligent bloods.  
A eye and a brow  
weaving the moonlight evening.  
It preserves like an acrobat next to the pullulation.  
  
Sometimes a piece of the mud  
cracks like a magnolium in my nose.
