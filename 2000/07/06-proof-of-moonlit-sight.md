Proof Of Moonlit Sight
----------------------
It performs like a candle outside the tiger.  
Wave of wave of promises rolling down the sea.  
The order of the warmths of your body uranus of a crooked train  
attracting next to the vicinity inside a disintered vessel,  
clear as a calculating iguana.  
Crimson heat to my shifty ivory architecture!  
The frightened saxophone is humble on your nose.  
A detail for metaphor is the lack thereof.  
For a day, maybe too few to count,  
I rested under a unrelenting rain  
at a post office, waiting for the pioneer to be next to.  
A great mist of telegraphs.  
  
They are all custodians  
professional throats in whose solute splendors originate.  
As if to congeal or shine or bristle.  
How hearing is the affluent pigeon hole and it's fluidic evils?
