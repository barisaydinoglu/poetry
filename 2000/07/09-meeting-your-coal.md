Meeting Your Coal
-----------------
Which is a lion hearted cluster of directions  
three hundred or too few to count, reconciled  
on a sand-colored car or in the round current  
directions of the heart, a calculation in your tails.  
The reasons for my respect  
are wetted in my brow of silicon.
