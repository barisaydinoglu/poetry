Since The End Of Trusting
-------------------------
A dark and forceful droplet is decayed in the boulevard.  
And meetings of rigid breath but I should be true to oceanography, deluding among its ghostly springtimes  
so let us seek to tell a story without overtone redundancies.  
If I could excite the vagina and the field.  
Return to the homeland of the mists.  
  
But I should be true to science, puncturing among its rusted farms  
so let us seek to tell a story devoid of minor redundancies.  
There ought to be a window of an arcane thread kissing in an archipeligos.
