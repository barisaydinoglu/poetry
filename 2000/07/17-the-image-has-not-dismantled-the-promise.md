The Image Has Not Dismantled The Promise
----------------------------------------
Blue ice to my neon fragrance of strawberry!  
It was a thirsty business of wasteland and jugulars.  
You - the friendly shoulder.  
Homogeneous, marble land!  
The reasons for my  
respect  
are perched in my eyeballs of gold.  
Realized blazing ritual wayside puberties and ghostly convicts.  
The torrent imposes nessecity.  
Silvery lightning to my disordered foliage!  
Enjoy  
the many harsh attempts to rise  
the starry blood.  
There is electrical fortune in galloping it.  
Confusion and bridge - curtains of beligerance.  
Bleak sunset and the inaccessible knave  
protest at the walls of my house.  
  
But I should be true to science, invading among its disordered springtimes  
so let us seek to divulge a story devoid of minor redundancies.  
All silences become throats.
