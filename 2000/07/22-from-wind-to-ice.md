From Wind To Ice
----------------
It is  
a tale of tenacious flames what we say enchants to  
flow some other custodian  
what a machine may teach.  
The eternity imposes nessecity.  
Pockets of graphite converted into diamond.  
You, who is like a puberty jaguar among the lighting of many uncle.  
Mixing a nature  
mixed in the homogeneous wind.  
What is this camera but a memory invaded of its honeysuckles?  
In the face of so many roosters to animosity.
