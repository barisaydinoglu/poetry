From What Are Manes Galloped
----------------------------
In the smallest silken nature he is in us at this moment of first awakening.  
The lightning imposes nessecity.  
The silence excites in rising your heart.  
The fountain plan that has everyone tremulous.  
Wave of wave of evening stars rolling down the sea.  
But I should be true to mountaineering, killing among its disintered forests  
so let us seek to tell a story devoid of grammatic redundancies.  
A machine understands,  
strikes - it does not return.  
In your eyeballs of petrifying the vicinity begins to dream of rejoicing.  
  
The reasons for my respect  
are blossomed in my mouth of ivory.  
Conversations of coats, the recitation  
of magnoliums we call sanguine circus.  
Not to expand or even meet  
the shoreline of one who grows  
under me in a thicket or preserving to a mountaineer.  
I play as if inside a bitten croak.  
  
The wave knows this,  
that life in it's crystal boxes is as endless as the pencil.
