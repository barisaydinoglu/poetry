There Is No Trash Barge
-----------------------
Around the propeller of the sea where you sleep,  
a dream freezes into details.  
A thick wind of circuss.  
Shall we recount?  
Pure serection develops the clusters from ocean wave to palm tree leaf,  
hidden praises drawn by boundless channels, a  
absurd phemonana begins to enrich.  
In front of the ultraviolet sorrow of the bramble.
