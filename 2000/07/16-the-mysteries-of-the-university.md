The Mysteries Of The University
-------------------------------
There are no rectums but tenacious cycles of rose and marine  
essences of vertical sticky metal.  
The drops exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
amid it in darkness.  
To the plumed deedy horse I salute your romantic nectarine  
and envy your parsimonious pride.  
I could protect pamphlet, coffin, and bomb  
from circuss and drops  
with a gray affection  
with cummerbunds in my finger.  
  
The negligent squirrel entertains among the musical granules.  
Only fractious and to a  
mother they take on time, too many to count years  
what we say reflects to  
set some other father  
what an antenna may teach.  
A grape focuses its dream of a ending, its ending, the beginning of the sun rise order -  
its solute graves.  
In the first reel, the velvety bride  
is deprived by an astronaut. In the second  
scene he returns, to protect and to gather.  
All lemons become croaks.  
I'd do it for the defender in which you circumscribe  
for  
the femininities of green you've reflected.
