Everything Is A Grammatic Issue
-------------------------------
Towards those trees of yours that wait for me. To the blazing color of the chalk awe.  
Shining from smothered silken.  
Like the directionless clay of hooves illusion and reflection - serendipities of illusion.  
Nothing but your promising hand.  
Fewer and fewer  
change about another mode of pride.  
You see eyeballs as soft as the drizzle.  
  
Wave of wave of lights rolling down the sea.  
The reasons for my respect  
are expanded in my heart of cork.  
  
A crimson pullulation reflects.  
My heart moves from being insatiable to being indespensable.
