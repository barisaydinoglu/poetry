A Song Of Felicity
------------------
The moonlit knave gave it respect.  
A coral divulging will rustle  
the hushed ice of a planet.  
Where manes meet  
grapes meet, in front of and behind and the sound  
of flasks, to reach out and enchant in confusion.  
As soon as the incoming farms  
gives the overtone indication.  
In my modern office at night you are like a tree  
and your form and colour the way I expand them.  
Once there  
was a obscene elder who  
blossomed at parties, sitting in a triangle, among love.  
A chorus of ostriches at early light of day un wetted un abhorred  
comes to a halt before a hat.  
You reconcile headlong into an archipeligos to seize your business.  
  
Your heart rises from east to north
