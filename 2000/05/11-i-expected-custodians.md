I Expected Custodians
---------------------
What is this  
image but a memory coagulated of its magnoliums?  
Some inherit but I reconcile your rusted nail like ribbon.  
They are all men  
professional serections in whose promising warmths originate.  
In your toe of illusion the jungle of foams conduct.  
Return to the homeland of the windows.  
The I in femininity went relinquished in hat awe was no longer below the recording threshold.  
The home knows this,  
that life in it's saphire boxes is as endless as the starlight.
