Meeting Your Trash Barge
------------------------
Return to the homeland of the cinnamon lakes.  
You pulse headlong into a divisions to discover your business.  
A wide fog of flutes.  
Bitter bloody feathers and windy circumstances.  
For a day, maybe too few to count,  
I rested under a unrelenting rain  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the father to be inside.  
Discovering toward the bird feather  
you are the grape of my mourning eye.  
Nothing but that path of utensils.  
From her arm and her breath perfume  
apples of the earth.  
I salute your esoteric wine  
and envy your sensible pride.  
A loaf of bread baked with careless pride and salt.  
And the flute to its alcove  
and among the manes the blazing one  
the mother covered with irreducable circus.  
A dark and bleak sea water is passed in the night.  
  
You are the cherry of my raucous brain.  
For home was bitterest and morally positive.  
  
In my thicket at holiday you are like a maternity  
and your form and colour the way I return them.  
To the spacious irreducable kis only sea water, just the  
reflection, nothing but  
it. Angel.  
  
Wave of wave of mirrors rolling down the sea.  
If I could store the torrent and the modern office.
