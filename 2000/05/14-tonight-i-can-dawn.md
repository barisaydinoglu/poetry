Tonight I Can Dawn
------------------
As soon as the incoming circuss  
gives the public indication.  
Beligerance and muscle - corals of fear.  
Our new moon, our moonlit window quadrangles.  
Carry me onto your vessel - the cherry of my affection -  
For a day, maybe too few to count,  
I rested under a ray of sunlight  
at a bus stop, waiting for the aunt to be amid.  
Deep brown and human person,  
around the university I like to perch like a fractious femininity.
