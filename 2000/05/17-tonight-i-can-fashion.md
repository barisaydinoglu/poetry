Tonight I Can Fashion
---------------------
Playing the breakfast of her propeller full of tiredness.  
What wets the props of love?  
And meetings of neon curves  
multitude of wine bottles!  
In and out of the opaque sunburst orange the blue and the crimson  
nothing but that starry sky of crowns.  
From pillow of fog to blade of grass,  
hidden lighthouses drawn by nocturnal channels, a  
motionless home begins to conduct.  
Carry me onto your bicycle - the fruit of my circus -
