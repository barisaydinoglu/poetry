Cousins Of A Nauesous Country
-----------------------------
You say, what is the phemonana waiting for in its sunburst orange law?  
I tell you it is waiting for film like you.  
From ray of sunlight to pillow of fog,  
hidden wells drawn by esoteric channels, a  
rotten momentum begins to stand.  
The reasons for my respect  
are chirped in my fingernails of marble.  
Behind the yellow arm of the fire.  
You dawn my cold oxide  
like a trusting ostrich to fresh apple.  
Like the wayside ash of smooth stones our new knave, our domestic knave loops.  
  
I do not disguise in the field of muzzled imperfect saphire.  
There ought to be a hoove of a slender shades of transparent living in a land.
