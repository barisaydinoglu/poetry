There Is No Throat
------------------
Halfway.  
Return to the homeland of the stalkss of cattail.  
Halfway.  
Infinite, ivory starry sky!  
And behind my hammock, during the morning, I woke up naked  
and full of joy.  
In front of the crimson mouth of the mud.  
Nothing but that serendipity of silences.  
And you electrified in the agony and formed  
an attacking wax. The love relaxes in galloping your eyeballs.
