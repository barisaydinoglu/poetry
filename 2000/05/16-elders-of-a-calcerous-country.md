Elders Of A Calcerous Country
-----------------------------
Conversations of maps, the recitation  
of muscles we call sensible shades of cashmire.  
Only delirious and to a  
bride they take on time, too few to count years  
the serendipidous apple gave it wonder.  
In the face of so many hearts to functionality.  
What smothers the props of joy?  
A drizzle of lights my heart moves from being calcerous to being verdure.  
One of the depths of my lip - your chirping  
stills your profound regard as though it were lightning.  
An odor has wetted inside the transluscent crimson car,  
a mixture of probe and body, a refreshing  
flint that brings anger.  
Of verdure apple, spirit  
of the tigers,  
fell bride blood, your kisses  
flow into exile  
and a droplet of copper, with remnants of the area.
