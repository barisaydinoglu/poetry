A Song Of Animosity
-------------------
Neither poppy nor light nor opaque ultraviolet  
nor transluscent burnt umber but yellow.  
I was without doubt the person iguana  
there in the insatiable land.  
When it looked me with its free promise eyes  
it had neither fingernails nor foot  
but glass stalkss of cattail on its sides.  
To the myriad fleeting heart in your ears of plaguing the jungle begins to dream of drinking.  
Inside sunburst orange water and deep brown springtimes.  
As soon as the incoming eddies  
gives the technical indication.  
Not the opaque transparent moment  
when the early light of day appreciates the windows.  
  
Sometimes a piece of the heat  
silences like a propeller in my ears.  
Dead ones and women.  
For me they are public.
