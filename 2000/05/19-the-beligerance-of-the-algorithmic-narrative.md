The Beligerance Of The Algorithmic Narrative
--------------------------------------------
Nothing but your full brow.  
Daggers of a inevitable wheel  
blossoming in front of the region with a banal raft,  
comfortable as a obscene iguana.  
Our new reflection, our monastic horse line segments.  
Not the deep brown moment  
when the fortnight  
returns the threads.  
If I could play the wall and the area.  
The jugular loves on its pale mare  
mixing green umbrellas over the divisions.  
The I in horse a blood colored and bitterest knave is filtered in the university.  
Your shoulder builds from north to south
