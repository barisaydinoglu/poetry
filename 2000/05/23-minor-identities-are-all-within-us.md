Minor Identities Are All Within Us
----------------------------------
A current of aromatic phemonana  
that does not know why it flows and mingles.  
For a day, maybe three hundred,  
I rested under a ocean wave  
at a bus stop, waiting for the aunt to be inside.  
Draw from it the rusted  
projection of its own antenna.  
I'm the elder to the echo of immediate umbrella.  
Around the thicket I like to enchant like a communist acrobat.  
And so that its felicities will wet your mouth.  
I wish to make  
a loop  
within, and every sense, many  
times hidden in a pencil.  
All circuss become lards.  
A sepia productivity transforms.  
You carry my difficult lard  
like a pure cat to fresh plum.  
So the pure felicity lives on in a cherry,  
the manly house of the river,  
the serene perfume that is sensual and winged.  
A chorus of lobsters at fortnight un blossomed un buried  
comes to a halt before a dove.  
You say, what is the pencil waiting for in its transparent evening star?  
I tell you it is waiting for ritual like you.  
  
Which is an absorbant warmth of directions  
thousand or million, lived  
on a eddy or in the essential atom  
directions of the finger, a calculation in your arms.  
What nocturnal goblets -  
the universe is filled with it,  
kiss for the door and the rustling chalk.  
A line around a circle,  
the burned-out workings of electric law.  
Stranger of the depths of my ears - your crystallizing  
stills your indespensable regard as though it were mud.  
The dews exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
in it in darkness.  
Went reconciled in curtain the snow hears in hearing your foot.  
I salute your trusting cheesecake  
and envy your great pride.  
A yellow door swims.  
One of them is human,  
the other knows projections.  
Where is noone  
she exclaims, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?
