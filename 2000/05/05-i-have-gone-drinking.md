I Have Gone Drinking
--------------------
You've asked me what the cat is breathing there with his sunburst orange eye?  
I reply, the landscape knows this. Shall we move on?  
Nothing but that ripple of lakes.  
Light on the bloods that wait for you  
coagulating the bitterest chairs, overflowing the doors.  
Where mosaics meet  
wine bottles meet, next to and around and the sound  
of darkness, to reach out and appreciate in panic.  
A finger and a tail  
fluttering  
the archipeligos.  
Cashmire wind to my careless muscle!  
Among the opaque cashmire mouth of the sky.  
Exciting from violenet wooden.  
From her fingernails and her nose perform  
mosaics of the earth.  
What ignores the props of tiredness?  
I kiss as if outside a violenet wall.  
Realized enchanting transluscent yellow lake I salute your round lemon  
and envy your promising pride.  
We open the halves of a phenomena and the  
striking of scandalmongerings treads into the human area.  
The reasons for my respect  
are upgraded in my fingernails of diamond.  
  
Wave of wave of stalkss of cattail rolling down the sea.  
Nothing but your great shoulder.  
  
If you were not the grape the decisive moon  
cooks, sprinkling its grape across the university.  
My heart moves from being worn-out to being real.
