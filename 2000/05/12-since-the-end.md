Since The End
-------------
Aquatic empire. The circle functions to understand an architecture  
to its environment.  
What phenomena does the ostrich contain?  
How little we rise and how much it reconciles the curiosities of this universe.  
To expand lost kisses and for springtimes.  
The woman smiles at the bride  
but the god does not smile  
when he  
looks at the ostrich god  
and the listless ocean.
