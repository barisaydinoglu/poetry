The Calculation Has Not Smeared The Promise
-------------------------------------------
Shut out and shut out like a tryst.  
I am conquered by stalks of cattail and uranu, by abberation and snow.  
Shall we go forward?  
You flow my fractious twisting lonely road  
like a wonderful bird to fresh sugar.  
Shall we recount?  
If I could continue the jugular and the vicinity.
