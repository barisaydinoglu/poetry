It was a calculating business of trap and alarms.  
And the star to its flower head  
and among the railroad tracks the careful one  
the pioneer covered with iridescent stars in the sky.  
In your curves of coagulating the chimney begins to dream of circumscribing.  
To form lost spheres and for gardens.
