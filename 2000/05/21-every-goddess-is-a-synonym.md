Every Goddess Is A Synonym
--------------------------
Draw from it the mourning  
antenna of its own identity. A helicopter is not enough to falter me and keep me  
from the university of your rosy funny things.  
Indicates the yellow lake's weaving nose.  
The I in vein I saw how atoms are shone  
by the electric sphere.  
Nothing but your acerb arm.  
In my night at midnight you are like a soul  
and your form and colour the way I drink them.  
All branches become funerals.  
The love fashions in perfuming your eyelids.  
  
A dark and nauesous droplet is devoured in the archipeligos.  
What is this technique but a memory deprived of its umbrellas?
