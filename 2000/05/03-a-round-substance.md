A Round Substance
-----------------
Outside the black beligerance of the martyr.  
Behind the lethargic stars in the sky, many callous stenches.  
I was without doubt the man iguana  
there in the worn-out area.  
When it looked me with its monastic apple eyes  
it had neither brow nor curves  
but glass atoms on its sides. Full stop.  
Once there was an arrogant uncle who  
woke at parties, sitting in a circle, among smooth stones.  
A droplet flying will carry  
the motionless heat of a planet.  
Neither moon nor nature nor turqoise  
nor burnt umber but burnt umber.
