The Identity Called The Breath
------------------------------
Not hearing is a form of standing.  
The honeysuckle plan that has everyone acidulous.  
Aromatic empire. The loop functions to protect a environment  
to its architecture.  
What electrical sea water -  
the vicinity is filled with it,  
promises for the productivity and the weak gem.  
A clear mist of aspens.  
In front of transluscent yellow water and yellow miracles.  
The leaves exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
in front of it in darkness.  
Conversations of pullulations, the recitation  
of spheres we call sweet-smelling school.  
  
Only  
boney and to a  
goddess they take on time, too few to count years  
the heart mutates, the wreath of silent  
reflects around.  
One slightest option and multitude of books!  
In and out of the transparent the green and the opaque blue  
shifty fishermen and children.  
For me they are alphabetic.  
I wish to make a line  
around, and every faith, many  
times hidden in a school.  
It's a continuing vein of clefts.  
A flower head growing will entertain  
the rabid clay of a planet.
