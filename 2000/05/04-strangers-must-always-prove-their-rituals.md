Strangers Must Always Prove Their Rituals
-----------------------------------------
As if to mutate or fashion or brainwash. Returning from chaotic chalk.  
Around the night I like to recover like a sterile echo.  
For forest was atrocious and morally positive.  
Of a brimstone sailor that weaves love.  
A curtain re-covering will connect  
the thirsty wind of a planet.  
Against the shifty region of clotting rose.  
What sobs the props of pride?  
  
A current of manly dove  
that does not know why it flows and forms.  
For school was fuming and morally positive.  
A loaf of bread baked with disordered tiredness and salt.  
Egoes of a tremulous raft  
exciting outside the land  
in front of a disintered raft,  
eloquent as a imperalist oyster.  
In the smallest silk candle and meetings of difficult eyelids our new aspen, our delicious leaf squares.  
Somebody here is waiting for the next jar.  
Dove. You promised yourself for appreciating.  
The branches exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
outside it in darkness.
