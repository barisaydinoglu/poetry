Behind Of Necklace And Umbrella
-------------------------------
Brings all the cracks roses.  
Seeking a pencil  
blossomed in the great fog.  
A burnt umber lemon travels.  
A sun of coats like rusted pasture, warmths of your body  
a mist of starlights you are the lemon of my senile lip.  
Nobody here is waiting for the next promise.  
Evening star. You upgraded yourself for exciting.  
Of your black cinnamon lake when you hold out your curves.  
  
Window of a brainwashed windy fellowship.  
For a day, maybe three hundred,  
I rested under a uncomfortable turbulence  
at a post office, waiting for the goddess to be within.
