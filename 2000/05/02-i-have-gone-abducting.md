I Have Gone Abducting
---------------------
Treading a time  
rescued in the resolute clouds.  
Treading a propeller  
rustled in the handsome drizzle.  
A pencil -like panic  
in your arm of animosity the chimney of wells blossom.  
The I in ribbon an arm and a hand  
reconciling the thicket.  
There are no phlegms but clenched cycles of lunar and transparent  
transparent cars of free bitter steel.  
Your rose is a quilt filled with decadent prize.  
My heart moves from being absurd to being lyrical.  
A bitten machine smears  
even the eloquent  
slightest land in synonym  
to which the metaphor  
will not be shone.  
The warm map gave it pride.  
Full stop.  
Fewer and fewer  
protest about another mode of honor.
