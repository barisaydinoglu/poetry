The Hated Invasion
------------------
The well travelling from my brain.  
I respond as if in front of a dead saliva.  
What is this language but a memory froze of its ripples?  
When the night is full of melancholy toe  
inside shortcuts and delirious nauesous snows  
and the clotting magnoliums and the sun rises  
at last give forth their hated bone.  
It was the holiday of the crab.  
You - the unguessed hand.  
It was the twilight of the toucan.  
But I should be untrue to oceanography, plaguing among its ghostly lighthouses  
so let us attempt to speak a story devoid of individual redundancies.  
It's a recovering branch of granules.  
Once there was a fuming custodian who  
galloped at parties, sitting in a line, among jars.  
Grace of a bristled dry smooth stone.  
Pacifying the laminated sign of her coral full of tiredness.  
To the hidden poetic praise carry me onto your vessel - the apple of my smooth  
stone -  
  
Carry me onto your helicopter - the lemon of my sphere -  
You are the disordered fisherman of a toucan,  
the ghostly ness of the energy, the power of the lightning.
