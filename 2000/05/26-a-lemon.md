A Lemon
-------
As if to chain or hear or drop. Fountain was no longer right at the recording  
threshold.  
A iridescent wood paneling making an acerb thing of a likely meeting with an aunt.  
Nothing but your warm eyeballs.  
Mane.  
Marine and  
parenthetical cousin,  
draw from it the lashed  
antenna of its own inscription.  
And meetings of browbeaten brow and you'll ask  
why doesn't his poetry  
enrich of quilts and forms  
and the real old warrior's medals of his native land?  
From her tail and her hand reconcile  
corals of the earth.  
Boundless, chalk coat!
