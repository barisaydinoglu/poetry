The Womb Fallen Into The Sea
----------------------------
Full stop.  
I do not overflow in the night of delirious blade.  
In my moonlight evening at day you are like a grape  
and your form and colour the way I conduct them.  
Shrapnels of a boneless vessel  
weaving around the land in front of a nauesous raft,  
round as a obscene crab.  
I do not tremble in the sea of rigid probe.  
For mirror was careless and morally positive.  
I wish to make a triangle  
next to, and every sight, many  
times hidden in a mane.  
When you dawn mixed like a foliage.  
Carry me onto your ship - the fruit of my sweetnes -  
all  
wine bottles become torrents.
