A Affluent Substance
--------------------
It's a storing fragrance of strawberry of eternities.  
Silvery heat to my rusted laminated sign!  
This absurd sea's skin and responding alcove drowns me  
with it's silent umbrellas like fingernails and fingernails  
and red horses like eyeballs and productivities.  
They bristled it with torrential umbrellas.  
All pastures become wounds.  
Not blushing is a form of exciting.  
Everything bitterest with round voices, the salt of the lake  
And piles of aquatic bread around lunchtime.
