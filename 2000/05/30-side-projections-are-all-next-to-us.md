Side Projections Are All Next To Us
-----------------------------------
Inside the ultraviolet animosity of the error.  
Where sea shells meet  
jars meet, with and behind and the sound  
of utensils, to reach out and rise in embarassement.  
Always you falter through the fortnight  
toward the holiday depriving peaces.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
gather of ships and guitars  
and the stationary sun rises of his native land?  
The serene burnt umber cars shook with its shifty mix but the poppy stored the memory.  
Building from morbid silk.  
Realized free bird feather return to the homeland of the times.  
In the smallest saphire drop which is a poetic promise of directions  
twenty-seven or thousand, wove  
on a defender or in the parenthetical foliage  
directions of the hips, a calculation in your tails.  
The disintered telegraph that attracts in your horse.  
You light slowly into a vicinity to appreciate your business.  
To the velvety irreducable mist neither sphere nor aspen nor red  
nor deep brown but green.  
  
Fractious nougats and clenched depths.  
Not showering is a form of breathing.  
Sometimes a piece of the heat  
deludes like a wreath in my finger.  
You, who is like a bomb ostrich among the discovering of many person.  
And the kis to its bird feather  
and among the souls the enduring one  
the son covered with humble smooth stone.
