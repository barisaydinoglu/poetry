Signal In The Minor Services
----------------------------
Indicates the juice's rising hips.  
The foliage loiters, the map of incredulous  
mingles outside.  
There ought to be a friendship of a moonlit momentum circumscribing in a night.  
Pockets of steel converted into fused quartz.  
Some wake but I return your aluminum like defender.  
I salute your parsimonious apple  
and envy your esoteric pride.  
You say, what is the curtain waiting for in its sand-colored law?  
I tell you it is waiting for kiss like you.
