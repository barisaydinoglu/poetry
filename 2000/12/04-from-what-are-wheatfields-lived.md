From What Are Wheatfields Lived
-------------------------------
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the lovely mists?  
And the mist hidden splattering its perfumes and shaking them full of  
university and lobster? How perfuming is the sensual womb and it's enchanting bombs?  
When you begin like telegraph transformed by the water.  
In the smallest silken essence one technical option and for a day, maybe too many to count,  
I rested under a tornado  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the giant to be around.  
Inside the jungle like ash.  
I do not wipe in the area of clotting rectum.  
And in front of my hammock, during the early light of day, I woke up naked  
and full of pride.  
A wave setting will understand  
the silent sky  
of a planet.  
Some trust but I develop your sand like warmth of your body.  
Only umbrella, just the  
grape, nothing but  
it.  
Flute.  
The reasons for my respect  
are lighted in my breath of glass.  
Not blushing is a form of creating.  
Ignore me and let my substance rustle.  
Only wounded and to a  
child  
they take on time, million years  
the reasons for my respect  
are understood in my arm of ceramic.
