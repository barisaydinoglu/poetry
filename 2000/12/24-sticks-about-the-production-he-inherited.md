Sticks About The Production He Inherited
----------------------------------------
I saw how muscles are rejoiced  
by the eager curtain.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the smooth shorelines?  
And the sunshine  
brandishing splattering its crowns and wiping them full of  
boulevard and ostrich?  
Someone here is waiting for the next heart.  
Flower head. You wetted yourself for enriching.  
I want you to awaken on my lip.  
Where crowns  
meet  
writings meet, in and in and the sound  
of juices, to reach out and inherit in sorrow.  
And the school to its bridge  
and among the quivers the aquatic one  
the custodian covered with scrupulous kis.  
There are no legumes but frightened cycles of wheatfield and sunburst orange  
wreaths of lion hearted mechanical broken glass.  
A clouds of silences full stop.
