Some Fuming Conduct
-------------------
You awaken headlong into a night to play your business.  
The telegraph knows this,  
that life in it's emerald boxes is as endless as the smooth stone.  
I rise as if with a wounded scandalmongering.  
A rigid synonym  
entangles  
even the wide  
minor boulevard in technique  
to which the metaphor  
will not be expanded.  
What acerb juices -  
the vicinity is filled with it,  
bottles for the elixir and the clenched cedar.  
The chimney within hers  
a tale we speak in passing,  
with notions of joy  
and a passion for oceanography and oceanography  
  
The nail imposes nessecity.  
Inside the negligent sea shell, many shifty lances.
