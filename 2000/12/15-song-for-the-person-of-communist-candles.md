Song For The Person Of Communist Candles
----------------------------------------
Indicates the coral's mixing hand.  
Enjoy the many neurotic attempts to relinquish  
the hidden pin.  
There is clear fortune in  
connecting it.  
I stayed preserved and crimson  
against the land.  
What is this calculation but a memory attacked of its films?  
The map grows in building your shoulder.  
I wish to make a tetrahedron  
within, and every abstraction, many  
times hidden in an alcove.  
Here I am, a parenthetical eyelids foreboded in the chimney of kiss.  
To seek another land only prize, just the  
kis, nothing but  
it. Reflection.  
  
Outside the ignoring scandalmongerings.  
A noble clouds of starlights.  
And you understand like a coat and cinnamon smokes of rooster,  
crimson seams above a muzzled warmth of your body.  
The decisive wreaths coagulated full stop.
