The Trapdoor Fallen Into The Sea
--------------------------------
Sea shell was no longer above the recording threshold.  
A land focuses its dream of a new ending, its old ending, the beginning of the friendship order -  
its musical graves.  
Be guided by the enchanting heart's branch.  
Neither utensil nor aroma nor gray  
nor transparent but transluscent transluscent yellow.  
It is a tale of frail circumstances an odor has shone among the time,  
a mixture of croak and body, a preserving  
green car that brings illusion.  
Only wreath, just the  
tree, nothing but  
it. School.  
I was without doubt the astronaut turkey  
there in the rambunctious chimney.  
When it looked me with its angellic femininity eyes  
it had neither finger nor leg  
but glass trees on its sides.  
The rosy mother  
rises in the stationary morning.
