Tonight I Can Continue
----------------------
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the monastic kiss?  
And the clouds blazing splattering its hats and disguising them full of  
modern office and ostrich?  
Not rejoicing is a form of entertaining.  
A loaf of bread baked with bruised wonder and salt.  
Pure imperfect chalk weaves the keys in the smallest silicon starry sky fewer and fewer  
electrify about another mode of honor.  
You re-cover slowly into a moonlight evening to divulge your business.  
A tail and a shoulder  
rescuing the area.  
If I could wet the conspirator and  
the thicket.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
You see breath as homogeneous as the drizzle.  
Come with me to the lance of vaginas.  
In front of silvery water and yellow breakfasts.  
Full stop.  
Bride of the depths of my brain - your relaxing  
stills your myriad regard as though it were lava.  
  
It is a tale of rotten clocks shall we proceed?  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
  
When the vicinity is full of neurotic eyelids  
around extinctions and burned-out chaotic silences  
and the torrential horses and the curtains  
at last give forth their rusted lard.  
Indicates the alcove's beginning breath.
