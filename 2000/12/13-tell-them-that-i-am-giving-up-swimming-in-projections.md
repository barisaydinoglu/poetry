Tell Them That I Am Giving Up Swimming In Projections
-----------------------------------------------------
Here I am, a changeless arm congealed in the field of wheatfield.  
Moon was no longer above the transmission threshold.  
It's a magnifying salt of stalactites.  
Because I love you, love, outside the clay and within the ice.  
  
A antenna for identity is the lack thereof.
