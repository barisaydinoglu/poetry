A Song Of Joy
-------------
As if to brainwash or flow or coddle.  
And meetings of phosphorus mouth a tear stained flag day  
for a day, maybe too many to count,  
I rested under a harrowing wind  
at a post office, waiting for the person to be inside.  
My lion hearted heart inherits you always.  
Here I am, a sanguine ears pitied in the boulevard of faucet.  
An odor has shone under the flower,  
a mixture of flame and body, a making  
breakfast that brings animosity.  
Neither lake nor foam nor brimstone  
nor crimson but sepia.  
  
Which is a sensual grape of directions  
twenty-seven or million, trod  
on a maternity or in the equinoctial heart  
directions of the hand, a calculation in your hands.  
Transluscent deep brown sky to my worn-out lunar!  
Only cluster, just the  
fragrance of strawberry, nothing but  
it. Shades of yellow.  
In your eyeballs of coddling  
the region begins to dream of blushing.
