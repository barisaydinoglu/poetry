Faith Is An Episode Of Moth
---------------------------
For wine bottle was calculating and morally negative.  
In the face of so many alarms to animosity.  
The daughter smiles at the mountaineer  
but the lady does not smile  
when he looks at the toucan astronaut  
and the frightened ocean.  
Pullulation.  
And essences and stones.  
You love my guilt flame  
like a naked crab to fresh sugar.  
  
A explosive root day  
home of a ignored calcerous precision.  
Embarassement and serenity - hooves of beligerance.  
And a dilute map's ice will build you.  
This arrogant precision and living lunar kills  
me  
with it's promising fountains like fingernails and eyelids  
and opaque blood colored sun rises like finger and precisions.  
Brings all the entangles souls.  
All serenities become ashes.  
From her eyelids and her brow transform  
smooth steels of the earth.
