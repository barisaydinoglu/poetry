The Inevitable Womb
-------------------
The midnight laminated signs you in its mortal ice.  
I'd do it for the grace in which you refresh  
for the laminated signs of silvery you've connected.  
In the putrid ritual, many weak abberations.  
What brainwashes the props of felicity?  
  
Entertain on the bloods that wait for you  
bristling the skeleton chairs, changing  
the doors.  
It mingles like a quiver behind the honeysuckle.  
Not trusting is a form of protecting.  
I salute your aquatic bread  
and envy your comfortable pride.
