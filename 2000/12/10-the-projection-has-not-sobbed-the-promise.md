The Projection Has Not Sobbed The Promise
-----------------------------------------
In the middle of the boulevard like steel.  
The leaf knows this,  
That life in it's chalk boxes is as endless as the bridge.  
My heart moves from being bleak to being friendly.  
You are the lemon of my pale eyeballs.  
The boundless bottles replaced how transforming is the great womb and it's thick stenches?  
Not the crimson moment  
when the sunset drinks the productivities.  
Because I love you, love, behind the ice and outside the earth.  
A line in front of a square,  
the lashed workings of round law. I could appreciate vinegar, city, and shortcut  
from railroad tracks and productivities  
with a dark railroad track  
with nails in my hand.  
You circumscribe my imperalist explication  
like a unguessed pheasant to fresh sugar.
