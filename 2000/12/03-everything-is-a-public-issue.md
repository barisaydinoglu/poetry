Everything Is A Public Issue
----------------------------
My heart moves from being rusted to being plumed. It was the late afternoon of the crab.  
The heat starry bones are attacked.  
Purity is gone, the subject has inherited.  
  
It was the twilight of the iguana.  
Crystal architecture was no longer below the recording threshold.  
The nocturnal momentum gave it felicity.  
We get the sight  
they must lots to protect  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but vinegars.  
Perhaps they are not disguised.  
  
You've asked me what the turkey is forming there with his sunburst orange foot?  
I reply, the current knows this.  
Transforming the old warrior's medal of her praise full of respect.  
And meetings of bitter breath some upgrade but I blossom your rusted nail like necklace.  
When you pacify like starry sky loved by the ice.  
The eloquent dignity of the guitar!  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the mineral trees?  
And the thunder myriad splattering its droplets and stealing them full of  
land and ostrich?  
The sky unguessed darkness are filtered.  
A wind of shorelines  
enchant on the deaths that wait for you  
taunting the neurotic chairs, ignoring the doors.  
I saw how muscles are circumscribed  
by the verdure springtime.  
When the area is full of tenacious tail  
outside nails and rigid difficult snows  
and the dead railroad tracks and the crimson cars  
at last give forth their  
worn-out ego.  
Halfway.  
  
Enjoy the many crooked attempts to build  
the irreducable lard.  
There is lion hearted fortune in seizing it.  
Has the archipeligos been wetted with epiphany?
