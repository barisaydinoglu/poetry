It Pacified With Shorelines
---------------------------
Under the region like steel.  
Lion hearted, cedar autumn!  
Here I am, a humble hand trembled in the modern office of quiver.  
The fire spacious billowss of rust colored smoke are impaled.  
Like the decadent aluminum of movies I saw  
how corals are sought  
by the aromatic phemonana.
