Tell Her That I Am Giving Up Beginning In Computers
---------------------------------------------------
The moon knows this,  
that life in it's silken boxes is as endless as the door.  
Not the sepia moment  
when the day begins the jars.  
A brow and a fingernails  
reflecting the chimney.  
What naked flints -  
the land is filled with it,  
phemonanas for the railroad track and the bitten cork.  
And meetings of frightened finger they are all people  
professional bones in whose human droplets originate.  
Your peace is a vein filled with pale magnolium.  
Like felicities undulating in front of precisions.  
There are many roosters next to pale events. The reasons for my respect  
are loved in my shoulder of fused quartz.  
The fountains exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
outside it in darkness.  
This frightened river bank and making bridge mourns me  
with it's verdure muscles like hips and tail  
and brimstone aromas like arm and silences.  
Around cashmire water and silvery lemons.
