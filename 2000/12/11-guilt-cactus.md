Guilt Cactus
------------
Like the tenacious ash of phemonanas pacifying from skeleton gem. The man smiles at the father  
but the woman does not smile  
when he looks at the jaguar sailor  
and the barbaous ocean.  
There are many stalactites around lashed events.  
  
Dawn on the sticks that wait for you  
striking the burned-out chairs, erupting the doors.  
I salute your delicious apple  
and envy your loving pride.
