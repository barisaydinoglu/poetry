The Beligerance Of The Public Narrative
---------------------------------------
The sun knows this,  
that life in it's fused quartz boxes is as endless as the flag.  
Horse of a plagued rabid bird feather.  
The mists exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
in it in darkness.  
And the river to its sea shell  
and among the tigers the aromatic one  
the person covered with lovely essence.  
The dew knows this,  
that life in it's fused quartz boxes is as endless as the promise.  
Not the cinnamon moment  
when the fortnight loves the smooth stones.  
A bed circumscribing will stand  
the fragmented sky of a planet.  
What curiosities does the crab contain?  
How little we develop and how much it stands the epiphany of this galaxy.
