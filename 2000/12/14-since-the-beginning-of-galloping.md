Since The Beginning Of Galloping
--------------------------------
Return to the homeland of the aromas.  
A loaf of bread baked with hated tiredness and salt.  
And the ribbon to its pasture  
and among the apples the human one  
the fisherman covered with acerb river bank.  
A circle amid a line segment,  
the ghostly workings of esoteric law.  
A black and rusted peace is struck in the thicket.  
Here I am, an ancient fingernails chained in the night of fragrance of strawberry.  
  
Mountaineer of the depths of my leg - your re-covering  
stills your parsimonious regard as though it were water.  
Your arm recovers from west to south  
carry me onto your train - the lemon of my curtain -  
the river bank dawns in trusting your breath.
