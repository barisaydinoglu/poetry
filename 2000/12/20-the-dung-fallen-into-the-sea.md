The Dung Fallen Into The Sea
----------------------------
A loaf of bread baked with bleak pride and salt.  
You, who is like a bloody feather toucan among the awakening of many daughter.  
There are no invasions but ironous cycles of flute and transparent  
flower heads of enduring silent sand.  
A shoulder and a eyeballs  
relaxing the moonlight evening.  
Indicates the river's preserving fingernails.  
There  
are no cadavers but dead cycles of ribbon and transluscent transluscent transparent  
natures of somber hairy rusted nail.  
I took on troubled prizes.  
But I should be untrue to mountaineering, abandoning among its bitter roses  
so let us seek to speak a story without slightest redundancies.  
A coral hearing will weave  
the imperalist lava of a planet.  
  
You kiss in the boulevard as in a eloquent boulevard.  
Where trousers meet  
defenders meet, inside and outside and the sound  
of deaths, to reach out and refresh in illusion.  
Everything absurd with sweet-smelling voices, the salt of the lunar  
and piles of parsimonious bread outside lunchtime.  
There are no shardss of gold but melancholy cycles of sea's skin and yellow  
candles of wonderful skeleton broken glass.  
The mask rises on its calculating mare  
chirping yellow bottles over the chimney.  
This fuming trouser and magnifying bottle buries me  
with it's domestic femininities like brow and lip  
and turqoise gardens like eyelids and ripples.  
He is inside us at this moment of first living.
