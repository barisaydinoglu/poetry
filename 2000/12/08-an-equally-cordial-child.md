An Equally Cordial Child
------------------------
Within the yellow leg of the wind.  
Within the erupting salivas.  
All flowers become ghosts.  
Callous pioneers and cousins.  
For me they are grammatic.  
The error imposes nessecity.  
Draw from it the clenched  
point of view of its own antenna.  
We get the faith  
they must lots to conduct  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but  
blades.  
Perhaps they are not sobbed.
