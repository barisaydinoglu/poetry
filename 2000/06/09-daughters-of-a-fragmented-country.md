Daughters Of A Fragmented Country
---------------------------------
With its inaccessible trust deep brown lightning to my shady pullulation!  
Outside the disintered archipeligos of tenacious time.  
Behind the brutal divisions of brutal garden.  
Trod and then built in the modern office.  
If I could seize the clandenstine and the region.  
To seek another land the electricity self-assured bombs are abandoned.  
Next to green water and cashmire flower heads.  
And you set like a knave and and a tremulous necklace's fire will drink you.  
The balanced atom gave it happiness.  
  
It is a tale of sticky croaks you've asked me what the toucan is building there with his sepia heart?  
I reply, the foliage knows this.
