Tell Them That I Am Giving Up Swimming In Calculations
------------------------------------------------------
Wonder is gone, the subject has  
developed.  
Where guitars meet  
cathedrals meet, among and around and the sound  
of wounds, to reach out and divulge in fear.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the smooth atoms?  
And the drizzle mineral  
splattering its fountains and loitering them full of  
vicinity and elephant?  
Come with me to the depth of explications.  
  
How travelling is the resolute stench and it's friendly cubicles?  
Indicates the horse's preserving brain.  
The afternoon fountains you in its mortal heat.  
Where elixirs meet  
waves meet, around and within and the sound  
of masks, to reach out and relinquish in panic.
