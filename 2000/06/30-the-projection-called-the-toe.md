The Projection Called The Toe
-----------------------------
The saxophone plan that has everyone putrid.  
The order of the green lakes as if to electrify or light or drown.  
Yellow electricity to my fragmented propeller!  
All landscapes become invasions.  
A loaf of bread baked with cold happiness and salt.  
I am dismantled by key and dominion, by shrapnel and wind.  
So the indespensable sincerity lives on in a tomato,  
the plumed house of the phemonana,  
the silent shades of yellow that is plumed and self-assured.
