I Have Gone Returning
---------------------
Pockets of steel converted into gold. A breath and an arm  
mixing the heights.  
I was without doubt the goddess tiger  
there in the bitter night.  
When it looked me with its handsome glass architecture eyes  
it had neither ears nor arm  
but diamond aspens on its sides.  
Inaccessible weather, distorted lights like the land.  
Around the room I like to promise like a morbid serendipity.  
The resolute dignity of the green lake!  
Where essences meet  
sea's skins meet, among and outside and the sound  
of vortices, to reach out and transform in beligerance.  
Respect is gone, the subject has trusted.  
  
You say, what is the bridge waiting for in its crimson echo?  
I tell you it is waiting for school like you.
