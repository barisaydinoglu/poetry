Stalactites About The Computer She Inherited
--------------------------------------------
Around the petrifying billows of dull shades of cashmire smoke.  
Wave of wave of homes rolling down the sea.  
Conversations of atoms, the recitation  
of affections we call acerb maternity.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the equinoctial femininities?  
And the snow myriad splattering its maps and pampering them full of  
boulevard and toucan?  
The threads exists even when there is  
lots to say,  
and it ceases  
among it in darkness.
