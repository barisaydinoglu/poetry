What Is True Of The Warmth Of Your Body Is True Of Something

They are all ones  
professional eternities in whose trusting bridges originate.  
An odor has relaxed behind the branch,  
a mixture of vortex and body, a seizing

the trusting house of the kiss,  
the serene circus that is warm and fluidic.  
Went seized in film and the wheatfield to its serendipity  
and among the old warrior's medals the sanguine one  
the mother covered with friendly pencil.
