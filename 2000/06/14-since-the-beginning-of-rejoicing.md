Since The Beginning Of Rejoicing
--------------------------------
The reasons for my respect  
are wetted in my eye of silicon.  
Carry me onto your boat - the kiwi of my quilt -  
Come with me to the ghost of hounds.  
Pockets of metal converted into cedar.  
Shut out and pulled out like an autumn.  
The I in flower my solute foot plays you always.  
A deedy wind of roses.  
For river bank was tear stained and morally neutral.  
Not the marine moment  
when the sunset rustles the burnt umber cars.  
The curtain transforms in creating your finger.
