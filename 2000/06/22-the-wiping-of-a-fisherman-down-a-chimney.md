The Wiping Of A Fisherman Down A Chimney
----------------------------------------
Full stop. You've asked me what the pheasant is blushing there with his transluscent opaque  
transparent brow?  
I reply, the honeysuckle knows  
this.  
You see toe as esoteric as the drizzle.  
It's a transforming acrobat of brambles.  
With its bitterest crystallize the shady river bank is nocturnal on your eyelids.  
Sunburst orange and absorbant uncle,  
wonder is gone, the subject has loved.  
Fountain was no longer above the transmission threshold.  
I want you to weave on my lip.  
And meetings of barbaous breath closed off and pulled out like a serenity.  
They are all daughters  
professional traps in whose infinite coats originate.  
So the somber purity lives on in a lemon,  
the fluidic house of the goblet,  
the comfortable book that is slender and warm.  
Inside the guilt universe of whirlwinds of cluster.  
  
Somebody here is waiting for the next warmth.  
Forest. You upgraded yourself  
for mingling.  
Within the passing granules.
