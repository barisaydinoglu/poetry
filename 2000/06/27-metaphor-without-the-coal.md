Metaphor Without The Coal
-------------------------
I could chirp legless horse, coffin, and oxide  
from splendors and lunars  
with a blood colored glass architecture  
with legless horses in my eye.  
A poetic thunder of praises.  
Neither eddy nor defender nor blood colored  
nor sand-colored but cashmire.  
Custodian of the depths of my finger - your returning  
stills your soft regard as though it were water.  
Bleak trashes and mourning billows of brimstone smoke.  
The room in hers  
a history we tell in passing,  
with notions of decency  
and a passion for computer science and science  
and you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
expand of praises and starry skies  
and the sensible  
doors of his native land?  
A image carries,  
gnaws - it does not return.  
In the first take, the acerb fisherman  
is foreboded  
by a lady. In the second  
take he returns, to magnify and to store.  
Realized romantic promise the umbrella plan that has everyone demonic.  
  
To seek another land from her leg and her eyelids awaken  
splendors of the earth.  
Amid the transluscent crimson eye of the wind.  
There are no corpses but cheerless cycles of magnolium and burnt umber  
acrobats of moonlit careless aluminum.
