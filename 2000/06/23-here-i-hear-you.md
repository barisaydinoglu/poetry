Here I Hear You
---------------
I drink as if outside a frightened scandalmongering.  
Which is a silent bell of directions  
too few to count or three hundred, shone  
on a sea's skin or in the somber crown  
directions of the eyelids, a calculation in your noses.  
From harrowing wind to uncomfortable turbulence,  
hidden starss  
in the sky drawn by dashing channels, a  
distorted maternity begins to flutter.  
Pure scandalmongering pacifies the maternities transparent stains of panic,  
transparent seams above a rusted path.  
The natural suns mutated we open the halves of a curiosities and the  
loathing of stalactites wets into the humble modern office.  
An odor has played behind the lemon,  
a mixture of violence and body, a rising  
quiver that brings beligerance.  
I salute your sweet-smelling sugar  
and envy your monastic pride.
