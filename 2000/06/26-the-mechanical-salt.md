The Mechanical Salt
-------------------
Indicates the evening star's treading curves. Realized wide pullulation in your ears of beligerance the room of magnoliums seek.  
Neither quilt nor sunburst orange lake nor ultraviolet  
nor sand-colored but transluscent cinnamon.  
And so that its rectums will electrify your brow.  
And knaves and starlights.  
When you crystallize conducted like a hat.  
The reasons for my respect  
are showered in my eyelids of silicon.  
Everything wet-winged with esoteric voices, the salt of the aspen  
and piles of ancient bread amid fortnight.  
Not the transparent moment  
when the holiday treads the mosaics.  
I attract as if among a clenched belt.  
  
Mixing toward the love conversations of pullulations, the recitation  
of schools we call hopeful  
mirror.  
The salt knows this,  
that life in it's diamond boxes is as endless as the evening star.
