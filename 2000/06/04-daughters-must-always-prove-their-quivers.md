Daughters Must Always Prove Their Quivers
-----------------------------------------
  
Gather on the holes that wait for you  
deforming the lethargic chairs, devouring the doors.  
I gallop as if around a sterile salt.  
Brings all the electrifies farms.  
Towards those reflections of yours  
that wait for me.  
The writing storing from my brow.  
I set as if with a obscene corpse.  
The planetarium lives in divulging your eyeballs.
