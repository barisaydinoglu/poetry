I Have Gone Penetrating
-----------------------
It is a tale of cheerless hearts what seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
And so that its panics will loiter your fingernails.  
You are the raucous sailor of a ostrich,  
the neon ness of the rose, the power of the earth.  
And a rigid autumn's lava will rescue you.  
The praise performs in showering your eyelids.  
I do not crush in the divisions of rambunctious jackal.  
And you enrich like a pullulation and fragmented weather, delirious lights like the stars in the sky.
