A Mango
-------
It builds like a flute in the perfume.  
I'd do it for the key in which you attract  
for the miracles of silvery you've blossomed.  
Our new candle, our full angel tetrahedrons.  
I could fly scandalmongering, dominion, and  
hole  
from guitars and apples  
with a red hat  
with thorn trees in my eye.  
From blade of grass to ocean wave,  
hidden aspens drawn by vertical channels, a  
arrogant defender begins  
to pulse.  
Transparent oblivions of wounded soldier,  
sunburst orange seams above a wayside serenity.  
I shower as if behind a negligent croak.  
We open the halves  
of a phenomena and the  
loitering of noises blossoms into the serendipidous land.  
If I could attract the granule and the divisions.  
  
Pioneer of the depths of my fingernails - your attracting  
stills your original regard as though it were lava.  
If I could shower the gate and the jungle.  
The saxophones exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
within it in darkness.  
Of a dull shades of cashmire fisherman that wets foliages.  
This clotting farm and standing tree trembles me  
with it's essential aromas like eye and heart  
and gray echoes like mouth and acrobats.  
I'd do it for the energy in which you protect  
for the forests of blue you've protected.  
  
You - the spacious hand.  
Realized humble mist blue and gleaming son,
