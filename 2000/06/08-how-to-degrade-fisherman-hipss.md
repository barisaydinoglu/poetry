How To Degrade Fisherman Hipss
------------------------------
Nothing but that aroma of fragrances of strawberry.  
In front of transparent water and sunburst orange roots.  
In the bristling consequences.  
Multitude of hats!  
In and out of the opaque yellow the green and the transluscent cinnamon  
Outside the land like salt.  
And so that its bones will smother your lip.  
A rain of lakes we open the halves of a secrets and the  
dismantling of torrents trusts into the real jungle.  
I took on clenched starss in the sky.  
You understand in the region as in a warm boulevard.  
An odor has  
reconciled among the tryst,  
a mixture of havoc and body, a travelling  
love that brings confusion.  
The I in tiger like the clotting clay of rituals the order of the promises in the face of so many clocks to functionality.  
Once there was a silent mother who  
began at parties, sitting in a circle,  
among warmths.  
  
The bride smiles at the astronaut  
but the mother does not smile  
when he looks at the cat child  
and the insufferable ocean.  
Not the cinnamon moment  
when the fortnight understands the movies.
