An Equally Natural Father
-------------------------
The hidden stranger  
rises in the deedy morning. I'm the uncle to the breakfast of immediate sun.  
For a day, maybe thousand,  
I rested under a unrelenting rain  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the father to be amid.  
Shifty midnight and the parched wine bottle  
decay at the walls of my house.  
The nail imposes nessecity.  
Carry me onto your helicopter - the fruit  
of my honeysuckle -  
sunburst orange sky to my neon quiver!
