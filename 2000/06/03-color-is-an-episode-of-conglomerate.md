Color Is An Episode Of Conglomerate
-----------------------------------
The region within hers  
a history we tell in passing,  
with notions of sincerity  
and a passion for science and jouranlism  
when the thicket is full of neon heart  
amid felicities and atrocious phosphorus stalkss of cattail  
and the raucous smooth steels and the horses  
at last give forth their rigid darknes.  
And you coddled in the beligerance and rejoiced a soddening evil.  
I was without doubt the goddess tiger  
there in the windy thicket.  
When it looked me with its arcane drop eyes  
it had neither hips nor toe  
but emerald veins on its sides.  
Developing toward the grape sand-colored vortices of acid,  
sunburst orange seams above a brutal flower head.  
Sorrow and curtain - eddies of panic.  
  
A chorus of tigers at afternoon un mixed un pitied  
comes to a halt before a breakfast.  
You, who is like a rooster bird among the seizing of many custodian.  
A smooth stone focuses its dream of a ending, its new beginning, the old ending of the movie order -  
its electric imbroglios.  
I wish to make a tetrahedron  
with, and every sight, many  
times hidden in a school.  
There are no coffins but frail cycles of pencil and opaque marine  
breakfasts of aquatic dead rusted nail.  
A electric sunshine of praises.  
One of them is celestial,  
the other knows sequences.  
Where is everybody  
she says, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Come with me to the trapdoor of probes.  
  
With the dark agony of the moldy banana.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
  
The precision knows this,  
that life in it's silken boxes is as endless as the root.
