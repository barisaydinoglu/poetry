Every Man Is A Metaphor
-----------------------
Around the vicinity I like to blossom like a clotting affection.  
My great eyelids travels you always.  
They are all gods  
professional jackals in whose lion hearted laws originate.  
It's a enchanting vein of lightnings.  
Exiled vaginas and rotten jugulars.  
You are the banana of my fatherless eye.  
I saw how lights are crystallized  
by the wide necklace.  
And meetings of morose heart I  
took on blood-stained necklaces.  
Outside the dull shades of yellow agony of the puberty.  
I tread as if next to a bitten polyp.  
To travel lost stalkss of cattail and for smooth stones.  
A sun of serenities and you seek like a kiss and in the face of so many lineages to animosity.  
The pencil fashioning from my eyelids.  
Stored and then developed in the heights.  
Went recovered in  
window silence me and let my substance shine.  
  
The fluidic mountaineer  
loves in the noble morning.  
This dead sunburst orange lake and gathering silence strikes me  
with it's decisive guitars like arm and lip  
and ultraviolet books like heart and mosaics.  
  
Once there was a silent father who  
rescued at parties, sitting in a quadrangle, among bottles.  
A mouth and a brow  
travelling the area.
