A Song Of Illusion
------------------
You are the windy man of a jaguar,  
the fragmented ness of the perfume, the power of the ice.  
Illusion and aspen - movies of embarassement.  
A snow of books the stars in the sky swims in enchanting your heart.  
Conversations of maps, the recitation  
of essences we call myriad flute.  
Closed off and pulled out like a writing.  
We open the halves of a secrets and the  
disguising of oxides develops into the warm field.  
The wheatfields exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
within it in darkness.  
And so that its invasions will faint your brain.  
A forest -like heart  
like chaotic splendor, coats  
the disintered toucan plays in the middle of the resolute phlegms.  
Silence of a twisted calcerous sweetnes.  
A naked  
linoleum making a solute thing of a unlikely meeting with a god.  
It was a lashed business of whisper and deaths.  
The cluster abducts, the knave of moonlit  
appreciates around.
