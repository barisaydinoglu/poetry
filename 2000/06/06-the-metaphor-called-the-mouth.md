The Metaphor Called The Mouth
-----------------------------
A current of fleeting smooth broken glass  
that does not know why it flows and appreciates.  
The disintered aroma that carries in your splendor.  
Growing the time of her energy full of tiredness.  
As soon as the incoming mirrors  
gives the grammatic indication.  
Purity is gone, the subject has enriched.  
The I in heart around the chimney I like to mingle like a dry flag.  
Your well is a lighthouse filled with windy nature.
