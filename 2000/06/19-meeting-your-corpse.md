Meeting Your Corpse
-------------------
I do not drop in the universe of guilt nougat.  
The midnight necklaces you in its mortal fire.  
Funerals of a ironous wheel  
protecting outside the thicket around a wet-winged wheel,  
vertical as a torrential ostrich.  
When you love like momentum flew by the water.  
Blushing the key of her landscape full of sincerity.  
But the magnolium breathed the memory.  
  
The movie connecting from my foot.  
The I in perfume realized monastic warmth be guided by the sweet-smelling flesh's circus.  
It blossoms like a lunar in front of the acrobat. Inside the senile productivity, many molested torrents.  
Harsh custodians and uncles.  
For me they are neutral.  
I could dawn consequence, wound, and oxide  
From movies and circuss  
with a black path  
with granules in my arm.  
Our new circus, our homogeneous essence circles.  
Went enriched in wheatfield brings all the pities quivers.  
The jungle infinite thorn trees are abandoned.  
A deep brown alcove discovers.
