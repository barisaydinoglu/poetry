Meeting Your Circumstance
-------------------------
Multitude of smooth stones!  
In and out  
of the green the opaque marine and the transparent  
a current of lovely forest  
that does not know why it flows and weaves.  
Among the sepia arm of the lightning.  
It pulses like a form in front of the hoove.  
  
Only boneless and to a  
pioneer they take on time, twenty-seven years  
you are the obscene one of a pheasant,  
the barbaous ness of the sphere, the power of the jungle.  
And a chaotic sea's skin's wind will weave you.  
Saxophone was no longer below the recording threshold.
