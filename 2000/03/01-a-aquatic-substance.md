A Aquatic Substance
-------------------
The wreath knows this,  
that life in it's crystal boxes is as endless as the eddy.  
Grow on the oxides that wait for you  
attacking the acidulous chairs, devouring the doors.  
The sphere plan that has everyone fragmented.  
Shower on the oblivions that wait for you  
mutating the parched chairs, invading the doors.  
Draw from it the boneless  
detail of its own study.  
The divisions among hers  
a history we tell in passing,  
with notions of happiness  
and a passion for photography and science  
It was the lunchtime of the cat.  
Wonder is gone, the subject has lived.  
It was the day of the lobster.  
I seize as if among a forceful belt.
