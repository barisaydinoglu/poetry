Breeding Dashing Affection
--------------------------
What we say plays to  
stand some other aunt  
what a machine may teach. Of mineral bread, spirit  
of the veins,  
mourned daughter blood, your kisses  
carry into exile  
and a droplet of cork, with remnants of the boulevard.  
In the face of so many abberations to functionality.  
In your tail of embarassement the vicinity of farms appreciate.  
So the comfortable happiness lives on in a tomato,  
the sanguine house of the moon,  
the silent warmth that is dashing and aromatic.
