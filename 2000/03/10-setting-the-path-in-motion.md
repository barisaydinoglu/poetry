Setting The Path In Motion
--------------------------
Not drinking is a form of refreshing.  
It was a lethargic business of bramble and cummerbunds.  
Return to the homeland of the times.  
Burnt umber shrapnels of dagger,  
transparent seams above a lewd garden.  
As soon as the incoming ribbons  
gives the algorithmic indication.  
Multitude of rivers!  
In and out of the green the blue and the marine  
of a rust colored gentleman that returns mists.  
As if to coagulate or connect or bristle.  
  
Draw from it the listless  
camera of its own antenna.  
They are all pioneers  
professional flasks in whose eager phemonanas originate.  
My thick heart pulses you always.
