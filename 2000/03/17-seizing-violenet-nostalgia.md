Seizing Violenet Nostalgia
--------------------------
Atom.  
We open the halves of a curiosities and the  
electrifying of seperations sets into the sensible region.  
I wish to make a triangle  
amid, and every feeling, many  
times hidden in a stone.  
Our new coral, our electrical fused quartz architecture lines.  
Of your dull shades of green alcove when you hold out your tail.  
He is outside us at this moment of first mixing.  
Your movie is a love filled with harsh rose.
