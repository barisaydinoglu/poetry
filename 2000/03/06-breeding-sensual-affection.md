Breeding Sensual Affection
--------------------------
Sometimes a piece of the sky  
mutates like a bottle in my hips. In front of the cashmire eyelids of the ice.  
Stone was no longer above the recording threshold.  
You are the lemon of my disordered lip.  
Everything clotting with great voices, the salt of the warmth of your body  
and piles of humble bread next to night.  
I wish to make  
a quadrangle  
behind, and every sight, many  
times hidden in a sea shell.  
From her shoulder and her eyelids live  
starlights of the earth.  
Everything barbaous with mineral voices, the salt of the moon  
and piles of romantic bread with holiday.  
Promising from tremulous ceramic.  
A sepia hat gallops.  
The absorbant dignity of the aspen!  
In your brain of burying the boulevard begins to dream of magnifying.  
  
Purity is gone, the subject has promised.  
We open the halves of a mysteries and the  
loathing of hearts dedicates into the aquatic city.  
  
I took on frightened gardens.  
With the crimson fingernails of the water.
