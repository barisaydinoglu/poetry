A Song Of Embarassement
-----------------------
Full stop.  
And stones and films.  
Conversations of wine bottles, the recitation  
of pencils we call naked starry sky.  
Within sunburst orange water and burnt umber evening  
stars.  
Anger and pullulation - atoms of beligerance.  
It is a tale of clenched bombs the stranger smiles at the son  
but the woman does not smile  
when he looks at the iguana pioneer  
and the fire-tipped ocean.  
  
If you were not the grape the naked moon  
cooks, sprinkling its nectarine across the universe.  
Fewer and fewer  
replace about another mode of purity.  
The I in coat when you live like shoreline pulsed by the electricity.  
Of a blood colored  
fisherman that pacifies echoes.  
The productivity inherits in rejoicing your arm.  
Sometimes a piece of the wind  
abandons like a bridge in my brow.  
  
You are the lemon of my difficult heart.
