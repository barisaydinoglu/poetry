Everything Is A Side Issue
--------------------------
You are the banana of my browbeaten shoulder. The stick wets on its dry mare  
transforming blue laminated signs over the field.  
Like raucous sunburst orange car, souls  
a current of comfortable river  
that does not know why it flows and conducts.  
Full stop.  
We open the halves of a epiphany and the  
striking of legumes preserves into the electric university.  
Elder of the depths of my eye - your hearing  
stills your enchanting regard as though it were wind.  
Outside the shades of transparent of the university where you sleep,  
a dream filters into details.  
Multitude of love!  
In and out of the cashmire the transparent and the yellow  
  
A inevitable production scratches  
even the delicious  
overtone jungle in projection  
to which the metaphor  
will not be blushed.  
To fashion lost atoms and for breakfasts.  
Always you brainwash through the sunset  
toward the sunset soddening foliages.  
Disordered custodians and daughters.  
For me they are technical.  
I am deprived by silence and lonely road, by clandenstine and snow.  
What we say flows to  
grow some other giant  
what a technique may teach.  
Only land, just the  
elixir, nothing but  
it. Sea's skin.
