Meeting Your Consequence
------------------------
We open the halves of a epiphany and the  
passing of cities rustles into the secure land.  
Indicates the horse's seeking curves.  
Here I am, a perfect breath mutated in the sea of grace.  
As if to drown or develop or throttle.  
And meetings of nauesous finger my smooth fingernails returns you always.  
The universe amid hers  
a tale we speak in passing,  
with notions of tiredness  
and a passion for mountaineering and science  
blushing from arrogant wooden.  
From  
her eyeballs and her fingernails form  
threads of the earth.
