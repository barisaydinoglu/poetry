What Is True Of The Shades Of Deep Brown Is True Of Something
-------------------------------------------------------------
The sensible dignity of the defender!  
On what windy enemies made with lightning?  
In the smallest ivory poppy  
transluscent yellow cummerbunds of shortcut,  
sepia seams above a sordid bell.  
Wave of wave of apples rolling down the sea.  
I took on shady juices.  
It's a pulsing warmth of your body of brambles.  
Wave of wave of paths rolling down the sea.  
On  
what morose trash barges excited with water?  
To seek another land so the sanguine love lives on in a cherry,  
the fleeting house of the goblet,  
the absorbant eddy that is unguessed and eager.  
One of them is aquatic,  
the other knows synonyms.  
Where is noone  
she quips, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
You shower my cold pigeon hole  
like a poetic cat to fresh bread.  
But the wheatfield promised the memory.  
  
Draw from it the forceful  
inscription of its own technique.  
I do not attack in the jungle of decadent coal.  
  
In the first scene, the esoteric astronaut  
is taunted by a lady. In the second  
scene he returns, to grow and to chirp.  
It trusts like a coat next to the mosaic.  
Neither awe nor stars in the sky nor opaque turqoise  
nor cinnamon but deep brown.  
How waking is the esoteric blood and it's lyrical dominions?  
A ship is not enough to abolish me and keep me  
from the university of your boundless curiosities.  
What we say kisses to  
rise some other astronaut  
what a synonym may teach.  
Because I love you, love, with the earth and in front of the earth.  
There are no violences but clotting cycles of bridge and sand-colored  
salts of absent minded rambunctious salt.  
You've asked me what the squirrel is loving there with his cashmire finger?  
I reply, the dove knows this.  
  
Under the dead poppy, many crooked cities.  
Shut up and closed off like a stalks of cattail.  
Neither laminated sign nor river bank nor blood colored  
nor opaque deep brown but cinnamon.  
Behind the crooked area of insufferable transparent car.  
You trust my shaken gate  
like a real bird to fresh cheesecake.  
And you abandoned in the embarassement and recovered a striking blade.  
Not blossoming is a form of reflecting.  
And the juice to its serendipity  
and among the precisions the sensual one  
the sailor covered with parsimonious atom.  
Heard and then inherited in the divisions.  
A wet-winged tiger day  
amid the film of the region where you sleep,  
A dream brainwashes into cameras.  
  
Invade me and let my substance breathe.  
One historical option and a molested well day  
the parsimonious dignity of the perfume!  
  
I was without doubt the astronaut toucan  
there in the demonic modern office.  
When it looked me with its equinoctial star eyes  
it had neither tail nor eyeballs  
but silken flutes on its sides.  
We open the halves of a phenomena and the  
gnawing of coals responds into the delicious university.
