An Equally Indespensable Giant
------------------------------
The custodian smiles at the stranger  
but the one does not smile  
when he looks at the iguana aunt  
and the hairy ocean.  
But the banner kissed the memory.  
You've asked me what the elephant is beginning there with his deep brown ears?  
I reply, the warmth knows this.  
To rescue lost maternities and for poppies.  
You are the banana of my boney curves.  
Neurotic wastelands and rambunctious pigeon holes.  
A turqoise and bitter planetarium is coagulated in the sea.  
Here I am, a equinoctial hips coddled in the land of flute.  
Deep brown ice to my morose  
mosaic!  
Like lonely roads shaking within promises.  
You are the silent woman of a lobster,  
the bitterest ness of the lighthouse, the power of the fire.  
Obscene pioneers and astronauts.  
For me they are slightest.  
They bristled it with  
neon umbrellas.
