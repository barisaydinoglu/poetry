How To Crush Giant Hands
------------------------
It's a expanding sun of nails.  
A noble fog of shadess of green.  
Draw from it the absurd  
inscription of its own camera.  
And so that its self-productions will loathe your eyelids.  
Like the mourning steel of threads outside the blood colored anger of the depth.  
Preserved and then promised in the archipeligos.  
Wheatfield was no longer right at the transmission threshold.  
Went built in productivity an absorbant wood paneling making an arcane thing of a unlikely meeting with a god.  
I salute your enduring peach  
and envy your fresh pride.  
  
And you attacked in the beligerance and made a wiping lard.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
We  
get the faith  
they must lots to protect  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but oblivions.  
Perhaps they are not impaled.  
Nothing but that faucet of utensils.
