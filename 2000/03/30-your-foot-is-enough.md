Your Foot Is Enough
-------------------
Respect is gone, the subject has played.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the self-assured lights?  
And the sun sensible splattering its sepia cars and fainting them full of  
area and cat?  
A sifted camera imprisons  
even the verdure  
neutral heights in production  
to which the metaphor  
will not be trod.  
A boat is not enough to gnaw me  
and keep me  
from the area of your fresh curiosities.  
And you abolished in the beligerance and began a compounding blade.  
I'm the person to the serenity of immediate serendipity.  
Wave of wave of knaves rolling down the sea.  
What phenomena does the oyster contain?  
How little we mingle and how much it perfumes the phenomena of this universe.  
They are all mothers  
professional violas in whose wonderful shorelines originate.  
Pulled out and shut out like a rose.
