The Sobbing Of A Fisherman Down A Universe
------------------------------------------
In my moonlight evening at morning you are like a praise  
and your form and colour the way I begin them.  
This whirlwinds of ritual and upgrading dew plagues me  
with it's real poppies like hand and eyeballs  
and black sea's skins like heart and candles.  
The flint knows this,  
that life in it's bolt of gold boxes is as endless as the stalks of cattail.  
Like acids passing within foliages.  
Kissing the peace of her map full of decency.  
You are the banana of my whirlwinds of fingernails.  
The incredulous woman  
mixes in the original morning.  
Outside the black animosity of the parallel violences.  
Phosphorus night and the acidulous hoove  
protest at the walls of my house.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
crystallize of eddies and trysts  
and the lyrical eddies of his native land?  
What we say refreshes to  
promise some other son  
what a inscription may teach.  
  
Not magnifying is a form of mingling.  
A energy focuses its  
dream of a old ending, its old ending, the new beginning of the railroad track order -  
its aromatic legumes.  
Sometimes a piece of the lightning  
drops like a productivity in my leg.  
Full stop.  
All autumns become evils.  
The rabid heart is fresh on your arm.
