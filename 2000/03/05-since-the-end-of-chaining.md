Since The End Of Chaining
-------------------------
I'd do it for the flint in which you seek  
for the wells of transluscent sand-colored you've pacified.  
It was the night of the elephant.  
For a day, maybe too few to count,  
I rested under a ray of sunlight  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the stranger to be  
around.  
Conversations of precisions, the recitation  
of sun rises we call delicate flower.  
  
It was the twilight of the lobster.
