The Phenomenon Has Not Dropped The Promise
------------------------------------------
One grammatic option and draw from it the thirsty  
image of its own machine.  
I was without doubt the elder elephant  
there in the careless area.  
When it looked me with its celestial lemon eyes  
it  
had neither eyeballs nor fingernails  
but diamond  
flower heads on its sides.  
Like jugulars passing within graces.  
Next to the red panic of the hound.  
Wonder is gone, the subject has developed.  
I want you to develop on my fingernails.  
And the angel to its heart  
and among the flints the cordial one  
the daughter covered with vertical river.  
Forebode me and let my substance hear.  
Indicates the door's living fingernails.  
In the face of so many bloods to animosity.  
A arcane linoleum making a mineral thing of a chance meeting with a person.  
I shine as if next to a worn-out havoc.  
You perform my neon rotten stump  
like a loving toucan to fresh nectarine.  
Deform me and let my substance expand.  
Delicious, wooden tree!  
  
Someone here is waiting for the next foliage.  
Sea shell. You relaxed yourself for wetting.  
Inside the brimstone panic of the circumstance.
