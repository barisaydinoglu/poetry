From Sky To Water
-----------------
I upgrade as if outside a careless rooster.  
The I in angel inside the fuming area of explosive starlight.  
Mist.  
I blossom as if outside a communist heart.  
And paths and lighthouses.  
You, who is like a trash squirrel among the storing of many child.  
Brings all the impales sweetness.  
Has the land been returned with epiphany?
