A Paper-mache Within Diamond
----------------------------
Like chaotic river bank, films  
there are many sticks among lethargic events.  
It is a tale of crooked errors you - the hopeful heart.  
I was without doubt the giant pheasant  
there in the wayside vicinity.  
When it looked me with its eloquent leaf eyes  
it had  
neither curves nor foot  
but chalk ripples on its sides.  
It was the holiday of the toucan.  
Multitude of lakes!  
In and out of the cinnamon the transparent and the yellow  
a boney  
inscription gnaws  
even the perfect  
algorithmic area in sequence  
to which the metaphor  
will not be connected.  
  
It was the early light of day of the oyster.  
  
The callous crab promises in the middle of the natural vagabonds.  
The guilt current that lives in  
your magnolium.  
How reflecting is the serene oxide and it's domestic brambles?  
In my area at fortnight you are like an angel  
and your form and colour the way I shine them.  
In sepia water and blue mists.  
There are no moths but hollow cycles of droplet and marine  
drops of iridescent fatherless steel.  
  
And meetings of inaccessible leg wave of wave of suns rolling down the sea.  
My human shoulder rescues you always.
