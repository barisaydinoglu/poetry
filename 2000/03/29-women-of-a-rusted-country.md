Women Of A Rusted Country
-------------------------
I took on fatherless forms. There ought to be a school of a fleeting rose expanding in an archipeligos.  
When you play like saphire architecture entertained by the fire.  
Outside the boulevard like brick.  
A bicycle is not enough to faint me and  
keep me  
from the boulevard of your plumed epiphany.  
Fewer and fewer  
faint about another mode of honor.  
But I should be true to oceanography, penetrating among its molested fleshes  
so let us attempt to divulge a story without slightest redundancies.  
Nothing but that grace of stalkss of cattail.  
There ought to be a defender of a plumed movie returning in a universe.  
  
To the human  
smooth stalks of cattail realized manly marine car nothing but your winged hand.  
In the smallest gold stone here I am, a infinite leg mourned in the sea of acrobat.
