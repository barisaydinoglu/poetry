Since The Beginning Of Promising
--------------------------------
Towards those utensils of yours that wait for me.  
There are many complaints within silent events.  
Nauesous weather, boney lights like the well.  
Has the archipeligos been imbued with epiphany?  
It was a calculating  
business of dagger and clefts.  
And amid my hammock, during the sunrise, I woke up naked  
and full of purity.  
  
I stayed blushed and opaque cashmire  
in the middle of the universe.
