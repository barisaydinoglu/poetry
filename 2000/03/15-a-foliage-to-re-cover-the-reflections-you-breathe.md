A Foliage To Re-cover The Reflections You Breathe
-------------------------------------------------
She is behind us at this moment of first mixing.  
It blushes like a wine bottle inside the acrobat.  
Waking a mosaic  
appreciated in the resplendent drizzle. And you perch like a leaf and towards those productivities of yours that wait for me.  
My unguessed eye wakes you always.  
It  
trusts like a sweetnes inside the guitar.  
Like brambles devouring with lighthouses.
