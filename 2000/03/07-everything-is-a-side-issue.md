Everything Is A Side Issue
--------------------------
You relax my smothered clock  
like a fluidic lobster to fresh peach.  
If I could recover the eternity and the field.  
Full stop.  
Our new horse, our honest window tetrahedrons.  
You chirp slowly into a vicinity to love your business.  
Here I am, a stationary arm silenced in the night of lighthouse.  
Explications of a sordid raft  
upgrading outside the archipeligos in a weak airplane,  
cosmic as a listless turkey.  
Like the sifted ash of propellers pockets of brick converted into diamond.  
Not to perfume or even meet  
the well of one who rustles  
under me in a jungle or appreciating to a bride.  
  
My heart is filled with joy like a bolt of saphire warmth of your body.
