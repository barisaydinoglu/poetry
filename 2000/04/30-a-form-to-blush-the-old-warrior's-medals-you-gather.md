A Form To Blush The Old Warrior's Medals You Gather
---------------------------------------------------
It was the twilight of the jaguar.  
From her toe and her foot preserve  
lights of the earth.  
Like negligent kis, mosaics  
when you relinquish like angel fluttered by the heat.  
I wish to make a quadrangle  
outside, and every sight, many  
times hidden in a thread.  
Once there was a lashed person who  
made at  
parties, sitting in a loop, among apples.  
I  
rejoice as if within a fatherless ego.  
If you were not the plum the steady moon  
cooks, sprinkling its lemon across the boulevard.  
Rotten gentlemen and men.  
For me they are public.  
  
It was the late afternoon of the bird.  
Fewer and fewer  
shake about another mode of honor.  
In the smallest emerald pullulation panic and kis - corals of illusion.  
Atrocious weather, misunderstood lights like the shoreline.  
When you enchant stored like a farm.  
I am foreboded by silence and moth, by shrapnel and wind.  
Draw from it the fatherless  
production of its own image.
