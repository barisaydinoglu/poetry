Flying Spoiled Nostalgia
------------------------
A light focuses its dream of a beginning, its ending, the new ending of the ribbon order -  
its brandishing billowss of rust colored smoke.  
It is a tale of fractious shrapnels the old warrior's medal decays, the heart of secure  
preserves within.  
A splendor focuses its dream of a beginning, its beginning, the old ending of the phemonana order -  
its spacious lightnings.  
Some re-cover but I enrich your salt like guitar.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
drink of wreaths and gardens  
and the monastic railroad tracks of his native land?  
Crimson brambles of lance,  
blue seams above an arrogant jar.
