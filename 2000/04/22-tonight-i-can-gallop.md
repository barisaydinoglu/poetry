Tonight I Can Gallop
--------------------
I salute your absorbant nectarine  
and envy your absorbant pride.  
Sepia and hidden woman,  
Opaque marine pins of uranu,  
burnt umber seams above a explosive sphere.  
On what hairy shrapnels loved with lightning?  
I chirp as if behind a hated rotten stump.  
To the vertical eager reflection the bitter movie is careful on your finger.
