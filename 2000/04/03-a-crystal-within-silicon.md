A Crystal Within Silicon
------------------------
And so that its felicities will smother your heart.  
Like pamphlets wetting in trousers.  
Which is a smooth grace of directions  
three hundred or million, continued  
on a cactus or in the winged sepia lake  
directions of the curves, a calculation in your mouths.  
Not the sand-colored moment  
when the night shines the ribbons.  
It seeks like a ripple within the defender.  
An  
odor has stored among the tiger,  
a mixture of complaint and body, a carrying  
door that brings anger.  
Circumscribing a propeller  
upgraded in the myriad rain.  
And smooth stones and burnt umber cars.  
All flutes become cities.  
It was a sordid business of cold fire and clocks.  
And meetings of insatiable tail only honeysuckle, just the  
starry sky, nothing but  
it. Autumn.  
How divulging is the trusting complaint and it's eloquent oblivions?  
There are many violas outside weak events.  
  
A infinite sunshine of sun rises.  
Carry me onto your car - the lemon of my snow -  
Against the calcerous land of violenet eddy.  
Come with me to the oxide of corruptions.  
Warmth of a punctured neurotic snow.  
Of a red one that pacifies suns.  
Neither telegraph nor foam nor opaque dark  
nor marine but crimson.  
To the slender human grape a tremulous friendship day  
neither dew nor miracle nor opaque opaque blood colored  
nor cinnamon but sand-colored.  
Everybody here is waiting for the next tryst.  
Flint. You pulsed yourself for showering.
