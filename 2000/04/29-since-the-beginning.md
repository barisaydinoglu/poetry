Since The Beginning
-------------------
Next to the transluscent green heart of the sky.  
In the degrading massacres.  
Because I love you, love, amid the mud and among the lightning.  
What forces the props of love?  
Outside the yellow finger of the electricity.  
From harrowing wind to blade of grass,  
hidden momenta drawn by scrupulous  
channels, a  
clotting form begins to flow.  
As soon as the incoming farms  
gives the minor indication.  
As if to forebode or travel or ignore.  
  
My heart is filled with purity like a ceramic flower head.  
The I in key it was the midnight of the pheasant.  
The warm promise gave it wonder.  
When the night is full of smothered shoulder  
around nougats and obscene neon natures  
and the absurd laminated signs and the banners  
at last give forth their barbaous shards of gem.  
  
It was the afternoon of the jaguar.
