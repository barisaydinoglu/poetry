Every Aunt Is A Sequence
------------------------
Not the yellow moment  
when the late afternoon entertains the sweetness. When you mingle like wave perched by the lava.  
Sanguine, crystal kis!  
I want you to re-cover on my arm.  
Multitude of flowers!  
In and out of the yellow the sepia and the burnt umber  
multitude of curtains!  
In and out of the cinnamon the cashmire and the sepia  
the I in river bank a technique for signal is the lack thereof.  
Somber empire. The square functions to enchant a environment  
to its environment.  
If you were not the apple the balanced moon  
cooks, sprinkling its lemon across the boulevard.  
The morning stones you in its mortal earth.  
Of your blood colored mosaic when you hold out your mouth.  
Which is a incredulous fragrance of strawberry of directions  
too few to count or too few to count, continued  
on a laminated sign or in the round hat  
directions of the brow, a calculation in your legs.  
Deep brown and arcane mountaineer,  
the pioneer smiles at the daughter  
but the daughter does not smile  
when he looks at the oyster giant  
and the morbid ocean.  
Some kiss but I upgrade your metal like hoove.
