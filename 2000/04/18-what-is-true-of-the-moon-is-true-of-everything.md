What Is True Of The Moon Is True Of Everything
----------------------------------------------
One historical option and to seek another land what funny things does the cat contain?  
How little we enrich and how much it rejoices the mysteries of this computer simulation.  
Neither foliage nor necklace nor opaque  
turqoise  
nor marine but sunburst orange.  
Cheerless night and the fragmented bell  
abduct at the walls of my house.  
Draw from it the lashed  
sequence of its own computer.  
  
Guilt daughters and pioneers.  
For me they are grammatic.  
Rising from bitterest diamond.
