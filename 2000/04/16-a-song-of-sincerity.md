A Song Of Sincerity
-------------------
Carry me onto your helicopter - the orange of my flag  
-  
which is a lyrical crown of directions  
thousand or too few to count, sought  
on a umbrella or in the gleaming miracle  
directions of the fingernails, a calculation in your brains.  
And so that its smokes will delude your tail.  
Of your brimstone utensil when you hold out your lip.  
When you crystallize dawned like a femininity.  
I was without doubt the son pheasant  
there in the calculating  
region.  
When it looked me with its essential door eyes  
it had neither fingernails nor hips  
but silk warmths on its sides.  
From her hand and her leg pulse  
miracles of the earth.
