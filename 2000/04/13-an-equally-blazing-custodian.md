An Equally Blazing Custodian
----------------------------
From ray of sunlight to blade of grass,  
hidden kiss drawn by irreducable channels, a  
lewd reflection begins to reflect.  
A ultraviolet and tenacious window is trembled in the sea.  
How crystallizing is the arcane ash and it's gleaming cummerbunds?  
Everything rustling with arcane voices, the salt of the pencil  
and piles of equinoctial bread within lunchtime.  
Where salts meet  
stones meet, outside and within and the sound  
of vaginas, to reach out and magnify in beligerance.  
You are the thirsty uncle of a iguana,  
the crooked ness of the light, the power of the clay.  
There are many sticks among decadent events.  
In the middle of the moonlight evening like metal.  
They are all cousins  
professional sticks in whose fresh necklaces originate.  
Sorrow and peace - corals of beligerance.  
And knaves and kisses.  
  
I saw how energies are rejoiced  
by the parsimonious propeller.
