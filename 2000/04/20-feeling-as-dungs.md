Feeling As Dungs
----------------
It was the afternoon of the bird.  
For a day, maybe too few to count,  
I rested under a ray of sunlight  
at a bus stop, waiting for the fisherman to be behind.  
Around the sea I like to hear like a disordered dove.  
  
It was the midnight of the jaguar.
