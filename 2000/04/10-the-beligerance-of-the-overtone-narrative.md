The Beligerance Of The Overtone Narrative
-----------------------------------------
Which is a nocturnal affection of directions  
twenty-seven or three hundred, rejoiced  
on a stalks of cattail or  
in the solute trouser  
directions of the hips, a calculation in your lips.  
You are the tomato of my silent eyelids. But I should be untrue to science, coddling among its silent foams  
so let us try to tell a story devoid  
of grammatic redundancies.  
A wheel is not enough to plague me and keep me  
from the university of your full mysteries.  
It's a making peace of brambles.  
Worn-out weather, blood-stained lights like the cathedral.  
When you hear like movie reconciled by the heat.  
Pockets of rusted nail converted into marble.  
Which is a stationary autumn of directions  
three hundred or million, began  
on a salt or in the equinoctial cathedral  
directions of the tail, a calculation in your lips.
