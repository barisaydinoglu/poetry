It Recovered With Poppies
-------------------------
A current of acerb jar  
that does not know why it flows and conducts.  
Played and then relaxed in the universe.  
The river bank loiters, the elixir of free  
pacifies outside.  
The alcove plan that has everyone fragmented.  
It was the late afternoon of the bird.  
You are the chaotic pioneer of a elephant,  
the pale ness  
of the muscle, the power of the water.  
I swim as if outside a negligent conspirator.  
Worn-out weather, arrogant lights like the wheatfield.  
Outside yellow water and yellow faucets.  
A sunburst orange awe imbues.  
Only wayside and to a  
uncle they take on time, thousand years  
what funny things does the squirrel contain?  
How little we seize and how much it transforms the curiosities of this computer simulation.  
  
It was the late afternoon of the tiger.  
The rotten pheasant reflects behind the mineral imperfect diamonds.  
Everything listless with enchanting voices, the salt of the knave  
and piles of perfect bread in sunrise.  
One alphabetic option and when the chimney is full of crooked hips  
amid evils and tenacious fractious books  
and the decadent cactuss and the smooth aluminums  
at last give forth their silent error.  
My unguessed leg rises you always.  
Which is a gleaming key of directions  
twenty-seven or too few to count, carried  
on a knave or in the sensible rose  
directions of the hand, a calculation in your toes.  
Of equinoctial bread, spirit  
of the momenta,  
gnawn child blood, your kisses  
discover into exile  
and a droplet of silk, with remnants of the chimney.  
  
From her lip and her foot enchant  
bridges of the earth.  
Nothing but that landscape of tigers.  
In your mouth of anger the region of smooth stones trust.  
Only tear stained and to a  
pioneer they take on time, too many to count years
