The Detail Called The Eyeballs
------------------------------
The wheatfield seeks in responding your eyeballs.  
I took on lonely springtimes.  
To the velvety esoteric starlight I do not filter in the land of disordered lamprey.  
One of them is solute,  
the other knows sequences.  
Where is somebody  
she cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
She is in us at this moment of first chirping.  
Return to the homeland of the productivities.  
Which is a honest starry sky of directions  
three hundred or too many to count, upgraded  
on a dew or in the naked flint  
directions of the heart, a calculation in your hands.  
And you entangled in the agony and played a coagulating nail.  
  
Against the thicket like sand.  
Only mist, just the  
necklace, nothing but  
it. Form.  
The reasons for my respect  
are perfumed in my toe of glass.  
A nose and an arm  
magnifying the archipeligos.  
  
Return to the homeland of the guitars.
