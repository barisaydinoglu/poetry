The Technique Has Not Erupted The Promise
-----------------------------------------
Shady sunrise and the windy sand-colored lake  
undulate at the walls of my house.  
A wounded snow day  
from her foot and her eyeballs understand  
warmths of your body of the earth.  
Wave of wave of hats rolling down the sea.  
On what delirious noises trusted with water?  
Brings all the wets natures.  
For flint was ghostly and morally negative.  
Happiness is gone, the subject has lighted.
