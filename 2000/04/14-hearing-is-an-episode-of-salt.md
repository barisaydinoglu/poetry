Hearing Is An Episode Of Salt
-----------------------------
You shower in the vicinity as in a spacious jungle.  
And meetings of tremulous brow one alphabetic option and there are no daggers but sordid cycles of tryst and sepia  
autumns of essential communist steel.  
The bitten ostrich stores behind the electrical belts.  
Wave of wave of corals rolling down the sea.  
They changed it with dead apples.  
To wake lost femininities and for muscles.  
Shall we go forward?  
Happiness is gone, the subject has dedicated.
