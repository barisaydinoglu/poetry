Song For The Pioneer Of Weak Forms
----------------------------------
Everything clotting with angellic voices, the salt of the friendship  
and piles of mineral bread among sunrise.  
Multitude of river banks!  
In and out of the sunburst orange the marine and the transluscent green  
Somebody here is waiting for the next momentum.  
Fellowship. You preserved yourself for treading.  
It was the sunrise of the lobster.  
A machine for technique is the lack thereof.  
One technical option and we open the halves of a epiphany and the  
smothering of cold fires plays into the cosmic universe.  
  
It was the twilight of the squirrel.  
  
Which is a scrupulous wave of directions  
million or three hundred, developed  
on a wheatfield or in the hopeful essence  
directions of the brain, a calculation in your fingers.  
Draw from it the wet-winged  
image of its own antenna.
