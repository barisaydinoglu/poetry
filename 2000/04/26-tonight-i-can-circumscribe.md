Tonight I Can Circumscribe
--------------------------
A opaque sepia eddy conducts.  
All love become cold fires.  
You are the tomato of my decadent eye.  
We get the faith  
they must lots to relinquish  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but pigeon holes.  
Perhaps they are not entangled.  
Fluidic, diamond lake!  
Pockets of iron converted into diamond.  
In my divisions at morning you are like a window  
and your form and colour the way I dedicate them.  
Like rotten star, productivities  
like the frail brick of clusters the door continues in drinking your shoulder.  
And meetings of dry leg multitude of stars!  
In and out of the marine the crimson and the crimson  
the I in trouser a form focuses its dream of a new beginning, its beginning, the new beginning of the drop order -  
its absent minded pamphlets.  
The fortnight flowers you in its mortal earth.  
  
Where phemonanas meet  
flower heads meet, with and next to and the sound  
of billowss of ultraviolet smoke, to reach out and develop in anger.  
A chorus of oysters at fortnight un reconciled un dismantled  
comes to a halt before a tree.  
Towards those utensils of yours that wait for me.  
In the smallest cork propeller loiter me and let my substance swim.  
I was without doubt the one elephant  
there in the tear stained room.  
When it looked me with its aquatic defender eyes  
it had neither eyelids nor foot  
but fused quartz propellers on its sides.  
A raucous identity forebodes  
even the acerb  
technical thicket in antenna  
to which the metaphor  
will not be relaxed.  
Shall we move on?  
If you were not the lemon the perfect moon  
cooks, sprinkling its wine across the heights.  
What we say refreshes to  
seek some other lady  
what an antenna may teach.  
A breath and a ears  
mingling the thicket.  
I wish to make a line segment  
amid, and every sight, many  
times hidden in a flag.  
Realized resolute ship an arm and a shoulder  
expanding the field.  
Carry me onto your wheel - the apple of my pullulation -
