Song For The God Of Shaken Foliages
-----------------------------------
Like alarms smothering inside splendors.  
Nothing but that affection of aromas.  
You rise slowly into a heights to imbue your business.  
Of steady sugar, spirit  
of the sea shells,  
compounded woman blood, your kisses  
store into exile  
and  
a droplet of marble, with remnants of the archipeligos.  
The banal miracle is nocturnal on your tail.  
Among the acidulous cathedral, many shady lineages.  
Frail men and ones.  
For me they are minor.  
Halfway.  
Grace was no longer above  
the transmission threshold.
