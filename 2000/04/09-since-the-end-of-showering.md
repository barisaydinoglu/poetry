Since The End Of Showering
--------------------------
Always you congeal through the afternoon  
toward the fortnight depriving ribbons. In the middle of the hollow moonlight evening of bruised evening star.  
A toe and a mouth  
understanding the vicinity.  
What is this signal but a memory pitied of its farms?  
Conversations of stars, the recitation  
of shorelines we call warm saxophone.  
In my archipeligos at fortnight you are like a grace  
and your form and colour the way I rise them.  
Everything smothered with velvety voices, the salt of the pasture  
and piles of starry bread amid holiday.  
  
I salute your thick apple  
and envy your mineral pride.  
A springtime blushing will pulse  
the bitten earth of a planet.  
  
As if to smear or shine or abandon.  
Cheerless astronauts and women.  
For me they are algorithmic.
