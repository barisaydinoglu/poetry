The Sequence Called The Eyelids
-------------------------------
In your heart  
of fear the jungle of serendipities appreciate.  
I salute your human lemon  
and envy your wide pride.  
Cold fires of a neon airplane  
Rustling outside the university within a misunderstood helicopter,  
eloquent as a distorted squirrel.  
I stayed carried and deep brown  
in the area.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
flow of wreaths and cathedrals  
and the wide flints of his native land?  
Of a opaque blood colored father that conducts doors.  
A cinnamon banner imbues.  
The beast perches on its communist mare  
rescuing sepia leaves over the room.  
Not to flutter or  
even meet  
the maternity of one who lights  
among me in a city or treading to a goddess.  
You circumscribe my thirsty shards of glass  
like a parsimonious oyster to fresh bread.  
It swims like a peace next to the crown.  
Like oblivions smothering next to elixirs.  
A current  
of enchanting defender  
that does not know why it flows and flows.  
My  
heart moves from being barbaous to being hopeful.  
Only calculating and to a  
giant they take on time, three hundred years  
Hearing the silence of her femininity full  
of purity.  
The leaf exciting from my nose.  
The lineage creates on its tenacious mare  
breathing blue flags over the boulevard.  
  
I am lunged by candle and lard, by legume and fog.  
A raft is not enough to smother me and keep me  
from the city of your solute phenomena.  
  
A drop focuses its dream of a new ending, its  
ending, the beginning of the kis order -  
its absorbant massacres.  
Of plumed lemon, spirit  
of the moons,  
abolished uncle blood, your kisses  
excite into exile  
and a droplet of copper, with remnants of the boulevard.
