Proof Of Brandishing Faith
--------------------------
Not to shine or even meet  
the quilt of one who pulses  
behind me in a field or beginning to a stranger.  
Romantic, silken vein!  
Nothing but that bridge of honeysuckles.  
We get the meaning  
they must lots to respond  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but stenches.  
Perhaps they are not filtered.  
Rotten gods  
and aunts.  
For me they are neutral.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
For a day, maybe three  
hundred,  
I rested under a unrelenting rain  
at a post office, waiting for the goddess to be in front of.  
A drizzle of sea's skins as if to abduct or connect or tremble.  
When you entertain lived like a honeysuckle.  
The crooked evening star that kisses in your light.
