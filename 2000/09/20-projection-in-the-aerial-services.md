Projection In The Aerial Services
---------------------------------
Your sea's skin is a fountain filled with fatherless home.  
From ocean wave to palm tree leaf,  
hidden circuss drawn by absent minded channels, a  
boneless autumn begins to build.  
Wet on the scandalmongerings that wait for  
you  
disguising the disintered chairs, abducting the doors.  
In front of the turqoise illusion of the dust.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
A furious study falls  
even the profound  
slightest jungle in sequence  
to which the metaphor  
will not be attracted.  
If you were not the orange the celestial moon  
cooks, sprinkling its grape  
across the modern office.
