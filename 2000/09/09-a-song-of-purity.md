A Song Of Purity
----------------
You are the ironous astronaut of a toucan,  
the listless ness of the phemonana, the power of the lightning.  
You hear in the field as in a wonderful land.  
The bed attracting from my hips.  
Phosphorus self-productions and phosphorus blades.  
Neither pencil nor foam nor ultraviolet  
nor burnt umber but crimson.  
A morbid identity entangles  
even the smooth  
aerial night in image  
to which the metaphor  
will not be dawned.  
One historical option and attracting toward the wave the coal conducts on its lethargic mare  
loving transluscent marine jars over the sea.  
It returns like a pencil with the serenity.  
Awakening a hat  
understood in the natural fog.  
  
Where flutes meet  
paths meet, with and within and the sound  
of daggers, to reach out and dedicate in illusion.  
She is against us at this moment of first beginning.
