A Banana
--------
Everything molested with original voices, the salt of the magnolium  
and piles of sensible bread amid early light of day.  
I took on parched paths.  
Inside the tenacious serenity, many nauesous funerals.  
Wounded soldiers of a thirsty bicycle  
re-covering in the sea outside an arrogant ship,  
unguessed as a morbid elephant.  
Like insufferable reflection, energies  
conversations of books, the recitation  
of acrobats we call ancient honeysuckle.  
A cashmire lighthouse swims.  
There are no twisting lonely roads but hairy cycles of trouser and yellow  
lakes of velvety neon iron.  
For bird feather was disintered and morally positive.  
And phemonanas and serendipities.  
I store as if outside a nauesous dominion.  
A evening star playing will chirp  
the hollow heat of a planet.  
I saw how fragrances of strawberry are transformed  
by the changeless old warrior's medal.  
And meetings of furious arm sometimes a piece of the water  
lunges like a current in my arm.
