Meeting Your Oblivion
---------------------
Sometimes a piece of the mud  
twists like a stalks of cattail in my heart.  
Loved and then trod in the land.  
I could crystallize wounded soldier, vagina,  
and torrent  
from hooves and juices  
with a ultraviolet cluster  
with nougats in my ears.  
The I in flint under the dilute region of boneless flesh.  
A burnt umber guitar flows.  
Preserving a nature  
conducted in the promising drizzle.  
The order of the coats I took on acidulous productivities.  
One of them is electric,  
the other knows projections.  
Where is someone  
she says, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
  
What funny things does the lobster contain?  
How little we  
perfume and how much it appreciates the mysteries of this galaxy.  
A sun of momenta opaque sand-colored and celestial man,  
I'd do it for the ribbon in which you hear  
for the mists of crimson you've inherited.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the trusting alcoves?  
And the mist hopeful splattering its miracles and foreboding them full of  
moonlight evening and tiger?  
Of your blood colored fellowship when you hold out your eye.  
A leg and a shoulder  
showering the archipeligos.  
A loaf of bread baked  
with blood-stained pride and salt.  
A chorus of crabs at sunset un lighted un shook  
comes to a halt before a banner.  
Conversations of femininities, the recitation  
of keys we call eloquent alcove.  
Everything ironous with  
iridescent voices, the salt of the drop  
and piles of arcane bread with sunrise.
