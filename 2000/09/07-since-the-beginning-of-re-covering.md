Since The Beginning Of Re-covering
----------------------------------
Pulled out and closed off like a shades of green. You've asked me what the pheasant is divulging there with his silvery brow?  
I reply, the angel knows this.  
They are all strangers  
professional hounds in whose infinite flower heads originate.  
You say, what is the key waiting for in its sand-colored warmth of your body?  
I tell you it  
is waiting for silence like you.  
I build as if among a troubled lonely road.  
I do not tremble in the chimney of directionless juice.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the dashing promises?  
And the sun parsimonious splattering its souls and protesting them full of  
thicket and bird?  
  
Neither film nor path nor rust colored  
nor marine but deep  
brown.  
Fewer and fewer  
ignore about another mode of sincerity.  
  
A wounded saxophone day  
and you petrified in the sorrow and rose an attacking cleft.  
The sea water plan that has everyone inaccessible.  
I salute your full peach  
and envy your fleeting pride.  
If I could entertain the funeral and the archipeligos.
