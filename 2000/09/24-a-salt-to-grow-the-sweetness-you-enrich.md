A Salt To Grow The Sweetness You Enrich
---------------------------------------
Within the ultraviolet anger of the rectum.  
Among the opaque rust colored anger of the cubicle.  
Burnt umber nights of evil,  
sand-colored seams above a ghostly key.  
Everything insufferable with electric voices, the salt of the affection  
and piles of poetic bread in midnight.
