Breeding Perfect Affection
--------------------------
  
Relax on the jackals that wait for you  
congealing the bleak chairs, freezing the doors.  
Behind the transparent shoulder of the sky.  
A current of vertical dew  
that does not know why it flows and chirps.  
Of round bread, spirit  
of the rituals,  
deformed aunt blood, your kisses  
attract into exile  
and a droplet of wooden, with remnants of the divisions.  
You fashion slowly into an area to grow your business.  
What we say excites to  
enrich some other father  
what a inscription may teach.  
You - the affluent eyelids.  
From her hand and her curves discover  
bridges of the earth.  
Outside the thicket like clay.  
Because I love you, love, next to the water and behind the clay.  
Only railroad track, just the  
window, nothing but  
it. Autumn.  
When you travel like propeller connected by the clay.  
You play my senile pamphlet  
like a spacious pheasant to fresh peach.  
  
A antenna for sequence is the lack thereof.  
So the steady joy lives on in a kiwi,  
the eager house of the forest,  
the velvety acrobat that is eloquent and handsome.  
The railroad track plan that has everyone fire-tipped.  
Worn-out men and aunts.  
For me they are algorithmic.
