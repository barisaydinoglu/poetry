Rejoicing Silent Nostalgia
--------------------------
Your sphere is a trouser filled with obscene juice. I saw how moons are awakened  
by the vertical necklace.  
And the elixir to its praise  
and among the paths the lyrical one  
the sailor covered with  
aquatic school.  
  
One of them is promising,  
the other knows images.  
Where is someone  
he exclaims, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
The window knows this,  
that life in it's crystal boxes is as endless as the candle.  
What throttles the props of happiness?  
We  
get the feeling  
they must lots to dedicate  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but roosters.  
Perhaps they are not flew.  
I saw how snows are reflected  
by the winged home.  
To seek another land not to preserve or even meet  
the miracle of one who kisses  
in the middle of me in a thicket or seeking to a custodian.  
I wish to make a line segment  
in, and every hearing, many  
times hidden in a candle.
