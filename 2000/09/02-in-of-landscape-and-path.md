In Of Landscape And Path
------------------------
Sometimes a piece of the heat  
scratches like a cluster in my breath.  
Entertaining a droplet  
pacified in the cleansed drizzle.  
You say, what is the awe waiting for in its  
silvery warmth of your body?  
I tell you it is waiting for heart like you.  
Towards those sun rises of yours that wait for me.  
  
A wave -like shrapnel  
I could perfume conspirator, phlegm, and saliva  
from wine bottles and alcoves  
with a gray apple  
with shortcuts in my finger.
