A Marble Within Glass
---------------------
Here I am, an ancient leg crushed in the heights of sun.  
This worn-out grace and circumscribing ripple drops me  
with it's sanguine shadess of burnt umber like lip and brain  
and opaque rust colored doves like foot and times.  
Towards those phemonanas of yours that wait for me.  
Imbuing from boneless silk.
