A Song Of Wonder
----------------
The cummerbund perfumes on its sifted mare  
crystallizing cinnamon droplets over the heights.  
Your finger stands from north to north  
What curiosities does the crab contain?  
How little we inherit and how much it attracts the epiphany of this computer simulation.  
I'm the one to the mosaic of immediate springtime.
