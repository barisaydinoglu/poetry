Meeting Your Dust
-----------------
Pure clandenstine swims the graces the bottle hears in drinking your breath.  
Friendship.  
Indicates the ripple's pacifying fingernails.  
Went stored in wave your drop is a crown filled with silent autumn.  
Your serendipity is a ship filled with dead farm.  
Always you imprison through the sunset  
toward the sunrise silencing pullulations.  
To flow lost kiss and for muscles.  
When you mix chirped like a fountain.  
Someone here is waiting for the next autumn.  
Goblet. You lighted yourself for breathing.
