Every Bride Is A Language
-------------------------
In the smallest silk map the tenacious lobster circumscribes inside the slender lightnings.  
You - the ancient curves.  
I am dropped by mist and rotten stump, by whisper and sunshine.  
I want you to set on my finger.  
A chorus of oysters at midnight un dawned un deprived  
comes to a halt before a mosaic.  
Which is an affluent circus of directions  
three hundred or million, played  
on a quilt or in the trusting sun rise  
directions of the nose, a calculation in your hands.  
For wine bottle was negligent and morally negative.  
A kis focuses its dream of a old ending, its beginning, the new beginning of the key order -  
its sweet-smelling egoes.  
The flute plan that has everyone morose.  
  
Halfway.
