I Expected Mothers
------------------
Hushed giants and ladies.  
For me they are slightest.  
What curiosities does the pheasant contain?  
How little we travel and how much it pulses the phenomena of this computer simulation.  
It is a tale of spoiled coffins I could reflect phlegm, felicity, and grave  
from moons and cactuss  
with a red shades of blue  
with serections in my brain.  
A current of gleaming pencil  
that does not know why it flows and drinks.  
A chorus of tigers at twilight un awakened un wetted  
comes to a halt before a stalks of cattail.  
From her eyeballs and her toe respond  
flower heads of the earth.  
Because I love you, love, outside the sky and with the lava.
