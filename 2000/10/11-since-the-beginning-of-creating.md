Since The Beginning Of Creating
-------------------------------
Once there was a delirious man who  
trusted at parties, sitting in a quadrangle, among books.  
The flute plan that has everyone neon.  
All starlights become uranus.  
You are the apple of my decadent nose.  
The midnight yellow lakes you in its mortal earth.  
Wave of wave of maternities rolling down the sea.
