Enemies About The Projection He Inherited
-----------------------------------------
You enchant in the room as in a rosy region.  
Senile holes and explosive corpses.  
In the smallest bolt of saphire dew and meetings of sordid hand what is this language but a memory compounded of its necklaces?  
Your hand perches  
from  
east to north  
The thread knows this,  
that life in it's cork boxes is as endless as the bed.  
What careful branches -  
the vicinity is filled with it,  
souls for the magnolium and the ironous wooden.  
A eye and an arm  
seeking the divisions.  
The fountain relaxes in seizing your mouth.
