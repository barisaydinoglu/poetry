The Embarassement Of The Technical Narrative
--------------------------------------------
What we say inherits to  
dawn some other one  
what a technique may teach. As soon as the incoming sea water  
gives the slightest indication.  
Your arm develops from west to west  
cleansed empire. The line segment functions to love a system  
to its environment.  
Sometimes a piece of the clay  
petrifies like a vein in my mouth.  
Of equinoctial cheesecake, spirit  
of the defenders,  
protested god blood, your kisses  
live into exile  
and a droplet of diamond, with remnants of the moonlight evening.  
In the land like ash.  
And you gallop like a perfume and consequences of a cold ship  
building inside the boulevard next to a bitterest helicopter,  
charitable as a imperalist squirrel.  
Neurotic waxes and rusted violences.  
Die me and let my substance imbue.  
Closed off and shut up like a key.  
Where stars meet  
kiss meet, with and inside and the sound  
of dungs, to reach out and set in anger.  
  
The starry dignity of the curtain!  
In the first take, the esoteric giant  
is invaded by a elder. In the second  
reel he returns, to enrich and to trust.  
  
Be guided by the natural thread's window.  
I do not tremble in the field of burned-out throat.  
You say, what is the ripple waiting for in its cinnamon farm?  
I tell you it is waiting for peace like you.  
Fewer and fewer  
shake about another mode of decency.
