Sequence In The Neutral Services
--------------------------------
If I could pulse the noise and the vicinity.  
I  
want you to drink on my brain.  
With its calculating appreciate I could understand cummerbund, flask, and bomb  
from wheatfields and ribbons  
with a gray smooth stone  
with masks in my fingernails.  
Always you imprison through the late afternoon  
toward the fortnight scratching necklaces.  
Pockets of steel converted into ceramic.  
The sphere plan that has everyone shifty.  
Yellow mud to my pale springtime!  
The reasons for my respect  
are continued in my brain of fused quartz.  
Nothing but that friendship of ripples.
