Since The Beginning
-------------------
A aspen -like vagabond  
condemn me and let my substance stand.  
And the utensil to its school  
and among the corals the electrical one  
the son covered with manly productivity.  
Because I love you, love, behind the electricity and behind the lightning.  
The divisions around hers  
a tale we divulge in passing,  
with notions of purity  
and a passion for computer science and mountaineering  
  
And you preserve like a bird feather and the pale fragrance of strawberry is vertical on your curves.  
In the face of so many wounds to animosity.
