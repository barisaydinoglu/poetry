The Synonym Has Not Prosecuted The Promise
------------------------------------------
Everything wet-winged with delicate voices, the salt of the springtime  
and piles of boundless bread outside twilight.  
Boney pins and forceful stenches.  
And meetings of sordid eyelids a ship focuses its dream of a new beginning, its  
ending, the ending of the flower head order -  
its sanguine violas.  
A image for camera is the lack thereof.  
  
A current focuses its dream of a beginning, its new ending, the new ending of the sun rise order -  
its esoteric dominions.  
A loaf of bread baked with listless tiredness and salt.  
As if to bristle or divulge or fly.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
enchant of springtimes and affections  
and the plumed bird feathers of his native land?  
The order of the juices behind the bristling havocs.  
For a day, maybe three hundred,  
I rested under a uncomfortable turbulence  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the daughter to be behind.  
  
All echoes become vagabonds.  
The lake divulges in attracting your eye.
