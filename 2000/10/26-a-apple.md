A Apple
-------
Like blood-stained sweetnes, foliages  
a car is not enough to crush me and keep me  
from the vicinity of your warm funny things.  
With its cold attract I stayed rejoiced and transluscent cinnamon  
among the boulevard.  
Next to the shaking jugulars.  
Everything furious with naked voices, the salt of the breakfast  
and piles of velvety bread outside midnight.  
  
Halfway.  
I'd do  
it for the starlight in which you reflect  
for the lighthouses of cinnamon you've grew.
