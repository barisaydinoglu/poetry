Proof Of Esoteric Feeling
-------------------------
The I in serenity when the sea is full of mechanical arm  
among wastelands and dilute lewd peaces  
and the dead utensils and the manes  
at last give forth their careless cubicle.  
Pure noise kisses the splendors there are no shardss of diamond but boney cycles of telegraph and burnt umber  
forms of delicate  
shifty aluminum.  
I was without doubt the goddess pheasant  
there in the absurd region.  
When it looked me with its resplendent coral eyes  
it had neither shoulder nor brow  
but silicon suns on its sides.  
Shall we set forth?  
From blade of grass to blade of grass,  
hidden bottles drawn by gleaming channels, a  
hushed current begins to travel.  
Weaving toward the book a quilt -like lance  
pure howl fashions the natures a current of monastic vein  
that does not know why it flows and creates.  
How creating is the cordial consequence and it's promising pamphlets?  
On what rotten salts rejoiced with heat?
