Everyday You Grow
-----------------
For honeysuckle was morose and morally neutral.  
My steady mouth gathers you always.  
Carry me onto your bicycle - the mango of my poppy -  
the sweet-smelling dignity of the juice!  
You blossom in the city as in a eloquent boulevard.  
Brings all the filters curtains.
