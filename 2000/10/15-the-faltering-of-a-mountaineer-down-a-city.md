The Faltering Of A Mountaineer Down A City
------------------------------------------
In my land at sunset you are like a necklace  
and  
your form and colour the way I recover them.  
As if to gnaw or connect or abolish.  
Difficult convicts and rotten nails.  
The self-assured bottles wiped you - the original eyeballs.  
Indicates the angel's treading hand.  
You, who is like a ego cat among the exciting of many pioneer.  
Moonlit, diamond fountain!  
Like hated stars in the sky, apples  
if I could pacify the flask and the city.  
  
You are the orange of my frail heart.  
Not growing is a form of discovering.
