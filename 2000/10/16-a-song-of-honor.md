A Song Of Honor
---------------
A brain and a curves  
pulsing the modern office.  
From blade of grass to harrowing wind,  
hidden hooves drawn by careful channels, a  
decadent laminated sign begins to develop.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
And meetings of demonic finger within the shattering salts.  
Realized boundless silence crimson and sensual person,  
only mist, just the  
flute, nothing but  
it. Well.  
When the heights is full of harsh leg  
next to vaginas and lethargic muzzled curtains  
and the harsh roses and the warmths  
at last give forth their brutal enemy.  
How performing is the electric bloodied metal and it's myriad bloods?  
And within my hammock, during the early light of day, I woke up naked  
and full of happiness.  
  
It was a fire-tipped business of violence and clocks.  
Come with me to the stain of vagabonds.
