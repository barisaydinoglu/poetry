The Language Called The Lip
---------------------------
Of a blood colored sailor that appreciates banners.  
And you struck in the beligerance and magnified a flying bone.  
A smooth stone enchanting will fashion  
the browbeaten fire of a planet.  
It was the night of the toucan.  
Not the sunburst orange moment  
when the morning preserves the manes.  
In the nauesous bird feather, many rigid hounds.  
  
It was the midnight of the lobster.  
Imperalist weather, dilute lights like the hoove.  
A loaf of bread baked with ironous joy and salt.  
A brow and  
a breath  
entertaining the boulevard.  
Halfway.  
If you were not the wine the cosmic moon  
cooks, sprinkling its apple across the jungle.  
If you were not the wine the celestial moon  
cooks, sprinkling its bread across the heights.  
Bloody feathers of a cold raft  
fluttering outside the field outside a obscene raft,  
rosy as a misunderstood oyster.  
The eddy fluttering from my hips.  
You - the human curves.  
  
Developing a snow  
developed in the musical sun.  
In the face of so many smokes to functionality.  
You say, what is the pencil waiting for in its marine branch?  
I tell you it is waiting for root like you.  
So the arcane decency lives on in a grape,  
the gleaming house of the fragrance of strawberry,  
the lovely wheatfield that is vertical and wonderful.  
What buries the props of love?  
And you conquered in the illusion and reflected a coagulating vagabond.
