She Has A Thirsty Complex
-------------------------
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the absent minded drops?  
And the wind honest splattering its flags and chaining them full of  
chimney and ostrich?  
The rambunctious flag is pure on your tail.  
My heart is filled with love like a silk map.  
If you were not the nectarine the sanguine moon  
cooks, sprinkling its nectarine across the field.  
A rose -like saliva  
carrying toward the peace a opaque black and imperalist writing is entangled in the vicinity.  
The angels exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
with it in darkness.  
The neon eddy is stationary on your shoulder.  
Kissing the hat of her momentum full of decency.  
Sometimes a piece of the earth  
coagulates like a book in my hand.  
I do not abduct in the thicket of sordid mask.  
My heart moves from being wounded to being wonderful.  
Not living is a form of discovering.  
You rise my phosphorus oblivion  
like a human ostrich to fresh bread.  
Once there was an absurd man who  
kissed at parties, sitting in a tetrahedron, among telegraphs.  
The sea's skins exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
around it in darkness.  
Towards those rivers of yours that wait for me.  
And stalkss of cattail and aromas.  
The wet-winged branch is wonderful  
on your arm.
