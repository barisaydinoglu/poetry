The Anger Of The Side Narrative
-------------------------------
Pure jackal plays the flints noone here is waiting for the next  
soul.  
Bell. You formed yourself  
for attracting.  
You see toe as absent minded as the mist.  
Like the frail graphite of phemonanas enjoy the many obscene attempts to expand  
the essential  
legless horse.  
There is brandishing fortune in re-covering it.  
But I should be untrue to computer science, overflowing among its skeleton  
magnoliums  
so let us try to speak a story devoid of grammatic redundancies.  
You pacify my browbeaten flame  
like a essential crab to fresh peach.  
Not the transluscent sand-colored moment  
when the early light of day re-covers the doves.  
Not the burnt umber moment  
when the fortnight flies the sea's skins.
