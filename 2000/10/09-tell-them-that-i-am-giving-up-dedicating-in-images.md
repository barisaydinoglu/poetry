Tell Them That I Am Giving Up Dedicating In Images
--------------------------------------------------
Towards those honeysuckles of yours that wait for me.  
Your awe is a prize filled with smothered fellowship.  
The pure cathedrals condemned a chorus of oysters at midnight un stored  
un gnawn  
comes to a halt before a wave.  
Around the divisions I like to pacify like a hated awe.  
Like the dilute iron of paths which is a brandishing splendor of directions  
too many to count or too few to count, relaxed  
on a lake or in the brandishing curtain  
directions of the hips, a calculation in your fingers.  
Marine and hidden lady,  
and in front of my hammock, during the night, I woke up naked  
and full of felicity.
