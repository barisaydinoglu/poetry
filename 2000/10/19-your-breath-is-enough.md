Your Breath Is Enough
---------------------
Pockets of metal converted into silicon.  
They congealed it with tenacious lighthouses.  
A tremulous mane day  
only browbeaten and to a  
gentleman they take on time, thousand years  
always you taunt through the sunset  
toward the holiday imprisoning warmths.  
You are the whirlwinds of custodian of a squirrel,  
the troubled ness of the sea water, the power of the lightning.  
And meetings of cold eyeballs what is this identity but a memory impaled of its foams?  
Return to the homeland of the propellers.  
Transforming from negligent ceramic.  
Neon gentlemen and goddesses.  
For me they are minor.  
Wave of wave of branches rolling down the sea.
