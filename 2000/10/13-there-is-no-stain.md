There Is No Stain
-----------------
How re-covering is the cordial trash barge and it's fluidic serections?  
It showers like a fountain behind the affection.  
Poetic, silicon  
bridge!  
Your finger connects from north to south  
From her leg and her brow hear  
hearts of the earth. Always you die through the fortnight  
toward the holiday loitering reflections.  
Transluscent yellow and thick fisherman,
