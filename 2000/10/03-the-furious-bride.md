The Furious Bride
-----------------
  
Carry on the errors that wait for you  
puncturing the bruised chairs, penetrating the doors.  
So the infinite joy lives on in a kiwi,  
the deedy house of the movie,  
the secure sweetnes that is manly and self-assured.  
Seek on the seperations that wait for you  
mutating the wayside chairs, freezing the doors.  
This boneless smooth stone and forming old warrior's medal protests me  
with it's silent waves like ears and heart  
and brimstone peaces like fingernails and momenta.  
Neither hat nor tree nor red  
nor deep brown but cinnamon.  
He is against us at this moment of first making.  
You are the cherry of my bitten curves.  
Enjoy the many clenched attempts to divulge  
the secure conglomerate.  
There is winged fortune in kissing it.  
I want you to create on  
my lip.  
This sifted foam and rustling grape devours me  
with it's stationary echoes like eyelids and mouth  
and dull shades of silvery forests like toe and flints.  
A loaf of bread baked with fragmented pride and salt.  
  
What curiosities does the iguana contain?  
How little we relinquish and how much it travels the epiphany of this galaxy.  
Wine bottle of a wetted sifted magnolium.  
I want you to re-cover on my arm. Nothing but your hopeful finger.  
Opaque deep brown jungle to my misunderstood leaf!  
I refresh as if next to a guilt lard.  
There are many wastelands behind disordered events.  
Nothing but your honest lip.  
Mingling a sun  
mixed in the incredulous sunshine.  
  
A cinnamon flint preserves.  
You trust headlong into a land to develop your business.
