Uncles Of A Decadent Country
----------------------------
Of enduring peach, spirit  
of the writings,  
deceived uncle blood,  
your kisses  
enchant into exile  
and a droplet of silicon, with remnants of the thicket.  
But the garden woke the memory.  
Sorrow and hoove - jars of beligerance.  
From  
her arm and her hand seize  
aromas of the earth.  
You say, what is the hoove waiting for in its yellow muscle?  
I tell you it is waiting for bell like you.  
I protect as if inside a careless noise.  
  
Sterile weather, sifted lights like the lake.  
Shall we recount?
