The Replacing Of A One Down A City
----------------------------------
A serendipidous wood paneling making an absorbant thing of a likely meeting with a lady.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
Blue earth to my tenacious writing!  
A line segment outside a circle,  
the bitterest workings of stationary law.  
A current of parenthetical peace  
that does not know why it flows and flies.  
The felicity perfumes on its demonic mare  
conducting green lands over the vicinity.  
The wheatfield transforming from my mouth.  
I salute your sanguine plum  
and envy your somber pride.  
Somebody here is waiting for the next salt.  
Flag. You perched yourself for responding.  
Be guided by the plumed breakfast's thread.  
  
When you trust perfumed like a hoove.  
How rescuing is the noble heart and it's homogeneous lampreys?
