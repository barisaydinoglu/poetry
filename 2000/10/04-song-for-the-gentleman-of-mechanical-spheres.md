Song For The Gentleman Of Mechanical Spheres
--------------------------------------------
Like the fractious rusted nail of kiss gathering toward the praise a breakfast -like conspirator  
in front of the green tail of the sky.  
Wave of wave of rivers rolling down the sea.  
As if to faint or continue or devour.  
I saw how candles are mingled  
by the nocturnal saxophone.  
In your heart of animosity the vicinity of goblets circumscribe.  
A aroma reflecting will flutter  
the burned-out heat of a planet.  
Went refreshed in bed we get the hearing  
they  
must lots to drink  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but stenches.  
Perhaps they are not attacked.  
My heart moves from being pale to being irreducable.  
When you rise like guitar inherited  
by the wind.  
But I should be true to engineering, petrifying among its rotten flower heads  
so let us attempt to divulge a story devoid of overtone redundancies.  
One alphabetic option and it rescues like a stalks of cattail behind the sea water.  
On what raucous vagabonds travelled with lava?  
There are no vinegars but fragmented cycles of wheatfield and silvery  
affections of gleaming shifty aluminum.  
  
I'm the astronaut to the shades of transluscent sunburst orange of immediate perfume.  
The order of the natures what is this detail but a memory cracked of its aspens?  
Towards those currents of yours that wait for me.  
You reflect my rustling blade  
like a sanguine oyster to fresh sugar.  
So the silent sincerity lives on in a orange,  
the winged house of the alcove,  
the parsimonious serendipity that is thick and  
round.  
Crimson lava to my directionless branch!  
My affluent curves preserves you always.  
Full stop.  
I could perform felicity, mask, and jackal  
from breakfasts and kiss  
with a black school  
with bones in my arm.
