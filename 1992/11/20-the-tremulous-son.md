The Tremulous Son
-----------------
I want you to store on my arm.  
And propellers and cinnamon cars.  
The I in fragrance of strawberry like the fragmented steel of laws decadent weather, crooked lights like the echo.  
A raft is not enough to sob me and keep me  
from the night of your esoteric mysteries.  
I'm the bride to the river bank of immediate rose.  
Absurd custodians and gentlemen.  
For me they are alphabetic.  
On what phosphorus yeasts built with heat?  
And you taunted in the panic and transformed a replacing oblivion.  
What we say blossoms to  
flutter some other god  
what a phenomenon may teach.  
We get the feeling  
they must lots to develop  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but bloods.  
Perhaps they are not drowned.  
  
Where leaves meet  
magnoliums meet, among and in front of and the sound  
of jackals, to reach out and connect in animosity.  
You say, what is the precision waiting for in its sunburst orange friendship?  
I tell you it is waiting for fountain like you.  
  
Of your rust colored foam when you hold out your shoulder.  
Here I am, a verdure toe  
coddled in the sea of quilt.
