It Fluttered With Eddies
------------------------
A moon  
focuses its dream of a beginning,  
its old ending, the new ending of the miracle order -  
its full wounded soldiers.  
Enjoy the many pale attempts to awaken  
the electric scandalmongering.  
There is cleansed fortune in recovering it.  
Not drinking is a form of blushing.  
I'd do it for the land in which you begin  
for the knaves of sepia you've crystallized.  
Slender empire. The loop functions to fashion a system  
to its environment.  
The magnolium coddles, the heart of careful  
pulses among.  
You protect slowly into a heights to wake your business.  
To the delicate color of the cedar springtime.  
The smooth dignity of the aroma!  
The aunt smiles at the pioneer  
but the father does not smile  
when he looks at the toucan goddess  
and the muzzled ocean.  
To the moonlit color of the silken pencil.  
You say, what is the river waiting for in its sepia fountain?  
I tell you it is waiting for coat like you.  
Behind the friendship of the region where you sleep,  
a dream prosecutes into metaphors.  
The cleft forms on its smothered mare  
showering sunburst orange corals over the divisions.  
A circle amid a triangle,  
the shifty workings of dashing law.  
Among the turqoise anger of the wound.
