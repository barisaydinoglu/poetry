Since The End Of Burying
------------------------
Because I love you, love, amid the clay and inside the water. A thunder of roses I rejoice as if outside a sordid blood.  
A moon focuses its dream of a new beginning, its new ending, the new ending of the propeller order -  
its myriad utensils.  
Travel on the daggers that  
wait for you  
passing the negligent chairs, devouring the doors.  
The fragrance  
of strawberry playing from my mouth.  
A blood colored and mourning yellow lake is filtered in the modern office.  
Your eye inherits from west to west  
I could fashion panic, night, and bloody feather  
from awes and stones  
with a dull shades of marine wine bottle  
with howls in my brain.  
  
My manly eyelids preserves you always.  
My heart is filled with wonder like a gem telegraph.  
A inscription perches,  
mutates - it does not return.  
Brings all the abducts maps.  
Your perfume is a book filled with frightened defender.  
Always you reject through the early light of day  
toward the morning scratching hooves.  
Parenthetical, wooden friendship!  
A loaf of bread baked with frail honor and  
salt.  
  
It is a tale of phosphorus legless horses and around my hammock, during the late afternoon, I woke up naked  
and full of felicity.  
There are many puberties within insufferable events.
