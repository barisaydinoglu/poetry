Since The Beginning
-------------------
Our new phemonana, our rosy coat triangles.  
Some grow but I continue your ash like railroad track.  
A hat -like stalactite  
like moldy bananas drowning in breakfasts.  
To seek another land to the boundless color of the fused quartz evening star.  
A brain and a eyelids  
pacifying the thicket.  
Sand-colored wind to my negligent form!  
Embarassement and stars in the sky - poppies of agony.
