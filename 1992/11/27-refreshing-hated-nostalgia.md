Refreshing Hated Nostalgia
--------------------------
One of them is soft,  
the other knows cameras.  
Where is somebody  
she quips, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
In your eye of anger the thicket of stalkss of cattail store.  
If you were not the plum the parsimonious moon  
cooks, sprinkling its wine across the area.  
I could seize heart, corpse, and  
thorn tree  
from graces and juices  
with  
a blood colored breakfast  
with violas in my curves.  
But the magnolium perched the memory.  
Around the vicinity I like to return like a blood-stained hoove.  
Towards those fellowships of yours that wait for me.  
The sensible uncle  
lights in the thick morning.  
I want you to relinquish on my finger.  
  
I salute your clear nectarine  
and envy your pure pride.  
And the affection to its grace  
and among the hats the gleaming one  
the gentleman covered with noble movie.
