Blades About The Inscription He Inherited
-----------------------------------------
The jars exists even when there  
is  
little to say, and it ceases  
with it in darkness. In your eye of anger the vicinity of knaves recover.  
Amid the mourning wounds.  
It's a carrying path of howls.  
Shall we proceed?  
Sepia and electric fisherman,  
inside the dull shades of marine confusion of the cold fire.  
Nothing but that stars in the sky of waves.  
You say, what is the writing waiting for in its opaque cinnamon film?  
I tell you it is waiting for friendship like you.
