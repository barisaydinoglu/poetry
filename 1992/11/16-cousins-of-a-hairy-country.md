Cousins Of A Hairy Country
--------------------------
A grace -like enemy  
and you hear like a faucet and in front of the changing complaints.  
And so that its oxides will drown your eye.  
There ought to be a book of a comfortable peace hearing in a boulevard.  
As soon as the incoming phemonanas  
gives the aerial indication.  
I saw how utensils are rescued  
by the sweet-smelling flower.
