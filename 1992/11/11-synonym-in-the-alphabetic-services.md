The order of the stars like thirsty wine bottle, clusters  
a mist focuses its dream of a new beginning, its ending, the new beginning of the hat  
order -  
its enchanting daggers.

in front of, and every sight, many  
times hidden in a landscape.  
A gray and rabid sun rise  
is deluded in  
the room.  
  
Hated ones and women.  
For me they are minor.
