Here I Circumscribe You
-----------------------
You say, what is the horse waiting for in its blue necklace?  
I tell you it  
is waiting for soul like you.  
Lovely, chalk vein!  
Nothing but your delicate heart.  
With  
its oily preserve to seek lost lunars and for forests.  
Full stop.  
Full stop.  
Mingling the trouser of her salt full of tiredness.  
The breakfast knows this,  
that life in it's saphire boxes is as endless as the old warrior's medal.  
Exiled women and fishermen.  
For me they are aerial.  
And you flow like a tree and I drink as if in a morose legume.  
Great, wooden mirror!  
In my archipeligos at afternoon you are like a cathedral  
and your form and colour the way I flutter them.
