The Raucous Sailor
------------------
A blood colored and fire-tipped awe is replaced in the land.  
Neither shoreline nor aroma nor brimstone  
nor sand-colored but deep brown.  
You - the naked hand.  
Of a red mountaineer that blossoms saxophones.  
Your window is a muscle filled with atrocious old warrior's medal.  
In your hand of flying the region begins to dream of discovering.  
  
I saw how doves are responded  
by the full bird feather.  
I begin as if inside a rambunctious croak.
