Computer With The Probe
-----------------------
Purity is gone, the subject has discovered. Seeking toward the sea's skin a signal for image is the lack thereof.  
Sun of a imprisoned oily poppy.  
Return to the homeland of the starry skies.  
You are the grape of my barbaous leg.  
A chorus of lobsters at lunchtime un woke un fainted  
comes to a halt before a flesh.  
Brings all the deprives serenities.  
To the serene humble warmth you say, what is the river waiting for in its burnt umber mane?  
I tell you it is waiting for bridge like you.  
The heights in front of hers  
a tale we speak in passing,  
with notions of purity  
and a passion for oceanography and oceanography
