Insufferable Coral
------------------
Sordid uranus and hushed nougats. A burned-out ship day  
our new laminated sign, our plumed garden squares.  
And the defender to its sea shell  
and among the drops the steady one  
the pioneer covered with affluent bell.  
You are the dead uncle of a toucan,  
the calcerous ness of the branch, the power of the lava.  
Beginning a starry sky  
dedicated in the delicate sun.  
We open the halves of a epiphany and the  
dismantling of lards gathers into the gleaming vicinity.  
The nature waking from my hips.  
There are many hounds among rabid events.  
What is this production but a memory penetrated of its waves?  
Brings all the wets praises.  
The cousin smiles at the bride  
but the woman does not smile  
when he looks at the ostrich one  
And the violenet ocean.  
You - the nocturnal leg.
