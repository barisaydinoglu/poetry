Tell Her That I Am Giving Up Dawning In Signals
-----------------------------------------------
My heart moves from being tear stained to being aquatic.  
One of them is warm,  
the other knows phenomena.  
Where is everybody  
she cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
I am brainwashed by friendship and trap, by dung and drizzle.  
I wish to make a line segment  
next to, and every faith, many  
times hidden in a ripple.  
I took on acidulous maternities.  
Where quilts meet  
coats meet, amid and next to and the sound  
of depths, to reach out and live in illusion.  
Draw from it the delirious  
point of view of its own camera.  
A chorus of lobsters at early light of day un fashioned un impaled  
comes to a halt before a law.  
But I should be true to photography, trembling among  
its exiled sepia lakes  
so let us try to divulge a story without algorithmic redundancies.  
Within the transluscent yellow foot of the jungle.  
  
Amid cinnamon water and deep brown quilts.  
Trod and then enchanted in the modern office.
