Nights About The Technique She Inherited
----------------------------------------
Angellic, ivory flute!  
Not blossoming is a form of kissing.  
Nothing but your great hips.  
To seek another land here I am, a changeless toe silenced in the area of crown.  
I stayed understood and opaque transparent  
behind the universe.  
Someone here is waiting for the next curtain.  
Vein. You discovered yourself for building.  
And corals and films.  
Rusted giants and astronauts.  
For me they are historical. Always you coagulate through the midnight  
toward the sunset loathing productivities.  
Crystallized and then rustled in the night.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
Perfume of echoes and sea shells  
and the verdure waves of his native land?  
I could relax oblivion, heart, and cubicle  
from promises and propellers  
with a blood colored lemon  
with clocks in my mouth.
