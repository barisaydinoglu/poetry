Since The End
-------------
Wave of wave of acrobats rolling down the sea.  
It was the fortnight of the bird.  
Outside the shaken star, many mechanical depths.  
I saw how tigers are awakened  
by the esoteric essence.  
In the face of so many panics to positivity.  
Sometimes a piece of the mud  
dismantles  
like a ship in my foot.  
This delirious well and expanding wine bottle shatters me  
with it's blazing forests like finger and eyeballs  
and rust colored hearts like breath and movies.  
Always you loathe through the fortnight  
toward the early light of day abolishing necklaces.  
  
To the affluent color of the fused quartz saxophone.  
One individual option and a chorus of lobsters at early light of day un reflected un drowned  
comes to a halt before a saxophone.  
  
It was the fortnight of the lobster.  
A line segment inside a line segment,  
the furious workings of enduring law.  
It reconciles like a thread  
in the nature.  
My heart is filled with sincerity like a fused quartz defender.  
My serene brow protects you always.  
Sifted weather, barbaous lights like the leaf.
