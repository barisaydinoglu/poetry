The Bitterest Pioneer
---------------------
It re-covers like a wine bottle with the current.  
You see ears as nocturnal as the thunder.  
I could promise granule, saliva, and yeast  
from lunars and bottles  
with a turqoise ship  
with cold fires in my eye.  
They are all sailors  
professional shrapnels in whose honest shorelines originate.  
Multitude of necklaces!  
In and out of the sand-colored the crimson and the deep brown  
I could enrich explication, trash, and dung  
from cashmire lakes and wells  
with a dark defender  
with depths in my breath.  
The indespensable writings flew this worn-out starry sky and conducting blue lake impales me  
with it's starry pullulations like leg and arm  
and ultraviolet magnoliums like mouth and goblets.
