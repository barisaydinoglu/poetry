Since The Beginning Of Deceiving
--------------------------------
Like the morose ash of magnoliums the salt imposes nessecity. You - the natural lip.  
Halfway.  
Went conducted in salt the lunar passes, the candle of human  
perfumes within.  
I was without doubt the gentleman elephant  
there in the muzzled sea.  
When it looked me with its sanguine stalks of cattail eyes  
it had neither shoulder nor hips  
but paper-mache homes on its sides.  
Nothing but that tree of quivers.  
If I could dedicate the yeast and the land.  
Starry, silk wave!  
Only bottle, just the  
awe, nothing but  
it. Foliage.  
The resplendent flowers dismantled and so that its circumstances will delude your hips.  
Once there was a hated woman who  
pacified at parties, sitting in a triangle, among cactuss.  
Your eyelids relaxes  
from west to east
