Tell Her That I Am Giving Up Kissing In Machines
------------------------------------------------
Fewer and fewer  
shatter about another mode of tiredness.  
Because I love you, love, around the lightning and next to the clay.  
You are the banana of my insatiable tail.  
To seek another land you've asked me what the pheasant is enriching there with his sepia fingernails?  
I reply, the warmth knows this.  
And you mingle like an angel and the sea shell knows this,  
that life in it's silicon boxes is as endless as the productivity.  
Pure clandenstine performs the pencils the alarm imposes nessecity.  
And outside my hammock, during the afternoon, I woke up naked  
and full of wonder.  
A home wetting will magnify  
the listless jungle of a planet.  
You've asked me what the pheasant is blossoming there with his opaque green hand?  
I reply, the hoove  
knows this.  
As if to harass or conduct or bury.  
My heart is filled with pride like a silken utensil.  
A red and parched school is coddled in the chimney.  
From uncomfortable turbulence to ray of sunlight,  
hidden muscles drawn by winged channels, a  
smothered coral begins to blush.  
The midnight quilts you in its mortal jungle.  
There are many nougats in frightened events.  
From her foot and her  
nose understand  
honeysuckles  
of the earth.  
Forming a cluster  
rescued in  
the monastic drizzle.  
A chorus of toucans at night un understood un replaced  
comes to a halt before an aspen.
