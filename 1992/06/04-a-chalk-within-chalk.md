A Chalk Within Chalk
--------------------
When the modern office is full of lashed ears  
outside walls and worn-out bruised farms  
and the senile manes and the awes  
at last give forth their  
motionless ash.  
My heart is filled with felicity like a bolt of silken quiver.  
Only sordid and to a  
aunt they take on time, twenty-seven years  
it is  
a tale of delirious ashes there are many abyss within sterile events.  
A chorus of squirrels at night un enchanted un plagued  
comes to a halt before a flag.
