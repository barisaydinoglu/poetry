Production In The Aerial Services
---------------------------------
In my jungle at sunrise you are like a dew  
and your form and  
colour the way I divulge them.  
A eyeballs and a mouth  
transforming the night.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another. I could grow cadaver, throat, and evil  
from sand-colored lakes and pullulations  
with a rust colored root  
with blades in my hips.
