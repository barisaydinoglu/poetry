Since The Beginning Of Lunging
------------------------------
An odor has dawned under the root,  
a mixture of beast and body, a flowing  
root that brings agony.  
But the muscle excited the memory.  
Under the acidulous city of sticky bed.  
But I should be untrue to jouranlism, entangling among its rustling suns  
so let us try to speak a story without aerial redundancies.  
Crimson and monastic mountaineer,  
They are all pioneers  
professional cubicles in whose poetic landscapes originate.  
A quadrangle within a quadrangle,  
the cheerless workings of verdure law.  
Congeal me and let my substance fly.  
Transparent lava to my hushed fountain!  
  
If I could enrich the night and the universe.  
Carry me onto your helicopter  
- the fruit of my stalks of cattail -  
around the divisions I like to magnify like a thirsty lake.  
Behind the cinnamon heart of the heat.
