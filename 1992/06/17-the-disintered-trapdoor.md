The Disintered Trapdoor
-----------------------
To imbue lost jars and for wells.  
A language transforms,  
lunges - it does not return.  
An odor has connected behind the horse,  
a mixture of death and body, a recovering  
atom that brings fear.  
To the human indespensable stars in the sky it carries like a flag behind the flag.  
Halfway.  
The resolute dignity of the land!  
In your arm of confusion the divisions of utensils kiss.  
Jar.  
Drown me and let my substance gallop.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.
