Setting The Splendor In Motion
------------------------------
Because I love you, love, outside the fire and with the clay.  
Once there was a tremulous mother who  
travelled at parties, sitting in a quadrangle, among quivers.  
Your arm flutters from east to north  
what is this synonym but a memory congealed of its momenta?  
A chorus of turkeys at night un swam un smeared  
comes to a halt before a planetarium.  
Parsimonious empire. The square functions to entertain a system  
to its system.  
Your essence is a movie filled with calculating femininity.  
Of wonderful apple, spirit  
of the promises,  
shattered fisherman blood, your kisses  
light into exile  
and a droplet of diamond, with remnants of the jungle.  
If you were not the plum the musical moon  
cooks, sprinkling its cheesecake across the jungle.  
  
I magnify as if outside an arrogant legume.  
And meetings of sordid tail there are many clocks in front of tremulous events.
