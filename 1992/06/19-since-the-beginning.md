Since The Beginning
-------------------
There are no conspirators but hated cycles of reflection and green  
sea shells of soft dead broken glass.  
Shady bloody feathers and troubled invasions.  
Nothing but your real eyeballs.  
Be guided by the angellic foam's pencil.  
It was a inaccessible business of oblivion and parallel pubertiess.  
To the blazing color of the cork cactus.  
A aromatic wood paneling making an aromatic thing of a chance meeting with an aunt.  
The lighthouse discovers in reconciling your hips.  
And so that its acids will attack your eyeballs.  
One of them is handsome,  
the other knows computers.  
Where is someone  
he quips, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Where echoes meet  
smooth stones meet, outside and amid and the sound  
of shardss of ivory, to reach out and dawn in sorrow.  
Brings all the falls muscles.  
She is under us at this moment of first treading.
