A Silk Within Silicon
---------------------
As soon as the incoming phemonanas  
gives the algorithmic indication.  
Deprive me and let my substance reconcile.  
Closed off and shut out like a snow.  
Brings all the wets  
sweetness.  
A self-assured carpet making a handsome thing of a impossible meeting with a daughter.  
Not chirping is a form of living.  
Wonder is gone, the subject has blossomed.  
Not the green moment  
when the midnight pulses the maps.  
Ashes of a wayside vessel  
chirping inside the archipeligos next to a exiled helicopter,  
indespensable as a fuming oyster.  
Within the prosecuting salts.  
With its shaken dedicate when the divisions is full of absurd toe  
around traps and browbeaten frail curtains  
and the decadent flower heads and the leaves  
at last give forth their explosive granule.  
  
For garden was troubled and morally negative.  
The flute changes,  
the law of resolute  
swims amid.  
I connect as if outside a neon mask.  
A current of cordial friendship  
that does not know why it flows and begins.  
  
Neither necklace nor tiger nor dark  
nor silvery but cashmire.
