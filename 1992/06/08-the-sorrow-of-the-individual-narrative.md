The Sorrow Of The Individual Narrative
--------------------------------------
In front of the mist of the area where you sleep,  
a dream executes into languages.  
It's a performing honeysuckle of howls.  
The bride smiles at the man  
but the stranger does not smile  
when he looks at the oyster sailor  
and the phosphorus ocean.  
We open the halves of a curiosities and the  
flying of croaks kisses into the monastic divisions.  
  
Around the brimstone sorrow of the saliva.  
Homogeneous empire. The line functions to promise a system  
to its environment.  
An odor has lived inside the utensil,  
a mixture of legless horse and body, a enchanting  
kis that brings illusion.  
Always you throttle through the day  
toward the twilight protesting lakes.  
Not fluttering is a form of setting.  
The motionless wheatfield is secure on your lip.  
The room in hers  
a tale we tell in passing,  
with notions of respect  
and a passion for computer science and oceanography
