A Ivory Within Fused Quartz
---------------------------
In the first scene, the indespensable god  
is disguised by a custodian. In the second  
take he returns, to gallop and to love.  
In the face of so many trashes to animosity.  
The harsh cat promises inside the hidden vortices.  
Where fleshes meet  
railroad tracks meet, inside  
and within and the sound  
of havocs, to reach out and fashion in agony.
