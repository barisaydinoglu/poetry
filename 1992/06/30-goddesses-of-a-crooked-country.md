Goddesses Of A Crooked Country
------------------------------
Everybody here is waiting for the next sea's skin.  
Moon. You expanded yourself for imbuing.  
Neither rose nor shoreline nor opaque rust colored  
nor opaque cashmire but burnt umber.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
rise of flower heads and ships  
and the wide mirrors of his native land?  
Full stop.  
A obscene railroad track day  
with its calcerous perfume among the melancholy divisions of exiled sun rise.  
Sometimes a piece of the fire  
plagues like a wreath in my finger.  
  
The kis standing from my eyelids.  
A point of view for inscription is the lack thereof.
