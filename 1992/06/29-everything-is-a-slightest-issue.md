Everything Is A Slightest Issue
-------------------------------
To swim lost ribbons and for foliages. Gentleman of the depths of my brain - your blossoming  
stills your absorbant regard as though it were fire.  
I want you to discover on my heart.  
  
You say, what is the ribbon waiting for in its cinnamon fountain?  
I tell you it is waiting for cluster like you.  
One of them is balanced,  
the other knows points of view.  
Where is somebody  
he says, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?
