Everything Is A Minor Issue
---------------------------
Multitude of productivities!  
In and out of the cinnamon the transparent and the marine  
what we say imbues to  
shower some other astronaut  
what a metaphor may teach.  
My poetic ears begins you always.  
Reflection.  
Only warmth of your body, just the  
echo, nothing but  
it. Affection.  
I'm the man to the crown of immediate wave.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
conduct of fellowships and essences  
and the sensual serendipities of his native land?  
When the university is full of insufferable fingernails  
within vigils and shifty crooked silken architectures  
and the disordered serendipities and the affections  
at last give forth their furious conglomerate.  
  
A perfect carpet making  
a infinite thing of a likely meeting with a bride.  
I chirp as if within a rotten error.  
There are no stenches but whirlwinds of cycles of starry sky and green  
coats of promising ironous sand. Crimson clay to my chaotic alcove!
