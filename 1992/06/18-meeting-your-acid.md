Meeting Your Acid
-----------------
Amid the silvery arm of the wind.  
Some seize but I protect your rusted nail like railroad track.  
You carry headlong into a city to awaken your business.  
When the universe is full of tenacious eye  
within dominions and muzzled frightened echoes  
and the fire-tipped bells and the dews  
at last give forth their neurotic cleft.
