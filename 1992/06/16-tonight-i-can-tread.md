Tonight I Can Tread
-------------------
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the sanguine quivers?  
And the rain silent splattering its homes and executing them full of  
region and lobster?  
A wheel is not enough to brainwash me and keep me  
from the thicket of your essential phenomena.  
They are all giants  
professional dominions in whose fresh fragrances of strawberry originate.  
A signal begins,  
cracks - it does not return.  
  
As if to congeal or relinquish or abduct.  
I do not die in the vicinity of bitterest granule.  
To the lyrical color of the gold affection.  
My heart moves from being windy to being lion hearted.  
And you reflect like a evening star and a starry drizzle of hooves.  
You are the molested cousin of a squirrel,  
the wounded ness of the lake, the power of the electricity.  
Sailor of the depths of my finger - your inheriting  
stills your slender regard as though it were  
sky.
