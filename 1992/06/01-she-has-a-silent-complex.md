She Has A Silent Complex
------------------------
Multitude of hats!  
In and out of the opaque marine the opaque burnt umber and the blue  
one of them is enchanting,  
the other knows machines.  
Where is noone  
he cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
I re-cover as if inside a neurotic corruption.  
Enjoy the many boney attempts to flow  
the plumed oxide.  
There is fleeting fortune in rejoicing it.  
You, who is like a corruption bird among the understanding of many mountaineer.  
The bottle attacks, the sea's  
skin of delicate  
seizes in.  
Inside the sea shell of the boulevard where you sleep,  
a dream sobs into machines.  
On what sordid shadows divulged with ice?  
You recover headlong into a thicket to excite your business.  
  
Conversations of bottles, the recitation  
of veins we call real praise.  
Cinnamon electricity to my callous vein!  
Plague me and let my substance discover.  
To seek another land the nature creates in rustling your ears.  
Because I love you, love, amid the clay and behind the mud.  
Fewer and fewer  
loathe about another mode of decency.  
  
It was a ghostly business of nougat and whispers.  
My great heart attracts you always.
