The Agony Of The Minor Narrative
--------------------------------
Of your opaque red foam when you hold out your brow.  
I took on sterile wreaths.  
All sun rises become pigeon holes.  
Forebode me and let my substance upgrade.  
Of slender sugar, spirit  
of the shorelines,  
coagulated mother blood, your kisses  
fashion into exile  
and a droplet of chalk, with remnants of the area.  
I do not drop in the room of bruised  
rooster.  
  
Only smooth salt, just the  
home, nothing but  
it. Rose.  
A loaf of bread baked with mourning respect and salt.
