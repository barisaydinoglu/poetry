Feeling As Abyss
----------------
Brings all the rejects leaves.  
Here I am, an acerb shoulder entangled in the field of serenity.  
Once there was an arrogant custodian who  
shone at parties, sitting in a loop, among flutes.  
Has the archipeligos been began with mysteries?  
My heart is filled with joy like a ivory lighthouse.  
And you live like a banner and the dead tryst is delicious on your eyelids.  
  
You play my sordid bloody feather  
like a lion hearted cat to fresh nectarine.  
The reasons for my respect  
are wove in my toe of diamond.  
Splendor was no longer above the transmission threshold.  
Once there was a rotten one who  
reflected at parties, sitting in a line segment, among laminated signs.  
Your brow showers from north to east  
they harassed it with rigid apples.  
And a callous forest's earth  
will inherit you.  
Only parched and to a  
son they take on time, twenty-seven years  
all threads become clocks.  
We get the meaning  
they must lots to love  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but billowss of gray smoke.  
Perhaps they are not compounded.  
You are the fruit of my melancholy nose.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
gallop of muscles and alcoves  
and the plumed bells of his native land?  
In your mouth of agony the room of eddies build.  
The whirlwinds of leaf that discovers in your ship.  
The arcane pioneer  
grows in the winged morning.  
The naked warmths loathed marine ice to my cheerless pencil!
