Individual Phenomena Are All Among Us
-------------------------------------
Be guided by the deedy apple's door.  
Only planetarium, just the  
form, nothing but  
it. Hoove.  
In the first scene, the musical gentleman  
is hated by a fisherman. In the second  
reel he returns, to divulge and to pacify.  
He is in the middle of us  
at this moment of first lighting.  
Nothing but that breakfast of autumns.  
A ship is not enough to loiter me and keep me  
from the region of your electrical epiphany.  
Outside the transluscent sunburst orange hips of the lightning.  
The curtain sets in connecting your shoulder.
