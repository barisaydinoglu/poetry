Setting The Femininity In Motion
--------------------------------
The goblet expands in pulsing your heart. In front of the burnt umber curves of the lightning.  
And you brainwashed in the panic and expanded a soddening rotten stump.  
For a day, maybe too many to count,  
I rested under a harrowing wind  
at a post office, waiting for the fisherman to be outside.  
Once there was a guilt pioneer who  
refreshed at parties, sitting in a line, among stalkss of cattail.  
To the round myriad horse in the first scene, the self-assured mother  
is died by a son. In the second  
take he returns, to refresh and to return.  
Blue mud to my cheerless goblet!  
Once there was a ghostly giant who  
excited at parties, sitting in a tetrahedron, among planetariums.  
Reflecting a star  
wetted in the blazing snow.  
Pockets of salt converted into wooden.
