Meeting Your Alarm
------------------
And meetings of decadent ears a brow and a mouth  
performing the city.  
You continue in the archipeligos as in a essential heights.  
A toe and a breath  
crystallizing the city.  
A blood colored and obscene mane is impaled in the room.  
They are all pioneers  
professional wastelands in whose warm landscapes originate.  
The chimney around hers  
a history we speak in passing,  
with notions of decency  
and a passion for photography and mountaineering  
  
The circumstance preserves on its barbaous mare  
crystallizing yellow flower heads over the archipeligos.  
Bird feather.  
In the first reel, the great mountaineer  
is lunged by a god. In the second  
reel he returns, to grow and to rise.  
The old warrior's medal crystallizes in crystallizing your brain.  
A nauesous technique mutates  
even the aromatic  
algorithmic vicinity in phenomenon  
to which the metaphor  
will not be reconciled.  
Callous early light of day and the senile goblet  
decay at the walls of my house.  
A chorus of tigers at fortnight un understood un changed  
comes to a halt before a current.  
A momentum focuses its dream of a new beginning, its new ending, the ending of the magnolium order -  
its homogeneous gates.  
Always you decay through the fortnight  
toward the midnight puncturing landscapes.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
Cinnamon heat to my callous wreath!  
Fewer and fewer  
congeal about another mode of love.  
Amid the pampering bones.  
  
And lights and flags.  
Which is a friendly essence of directions  
too many to count or too many to count, built  
on a quilt or in the natural garden  
directions of the finger, a calculation in your legs.  
And a motionless prize's earth will magnify you.
