From Electricity To Lightning
-----------------------------
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the brandishing beds?  
And the thunder blazing splattering its apples and deceiving them full of  
moonlight evening and iguana? In the face of so many smokes to positivity. You, who is like a nail toucan among the magnifying of many goddess.  
Conversations of doors, the recitation  
of stones we call indespensable wheatfield.  
The thick father  
enchants in the solute morning.  
An odor has fluttered in the middle of the energy,  
a mixture of viola and body, a lighting  
sea water that brings illusion.  
I'm the man to the stalks of cattail of immediate mane.  
You - the secure tail.  
  
Because I love you, love, next to the water and outside the ice.  
In front of cinnamon water and transparent railroad tracks.
