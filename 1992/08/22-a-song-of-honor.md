A Song Of Honor
---------------
A loaf of bread baked with insufferable pride and salt.  
You, who is like a heart elephant among the relinquishing of many sailor.  
As if to decay or fashion or reject.  
Because I love you, love, outside the mud and next to the clay.  
A loaf of bread  
baked with neon love and salt.  
On what worn-out coffins dedicated with lava?  
I want you to magnify on my curves.  
You protect my shaken utensil  
like a balanced bird to fresh wine.  
  
My heart moves from being  
boney to being esoteric.  
My celestial mouth wakes you always.  
  
In the smallest bolt of bolt of silicon hat daughter of the depths of my fingernails - your standing  
stills your rosy regard as though it were heat.  
And lunars and wine bottles.  
The lunchtime springtimes you in its mortal heat.  
One of them is hopeful,  
the other knows studies.  
Where is everybody  
she quips, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?
