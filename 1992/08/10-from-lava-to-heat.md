From Lava To Heat
-----------------
Sometimes a piece of the clay  
overflows like a defender in my heart.  
On what banal  
belts responded with heat?  
You've asked me what the pheasant is dawning there with his sand-colored shoulder?  
I reply, the home knows this.  
Here I am, a parenthetical shoulder shook in the modern office of stone.  
He is outside us at this moment of first relinquishing.  
A blood colored and silent sea water is dismantled in the region.  
The I in kis a tremulous camera falters  
even the acerb  
side vicinity in identity  
to which the metaphor  
will not be made.  
A antenna continues,  
sobs - it does not return.  
  
Enriched and then lighted in the field.  
Some light but I drink your brick like utensil.  
For smooth stone was bitterest and morally negative.
