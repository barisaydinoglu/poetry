In Individual Understanding - Techniques And Photography
--------------------------------------------------------
The comfortable dignity of the moon!  
I wish to make a triangle  
with, and every faith, many  
times hidden in an angel.  
My heart moves from being silent to being balanced.  
Disordered nights and atrocious ghosts.  
My domestic foot grows you always.  
I am dropped by fellowship and serection, by gate and rain.  
The cathedral plan that has everyone pale.  
Wipe me and let my substance grow.  
You are the dead father of a ostrich,  
the rigid ness of the perfume, the power of the fire.  
Of a brimstone bride that attracts momenta.  
The I in reflection among the rabid cathedral, many wayside oxides.  
Iridescent empire. The loop functions to preserve an architecture  
to its architecture.
