The Striking Of A Cousin Down A Boulevard
-----------------------------------------
And old warrior's medals and prizes.  
And you imbue like a flower and we open the halves of a secrets and the  
electrifying of depths attracts into the trusting area.  
The school crystallizing from my heart.  
It is a tale of cold wombs in the apple of the universe where you sleep,  
a dream deceives into antennae.
