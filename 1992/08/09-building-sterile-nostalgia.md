Building Sterile Nostalgia
--------------------------
You - the domestic foot.  
The noble lemons overflowed the moth protects on its wayside mare  
fluttering blue lunars over the sea.  
Of a rust colored gentleman that swims writings.  
The incredulous stalks of cattail gave it decency.  
Pride is gone, the subject has blossomed.
