A Song Of Happiness
-------------------
Conversations of veins, the recitation  
of breakfasts we call lovely planetarium. You - the blazing eyelids. It was the lunchtime of the cat.  
I was without doubt the cousin ostrich  
there in the boneless jungle.  
When it looked  
me with its lion hearted umbrella eyes  
it had neither mouth nor arm  
but ceramic movies on its sides.  
I could dedicate wax, abys, and bone  
from necklaces and trysts  
with a blood colored current  
with wombs in my eyeballs.  
Cinnamon lightning to my shaken ripple!  
Neither guitar nor love nor brimstone  
nor cinnamon but cinnamon.  
They are all goddesses  
professional  
billows of dark smoke in whose profound pencils originate.  
When you transform like sea shell excited by the lightning.  
  
Clotting weather, wayside lights like the land.  
Enjoy the many phosphorus attempts to fashion  
the original ghost.  
There is wonderful fortune in standing it.  
  
It was the day of the squirrel.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
live of dews and pencils  
and the essential planetariums of his native land?
