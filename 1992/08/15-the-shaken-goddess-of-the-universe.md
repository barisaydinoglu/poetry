The Shaken Goddess Of The Universe
----------------------------------
A coat focuses its dream of a new beginning, its beginning, the old ending of the breakfast order -  
its aquatic howls.  
Refreshing from tremulous cedar.  
Bitterest fortnight and the torrential mirror  
gnaw at the walls of my house.  
My full hips imbues you always.
