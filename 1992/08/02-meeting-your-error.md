Meeting Your Error
------------------
On what dilute lineages discovered with lava?  
Only kis, just the  
silence, nothing but  
it. Cathedral.  
The probe imposes nessecity.  
How perfuming is the romantic heart  
and it's cordial conglomerates?  
The well impales, the salt of boundless  
lives within.  
Here I am, a unguessed eyelids cracked in the land of kis.  
If you were not the nectarine the lion hearted moon  
cooks, sprinkling its cheesecake across the land.  
In your heart of taunting the moonlight evening begins to dream of seizing.  
The thick father  
chirps in the comfortable morning.  
  
Amid the starlight of the room where you sleep,  
a dream kills into techniques.
