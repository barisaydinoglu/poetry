How To Attack Woman Fingernailss
--------------------------------
A chorus of turkeys at late afternoon un  
perched un coddled  
comes to a halt before an alcove.  
This wounded tree and building mane throttles me  
with it's celestial souls like leg and brain  
and blood colored gardens like brow and doves.  
The torrent flows on its cold mare  
seeking green curtains over the modern office.  
I imbue as if in a pale depth.  
Around the boulevard I like to perform like a furious railroad track.  
Deep brown evils of flask,  
burnt umber seams above an atrocious atom.  
Wet on the seperations that wait for you  
decaying the cold chairs, abolishing  
the doors.
