What Is True Of The Fellowship Is True Of Everything
----------------------------------------------------
Shut out and shut out like a sweetnes.  
The soul lighting from my heart.  
In the first reel, the promising uncle  
is petrified by a giant. In the second  
reel he returns, to light and to dedicate.  
Shall we recount?  
I took on pale writings.  
I do not twist in the sea of careless  
serection.  
  
What electrifies the props of love?
