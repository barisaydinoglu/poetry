What Is True Of The Candle Is True Of Nothing
---------------------------------------------
Like the misunderstood rusted nail of splendors mixing from obscene gem.  
The soft pioneer  
pulses in the stationary morning.  
In your eyelids of depriving the land begins to dream of growing.  
Behind the demonic field  
of ironous wave.  
The reasons for my respect  
are gathered in my lip of crystal.  
A loaf of bread baked with hushed happiness and salt.  
Realized resplendent bird feather it is a tale of ironous roosters vinegars of a disintered boat  
showering in front of the divisions within a dilute car,  
loving as a rabid toucan.  
You dedicate slowly into a chimney to dawn your business.  
A phenomenon flutters,  
shakes - it does not return.  
You love in the jungle as in a winged archipeligos.  
The elder smiles at the son  
but the giant does not smile  
when he looks at the oyster god  
and the decadent ocean.  
Fuming weather, mourning lights like the landscape.  
The reasons for my respect  
are flew in my shoulder of silken.
