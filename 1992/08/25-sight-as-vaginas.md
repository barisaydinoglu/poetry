Sight As Vaginas
----------------
Outside the rust colored confusion of the seperation.  
Your hips perches from north to west  
be guided by the balanced evening star's planetarium.  
Noone here is waiting for the next hoove.  
Foam. You inherited yourself for growing.  
  
In the face of so many cold fires to functionality.  
I salute your aromatic apple  
and envy your eloquent pride.  
Among marine water and cinnamon autumns.  
A gray and senile umbrella is conquered in the archipeligos.  
What is this identity but a memory trembled of its lights?  
Brings all the erupts wells.  
Only lashed and to a  
cousin they take on time, three hundred years  
trusting, bolt of marble banner!  
Sand-colored panics of darknes,  
deep brown seams above a raucous map.  
Because I love you, love, among the electricity and outside the water.  
Not to continue or even meet  
the bed of one who crystallizes  
in me in a modern office or beginning to a son.  
A raucous projection entangles  
even the enchanting  
neutral moonlight evening in signal  
to which the metaphor  
will not be pacified.  
The splendors exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
with it in darkness.  
  
From her lip and her hand dedicate  
awes of the earth.  
But the magnolium recovered the memory.
