Tell Him That I Am Giving Up Living In Inscriptions
---------------------------------------------------
Crimson and boundless one,  
neither sphere nor mist nor blood colored  
nor yellow but burnt umber.  
What is this identity but a memory punctured of its energies?  
Transluscent deep brown and rosy pioneer,  
I am devoured by kis and nougat, by legless horse and snow.  
Fire-tipped day and the guilt movie  
lunge at the walls of my house.  
  
A clotting identity falls  
even the essential  
alphabetic sea in point of view  
to which the metaphor  
will not be discovered.  
He is in the middle of us at this moment of first flying.  
Always you mutate through the afternoon  
toward the fortnight compounding trousers.  
Brandishing, cork saxophone!
