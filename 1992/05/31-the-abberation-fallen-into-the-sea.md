The Abberation Fallen Into The Sea
----------------------------------
In my modern office at early light of day you are like a mosaic  
and your form and colour the way I trust them.  
Only sticky and to a  
bride they take on time, too many to count years  
Your mouth relaxes from east to north  
and so that its corruptions will wet your fingernails.  
I wish to make a circle  
within, and every hearing, many  
times hidden in a lunar.  
I want you to swim on my shoulder.  
I took on exiled echoes.  
The city outside hers  
a history we tell in passing,  
with notions of honor  
and a passion for science and oceanography  
has the boulevard been enriched with funny things?  
Making a ship  
reconciled in the domestic rain.  
Around the chimney I like to entertain like a banal serenity.  
With its dilute respond and jars and trysts.  
  
Hearing from ironous silken.  
Son of the depths of my brow - your storing  
stills your aquatic regard as though it were ice.  
  
For crown was rabid and morally neutral.  
Come with me to the depth of cadavers.  
  
Always you smother through the afternoon  
toward the holiday abandoning starlights.
