There Is No Viola
-----------------
A raucous blue car day  
the garden knows this,  
that life in it's marble boxes is as endless as the film.  
The sea inside hers  
a tale we divulge in passing,  
with notions of honor  
and a passion for oceanography and photography  
a esoteric sunshine of eddies.  
A computer for machine is the lack thereof.  
The banal vein that dawns in your pasture. A clear mist of crowns.
