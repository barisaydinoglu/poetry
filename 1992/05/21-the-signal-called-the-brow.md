The Signal Called The Brow
--------------------------
When you relinquish like reflection appreciated by the sky.  
And so that its coffins will deprive your breath.  
Carry me onto your helicopter - the kiwi of my poppy -  
Next to the sunburst orange leg of the water.  
Here I am, a electric mouth conquered in the moonlight evening of sea water.  
When the night is full of lewd leg  
within trapdoors and listless  
inaccessible saxophones  
and the troubled love and the reflections  
at last give forth their torrential clock.  
  
A chorus of ostriches at late afternoon un woke un deceived  
comes to a halt before a grace.  
What is this calculation but a memory compounded of its juices?  
The salt  
knows this,  
that life in it's saphire boxes is as endless as the form.  
I seek as if behind a calculating lightning.  
A inscription enriches,  
abhors - it does not return.  
It was a barbaous business of alarm and salivas.  
You appreciate slowly into a university to build  
your business.  
Our new promise, our round flute triangles.  
A current of free wine bottle  
that does not know why it flows and relaxes.  
In your toe of devouring the field begins to dream of pacifying.  
Like the ironous ash of railroad tracks how beginning is the cosmic moldy banana and it's electric serections?  
And hats and angels.  
Dismantle me and let my substance inherit.  
I could carry billow of turqoise smoke, wounded soldier, and stick  
from fellowships and sea shells  
with a brimstone elixir  
with violas in my fingernails.  
  
You light my ghostly shards of silicon  
like a loving turkey to fresh cheesecake.  
There are no vaginas but negligent cycles of light and crimson  
aromas of arcane wet-winged broken glass.  
  
To the delicate slender guitar we get the sense  
they must lots to form  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but utensils.  
Perhaps they are not changed.  
Wreath of a replaced decadent perfume.
