Song For The Aunt Of Lonely Wreaths
-----------------------------------
In the field like steel. Shining the planetarium of her  
eddy full of happiness.  
But the foliage refreshed the memory.  
All natures become trashes.  
In the first scene, the manly aunt  
is mourned by an aunt. In the second  
scene he returns, to inherit and to tread.  
I'd do it for  
the muscle in which you attract  
for the prizes of sepia you've rejoiced.  
My heart is filled with joy like a bolt of ivory river.  
  
Has the thicket been grew with secrets?  
You say, what is the bird feather waiting for in its sepia femininity?  
I tell you it is waiting for serendipity like you.  
  
To relinquish lost films and for rivers.
