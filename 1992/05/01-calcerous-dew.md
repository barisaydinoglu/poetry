Calcerous Dew
-------------
I wish to make a square  
outside, and every hearing, many  
times hidden in a horse.  
To the ancient color of the copper knave.  
Enriching a farm  
recovered in the deedy mist. Your finger makes from east to east  
a pencil -like enemy  
it was the midnight of the cat.  
The early light of day crimson cars you in its mortal heat.  
I dawn as if within a skeleton billow of brimstone smoke.  
  
It was the early light of day of the oyster.
