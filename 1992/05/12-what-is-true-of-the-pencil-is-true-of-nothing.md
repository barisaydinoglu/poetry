What Is True Of The Pencil Is True Of Nothing
---------------------------------------------
I am mutated by form and billows of gray smoke, by uranu and snow. A fragrance of strawberry focuses its dream of a ending, its beginning, the ending of the ritual order -  
its handsome abyss. Shall we keep going?  
And a bruised smooth graphite's clay will dawn you.  
The river building from my tail.  
Showering toward the movie not pacifying is a form of inheriting.  
Indicates the sun rise's circumscribing leg.  
And a fuming river bank's water will light you.  
Tree.
