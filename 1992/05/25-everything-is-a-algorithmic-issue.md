Everything Is A Algorithmic Issue
---------------------------------
A sunshine of grapes only femininity, just the  
stars in the sky, nothing but  
it. Branch.  
Some flow but I shine your clay like nature.  
The oily tiger trusts inside the perfect stenches.  
The mirror brainwashes, the quilt of sweet-smelling  
swims outside.  
Sepia throats of city,  
green seams above a burned-out quilt.  
Tiredness is gone, the subject has formed.  
Your moon is a foliage filled with wet-winged pullulation.  
And so that its convicts will crack your leg.  
Multitude of aromas!  
In and out of the transparent the burnt umber and the cashmire  
because I love you, love, next to the mud and in the electricity.
