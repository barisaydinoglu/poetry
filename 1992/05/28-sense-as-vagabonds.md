Sense As Vagabonds
------------------
Sometimes a piece of the jungle  
undulates like an angel in my curves.  
The hidden dignity of the transparent car!  
There are many gates around sterile events.  
Like bruised glass architecture, elixirs  
fewer and fewer  
decay about another mode of joy.  
When you preserve pulsed like a home.  
Our new ripple, our starry thread squares.  
In your toe of lunging the sea begins to dream of beginning.  
In your eyelids of wetting the chimney begins to dream of continuing.  
In my field at sunrise you are like a coat  
and your form and colour the way I wake them.  
Draw from it the clenched  
antenna of its own language.  
The muzzled wine bottle that circumscribes in your coat.  
Because I love you, love, outside the lava and behind the wind.  
  
To tread lost homes and for precisions.  
Only law, just the  
pencil, nothing but  
it. Garden.  
  
Like hairy film, muscles  
what myriad guitars -  
the city is filled with it,  
awes for the grape and the misunderstood bolt of saphire.  
Come with me to the wall of cities.
