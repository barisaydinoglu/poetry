There Is No Nougat
------------------
We open the halves of a curiosities and the  
depriving of thorn trees magnifies into the clear sea.  
Around the land I like to refresh like a careless farm.  
It is a tale of calculating violas  
yellow and equinoctial fisherman,  
your finger expands from east to east  
Shut out and closed off like an autumn.  
The eager  
dignity of the thread!  
The stalks of cattail changes, the light of unguessed  
flies behind.  
With its imperalist rejoice it is a tale of phosphorus scandalmongerings you've asked me what the crab is recovering there with his sand-colored toe?  
I reply, the window knows this.  
They loitered it with fire-tipped graces.  
Everything fuming with delicious voices, the salt of the knave  
and piles of starry bread next to late afternoon.  
Draw from it the fire-tipped  
production of its own technique.  
Because I love you, love, in the ice and within the jungle.
