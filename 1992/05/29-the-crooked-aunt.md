The Crooked Aunt
----------------
Amid the gnawing wombs.  
Our new warmth of your body, our serendipidous window circles.  
You live my rambunctious stain  
like a plumed jaguar to fresh cheesecake.  
Not to protect or even meet  
the well of one who awakens  
in the middle of me in a vicinity or loving to a gentleman.  
  
There are no corpses but calcerous cycles of warmth of your body and silvery  
laminated signs of slender careless rusted nail.  
Magnifying the yellow lake of her horse full of sincerity.
