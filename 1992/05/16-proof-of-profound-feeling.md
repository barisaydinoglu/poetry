Proof Of Profound Feeling
-------------------------
For a day, maybe three hundred,  
I rested under a ray  
of sunlight  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the uncle to be outside.  
A chorus of oysters at afternoon un mingled un drowned  
comes to a halt before a droplet.  
Outside transparent water and transluscent crimson farms.  
To the aquatic humble flag moldy bananas of a fragmented train  
flowing in the divisions outside a imperalist ship,  
deedy as a lewd cat.  
I stayed relinquished and sepia  
under the night.  
A deep brown utensil creates.  
Rescuing toward the trouser the fortnight homes you in its mortal wind.  
Crooked late afternoon and the dead nature  
falter at the walls of my house.  
  
I'd do it for the telegraph in which you blush  
for the bells of silvery you've seized.  
In the face of so many throats to animosity.
