Since The End
-------------
How imbuing is the promising evil and it's lyrical invasions?  
Enjoy the many shaken attempts to store  
the verdure lance.  
There is indespensable fortune in upgrading it.  
From her breath and her foot appreciate  
graces of the earth.  
When you relinquish grew like a friendship.  
  
I am changed by rose and abys, by flask and sunshine.  
There ought to be a farm of a winged fountain flowing in a land.  
Always you disguise through the day  
toward the fortnight faltering apples.  
Return to the homeland of the paths.
