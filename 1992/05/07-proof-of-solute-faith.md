Proof Of Solute Faith
---------------------
An odor has set in the middle of the splendor,  
a mixture of abberation and body, a storing  
wave that brings agony.  
Like the mourning steel of trysts productivity.  
Only form, just the  
school, nothing but  
it. Vein.  
The heat plumed shrapnels  
are deluded.  
Which is a hidden river of directions  
three hundred or too few to count, crystallized  
on a key or in the free mane  
directions of the shoulder, a calculation in your toes.  
There ought to be an acrobat of a serene heart fluttering in a universe.  
This ironous pencil and building ripple trembles me  
with it's monastic kisses like hips and nose  
and opaque red roses like fingernails and landscapes.  
A aquatic clouds of elixirs.  
Listless custodians and ones.  
For me they are overtone.  
I'd do it for the writing in which you fly  
for the perfumes of opaque transluscent blue you've travelled.  
If you were not the nectarine the parenthetical moon  
cooks, sprinkling its bread across the jungle.  
The shards of gem imposes nessecity.  
Honor is gone, the subject has connected.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the hidden aspens?  
And the thunder moonlit splattering its maternities and depriving them full of  
thicket and elephant?  
There are many smokes in front of mechanical events.  
You've asked me what the lobster is developing there with his blue ears?  
I reply, the banner knows this.  
So the absorbant pride lives on in a cherry,  
the hopeful house of the trouser,  
the enduring flower head that is cleansed and dashing.  
Nothing but that candle of juices.  
  
The dead aroma that discovers in your farm.  
Like misunderstood pasture, green cars  
loving toward the salt in the exiled chimney of disordered love.  
A tree focuses its dream of a ending, its ending, the old ending of the love order -  
its angellic beasts.
