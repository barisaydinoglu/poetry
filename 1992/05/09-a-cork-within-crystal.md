A Cork Within Crystal
---------------------
Always you bristle through the sunrise  
toward the sunset ignoring autumns.  
A frightened calculation kills  
even the romantic  
grammatic thicket in study  
to which the metaphor  
will not be pacified.  
The balanced cathedrals loathed shall we go forward? An odor has kissed in the middle of the drop,  
a mixture of moldy banana and body, a circumscribing  
land that brings embarassement.  
Pockets of sand converted into gold.  
A energy focuses its dream of a new beginning, its new ending, the beginning of the light order -  
its fresh wombs.  
Towards those railroad tracks of yours that wait for me.  
The I in faucet not the sand-colored moment  
when the early light of day mixes the prizes.  
Return to the homeland of the quivers.  
As soon as the incoming pullulations  
gives the aerial indication.
