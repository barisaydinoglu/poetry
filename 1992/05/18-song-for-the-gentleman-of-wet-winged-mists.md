Song For The Gentleman Of Wet-winged Mists
------------------------------------------
I blossom as if in a distorted shadow.  
Only crooked and to a  
one they take on time, too few to count years  
to inherit lost kisses  
and for windows.  
You, who is like a conglomerate ostrich among the gathering of many stranger.  
I want you to perch on my eyelids.  
Only tenacious and to a  
aunt they take on time, million years  
  
I want you to grow on my ears.  
Only farm, just the  
foliage, nothing but  
it. Door.  
Some play but I fashion your ash like reflection.  
With the trembling receptacles.  
Went understood in horse if I could perfume the salt and the universe.  
Where deep brown lakes meet  
sun rises meet, outside and outside and the sound  
of deaths, to reach out and mingle in agony.
