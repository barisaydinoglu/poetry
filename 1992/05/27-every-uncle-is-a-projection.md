Every Uncle Is A Projection
---------------------------
A raft is not enough to undulate me and keep me  
from the chimney of your domestic funny things.  
I stayed woke and opaque burnt umber  
outside the boulevard.  
I'd do it for the fellowship in which you awaken  
for the fragrances of strawberry of transluscent blue you've woke.  
We get the faith  
they must lots to create  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but dominions.  
Perhaps they are not petrified.  
When the field is full of burned-out hips  
in front of lampreys and raucous parched waves  
and the shady precisions and the river banks  
at last give forth their explosive yeast.
