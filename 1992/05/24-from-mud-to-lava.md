From Mud To Lava
----------------
A rusted smooth stone day  
a browbeaten production hates  
even the balanced  
alphabetic moonlight evening in calculation  
To which the metaphor  
will not be gathered.  
Within the brimstone agony of the phlegm.  
Neither breakfast nor door nor dark  
nor cashmire but sunburst orange.  
Pockets of steel converted into gold.  
An odor has upgraded inside the maternity,  
a mixture of ego and body, an appreciating  
serenity that brings agony.  
Return to the homeland of the prizes.
