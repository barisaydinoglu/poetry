Proof Of Warm Feeling
---------------------
Everything shaken with loving voices, the salt of the time  
and piles of incredulous bread behind afternoon.  
There are no scandalmongerings but crooked cycles of awe and cinnamon  
ribbons of spacious molested salt.  
Fashioning toward  
the vein you are the mango of my fragmented curves.  
And outside my hammock, during the afternoon, I woke up naked  
and full of wonder.  
What we say circumscribes to  
shower some other stranger  
what a metaphor may teach. And meetings of distorted arm of your dull shades of deep brown pencil when you hold out your lip.
