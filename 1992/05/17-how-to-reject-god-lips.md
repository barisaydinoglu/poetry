How To Reject God Lips
----------------------
Realized iridescent writing I'd do it for the warmth in which you shine  
for the pastures of green you've gathered.  
And meetings of careless ears a romantic fog of perfumes.  
All propellers become alarms.  
Always you fall through the midnight  
toward the late afternoon decaying books.  
How awakening is the changeless error and it's full holes?
