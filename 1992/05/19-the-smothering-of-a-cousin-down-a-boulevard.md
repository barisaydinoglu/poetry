The Smothering Of A Cousin Down A Boulevard
-------------------------------------------
I'd do it for the silence in which you refresh  
for the landscapes of sepia you've loved.  
Musical empire. The loop functions to wet a system  
to its environment.  
Enjoy  
the many frail attempts to fashion  
the poetic womb.  
There is incredulous fortune in growing it. It is a tale of lewd shrapnels a machine breathes,  
abducts - it does not return.
