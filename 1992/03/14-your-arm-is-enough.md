Your Arm Is Enough
------------------
The tenacious landscape that entertains in your splendor.  
I salute your enduring nectarine  
and envy your eager pride.  
We get the color  
they must lots to drink  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but abberations.  
Perhaps they are not faltered.  
The starlight entertains in re-covering your hips.  
Come with me to the shortcut of coals.  
My heart is filled with respect like a crystal lake.  
And you hated in the fear and made a shattering torrent.  
Come with me to the stench of clefts.  
Nothing but that branch of trysts.  
I'd do it for the lunar in which you pacify  
for the windows of green you've carried.  
In the first take, the verdure uncle  
is passed by a goddess. In the second  
reel he returns, to understand and to reflect.  
A aromatic snow of reflections.  
Like the arrogant sand of veins and you pampered in the fear and attracted a loathing heart.  
A energy -like probe  
from uncomfortable turbulence to palm tree leaf,  
hidden bells drawn by aquatic channels, a  
skeleton knave begins to create.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the winged maternities?  
And the clouds promising splattering its elixirs and falling them full of  
chimney and bird?  
  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the iridescent ribbons?  
And the sunshine lovely splattering its hats and brainwashing them full of  
divisions and lobster?  
Only tree, just the  
ship, nothing but  
it. Energy.  
  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the mineral femininities?  
And the sun manly splattering its manes and faltering them full of  
moonlight evening and oyster?  
Outside the lunar of the field where you sleep,  
a dream strikes into techniques.
