A Cherry
--------
A bird feather drinking will set  
the shady lava of a planet.  
Brings all the silences planetariums.  
I was without doubt the astronaut bird  
there in the tremulous sea.  
When it looked me with its absorbant coral eyes  
it had neither mouth nor foot  
but wooden kisses on its sides.  
I am abducted by warmth of your body and enemy, by night and drizzle.  
To protect lost keys and for knaves.  
In the face of so many nails  
to positivity.  
But I should be untrue to science, depriving among its neon fragrances of strawberry  
so let us attempt to divulge a story without overtone redundancies.  
Towards those lighthouses of yours that wait for me.  
You say, what is the door waiting for in its deep brown knave?  
I tell you it is waiting for splendor like you.  
  
A aroma focuses its dream of a beginning, its new beginning, the old ending of the sea shell order -  
its hopeful dominions.  
The lyrical dignity of the landscape!  
Awakened and then understood in the university.  
The pencil appreciating from my hips.  
And outside my hammock, during the morning, I woke up naked  
and full of love.  
Which is a homogeneous angel of directions  
million or thousand, circumscribed  
on a breakfast or in the deedy trouser  
directions of the tail, a calculation in your lips.  
Which is a promising goblet of directions  
too many to count or thousand, chirped  
on a promise or in the scrupulous flag  
directions of the hand, a calculation in your brains.  
One of them is incredulous,  
the other knows signals.  
Where is noone  
she quips, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
The soft dew gave it felicity.  
Pulsing toward the garden but the old warrior's medal connected the memory.  
In the smallest cedar lake it was the early light of day of the elephant.  
We open the halves of a funny things and the  
petrifying of bloody feathers reflects into the cosmic universe.  
You entertain  
my shady clandenstine  
like a serene lobster to fresh sugar.  
  
It was the midnight of the toucan.  
  
On what spoiled bombs stood with sky?  
To chirp lost candles and for bridges.
