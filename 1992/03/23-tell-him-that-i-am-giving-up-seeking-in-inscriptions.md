Tell Him That I Am Giving Up Seeking In Inscriptions
----------------------------------------------------
Pure panic begins the mosaics sometimes a piece of the heat  
kills like an apple in my mouth.  
The reasons for my respect  
are blossomed in my leg of crystal.  
Cheerless gods and giants.  
For me they are aerial.  
  
Tread on the alarms that wait for you  
protesting the parched chairs, cracking the doors.  
Marine beasts of rectum,  
deep brown seams above a fragmented juice.  
But I should be true to science, condemning among its wet-winged windows  
so let us try to divulge a story devoid of individual redundancies.  
  
Indicates the quiver's relaxing arm.  
Not the sepia moment  
when the late afternoon grows the bird feathers.  
You are the tomato of my difficult  
foot.  
My sanguine hand chirps you always.  
Sea water of a forced browbeaten drop.  
Rise on the wounds that wait for you  
abhorring the spoiled chairs, trembling the doors.  
Noone here is waiting for the next poppy.  
Wheatfield. You inherited yourself for seizing.  
Only clotting and to a  
pioneer they take on time, million years  
What deprives the props of wonder?  
Towards those starss in the sky of yours that wait for me.  
Conversations of flints, the recitation  
of ships we call parsimonious pullulation.
