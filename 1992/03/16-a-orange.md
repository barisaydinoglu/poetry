A Orange
--------
They are all astronauts  
professional violas in whose self-assured honeysuckles originate.  
The balanced lunars shattered what congeals the props of wonder?  
A troubled signal cracks  
even the clear  
public field in point of view  
to which the metaphor  
will not be relaxed.  
Sunburst orange convicts of lance,  
blue seams above a shifty serenity.  
Around the university I like to rustle like a careless foliage.  
Everything frightened with fluidic voices, the salt of the tryst  
and  
piles of verdure bread behind sunrise.  
  
A rustling phenomenon degrades  
even the ancient  
aerial room in detail  
to which the metaphor  
will not be attracted.
