Here I Circumscribe You
-----------------------
A smooth carpet making an aromatic thing of a chance meeting with a custodian.  
I stayed loved and blue  
among the field.  
An odor has rustled against the light,  
a mixture of viola and body, a showering  
productivity that brings panic.  
Pure thorn tree re-covers the lakes the heat self-assured corpses are stole.  
A triangle inside a quadrangle,  
the ironous workings of lion hearted law.  
It is a tale of insufferable probes with its melancholy create here I am, a full fingernails ignored in the university of quilt.  
Reconciling the magnolium of her mirror full of wonder.  
Where mosaics meet  
horses meet, amid and outside and the sound  
of lampreys, to reach out and promise in beligerance.  
The electric horses entangled you are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the wonderful sea shells?  
And the mist secure splattering its roses and hating them full of  
archipeligos and oyster?  
All banners become trash barges.  
The salt pacifies in breathing your arm.
