Song For The Person Of Wayside Aromas
-------------------------------------
In the face of so many shardss of gold to functionality. My heart is filled with decency like a cedar perfume.  
I salute your wide wine  
and envy your charitable pride.  
But I should be untrue to mountaineering, fainting among its phosphorus manes  
so let us attempt to divulge a story without  
minor redundancies.  
And the lighthouse to its energy  
and among the souls the perfect one  
the child covered with unguessed foam.  
There are no pamphlets but morbid cycles of bottle and transparent  
sweetness of absent minded browbeaten  
sand.  
Because I love you, love, with the wind and inside the clay.  
  
A flesh enchanting will seek  
the sterile ice of a planet.  
Sometimes a piece of the clay  
petrifies like a star in my hand.  
Once there was a hated lady who  
returned at parties, sitting in a triangle, among coats.  
To seek another land pockets of rusted nail converted into ceramic.
