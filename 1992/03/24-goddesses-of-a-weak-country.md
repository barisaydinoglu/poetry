Goddesses Of A Weak Country
---------------------------
There are no salts but weak cycles of bed and cinnamon  
wells of aromatic shifty metal. Flower was no longer right at the transmission threshold.

In the smallest silken bird feather outside the fragmented river, many directionless oxides.  
A crimson cluster attracts.
