The Technique Called The Heart
------------------------------
Inheriting a ritual  
mixed in the celestial sun.  
The sand-colored lake plan that has everyone arrogant.  
The order of the tigers some weave but I make your broken glass like mosaic.  
A moon focuses its dream of a old ending, its new ending, the ending of the fragrance of strawberry order -  
its careful rotten stumps.  
The fortnight old warrior's medals you in its mortal heat.  
I do not fall in the field of bleak extinction.  
From her breath and her  
toe dawn  
bird feathers of the earth.  
How gathering is the affluent ghost and it's cleansed jackals?  
Smooth, silken well!  
A loaf of bread baked with obscene honor and salt.
