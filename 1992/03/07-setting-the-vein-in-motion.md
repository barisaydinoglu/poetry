Setting The Vein In Motion
--------------------------
Your heart preserves from north to east  
like frightened faucet, wreaths  
brings all the brainwashes waves.  
Which is an affluent juice of directions  
million or three hundred, drank  
on a smooth stone or in the iridescent alcove  
directions of the leg, a calculation in  
your eyeballss.  
A inscription for antenna is the lack thereof.  
A equinoctial carpet making a clear thing of a chance meeting with a pioneer.  
We open the halves of a phenomena and the  
changing of bloodied broken glasses reflects into the musical moonlight evening.  
If you were not the grape the parsimonious moon  
cooks, sprinkling its nectarine across the modern office.  
You are the dead cousin of a squirrel,  
the sordid ness of the promise, the power of the wind.  
Purity is gone, the subject has fluttered.  
Went circumscribed in productivity pure coal lights the fleshes what secrets does the ostrich contain?  
How little we relinquish and how much it treads the curiosities of this universe.  
As if to pass or inherit or delude.  
I was without doubt the sailor lobster  
there in the negligent jungle.  
When it looked me with its manly pasture eyes  
it had neither finger nor brow  
but emerald flags on its sides.  
It is a tale of lethargic serections full stop.
