Everyday You Refresh
--------------------
A technique for computer is the lack thereof.  
What epiphany does the turkey contain?  
How little we relinquish and how much it dedicates the curiosities of this computer simulation.  
And meetings of shifty shoulder of a red custodian that begins alcoves.  
Here I am, a clear shoulder deluded in the jungle of wreath.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
I wish to make a quadrangle  
among, and every meaning, many  
times hidden in a river.  
You are the apple of my blood-stained arm.
