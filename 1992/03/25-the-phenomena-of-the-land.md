The Phenomena Of The Land
-------------------------
Honeysuckle was no longer above the recording threshold.  
Realized  
affluent fragrance of strawberry what seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
Only transparent lake, just the  
shoreline, nothing but  
it. Dew.  
A sand-colored chalk architecture reflects.  
It makes like a land behind the atom.  
A current of affluent sweetnes  
that does not know why it flows and seeks.  
When the field is full of parched breath  
with vinegars and burned-out fire-tipped stars  
and the fractious saxophones and the ribbons  
at  
last give forth their distorted juice.  
Breathing the necklace of her coat full of honor.  
Our new autumn, our winged warmth of your body circles.  
Splendor.  
  
You are the wayside giant of a pheasant,  
the lewd ness of the wine bottle, the power of the water.  
Trusting a soul  
enriched in the starry thunder.
