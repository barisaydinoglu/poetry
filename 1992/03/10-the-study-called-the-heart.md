The Study Called The Heart
--------------------------
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
Your sunburst orange car is a salt filled with smothered quilt.  
Ancient, ivory knave!  
In cinnamon water and transparent droplets.  
The sunset laminated  
signs you in its mortal water.
