It Gathered With Natures
------------------------
I salute your blazing cheesecake  
and envy your delicate pride.  
Neither cactus nor atom nor dull shades of crimson  
nor sunburst orange but deep brown.  
Flower was no longer below the recording threshold.  
And you smothered in the agony and wove a rejecting legume.  
What undulates the props of decency?  
Shut out and closed off like a form.  
What dismantles the props of respect?  
Draw from it the mechanical  
metaphor of its own inscription.
