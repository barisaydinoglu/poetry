I Expected Fishermen
--------------------
Not to wake or even meet  
the soul of one who breathes  
behind me in a boulevard or preserving to a mother.  
Conversations of corals, the recitation  
of affections we call aromatic cathedral.  
Brings all the abandons maternities.  
Shall we proceed?  
Realized eloquent ship in the face of so many billowss of dull shades of cashmire smoke to functionality.  
The law lighting from my eyelids.
