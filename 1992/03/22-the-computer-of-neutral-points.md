The Computer Of Neutral Points
------------------------------
Only forest, just the  
dew, nothing but  
it. Ship. Brings all the erupts moons.  
I'd do it for the bird feather in which you blush  
for the elixirs of crimson you've reflected.  
  
A crown focuses its dream of a beginning, its new ending, the new ending of the echo order -  
its sensual gates.  
On what smothered corpses grew with fire?
