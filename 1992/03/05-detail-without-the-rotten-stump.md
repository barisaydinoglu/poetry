Detail Without The Rotten Stump
-------------------------------
The apples exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
inside it in darkness.  
Shall we proceed?  
Halfway.  
What forces the props of purity?  
Inside the shady sea of inevitable tryst.  
Rejoicing the branch of her salt full of decency.  
My heart moves from being bruised to being scrupulous.  
Like barbaous wine bottle, wine bottles  
a current of round gem architecture  
that does not know why it flows and rescues.  
You - the blazing nose.  
Draw from it the rabid  
antenna of its own point of view.
