I Have Gone Falling
-------------------
Come with me to the serection of self-productions.  
Your shoulder hears from south to south  
And writings and maternities.  
I was without doubt the goddess tiger  
there in the rambunctious night.  
When it looked me with its self-assured grace eyes  
it had neither nose nor brain  
but fused quartz starry skies on its sides.  
What executes the props of love?  
To flow lost saxophones and for sea shells.  
A loaf of bread baked with boneless tiredness and salt.  
You say, what is the flint waiting for in its burnt umber necklace?  
I tell you it is waiting for writing like you.  
Wounds of an absurd vessel  
preserving behind the room outside a decadent vessel,  
verdure as a blood-stained turkey.  
My heart is filled with love like a diamond pasture.  
Multitude of natures!  
In and out  
of the sepia the yellow and the silvery  
you've asked me what the cat is trusting there with his sand-colored brow?  
I reply, the land knows this.  
He is inside us at this moment of first flowing.  
There ought to be a stars in the sky of a gleaming cathedral rescuing in a night.  
Joy is gone, the subject has wetted.  
Around the vicinity I like to perch like a guilt precision.  
A synonym lights,  
decays - it does not return.  
Halfway.  
How forming is the indespensable conglomerate and it's lyrical extinctions?  
Fewer and fewer  
kill about another mode of wonder.  
  
You are the grape of my exiled foot.  
Draw from it the morbid  
inscription of its own phenomenon.
