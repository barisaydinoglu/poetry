Under Slightest Understanding - Calculations And Science
--------------------------------------------------------
How imbuing is the wide hound and it's smooth whispers?  
In my moonlight evening at lunchtime you are like a writing  
and your form and colour the way I perform them.  
To the resplendent color of the crystal wreath.  
Gnaw me and let  
my substance seek.  
Not understanding is a form of shining.  
Multitude of windows!  
In and out of the yellow the transparent and the yellow  
  
You promise in the universe as in a unguessed boulevard.  
Violenet alarms and brutal alarms.
