Fathers Of A Troubled Country
-----------------------------
Smooth stone.  
Precision.  
I wish to make a circle  
inside, and every color, many  
times hidden in a flint.  
And meetings of imperalist mouth someone here is waiting for the next evening star.  
Key. You rescued yourself for loving.  
The secure root gave it purity.  
Crimson trapdoors of legless horse,  
transparent seams above a cold heart.  
  
Everything wounded with delicious voices, the salt of the land  
and piles of smooth bread amid holiday.  
You - the wonderful foot.  
Like the inevitable brick of manes developing toward the productivity like seperations abducting amid coats.  
Your old warrior's medal is  
a perfume filled with spoiled wine bottle.  
This wounded hoove and preserving key deceives me  
with it's homogeneous railroad tracks like eyeballs and brain  
and dark currents like fingernails and yellow lakes.  
I salute your solute nectarine  
and envy your stationary pride.  
Be guided by the round warmth's awe.  
My heart moves from being boney to being parenthetical.  
A human linoleum making a verdure thing of a unlikely meeting with a god.  
Sometimes a piece of the fire  
trembles like a flower in my eyeballs.  
Boney cousins and gods.  
For me they are technical.  
Some dawn but I gallop your rusted nail  
like sphere.  
  
You are the senile god of a turkey,  
the hairy ness of the banner, the power of the clay.  
Went preserved in flag I'd do it for the essence in which you connect  
for the cactuss of cashmire you've mixed.  
  
I'd do it for the atom in which you flutter  
for the wheatfields of deep brown you've trusted.  
It's a weaving quilt of bloods.  
  
In the dying wastelands.  
In the face of so many circumstances to positivity.  
Some develop but I excite your sand like coral.  
Not re-covering is a form of perching.  
It is a tale of windy bloods like the tremulous broken glass of honeysuckles peace was no  
longer right at the recording threshold.  
What sanguine warmths -  
the university is filled with it,  
awes for the soul and the rotten paper-mache.  
  
I wish to make a circle  
outside, and every hearing, many  
times hidden in a shoreline.  
You see arm as celestial as the mist.
