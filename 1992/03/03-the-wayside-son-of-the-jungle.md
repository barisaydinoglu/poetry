The Wayside Son Of The Jungle
-----------------------------
A detail for camera is the lack thereof.  
I was without doubt the cousin lobster  
there in the lonely field.  
When it looked me with its humble green lake eyes  
it had neither curves nor lip  
but chalk propellers on its sides.  
A image protects,  
passes - it does not return.  
To the original poetic coat a image wets,  
deceives - it does not return.
