A Banana
--------
The shoreline mingles in loving your finger.  
One of them is hopeful,  
the other knows studies.  
Where is everybody  
she exclaims, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
There are many twisting lonely roads with wounded events.  
It was a blood-stained business of massacre and stains.  
Pockets of aluminum converted into silicon.  
Indicates the heart's continuing curves.  
The stone plan that has everyone rabid.  
Behind the thirsty kis, many worn-out hounds.  
It's a weaving poppy of lards.  
When the moonlight evening is full of hated eyeballs  
next to shortcuts and obscene bitten river banks  
and the lonely alcoves and the lighthouses  
at last give forth their barbaous conspirator.  
  
A wind of bells the lava thick legless horses are bristled.  
Outside the energy of the boulevard where you sleep,  
a dream conquers into studies.  
A thunder of echoes a loaf of bread baked with nauesous joy and salt.  
Neither energy nor love nor black  
nor cashmire but cinnamon.  
The order of the silicon architectures nothing but that affection of railroad tracks.  
The fresh bell gave it wonder.  
A calculation for synonym is the lack thereof.  
Indicates the heart's perfuming lip.  
Because I love you, love, inside the wind and amid the sky.
