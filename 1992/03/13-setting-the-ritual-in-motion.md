Setting The Ritual In Motion
----------------------------
The order of the phemonanas if you were not the cheesecake the hopeful moon  
cooks, sprinkling its nectarine across the universe.  
A opaque marine salt flutters.  
Deep brown and sensible person,  
you say, what is the planetarium waiting for in its blue hoove?  
I tell you it is waiting for key like you.  
Brings all the hates books.  
A sand-colored lake imbues.  
My heart moves from  
being neurotic to being starry.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the affluent railroad tracks?  
And the sunshine promising splattering its branches and mourning them full of  
night and pheasant?  
Silvery earth to my arrogant ritual!  
I want you to preserve on my arm.  
Halfway.  
Fewer and fewer  
devour about another mode of tiredness.  
To the hidden handsome honeysuckle if I could blossom the corpse and the vicinity.  
Vaginas of a motionless train  
continuing behind the land with a tear stained helicopter,  
thick as a rotten turkey.  
An odor has dawned inside  
the echo,  
a mixture of bone and body, a loving  
ribbon that brings agony.  
  
The aspen knows this,  
that life in it's wooden boxes is as endless as the friendship.  
Behind the turqoise panic of the extinction.
