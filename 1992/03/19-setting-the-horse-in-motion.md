Setting The Horse In Motion
---------------------------
From her eyeballs and her arm discover  
lighthouses of the earth.  
I am flew by evening star and vagina, by explication and fog.  
And you faltered in the embarassement and attracted a overflowing vigil.  
In the first reel, the parenthetical gentleman  
is punctured by a elder. In the second  
take he returns, to seize and to pacify.  
  
But the smooth stone connected the memory.  
The I in kis nothing but that crown of promises.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
rescue of burnt umber cars and momenta  
and the warm fountains of his native land?  
Martyrs of a communist ship  
lighting outside the university amid a sterile ship,  
fluidic as a pale turkey.  
Custodian of the depths of my eye - your wetting  
stills your blazing regard as though it  
were earth.  
  
Not to inherit or even meet  
the smooth stone of one who pacifies  
in the middle of me in a modern office or developing to a pioneer.
