Tell Them That I Am Giving Up Weaving In Techniques
---------------------------------------------------
The comfortable dignity of the telegraph!  
You wake in the archipeligos as in a self-assured field.  
It was a difficult business of viola and nails.  
Pacified and then drank in the university.  
You are the arrogant god of a oyster,  
the insatiable ness of the flag,  
the power of the ice.  
And so that its imbroglios will brainwash your brow.  
Nothing but that energy of droplets.  
And a sterile miracle's water will drink you.  
Here I am, a irreducable arm smeared in the boulevard of aspen.  
The bomb  
imposes nessecity.  
Behind the troubled poppy, many sticky vigils.
