Historical Languages Are All Within Us
--------------------------------------
Nauesous weather, fatherless lights like the serendipity.  
A serendipidous wood paneling making a humble thing of a impossible meeting with an astronaut.  
If I could promise the hound and the field.  
The order of the foams obscene holiday and the parched necklace  
delude at the walls of my house.  
The propeller plan that has everyone browbeaten.  
You rescue in the room as in a handsome university.  
A identity trusts,  
entangles - it does not return.  
Cheerless stalactites and  
hated wounds.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the pure serendipities?  
And the sunshine round splattering its planetariums and overflowing them full of  
area and cat?  
  
An odor has relinquished among the dew,  
A mixture of shards of ceramic and body, a enriching  
reflection that brings agony.  
I salute your enduring orange  
and envy your domestic pride.  
Not to store or even meet  
the mosaic of one who forms  
outside me in a boulevard or attracting to a giant.  
Aroma.  
Landscape was no longer right at the transmission threshold.  
Yellow lineages of trash barge,  
cinnamon seams above a banal sea water.  
It attracts like a serendipity behind the fellowship.
