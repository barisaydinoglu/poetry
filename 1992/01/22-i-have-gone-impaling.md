I Have Gone Impaling
--------------------
Pure stench re-covers the flints it's a creating lake of uranus.  
For a day, maybe million,  
I rested under a pillow of fog  
at a bus stop, waiting for the aunt to be outside.  
But I should be true to engineering, erupting among its putrid silences  
so let us try to speak a story devoid of aerial redundancies.  
Frightened lightnings and lonely stains.
