There Is No Bone
----------------
Within the marine tail of the lava.  
Because I love you, love, around the heat and in the water.  
Of velvety orange, spirit  
of the aromas,  
scratched lady blood, your kisses  
live into exile  
and a droplet of paper-mache,  
with remnants of the boulevard.  
In the first reel, the plumed father  
is trembled by a elder. In the second  
scene he returns, to travel and to discover.  
For a day, maybe too few to count,  
I rested under a blade of grass  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the mother to be around.  
Behind the well of the jungle where you sleep,  
a dream changes into points of view.  
For a day, maybe three hundred,  
I rested under a pillow of fog  
at a bus stop, waiting for the stranger to be around.
