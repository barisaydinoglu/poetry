A Promise To Trust The Threads You Set
--------------------------------------
From uncomfortable turbulence  
to blade of grass,  
hidden horses drawn by poetic channels, a  
acidulous mist begins to grow.  
Enchanting toward the knave next to the cinnamon nose of the water.  
I do not change in the moonlight evening of mechanical nougat.  
There are no nights but thirsty cycles of defender and marine  
echoes of serene explosive graphite.  
Not the deep brown moment  
when the fortnight breathes the propellers.  
A sunshine of pullulations we open the halves of a funny things and the  
chaining of yeasts pulses into the esoteric heights.  
The afternoon doves you in its mortal jungle.
