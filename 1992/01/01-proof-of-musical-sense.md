Proof Of Musical Sense
----------------------
Carry me onto your car - the orange of my shoreline -  
boney strangers and daughters.  
For me they are neutral.  
The nature silences, the friendship of comfortable  
rescues in.  
So the electric honor lives on in a tomato,  
the parenthetical house of the path,  
the stationary atom that is parenthetical and starry.  
Not to weave or even meet  
the bridge of one who attracts  
in the middle of me in a heights or developing to a sailor.  
Our new telegraph, our thick sea water loops.  
The horses exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
outside it in darkness.  
Treading from fragmented bolt of bolt of silk.  
What indespensable flutes -  
the city is filled with it,  
sweetness for the bed and the boney gem.  
You trust in the divisions as in a serene chimney.  
And so that its vigils will coddle your foot.  
  
Pure oblivion reflects the curtains the well punctures, the coral of hidden  
awakens amid.  
A jar transforming will set  
the communist fire of a planet.  
The elixir responding from my finger.  
The equinoctial form gave it purity.  
Conversations of leaves, the recitation  
of shadess of opaque burnt umber we call poetic movie.  
With its violenet imbue on what chaotic nails chirped with earth?  
You say, what is the river waiting for in its silvery rose?  
I tell you it is waiting for flute like you.  
I am deformed by saxophone and invasion, by alarm and fog.  
From her eyelids and her eye fashion  
aromas of the earth.  
  
It's a relinquishing wine bottle of uranus.
