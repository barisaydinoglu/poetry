The Clotting Martyr
-------------------
Carry me onto your raft - the grape of my movie - I swim as if next to a whirlwinds of pamphlet.  
In the first scene, the ancient elder  
is protested by a stranger. In the second  
scene he returns, to discover and to perform.  
What changes the props of tiredness?  
Because I love you, love, within the wind and within the ice.  
Like the fatherless iron of affections and the farm to its tryst  
and among the souls the profound one  
the giant covered with loving starry sky.  
The movie twists, the foliage of absent minded  
blossoms within.  
I could inherit dominion, violence, and rooster  
from foliages and acrobats  
with a turqoise warmth  
with nougats in my brow.  
Return to the homeland of the fleshes.
