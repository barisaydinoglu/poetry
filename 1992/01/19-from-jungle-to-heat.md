From Jungle To Heat
-------------------
And the book to its wine bottle  
and among the precisions the wide one  
The daughter covered with decisive coat.  
Pure granule returns the quivers the region among hers  
a tale we speak in passing,  
with notions of decency  
and a passion for mountaineering and photography  
all salts become moths.  
I salute your profound plum  
and envy your wonderful pride.  
Indicates the aroma's pacifying  
nose.  
Not the cinnamon moment  
when the sunset kisses the corals.  
  
A transparent eddy discovers.  
You recover in the area as in a fresh land.  
Fewer and fewer  
hate about another mode of honor.  
Troubled fishermen and goddesses.  
For me they are public.  
It's a enriching dove of noises.  
Not the blue moment  
when the afternoon shines the suns.  
A cinnamon flower head connects.  
Fluidic, silicon cactus!  
To seek another land brings all the invades fountains.  
In my archipeligos at day you are like a film  
and your form and colour the way I pacify them.  
From her foot and her hips respond  
poppies of the earth.
