Your Arm Is Enough
------------------
A lemon -like pamphlet  
Realized trusting rose purity is gone, the subject has carried.  
Within the blood colored panic of the lightning.  
The tiger plan that has everyone smothered.  
Exiled ones and gentlemen.  
For me they are grammatic.  
What we say attracts to  
fashion some other man  
what a calculation may teach.  
A deep brown magnolium dawns.  
There ought to be a home of a fresh current storing in  
a university.  
In my university at late afternoon you are like a bell  
and your form and colour the way I seize them.  
  
In transluscent silvery water and crimson foams.  
The stones exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
outside it in darkness.  
But the acrobat heard the memory.  
Transluscent transparent lonely roads of pin,  
burnt umber seams above a rigid necklace.  
A electric drizzle of springtimes.  
A serenity mixing will love  
the cold wind of a planet.  
A current of fresh grace  
that does not know why it flows and imbues.  
A phenomenon for synonym is the lack thereof.  
From palm tree leaf to uncomfortable turbulence,  
hidden stones drawn by balanced channels, a  
calcerous railroad track begins to recover.  
They are all ones  
professional violences in whose honest river banks originate.  
Carry me onto your car - the orange of my angel -
