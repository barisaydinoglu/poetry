The Epiphany Of The Universe
----------------------------
Of your dark smooth metal when you hold out your finger.  
What crushes the props of wonder?  
In the smallest paper-mache elixir not flying is a form of awakening.  
In your brain of dying the boulevard begins to dream of recovering.  
As if to ignore or rescue or wipe.  
The stalks of cattail plan that has everyone bitterest.  
In my heights at lunchtime you are like a mane  
and your form and colour the way I light them.
