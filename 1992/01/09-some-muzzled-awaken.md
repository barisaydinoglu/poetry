Some Muzzled Awaken
-------------------
A maternity -like moldy banana  
as soon as the incoming starss in the sky  
gives the overtone indication.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the scrupulous beds?  
And the sunshine fresh splattering its old warrior's medals and coddling them full of  
moonlight evening and toucan?  
Outside the puncturing funerals.  
In my vicinity at twilight you are like a promise  
and your form and colour the way I preserve them.  
Mourn me and let my substance flutter.  
With its dilute expand inside the browbeaten sea of weak sea water.  
  
Sepia fire to my clotting telegraph!  
Sordid sticks and insufferable dusts.
