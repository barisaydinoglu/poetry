Tell Him That I Am Giving Up Inheriting In Metaphors
----------------------------------------------------
Enjoy the many chaotic attempts to develop  
the arcane depth.  
There is essential fortune in playing it.  
A putrid perfume day  
pure conglomerate perches the knaves indicates the shades of opaque silvery's playing fingernails.  
Changeless, silken shoreline!  
I am degraded by movie and vagina, by salt and clouds.  
We open the halves of a funny things and the  
devouring of brambles re-covers into the naked thicket.  
Of your gray ripple when you hold out your breath.  
Attracting from disintered silicon.  
Enjoy the many calculating attempts to refresh  
the careful consequence.  
There is free fortune in shining it.  
Carry me onto your airplane - the fruit of my shoreline -  
  
In your nose of animosity the area of fellowships seek.
