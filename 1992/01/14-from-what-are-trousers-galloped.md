From What Are Trousers Galloped
-------------------------------
As soon as the incoming starry skies  
gives the minor indication.  
Where rituals meet  
forms meet, with and amid and the sound  
of abberations, to reach out and tread in beligerance.  
Guilt vaginas and rambunctious bloodied ashes.  
In the negligent lake, many clotting wombs.  
Like the absurd metal of landscapes a dead calculation shatters  
even the parsimonious  
algorithmic vicinity in metaphor  
to which the metaphor  
will not be enchanted.  
I could breathe nail, phlegm, and womb  
from atoms and opaque blue cars  
with a blood colored echo  
with cold fires in my nose.
