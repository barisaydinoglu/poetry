From What Are Kisses Formed
---------------------------
A banner transforming will recover  
the rustling ice of a planet.  
What smothers the props of joy?  
To seek  
another land the landscape blossoming from my eyeballs.  
And bird feathers and mists.  
The order of the stars my heart moves from being hated to being somber.  
Multitude of fellowships!  
In and out of the sepia the sepia and the yellow  
when you grow rescued like a hat.  
The chimney inside hers  
a history we speak in passing,  
with notions of felicity  
and a passion for oceanography and mountaineering  
  
Halfway.  
Beginning a tryst  
inherited in the delicious thunder.  
The natural cousin  
drinks in the promising morning. We open the halves of a phenomena  
and the  
brainwashing of uranus promises into the equinoctial sea.  
Outside the blood colored agony of the moth.  
Delirious rectums and atrocious belts.  
What we say reflects to  
pulse some other elder  
what a identity may teach.
