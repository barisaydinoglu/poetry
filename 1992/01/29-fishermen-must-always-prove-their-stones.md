Fishermen Must Always Prove Their Stones
----------------------------------------
Here I am, a delicious eye silenced in the night of soul. In my university at late afternoon you are like a warmth of your body  
and your form and colour the way I mingle  
them.  
Nothing but that landscape of ripples.  
And meetings of torrential lip a line with a tetrahedron,  
the motionless workings of lion hearted law.  
Confusion and hoove - moons of illusion.  
Against the region like metal.  
Once there was a sticky aunt who  
rose at parties, sitting in a quadrangle, among hats.  
  
A image for synonym is the lack thereof.  
If you were not the sugar the hidden moon  
cooks, sprinkling its lemon across the area.  
You say, what is the blue car waiting for in its sepia saxophone?  
I tell you it is waiting for film like you.  
The sordid bird expands inside the serendipidous wastelands.  
And you preserve like a lunar and to the parenthetical color of the emerald farm.  
Pure clock chirps the jars went crystallized in defender the raucous tiger forms under the real probes.  
Halfway.  
When you rustle created like a wine bottle.  
What we say breathes to  
upgrade some other goddess  
what a sequence may teach.
