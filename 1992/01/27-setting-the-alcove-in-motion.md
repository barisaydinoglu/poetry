Setting The Alcove In Motion
----------------------------
The femininity awakens in forming your curves. I could conduct  
conglomerate, shards of wooden, and moth  
from aromas and starss in the sky  
with a black acrobat  
with whispers in my brow.  
So the stationary respect lives on in a banana,  
the homogeneous house of the phemonana,  
the resplendent sun rise that is changeless and parenthetical.  
  
From blade of grass to palm tree leaf,  
hidden peaces drawn by domestic channels, a  
furious tiger begins to blush.
