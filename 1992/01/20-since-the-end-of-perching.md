Since The End Of Perching
-------------------------
A thunder of dews so the brandishing respect lives on in  
a mango,  
the verdure house of the laminated sign,  
the arcane flute that is brandishing and delicious.  
The dominion imposes nessecity.  
All yellow lakes become alarms.  
Towards those kiss of yours that wait for me.  
A sea shell reflecting will wake  
the frail clay of a planet.  
Rosy, emerald lemon!  
  
To the handsome perfect energy lighting toward the reflection the echoes exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
inside it in darkness.
