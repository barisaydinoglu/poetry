Proof Of Eloquent Hearing
-------------------------
For root was motionless and morally negative.  
What we say plays to  
dedicate some other stranger  
what a synonym may teach.  
Conversations of splendors, the recitation  
of doors we call musical star.  
You tread in the chimney as in a great vicinity.  
Our new alcove, our humble wheatfield loops.  
What we say forms to  
re-cover some other custodian  
what a language may teach.  
Like the listless graphite of faucets you are the bleak pioneer of a turkey,  
the putrid ness of the cathedral, the power of the water.  
And a inaccessible river's clay will store you.  
What we say mingles to  
divulge some other father  
what a sequence may teach.  
Only disordered and to a  
pioneer they take on time, thousand years  
among  
the lunar of the boulevard where you sleep,  
a dream devours into techniques.  
Wave of wave of leaves rolling down the sea.  
Someone here is waiting for the next time.  
Dew. You crystallized yourself for rising.
