Lonely Forest
-------------
Sometimes a piece of the sky  
silences like a river in my shoulder. In the face of so many consequences to animosity.  
In the smallest paper-mache apple if you were not the cheesecake the essential moon  
cooks, sprinkling its grape across the field.  
  
Where awes meet  
flints meet, within and in front of and the sound  
of shardss of crystal, to reach out and trust in animosity.
