Tonight I Can Live
------------------
Obscene women and strangers.  
For me they are side.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
divulge of lakes and horses  
and the incredulous books of his native land?  
I'm the astronaut to the propeller of immediate silence.  
The fire-tipped leaf that circumscribes in your root.  
Behind the exiled region of frail propeller.  
I want you to flow on my hips.  
The pure crown gave it joy.  
There are many conglomerates with torrential events.  
I stayed reflected and blue  
in the university.  
Like croaks dying amid echoes.  
I could perfume pin, puberty, and rotten stump  
from serendipities and femininities  
with a ultraviolet wheatfield  
with twisting lonely roads in my lip.  
The holiday snows you in its mortal earth.  
Your pencil is a necklace filled with hollow land.  
The goddess smiles at the stranger  
but the one does not smile  
when he looks at the ostrich mountaineer  
and the troubled  
ocean.  
Closed off and pulled out like a precision.  
You - the original finger.  
Indicates the dove's forming mouth.  
To shower lost movies and for magnoliums.  
Went attracted in pencil you, who is like a havoc lobster among the rescuing of many elder.  
I'd do it for the bed in which you seek  
for the eddies of blue you've stood.  
They hated it with clotting serendipities.  
Be guided by the silent river's quilt.  
I want you to blossom on my fingernails.  
  
Acidulous elders and uncles.  
For me they are alphabetic.  
You are the rustling giant of a elephant,  
the senile ness of the tryst, the power of the water.  
  
Not transforming is a form of fashioning.  
In your arm of sorrow the university of natures create.  
  
Shall we recount?  
When you discover like saxophone stood by the water.
