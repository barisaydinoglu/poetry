The Beligerance Of The Overtone Narrative
-----------------------------------------
There are many ghosts in exiled events.  
Your guitar is a jar filled with motionless kiss.  
A computer for phenomenon is the lack thereof.  
Only river, just the  
poppy, nothing but  
it. Praise.  
Transparent trash barges of wax,  
deep brown seams above a inevitable planetarium.  
Your finger reconciles from east to south  
the fluidic woman  
wakes in the monastic morning.
