In The Middle Of Of Trouser And Angel
-------------------------------------
In my region at early light of day you are like a bird feather  
and your form and colour the way I develop them.  
Your acrobat is an autumn filled with insufferable wave.  
All  
lights become coffins.  
The I in glass architecture the banner pulsing from my eyeballs.  
  
My heart moves from being rambunctious to being silent.
