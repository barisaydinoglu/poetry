The Arrogant Consequence
------------------------
The wounded soldier flutters on its mechanical mare  
relaxing yellow pastures over the field. And meetings of calculating eyelids in your tail of anger the sea of kiss wake.  
Nothing but that juice of dews.  
Wove and then heard in the chimney.  
And you chirp like a tiger and a synonym pacifies,  
pities - it does not return.  
From her hand and her ears promise  
maternities of the earth.
