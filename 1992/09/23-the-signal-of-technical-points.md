The Signal Of Technical Points
------------------------------
One of them is warm,  
the other knows phenomena.  
Where is noone  
he cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen? Some rustle but I build your iron like guitar.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
chirp of energies and eddies  
and the equinoctial maternities of his native land?  
Multitude of flints!  
In and out of the sepia the cashmire and the cinnamon  
of your red ship when you hold out your hand.
