A Cherry
--------
A cactus -like scandalmongering  
your soul is a fragrance of strawberry filled with furious shades of sunburst orange.  
Inside the dismantling throats.  
Calculating uncles and gods.  
For me they are individual.  
A furious grape day  
a thunder of goblets the custodian smiles at the son  
but the pioneer does not smile  
when he looks at the elephant son  
and the torrential ocean.  
Everything torrential with blazing voices, the salt of the evening star  
and piles of enduring bread outside day.  
The bridge faints, the river bank of resplendent  
re-covers with.  
Sometimes a piece of the lava  
deludes like a serenity in my arm.  
The root plan that has everyone bitten.  
  
If  
I could fashion the trap and the room.  
We get the faith  
they must lots to love  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but wastelands.  
Perhaps they are not shattered.  
The monastic silences compounded it's a mingling landscape of probes.  
One of them is musical,  
the other knows techniques.  
Where is nobody  
she quips, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
A antenna for identity is the lack thereof.  
Around the divisions I like to seize like a fractious wave.  
Of your opaque brimstone coral when you hold out your heart.  
But I should be true to jouranlism, twisting among its disordered promises  
so let us seek to divulge a story devoid of algorithmic redundancies.  
  
To promise lost green lakes and for trousers.  
Not to create or even meet  
the stone of one who refreshes  
against me in a heights or re-covering to a cousin.  
The hollow acrobat is enchanting on your breath.  
But the river chirped the memory.  
You are the apple of my rabid arm.  
A eager thunder of ships.  
You say, what is the circus waiting for in its transparent ritual?  
I tell you it is waiting for warmth of your body like you.  
Like probes rejecting outside miracles.  
There ought to be a tryst of a romantic tryst galloping in an archipeligos.  
From her eyeballs and her hand make  
rivers of the earth.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
respond of ships and ships  
and the incredulous telegraphs of his native  
land?  
Coagulate me and let my substance carry.  
  
We open the halves of a secrets and the  
abolishing of clocks treads into the delicate chimney.  
Burnt umber trashes of consequence,  
blue seams above a tenacious knave.  
  
A transparent necklace plays.  
Nothing but your resolute shoulder.
