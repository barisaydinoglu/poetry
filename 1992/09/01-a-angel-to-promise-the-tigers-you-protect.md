A Angel To Promise The Tigers You Protect
-----------------------------------------
A nose and a toe  
gathering the modern office.  
The esoteric uncle  
begins in the celestial morning.  
There are no trapdoors but bitter cycles of cathedral and green  
moons of cleansed frail brick.  
All flower heads become vortices.  
In the smallest paper-mache miracle and within my hammock, during the day, I woke up naked  
and full of respect.  
Like shrapnels stealing with manes.  
The reasons for my respect  
are recovered in my shoulder of copper.  
A coat focuses its dream of a new beginning, its new beginning, the new ending of the serendipity order -  
its smooth nougats.  
A chorus of birds at sunset un kissed un pitied  
comes to a halt before a tree.  
A boat is not enough to conquer me and keep me  
from the field of your self-assured mysteries.  
The thread invades, the warmth of your body of cosmic  
pacifies in front of.  
  
The order of the dews a fluidic snow of flutes.  
Sometimes a piece of the water  
shakes like a hoove in my eyeballs.
