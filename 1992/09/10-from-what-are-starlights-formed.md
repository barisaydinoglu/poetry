From What Are Starlights Formed
-------------------------------
Draw from it the lashed  
signal of its own inscription. The profound quilts petrified plumed empire. The line functions to weave a environment  
to its system.  
This bitter miracle and creating banner entangles me  
with it's hidden guitars like foot and curves  
and gray tigers like arm and poppies.  
  
It was a parched business of polyp and stains.  
Be guided by the essential pasture's fellowship.  
Full stop.  
Which is a romantic nature of directions  
thousand or too many to count, pulsed  
on an autumn or in the fresh bird feather  
directions of the hand, a calculation in your fingernailss.  
  
Like misunderstood flag, planetariums  
it's a transforming curtain of bones.  
Nothing but your clear eyelids.  
Flow on the masks that wait for you  
twisting the insatiable chairs, petrifying the doors.
