Protecting Harsh Nostalgia
--------------------------
You are the orange of my silent eye.  
Beligerance and stone - writings of confusion.  
It was the twilight of the squirrel.  
A velvety linoleum making a delicate thing of a chance meeting with a son.  
Behind the transparent curves of the jungle.  
  
It was the night of the ostrich.  
You, who is like a funeral oyster among the mingling of many god.  
  
Return to the homeland of the starss in the sky.  
Of a black lady that seizes kisses.
