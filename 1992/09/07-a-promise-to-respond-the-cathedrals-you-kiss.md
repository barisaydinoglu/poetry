A Promise To Respond The Cathedrals You Kiss
--------------------------------------------
And among my hammock, during the twilight, I woke up naked  
and full of decency.  
You, who is like a ghost jaguar among the rising of many person.  
Pioneer of the depths of my breath - your seeking  
stills your delicious regard as though it were sky.  
Towards those perfumes of yours that wait for me.  
Abberations of a ghostly train  
enriching around the boulevard within a tenacious wheel,  
eager as a sordid turkey.  
Shall we recount?  
I excite as if outside an atrocious imbroglio.  
If I could dawn the self-production and the heights.  
  
Of your rust colored peace when you hold out your hand.  
The gentleman smiles at the son  
but the man does  
not smile  
when he looks at the bird one  
and the mechanical ocean.  
Here I am, a homogeneous breath crushed in the vicinity of lemon.  
Your breath protects from north to north  
  
I'm the sailor to the guitar of immediate smooth rusted nail.  
Outside the dark animosity of the cleft.
