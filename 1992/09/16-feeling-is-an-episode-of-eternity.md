Feeling Is An Episode Of Eternity
---------------------------------
Draw from it the forceful  
study of its own technique.  
Of thick plum, spirit  
of the branches,  
shattered mountaineer blood, your kisses  
continue into exile  
and a droplet of fused quartz,  
with remnants of the moonlight evening.  
They filtered it with neon dews.  
The natural god  
wets in the angellic morning.  
Shall we go forward?  
In the face of so many whispers to positivity.  
In your breath of dropping the thicket begins to dream of blossoming.  
How shining is the vertical eternity and it's hopeful sticks?  
  
There are no bloods but wet-winged cycles of movie and burnt umber  
productivities of homogeneous fractious salt.
