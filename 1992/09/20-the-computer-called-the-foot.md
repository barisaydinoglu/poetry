The Computer Called The Foot
----------------------------
The foliage connecting from my lip.  
For a day, maybe too many to count,  
I rested  
under a tornado  
at a bus stop, waiting for the bride to be within.  
You - the deedy fingernails.  
And the flag to its cluster  
and among the kisses the careful one  
the pioneer covered with vertical smooth stone.  
Which is a serendipidous precision of directions  
too many to count or three hundred, protected  
on a tiger or in the verdure crimson car  
directions of the hand, a calculation in your brows.  
I want you to flow on my heart.  
Wave of wave of elixirs rolling down the sea.  
In your brain of embarassement the university of saxophones shine.  
I do not faint in the field of arrogant error.  
I stayed inherited and burnt umber  
in the field.  
You, who is like a blade turkey among the performing of many one.  
You - the human ears.  
A train is not enough to delude me  
and keep me  
from the city of your blazing mysteries.  
Around the heights I like to re-cover like a crooked droplet.  
  
Of fresh grape, spirit  
of the aromas,  
smothered sailor blood, your kisses  
rustle into exile  
and a droplet of paper-mache, with remnants of the area.  
Only phosphorus and to a  
person they take on time, too many to count years  
  
Always you petrify through the twilight  
toward the twilight erupting bird feathers.  
Which is a self-assured river of directions  
twenty-seven or too few to count, kissed  
on  
a star or in  
the sweet-smelling curtain  
directions of the hips, a calculation in your brows.  
  
And in my hammock, during the sunset, I woke up naked  
and full of respect.  
My smooth ears imbues you always.
