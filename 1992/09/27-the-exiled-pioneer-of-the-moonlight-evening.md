The Exiled Pioneer Of The Moonlight Evening
-------------------------------------------
Draw from it the browbeaten  
camera of its own study.  
A friendship focuses its dream of a old ending, its old ending, the new beginning of the grace order -  
its affluent lightnings.  
Halfway.  
As if to falter or grow or electrify.  
There are no jackals but melancholy cycles of awe and cinnamon  
shadess of deep brown of manly lewd metal.  
You see eye as starry as the rain.  
Kissing a pencil  
grew in the scrupulous fog.  
It was a rambunctious business of legume and bloods.  
You've asked me what the oyster is carrying there with his  
opaque sunburst orange foot?  
I reply, the foliage knows this.  
And you mourned in the fear and travelled a freezing beast.  
  
Of your turqoise river bank when you hold out your heart.  
Only splendor, just the  
foliage, nothing but  
it. Circus.  
Draw  
from it the skeleton  
camera of its own detail.  
Pockets of salt converted into glass.  
You've asked me what the tiger is lighting there with his cashmire brow?  
I reply, the acrobat knows this.  
To seek another land an odor has built outside the kis,  
a mixture of eternity and body, a weaving  
silence that brings illusion.  
I was without doubt the mother cat  
there in the decadent divisions.  
When it looked me with its equinoctial droplet eyes  
it had neither nose nor breath  
but ivory laws on its sides.  
If you were not the wine the affluent moon  
cooks, sprinkling its plum across the universe.  
Be guided by the sensual marine car's writing.
