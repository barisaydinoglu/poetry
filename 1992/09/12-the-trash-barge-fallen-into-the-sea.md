The Trash Barge Fallen Into The Sea
-----------------------------------
Transparent jackals of legless horse,  
cinnamon seams above a lashed curtain.  
Of homogeneous wine, spirit  
of the silk architectures,  
wetted astronaut blood, your kisses  
shower into exile  
and a droplet of emerald, with remnants of the universe.  
A computer for projection is the lack thereof.  
If I could swim the stain and the vicinity.  
  
Blue heat to my forceful smooth stone!  
Like the hairy aluminum of salts outside the brimstone embarassement of the evil.  
Pure wall appreciates the umbrellas the reasons for my respect  
are began in my toe of copper.  
As if to kill or dawn or petrify.
