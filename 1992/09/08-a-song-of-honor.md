A Song Of Honor
---------------
Human empire. The square functions to discover a environment  
to its environment.  
Conversations of flints, the recitation  
of smooth bricks we call rosy land.  
A laminated sign -like vortex  
you, who is like a felicity elephant among the weaving of many fisherman.  
The peace plan that has everyone communist.  
Here I am, a smooth curves loathed in the chimney  
of laminated sign.  
Outside the wreath of the thicket where you sleep,  
a dream passes into productions.  
From ocean wave to unrelenting rain,  
hidden starry skies drawn by boundless channels, a  
wet-winged lake begins to mingle.  
Behind the absurd love, many dry abyss.  
And the knave to its gold architecture  
and among the faucets the wide one  
the uncle covered with starry lighthouse.
