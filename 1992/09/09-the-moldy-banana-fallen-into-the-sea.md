The Moldy Banana Fallen Into The Sea
------------------------------------
Continuing toward the aspen we get the abstraction  
they must lots to crystallize  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but gates.  
Perhaps they are not decayed.  
A loaf of bread baked with clenched love and salt.  
There are no cubicles but troubled cycles of hoove and transluscent cashmire  
roses of solute bruised metal.  
Towards those mists of yours that wait for me.  
Halfway.  
It was the morning of the squirrel.  
Wave of wave of warmths rolling down the sea.  
Like massacres twisting inside shadess of silvery.  
If I could rise the vagabond and the divisions.  
It re-covers like a sea shell inside the awe.  
A boat is not enough to plague me and keep me  
from the room of your deedy epiphany.  
The warm woman  
attracts in the delicious morning.  
Marine deaths of clandenstine,  
opaque cashmire seams above a hated springtime.  
  
It was the fortnight of the oyster.  
My heart moves from being boney to being angellic.  
The utensil plan that has everyone calculating.  
In your eye of anger the night of poppies rescue.  
  
Not to perform or even meet  
the evening star of one who stands  
among me in a night or trusting to a sailor.
