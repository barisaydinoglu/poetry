Your Tail Is Enough
-------------------
Come with me to the corpse of trashes.  
It was a difficult business of pin and waxes.  
Shut up and shut out like a candle.  
When you relax pacified like a sea's skin.  
In the face of so many violences to animosity.  
Enjoy the many ironous attempts to begin  
the musical explication.  
There is delicate fortune in relinquishing it.  
Has the jungle been continued with funny things?
