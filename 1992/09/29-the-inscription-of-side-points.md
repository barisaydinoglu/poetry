The Inscription Of Side Points
------------------------------
Behind the fragrance of strawberry of the divisions  
where you sleep,  
a dream smothers into cameras.  
In the area like graphite.  
And the shoreline to its bird feather  
and among the defenders the thick one  
the aunt covered with dashing home.  
Wonder is gone, the subject has perched.  
To perfume lost pencils and for praises.  
Only starlight, just the  
land, nothing but  
it. Echo.  
We get the abstraction  
they must lots to build  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but puberties.  
Perhaps they are not congealed.  
We get the sight  
they must lots to transform  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but depths.  
Perhaps they are not penetrated.  
I was without doubt the father bird  
there in the distorted night.  
When it looked me with its trusting jar eyes  
it had neither breath nor finger  
but copper hearts on its sides.  
What deceives the props of honor?  
A obscene synonym falters  
even the aquatic  
technical jungle in image  
to which the metaphor  
will not be enriched.  
A worn-out calculation compounds  
even the round  
technical archipeligos in technique  
to which the metaphor  
will not be carried.  
  
The probe imposes nessecity.  
Around the region I like to wake like a calculating drop.
