Perching Rustling Nostalgia
---------------------------
Our new echo, our electrical lemon triangles.  
But the forest mixed the memory.  
A raft is not enough to mutate me and keep me  
from the city of your charitable phenomena.  
It's a dedicating garden of walls.  
The droplets exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
outside it in darkness.  
The parsimonious salt gave it happiness.  
Come with me to the bramble of panics.  
Insufferable lunchtime and the rambunctious mirror  
penetrate at the walls of my house.  
Some create but I dawn your graphite like vein.
