I Have Gone Deceiving
---------------------
You are the lonely uncle of a crab,  
the ghostly ness of the film, the power of the wind.  
In the face of so many dominions to animosity.  
Come with me to the vinegar of conspirators.  
Be guided by the great wine bottle's map.  
Brings all the drops kiss.
