The Epiphany Of The Region
--------------------------
I flow as if with a oily stalactite.  
Because I love you, love, in the electricity and around the jungle.  
A chorus of tigers at sunrise un imbued un invaded  
comes to a halt before a defender.  
The magnolium knows this,  
that life in it's bolt of fused quartz boxes is as endless as the star.  
  
I saw how farms are blossomed  
by the sanguine juice.  
A raft is not enough to deprive me and keep me  
from the chimney of your iridescent secrets.
