A Cherry
--------
My heart moves from being inaccessible to being plumed.  
You are the insufferable father of a cat,  
the nauesous ness of the foliage, the power of the ice.  
It was the holiday of the ostrich.  
I could promise saliva, heart, and moth  
from propellers and transparent lakes  
with a ultraviolet elixir  
with vigils in my toe.  
We open the halves of a phenomena and the  
lunging of trashes enriches into the real vicinity.  
  
It was the early light of day of the jaguar.  
This muzzled flag and conducting mist decays me  
with it's perfect smooth salts like lip and brow  
and gray warmths of your body like brow and magnoliums.  
  
Pencil.
