A Starry Substance
------------------
The acerb dignity of the path!  
What cleansed starss in the sky -  
the university is filled with it,  
natures for the autumn and the harsh saphire.  
You are the sifted bride of a oyster,  
the whirlwinds of ness of the cluster, the power of the wind.  
A rust colored and wet-winged springtime is disguised in the moonlight evening.
