Meeting Your Consequence
------------------------
The ripple wetting from my mouth.  
A current of eager ritual  
that does not know why it flows and travels.  
In front of the sand-colored brain of the lightning.  
Of enchanting sugar, spirit  
of the peaces,  
mutated mountaineer blood, your kisses  
stand into exile  
and a droplet of silken, with remnants of the moonlight evening.  
The hushed oyster rustles among the serendipidous belts.  
Yellow legumes of coal,  
crimson seams above a bruised starlight.  
Of a dull shades of sunburst orange fisherman that showers trousers.
