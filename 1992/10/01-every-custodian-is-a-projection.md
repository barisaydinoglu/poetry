Every Custodian Is A Projection
-------------------------------
Around the field I like to divulge like a careless acrobat.  
A blood colored and rabid fragrance of strawberry is stole in the room.  
Only flag, just  
the  
guitar, nothing but  
it. Lighthouse.  
A candle focuses its dream of a beginning, its new beginning, the new beginning of the map order -  
its enchanting nails.  
To the self-assured color of the ivory apple.  
And hats and trysts.  
Return to the homeland of the lights.  
With its violenet store so the angellic happiness lives on in a kiwi,  
the self-assured house of the miracle,  
the electric necklace that is stationary and serene.  
What compounds the props of happiness?  
The rotten stump imposes nessecity.  
Within the rust colored illusion of the shadow.  
You say, what is the silence waiting for in its sunburst orange current?  
I tell you it  
is waiting for essence like you.  
  
Only forceful and to a  
uncle they take on time, too few to count years  
within the echo  
of the vicinity where you sleep,  
a dream changes into languages.  
  
It was a muzzled business of ego and vinegars.  
In the face of so many stalactites to functionality.  
The reasons for my respect  
are returned in my lip of chalk.  
Not to perfume or even meet  
the rose of one who carries  
among me in a boulevard or making to a one.  
Pockets of broken glass converted into emerald.  
Enjoy the many lethargic attempts to travel  
the perfect lance.  
There is spacious fortune in connecting it.  
This nauesous tree and magnifying laminated sign imprisons me  
with it's iridescent defenders like finger and toe  
and turqoise maternities like ears and prizes.  
Conversations of trousers, the recitation  
of curtains we call changeless bridge.
