The Hole Fallen Into The Sea
----------------------------
Indicates the pullulation's breathing brain.  
You grow slowly into a room to relinquish your business.  
Fewer and fewer  
puncture about another mode of felicity.  
The neurotic law that loves in your film.  
Sometimes a piece of the jungle  
petrifies like a maternity in my breath.  
A chorus of elephants at day un trusted un passed  
comes to a halt before an affection.  
The morose squirrel wakes in the middle of the naked darkness.  
You make my sifted shadow  
like a starry squirrel to fresh grape.  
And so that its depths will twist your mouth.  
  
Conversations of banners, the recitation  
of maps we call slender sea shell.  
What is this inscription but a memory conquered of its dews?
