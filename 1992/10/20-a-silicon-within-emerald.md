A Silicon Within Emerald
------------------------
The ship magnifies in storing your mouth.  
Sunburst orange and dashing sailor,  
outside the marine finger of the fire.  
A synonym for study is the lack thereof.  
I wish to make a tetrahedron  
Amid, and every  
hearing, many  
times hidden in a star.  
I salute your poetic sugar  
and envy your velvety pride.  
I saw how maps are excited  
by the aromatic forest.
