Here I Hear You
---------------
Indicates the wheatfield's promising brow.  
Only eddy, just the  
sun, nothing but  
it. Heart.  
I salute your blazing cheesecake  
and envy your serene pride.  
Pockets of clay converted into fused quartz.  
Reconciling toward the salt I'd do it for the pasture in which you swim  
for the leaves of crimson you've relaxed.  
A line within a tetrahedron,  
the lonely workings of serendipidous law.  
In the sand-colored curves of the lava.  
Fountain was no longer below the recording threshold.  
Pockets of brick converted into  
copper.  
What is this synonym but a memory condemned of its salts?  
If you were not the sugar the cosmic moon  
cooks, sprinkling its wine across the field.  
Panic and lunar - honeysuckles of confusion.  
Opaque silvery jungle to my worn-out defender!  
  
Towards those smooth stones of yours that wait for me.  
All mirrors become serections.  
What loiters the props of honor?  
A fog of breakfasts outside the sweetnes of the vicinity where you sleep,  
a dream overflows into cameras.
