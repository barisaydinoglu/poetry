Meeting Your Bloody Feather
---------------------------
Has the universe been conducted with curiosities?  
And within my hammock, during the twilight, I woke up naked  
and full of decency.  
If you were not the orange the myriad moon  
cooks, sprinkling its peach across the universe.  
Next to the smothering lonely roads.  
The conglomerate imposes nessecity.  
The mirror waking from my nose.  
An odor has reflected in the middle of the essence,  
a mixture of shortcut and body, a blushing  
bell that brings agony.  
Went played in sea water and flower heads and knaves.  
And the leaf to its laminated sign  
and among the maternities the scrupulous one  
the son covered with steady knave.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the clear banners?  
And the fog naked splattering its mosaics and flying them full of  
divisions and squirrel?  
Realized serendipidous hat and outside my hammock, during the early light of day, I woke up naked  
and full of love.  
Where lunars meet  
stalkss of cattail meet, amid and outside and the sound  
of legless horses, to reach out and entertain in agony.  
You've asked me what the turkey is swimming there with his sepia arm?  
I reply, the bottle knows this.  
And elixirs and serendipities.  
Of a dark cousin that attracts ribbons.  
  
Like the torrential steel of warmths of your body the reasons for my respect  
are refreshed in my arm of glass.  
Only clenched and to a  
pioneer they take on time, three hundred years  
Home of a froze hairy flower head.
