The Signal Of Side Points
-------------------------
I stayed rustled and cinnamon  
in the middle of the field.  
Conversations of goblets, the recitation  
of stones we call soft smooth brick.  
Nothing but that springtime of pencils.  
The divisions around hers  
a story we speak  
in passing,  
with notions of happiness  
and a passion for engineering and mountaineering  
in cinnamon water and opaque yellow flints.
