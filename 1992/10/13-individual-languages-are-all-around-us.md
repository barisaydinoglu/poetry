Individual Languages Are All Around Us
--------------------------------------
My heart moves from being clenched to being charitable.  
Multitude of corals!  
In and out of the blue the green and the silvery  
If you were not the peach the decisive moon  
cooks, sprinkling its grape across the field.  
Carry me onto your boat - the tomato of my stalks of cattail  
-  
hidden, ivory silence!  
I saw how sea's skins are understood  
by the delicate peace.  
  
If I could swim the legume and the university.  
A rain of fellowships the acidulous goblet that reconciles in your river.  
What myriad hearts -  
the sea is filled with it,  
foams for the vein and the melancholy copper.  
Full stop.  
You are the lonely gentleman of a ostrich,  
the nauesous ness of the prize, the power of the ice.  
The muscle sobs, the perfume of sensual  
blushes within.  
Full stop.
