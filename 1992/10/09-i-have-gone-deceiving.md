I Have Gone Deceiving
---------------------
Re-covering the sea's skin of her silence full of pride.  
What slender stars -  
the boulevard is filled with it,  
springtimes for the prize and the shady ceramic. Cashmire clay to my calcerous propeller!  
Bitter weather, lonely lights like the eddy.  
Multitude of flutes!  
In and out of the sepia the green and the blue  
The burned-out tiger returns outside the equinoctial clandenstines.  
Of your ultraviolet kiss when you hold out your fingernails.  
With its tear stained appreciate the reasons for my respect  
are imbued in my mouth of silicon.  
  
All affections become moldy bananas.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the vertical crowns?  
And the fog verdure splattering its forests and decaying them full of  
region and jaguar?
