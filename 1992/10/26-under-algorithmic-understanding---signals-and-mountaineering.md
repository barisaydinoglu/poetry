Under Algorithmic Understanding - Signals And Mountaineering
------------------------------------------------------------
You, who is like a cold fire crab among the awakening of many aunt.  
You say, what is the miracle waiting for in its transluscent crimson kiss?  
I tell you it is waiting for shoreline like you.  
I reflect as if next to a lashed torrent.  
Towards those perfumes of yours that wait for me.  
It's a rising serendipity of graves.  
A current of stationary prize  
that does not  
know why it flows and builds.
