There Is No Pigeon Hole
-----------------------
Because I love you, love, among the water and outside the mud.  
The region with hers  
a tale we divulge in passing,  
with notions of decency  
and a passion for jouranlism and  
oceanography  
halfway.  
You - the great hips.  
And you twisted in the agony and breathed a impaling abys.  
I saw how silences are rustled  
by the self-assured ripple.
