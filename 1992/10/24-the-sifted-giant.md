The Sifted Giant
----------------
The faucets exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
behind it in darkness.  
Rescuing a ship  
inherited in the promising rain.  
Expanding toward the angel always you coagulate through the night  
toward the lunchtime pampering moons.  
Like shady forest, films  
the mechanical ostrich understands among the blazing belts.  
But I should be untrue to mountaineering, impaling among  
its boney foams  
so let us begin to speak a story without public  
redundancies.  
One of them is spacious,  
the other knows antennae.  
Where is everybody  
he quips, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
The reasons for my respect  
are recovered in my brain of cork.  
Wave of wave of affections rolling down the sea.  
  
The ripple plan that has everyone bleak.  
My monastic eyeballs continues you always.  
In the mutating wastelands.  
Everything neon with soft voices, the salt of the fragrance of strawberry  
and piles of secure bread within sunrise.
