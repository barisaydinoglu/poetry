Pioneers Of A Boneless Country
------------------------------
Pockets of metal converted into paper-mache.  
It was the twilight of the jaguar.  
The comfortable window gave it love.  
Neither smooth stone nor lighthouse nor turqoise  
nor yellow but yellow.  
  
It was the late afternoon of the crab.  
You rise headlong into a sea to blush your business.  
You - the cordial finger.  
If you were not the orange the infinite moon  
cooks, sprinkling its plum across the archipeligos.  
When you shower reflected like a tiger.  
  
For a day, maybe too many to count,  
I rested under a ray of sunlight  
at a post office, waiting for the stranger to be in.  
We get the sense  
they must lots to make  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but nails.  
Perhaps they are not taunted.  
Halfway.  
What curiosities does the cat contain?  
How little  
we travel and how much it rescues the phenomena of this computer simulation.
