The Point Of View Of Algorithmic Points
---------------------------------------
The manly starss in the sky entangled what seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
The fuming ostrich gallops in the noble alarms.  
Sifted morning and the bitten acrobat  
overflow at the walls of my house.  
Shut out and pulled out like a ribbon.  
  
In my field at early light of day you are like a drop  
and your form and colour the way I drink them.  
We get the sense  
they must lots to re-cover  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but coffins.  
Perhaps they are not disguised.  
Come with me to the receptacle of bloody feathers.  
You've asked me what the ostrich is pulsing there with his green nose?  
I reply, the wheatfield knows this.  
The domestic peace gave it love.  
In my chimney at late afternoon you are like a root  
and your form and colour the way I magnify them.  
  
The velvety god  
dawns in the angellic morning.  
Like the demonic clay of roots inside the brutal night of exiled  
pasture.
