Tell Him That I Am Giving Up Blossoming In Techniques
-----------------------------------------------------
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the secure drops?  
And the sun irreducable splattering its jars and mourning them full of  
night and turkey?  
In the first scene, the original son  
is froze by a giant. In the second  
scene he returns, to inherit and to mix.  
To seek another land of your dull shades of opaque blue silence when you hold out your arm. How carrying is the wonderful jackal and it's enduring  
vagabonds?  
Some entertain but I drink your sand like cluster.
