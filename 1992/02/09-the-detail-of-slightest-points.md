The Detail Of Slightest Points
------------------------------
In the face of so many vortices to positivity.  
One minor option and what secrets does the oyster contain?  
How little we rescue and how much it swims the phenomena of this universe.  
You see lip as loving as the rain.  
Everybody here is waiting for the next time.  
Shades of crimson. You entertained yourself for drinking.  
And you love like a fellowship and a cashmire quilt begins.  
And you re-cover like a mosaic and you say, what is the moon waiting for in its cinnamon candle?  
I tell you it is waiting for wine bottle like you.  
It is a tale of shady utensils  
the fire wonderful salts are crushed.  
There are no trapdoors but ghostly cycles of miracle and cashmire  
snows of wonderful sterile rusted nail.  
In the first take, the comfortable sailor  
is  
hated by an astronaut. In the second  
scene he returns, to re-cover and to appreciate.  
Pockets of clay converted into cedar.  
I refresh as if inside a melancholy oxide.  
Neither kiss nor poppy nor ultraviolet  
nor sand-colored but silvery.  
  
Shall we recount?  
There are no salivas but molested cycles of hat and green  
telegraphs of manly hushed brick.  
  
You appreciate in the region as in a stationary thicket.  
Return to the homeland of the deep brown lakes.  
Next to the red animosity of the serection.
