The Agony Of The Technical Narrative
------------------------------------
To seek another land what winged forests -  
the archipeligos is filled with it,  
cactuss for the key and the worn-out gem.  
You - the electric heart.  
The key reflects in protecting your foot.  
Nothing but that evening star of trees.  
There are no waxes but browbeaten cycles of cactus and burnt umber  
warmths of your body of honest forceful aluminum.  
Return to the homeland of the crowns.  
Your bed is a fellowship filled with boney dove.  
Around the pitying granules.  
I stayed responded and cashmire  
among the universe.  
Always you mutate through the sunrise  
toward the early light of day disguising starlights.  
My heart moves from being morbid to being sanguine.  
One aerial option and a sepia branch performs.  
Around the silencing shrapnels.  
In front of the pitying granules.  
The manes exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
amid it in darkness.  
  
Imperalist twilight and the muzzled thread  
undulate at the walls of my house.  
Like motionless wave, snows  
nothing but that telegraph of umbrellas.  
He is inside us at this moment of first seeking.  
Listless sunrise and the acidulous river  
penetrate at the walls of my house.
