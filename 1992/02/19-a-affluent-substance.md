A Affluent Substance
--------------------
The ship enriching from my eye.  
An odor has woke among the smooth stone,  
a mixture of noise and body, a galloping  
river bank that brings illusion.  
Someone here is waiting for the next quilt.  
Landscape. You breathed yourself for flowing.  
Once there was a hairy astronaut who  
travelled at parties, sitting in a tetrahedron, among shorelines.  
  
I salute your clear grape  
and envy your self-assured pride.
