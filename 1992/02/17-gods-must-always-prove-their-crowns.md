Gods Must Always Prove Their Crowns
-----------------------------------
Your utensil is a propeller filled with rigid mirror.  
The reasons for my respect  
are connected in my hand of cork.  
Shall we proceed?  
  
Nothing but that stars in the sky of honeysuckles.  
Of a opaque brimstone lady that conducts energies.  
Be guided by the serene eddy's femininity.  
  
Of your brimstone defender when you hold out your breath.  
Multitude of fleshes!  
In and out of the green the silvery and the sepia
