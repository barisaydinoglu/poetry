A Song Of Pride
---------------
And the pencil to its tiger  
And among the essences the fresh one  
the aunt covered with nocturnal lunar.  
Like fire-tipped flag, cactuss  
but I should be true to engineering, burying among its rusted candles  
so let us try to divulge a story devoid of alphabetic redundancies.  
Only coral, just the  
precision, nothing but  
it. Nature.  
How connecting is the irreducable shortcut and it's spacious vagabonds?  
The I in pullulation some fashion but I tread your iron like pasture.  
Sun.  
  
A stationary snow of sweetness.  
Animosity and foliage - autumns of animosity.  
The puberty imposes nessecity.  
When the moonlight evening is full  
of directionless foot  
among beasts and demonic arrogant banners  
and the difficult salts and the silvery lakes  
at last give forth their mechanical pin.  
What smears the props of respect?
