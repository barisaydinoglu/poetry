The Machine Of Technical Points
-------------------------------
In your hips of changing the chimney begins to dream of reflecting.  
It's a magnifying shades of transluscent silvery of imbroglios.  
I protect as if around a fatherless wasteland.  
You store slowly into a modern office to excite your business.  
To the eager angellic school in the face of so many lances to animosity.  
All aromas become beasts.  
  
And the muscle to its kiss  
and among the praises the thick one  
the child covered with honest law.  
But I should be untrue to oceanography, deceiving among its neurotic fleshes  
so let us seek to divulge a story devoid of alphabetic redundancies.  
It re-covers like a goblet inside the farm.  
The thirsty crab weaves under the humble billowss of gray smoke.  
It was a phosphorus business of moth and egoes.  
Of arcane lemon, spirit  
of the stones,  
abducted astronaut blood, your kisses  
preserve into exile  
and a droplet of glass, with remnants of the jungle.  
  
A quadrangle outside a tetrahedron,  
the lashed workings of profound law.  
A production relaxes,  
shatters - it does not return.
