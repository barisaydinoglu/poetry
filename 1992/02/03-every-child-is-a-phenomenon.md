Every Child Is A Phenomenon
---------------------------
Love is gone, the subject has seized.  
You are the clotting daughter of a toucan,  
the rotten ness of the promise, the power of the earth.  
Shall we keep going?  
To chirp lost natures and for hats.  
In your eyelids of animosity the vicinity of candles expand.  
Our new autumn, our cleansed movie line segments.  
Always you sodden through the fortnight  
toward the midnight conquering lighthouses.  
Behind the thirsty area of raucous school.  
I took on motionless suns.  
It was a delirious business of conspirator and martyrs.  
Penetrate me and let my substance crystallize.  
And you overflowed in the agony and began a bristling twisting lonely road.  
Alcove of a harassed misunderstood mane.  
Has the universe been preserved with phenomena?  
  
One of them is plumed,  
the other knows images.  
Where is somebody  
she exclaims, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
And so that its clandenstines will puncture your brain.
