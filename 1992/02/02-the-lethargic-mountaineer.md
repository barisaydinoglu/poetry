The Lethargic Mountaineer
-------------------------
In the smooth iron of the chimney where you sleep,  
a dream chains into productions. Electrical, silk aspen!  
In the first scene, the irreducable cousin  
is entangled by a gentleman. In the second  
scene he returns, to flutter and to reconcile.  
Towards those lunars of yours that wait for me.  
Sometimes a piece of the clay  
abducts like a silence in my brain.  
One grammatic option and my heart moves from being fire-tipped to being manly.  
Outside the turqoise agony of the depth.  
Because I love you, love, in front of the earth and next to the fire.  
For form was hated and morally neutral.  
Your curves relaxes from west to north  
one slightest option and the map drinking from my shoulder.  
Awakening from wayside chalk.
