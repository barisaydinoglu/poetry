Since The End Of Forcing
------------------------
A thunder of maternities a current forming will begin  
the frail mud of a planet. The sweetnes appreciates in rustling your heart.  
The hidden dignity of the fragrance of strawberry!  
There are no coals but decadent cycles of flint and green  
Aspens of poetic worn-out aluminum.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
  
Here I am, a humble hand soddened in the room of grape.  
Light of a silenced muzzled writing.  
Purity is gone, the subject has refreshed.  
When you develop transformed like a cactus.
