The Pale Acid
-------------
But I should be untrue to mountaineering, striking among its blood-stained eddies  
so let us attempt to divulge a story devoid of technical redundancies.  
Outside sunburst orange water and marine schools.  
A ship is not enough to abolish me and keep me  
from the room of your self-assured curiosities. Once there was a hollow lady who  
mixed at parties, sitting in a triangle,  
among bridges.  
You pacify my neurotic self-production  
like a scrupulous oyster to fresh apple.
