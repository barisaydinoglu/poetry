Infinite Theories Of Branches
-----------------------------
The torrential knave that rejoices in your star.  
A language inherits,  
falters - it does not return.  
Which is a delicious film of directions  
million or too many to count, shone  
On a utensil or in the wide coat  
directions of the brow, a calculation in your tails.  
The I in flower your finger reconciles from east to north  
Fashioned and then lived in the land.  
I saw how roses are divulged  
by the sensible utensil.
