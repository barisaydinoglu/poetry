The Oily Fisherman
------------------
I wish to make a quadrangle  
next to, and every meaning, many  
times hidden in a film.  
And a brutal peace's clay will carry you.  
Vaginas of a muzzled airplane  
weaving in front of the area with a lonely bicycle,  
delicious as a directionless oyster.  
A loaf of bread baked with demonic pride and salt.  
Rose and then appreciated in the city.  
Multitude of eddies!  
In and out of the cinnamon the burnt umber and the marine  
the bitterest iguana swims against the clear ashes.
