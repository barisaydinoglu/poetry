An Equally Rosy Pioneer
-----------------------
I do not prosecute in the room of negligent oblivion. The sea next to hers  
a story we tell in passing,  
with notions of purity  
and a passion for oceanography and oceanography  
in the first scene, the electric sailor  
is coddled by a mountaineer. In the second  
reel he returns, to relax and to seize.  
I want you to travel on my eyeballs.  
You - the round breath.  
You begin headlong into a divisions to pulse your business.  
To magnify lost ribbons and for wells.  
When you perfume magnified like a flower head.  
  
A poppy -like ash  
shady weather, browbeaten lights like the quilt.  
Child of the depths of my mouth - your kissing  
stills your sensible regard as though it were fire.
