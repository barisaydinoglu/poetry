It Perfumed With Lighthouses
----------------------------
Your horse is a wine bottle filled with calculating sea's skin.  
Wonderful empire. The tetrahedron functions to reflect an architecture  
to its system.  
Neither lake nor breakfast nor opaque ultraviolet  
nor yellow but crimson.  
Pockets of ash converted into fused quartz.  
Neither wreath nor shades of transluscent burnt umber nor black  
nor sand-colored but green.  
The cleansed old warrior's medals taunted I perfume as if in front of a hairy jugular.  
On what neon dungs circumscribed with jungle?  
You reconcile slowly into a night to love your business.
