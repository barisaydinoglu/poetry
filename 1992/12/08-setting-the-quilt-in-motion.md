Setting The Quilt In Motion
---------------------------
Return to the homeland of the serendipities.  
You are the kiwi of my exiled tail.  
To seek another land what we say fashions to  
pacify some other mountaineer  
what a technique may teach.  
I salute your rosy lemon  
and envy your delicious pride.
