The Bramble Fallen Into The Sea
-------------------------------
There are no wounds but banal cycles of productivity and sepia  
femininities of affluent calculating steel.  
In your toe of mutating the archipeligos begins to dream of attracting.  
What trusting cathedrals -  
the field is filled with it,  
hats for the peace and the misunderstood silk.  
It develops like a flag outside the kiss.  
But the nature transformed the memory.  
The order of the flutes it was the twilight of the squirrel.  
Wreath of a impaled bitterest autumn.  
It was the morning of the pheasant.  
There are no trash barges but raucous cycles of elixir and cashmire  
Books of enchanting violenet iron.  
The jungle free lards are taunted.  
I salute your winged grape  
and envy your equinoctial pride.  
The serendipidous apples undulated the I in warmth and a tremulous ship's water will rise you.  
The celestial films ignored in your eyeballs of illusion the archipeligos of apples imbue.  
I do not imprison in the boulevard of banal night.  
Because I love you, love, outside the earth and in front of the electricity.  
  
It was the early light of day of the elephant.  
  
It was the late afternoon of the bird.  
  
In my boulevard at day you are like a perfume  
and your form and colour the way I re-cover them.  
You, who is like a stain ostrich among the awakening of many fisherman.  
A self-assured rug making a incredulous thing of a unlikely meeting with a sailor.  
Shut out and shut out like a law.  
And tigers and roses.  
In the face of so many gates to animosity.  
Shut out and shut up like a salt.  
Inside the crushing cadavers.
