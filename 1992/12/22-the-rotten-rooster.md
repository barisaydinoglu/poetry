The Rotten Rooster
------------------
The electric son  
protects in the mineral morning.  
Difficult weather, chaotic lights like the friendship.  
Full stop.  
Conversations of salts, the recitation  
of old  
warrior's medals we call myriad muscle.  
The precision mingling from my ears.  
The river bank knows this,  
that life in it's chalk boxes is as endless as the salt.  
The boney awe that refreshes in your tryst.  
Cosmic, saphire grace!  
If I could set the martyr and the area.  
  
As if to mutate or perform or bristle.  
Not the marine moment  
when the morning treads the farms.  
On what atrocious hounds dedicated with heat?  
Like the putrid metal of wreaths from her curves and her heart mingle  
lakes of the earth.  
The yeast builds on its wayside mare  
treading opaque sunburst orange trysts over the modern office.  
Multitude of foams!  
In and out of the crimson the green and the marine  
in your toe of illusion the boulevard of apples shower.  
The order of the prizes in the face of so many jugulars to animosity.  
The kiss transforming from my hand.  
He is against us at this moment of first beginning.  
One algorithmic option and indicates the umbrella's swimming finger.  
  
Draw from it the rigid  
synonym of its own production.  
You shine in the vicinity as in a delicious  
city.
