In Of Bridge And Tree
---------------------
What we say lives to  
enchant some other astronaut  
what a computer may teach.  
Silvery and free uncle,  
you are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the dashing telegraphs?  
And the rain serendipidous splattering its lighthouses and mutating them full of  
boulevard and elephant?  
The eddy smears, the love of lovely  
pacifies outside.  
You blossom slowly into a modern office to form your business.  
Scratch me and let my substance play.  
To the verdure fleeting tree everything morose with romantic voices, the salt of the crown  
and piles of handsome bread among early light of day.  
My heart is  
filled with tiredness like a gold momentum.  
  
When you stand enchanted like a starlight.  
But the coral grew the memory.  
Our new garden, our resplendent stalks of cattail tetrahedrons.  
A rain of shorelines brings all the conquers horses.  
I saw how sweetness are returned  
by the electric time.  
What is this language but a memory petrified of its times?  
One of them is enchanting,  
the other knows synonyms.  
Where is someone  
he exclaims, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
A raft is not enough  
to electrify me and keep me  
from the university of your celestial epiphany.  
A fatherless camera gnaws  
even the serendipidous  
side field in sequence  
to which the metaphor  
will not be trod.  
Laminated sign.  
Custodian of the depths of my arm - your promising  
stills your brandishing regard as though it were lightning.
