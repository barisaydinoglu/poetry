I Expected Mountaineers
-----------------------
The shades of transluscent sepia rustling from my tail.  
You've asked me what the pheasant is playing there with his transluscent cashmire leg?  
I reply, the utensil knows this.  
Not the green moment  
when the afternoon swims the natures.  
You've asked me what the turkey is living there with his blue foot?  
I reply, the muscle knows this.  
When the thicket is full of burned-out curves  
with smokes and ghostly cold perfumes  
and the wayside saxophones and the shadess of crimson  
at last give forth their neon vigil.  
And the crown to its banner  
and among the sea's skins the nocturnal one  
the pioneer covered with romantic garden.
