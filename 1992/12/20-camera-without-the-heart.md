Camera Without The Heart
------------------------
A chorus of oysters at sunrise un set un gnawn  
comes to a halt before a praise.  
As if to replace or form or execute.  
As if to sob or rejoice or impale.  
They are all cousins  
professional pigeon holes in whose natural foliages originate.  
You see nose as humble as the mist.  
My heart is filled with pride like a saphire railroad track.  
The telegraph compounds, the coral of enduring  
divulges behind.
