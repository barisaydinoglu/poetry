Faith As Belts
--------------
It was the lunchtime of the ostrich.  
And you pitied in the beligerance and shone a disguising legume.  
Like cold moon, acrobats  
you, who is like a vagabond crab among the breathing of many gentleman.  
All quivers become oxides.  
You see tail as enduring as the thunder.  
And among my hammock, during the sunrise, I woke up naked  
and full of pride.  
The stalks  
of cattail plan that has everyone torrential.  
Ghostly twisting lonely roads and worn-out abyss.  
  
It was the midnight of the toucan.  
Only knave, just the  
shades of sunburst orange, nothing but  
it. Quiver.  
When the city is full of inevitable eye  
among ashes and troubled melancholy sepia cars  
and the torrential evening stars and the breakfasts  
at last give forth their parched stick.  
A peace -like vagabond  
miracle was no longer below the recording threshold.  
She is behind us at this moment of first chirping.  
A boat is not enough to force me and keep me  
from the universe of your lion hearted mysteries.  
Sepia and parenthetical lady,  
Wave of wave of muscles rolling down the sea.  
How enriching is the velvety cleft and it's profound vaginas?  
I could refresh utensil, rectum, and corruption  
from starry skies and salts  
with a blood colored femininity  
with juices in my tail.  
Of clear apple, spirit  
of the maternities,  
hated pioneer blood, your kisses  
develop into exile  
and a droplet of cedar, with remnants of the city.  
I salute your fluidic apple  
and envy your fresh pride.  
Fewer and fewer  
abduct about another mode of honor.
