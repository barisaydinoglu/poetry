Meeting Your Bramble
--------------------
  
Re-cover on the abyss that wait for you  
devouring the melancholy chairs, brainwashing the doors. I salute your naked cheesecake  
and envy your humble pride.  
Cinnamon heat to my communist time!  
  
A brain and a hand  
blushing the jungle.  
My heart is filled  
with honor like a chalk serenity.  
I stayed rustled and silvery  
behind the area.  
The friendship plan that has everyone sticky.
