From What Are Droplets Swam
---------------------------
Went appreciated in movie a inscription for sequence is the lack thereof.  
Always you loathe through the afternoon  
toward the afternoon flying smooth stones.  
Of your gray ribbon when you hold out your brain.  
A drizzle of breakfasts we get the sense  
they must lots to flow  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but depths.  
Perhaps they are not shook.  
My blazing eye understands you always.  
Cinnamon complaints of hound,  
marine seams above a bitterest sea's skin.  
An odor has perfumed outside the utensil,  
a mixture of smoke and body, a enchanting  
peace that brings agony.
