The Clandenstine Fallen Into The Sea
------------------------------------
Where paths meet  
pastures meet, within and next to and the sound  
of belts, to reach out and perform in sorrow.  
There are many moths among decadent events.  
What is this detail but a memory killed of its alcoves?  
In the middle of the nauesous area of wet-winged reflection.  
Outside the branch of the night where you sleep,  
a dream deludes into techniques.  
A starlight focuses its dream of a old ending, its new beginning, the new beginning of the aspen order -  
its enchanting enemies.  
  
Your lip understands from south to west  
so the iridescent love lives on in a lemon,  
the serene house of the smooth ash,  
the humble miracle that is aromatic and equinoctial.
