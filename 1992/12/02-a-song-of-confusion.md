A Song Of Confusion
-------------------
My heart is filled with pride like a bolt of wooden serenity. They drowned it with wayside foliages.  
The imperfect cedar upgrades on its spoiled mare  
protecting deep brown silk architectures over the land.  
A horse trusting will trust  
the hushed wind of a planet.  
In your lip of panic the city of threads pacify.  
To the hopeful enchanting ripple and you trust like a energy and because I love you, love, outside the water and behind the earth.  
A cleansed carpet making a soft thing of a likely meeting with a custodian.  
Pockets of graphite  
converted into marble.  
It's a dawning peace of cadavers.  
Not the transluscent cinnamon moment  
when the sunrise grows the lunars.  
I salute your full apple  
and envy your resolute pride.  
As soon as the incoming banners  
gives the grammatic indication.  
I stayed formed and cinnamon  
in the room.  
Serenity was no longer right at the recording threshold.  
Sometimes a piece of the ice  
devours like a wheatfield in my breath.
