I Have Gone Pulsing
-------------------
You've asked me what the bird is building there with his  
green foot?  
I reply, the shades of transparent knows this.  
You -  
the resplendent ears.  
Deedy, copper poppy!  
I attract as if in front of a tear stained twisting lonely road.  
Your shoulder travels from north to south  
inheriting a bird feather  
dedicated in the deedy sun.  
Neither stone nor sea's skin nor brimstone  
nor burnt umber but sunburst orange.  
You reflect slowly into a field to play your business.  
Tiredness is gone, the subject has mingled.  
A current of nocturnal shades of marine  
that does not know why it flows and mixes.
