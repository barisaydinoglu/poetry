Breeding Enchanting Affection
-----------------------------
You are the cherry of my negligent leg.  
Someone here is waiting for the next flesh.  
Forest. You magnified yourself for returning.  
A kis focuses its dream of a old ending, its old ending, the old ending of the hoove order -  
its enchanting trapdoors.  
The torrential root is enchanting on your foot.  
Towards those books of yours that wait for me.  
Smooth broken glass of a replaced  
spoiled drop.  
The reasons for my respect  
are divulged in my eye of glass.  
For a day, maybe too many to count,  
I rested under a uncomfortable turbulence  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the mountaineer to be behind.  
I saw how windows are kissed  
by the infinite home.  
Our new muscle, our trusting productivity lines.  
Conversations of lighthouses, the recitation  
of flints we call parenthetical warmth of your body.  
A phenomenon forms,  
invades - it does not return.  
A current of profound pasture  
that does not know why it flows and swims.
