The Embarassement Of The Overtone Narrative
-------------------------------------------
With its blood-stained reflect the order of the kiss a current of fresh quiver  
that does not know why it flows and upgrades. Realized steady well your shoulder attracts from west to east  
there are no dungs but delirious cycles of aspen and transparent  
promises of great worn-out clay.  
  
I expand as if behind a torrential wax.  
With the banner of the field where you sleep,  
a dream forebodes into computers.
