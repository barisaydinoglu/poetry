A Silent Substance
------------------
The utensil imposes nessecity.  
When the night is full of rigid finger  
with brambles and delirious tear stained threads  
and the torrential suns and the defenders  
at last give forth their burned-out bone.  
In the face of so many thorn trees to positivity. In your heart of passing the field begins to dream of trusting.
