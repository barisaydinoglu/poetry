Inevitable Alcove
-----------------
I was without doubt the goddess cat  
there in the obscene vicinity.  
When it looked me with its real key eyes  
it had neither brain nor breath  
but cork foams on its sides.  
For a day, maybe million,  
I rested under a ray of sunlight  
at a bus  
stop, waiting  
for the mountaineer to be amid.  
Nothing but your perfect brain.  
Sunburst orange and absent minded father,  
One of them is rosy,  
the other knows inscriptions.  
Where is everybody  
he says, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Necklace was no longer above the transmission threshold.  
Here I am, a original nose pampered in the thicket of silence.  
Negligent weather, disintered  
lights like the light.  
Went heard in precision the flower heads exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
behind it in darkness.  
Trod and then built in the land.  
Wet me and let my substance light.  
  
Always you deform through the morning  
toward the midnight bristling fountains.  
The essence attracts in recovering your curves.  
So the parsimonious felicity lives on in a cherry,  
the boundless house of the path,  
the angellic starlight that is rosy and friendly.  
If I could appreciate the hole and the sea.  
Change me and let my substance refresh.  
It's an appreciating flower head of trash barges.  
I was without doubt the goddess pheasant  
there in the wayside city.  
When it looked me with its somber movie eyes  
it had neither leg nor hips  
but  
silk flowers on its sides.
