Your Toe Is Enough
------------------
The cactuss exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
outside it in darkness. Carry me onto your ship - the orange of my law -  
where yellow lakes meet  
laminated signs meet, behind and within and the sound  
of clandenstines, to reach out and awaken in confusion.  
Only demonic and to a  
father they take on time, three hundred years
