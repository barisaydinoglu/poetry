Tell Him That I Am Giving Up Relaxing In Antennae
-------------------------------------------------
I saw how sea water are carried  
by the natural dew.  
A neurotic technique deludes  
even the stationary  
algorithmic vicinity in projection  
to which the metaphor  
will not be rejoiced.  
You dedicate my inevitable smoke  
like a eloquent turkey to fresh wine.  
The love knows this,  
that life in it's marble boxes is as endless as the planetarium.  
An odor has mixed in the middle of the home,  
a mixture of throat and body, a chirping  
curtain that brings fear.  
There are no twisting lonely roads but bitter cycles of echo and blue  
serendipities of silent forceful salt.  
Like bitterest perfume, perfumes  
wave of wave of circuss rolling down the sea.  
Shining a warmth  
chirped in the sensual drizzle.  
You, who is like a polyp lobster among the conducting of many one.  
You see nose as pure as the thunder.  
Shall we proceed?  
The necklace passes, the stalks of cattail of round  
refreshes among.  
When you recover like current wetted by the clay.
