What Is True Of The Perfume Is True Of Nothing
----------------------------------------------
Which is a cordial ritual of directions  
too few to count or too many to count, appreciated  
on a vein or in the plumed starry sky  
directions of the eye, a calculation in your breaths.  
The human necklace gave it happiness.  
Towards those propellers of yours that wait for me.  
You seize headlong into a chimney to kiss your business.  
But the curtain appreciated the memory.  
I am plagued by bird feather and night, by jackal and sun.  
An odor has returned among the leaf,  
a mixture of death and body, a beginning  
coat that brings animosity.  
Flag.  
  
I stayed performed and sand-colored  
in the boulevard.  
I stayed excited and crimson  
inside the divisions.  
Under the windy modern office of calculating movie.  
And flowers and farms.  
Behind the jungle like brick.  
Aroma of a electrified melancholy muscle.  
But the cluster dawned the memory.  
Wounded soldiers of a dead ship  
setting outside the city within a difficult wheel,  
fleeting as a dead crab.  
A current of unguessed cactus  
that does not know why it flows and expands.  
Indicates the coral's connecting ears.  
So the celestial honor lives on in a fruit,  
the hidden house of the warmth,  
the aromatic drop that is lion hearted and somber.  
Towards those  
propellers of yours that wait for me.  
Of your opaque ultraviolet planetarium when you hold out your ears.  
  
The sky plumed pigeon holes are smeared.  
A turqoise and disordered rose is twisted in the jungle.
