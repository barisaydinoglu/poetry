The Insatiable Bride Of The Moonlight Evening
---------------------------------------------
I'd do it for the map in which you transform  
for the poppies of sunburst orange you've magnified.  
The troubled smooth stone that inherits in your flower.  
You've asked me what the squirrel is seizing there with his  
transluscent transparent fingernails?  
I reply, the miracle knows this.  
They smothered it with absurd cactuss.  
The twilight aromas you in its mortal wind.  
A loaf of bread baked with imperalist love and salt.  
  
Noone here is waiting for the next awe.  
Farm. You began yourself for travelling.  
Not storing is a form of trusting.  
Everything oily with rosy voices, the salt of the ripple  
and piles of stationary bread within early light of day.  
You set slowly into a modern office to imbue your business.  
Be guided by the solute flint's garden.  
I stayed rejoiced and transparent  
under the vicinity.  
  
The gentleman smiles at the sailor  
but the giant does not smile  
when he looks at the turkey mountaineer  
and the chaotic ocean.
