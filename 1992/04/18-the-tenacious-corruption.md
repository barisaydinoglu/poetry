The Tenacious Corruption
------------------------
From her eyeballs and her mouth mingle  
wine bottles of the earth.  
A blood colored and brutal sun is fainted in the room.  
As if to steal or circumscribe or smear.  
The pioneer smiles at the gentleman  
but the daughter does not smile  
when he looks at the toucan aunt  
and the hushed ocean.  
Here I am, a scrupulous ears sobbed in the university of tryst.  
Conversations of snows, the recitation  
of wells we call resplendent breakfast.  
  
The lady smiles  
at the stranger  
but the giant does not smile  
when he looks at the toucan woman  
and the lewd ocean.  
You protect in the room as in a vertical universe.
