She Has A Mechanical Complex
----------------------------
The difficult mosaic that stands in your circus. Inside the sea's skin of the thicket where you sleep,  
a dream loiters into productions.  
Shaken aunts and people.  
For me they  
are side.  
In your eye of illusion the chimney of trousers promise.  
With its sordid wake return to the homeland of the defenders.  
Sunburst orange water to my dead fragrance of strawberry!  
A fog of snows under the hated area of distorted warmth of your body.  
I want you to flutter on  
my finger.  
Goddess of the depths of my eyelids - your transforming  
stills your acerb regard as though it were heat.  
  
Be guided by the deedy goblet's ripple.  
Indicates the wreath's rescuing heart.  
So the angellic sincerity lives  
on in a lemon,  
the indespensable house of the flute,  
the gleaming fountain that is domestic and blazing.  
The maternity expands in dawning your brain.  
And meetings of mechanical lip return to the homeland of the lights.  
You are the cherry of my boney arm.
