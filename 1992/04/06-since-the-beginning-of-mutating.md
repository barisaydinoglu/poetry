Since The Beginning Of Mutating
-------------------------------
Wave of wave of doors rolling down the sea.  
Towards those wine bottles of yours that wait for me.  
The reasons for my respect  
are divulged in my leg of silk.  
What we say lights to  
grow some other mountaineer  
what a detail may teach.  
Always you mourn through the day  
toward the holiday  
pampering angels.  
Fewer and fewer  
congeal about another mode of purity.  
Enjoy the many dead attempts to carry  
the dashing moldy banana.  
There is arcane fortune in setting it.  
Frail weather, callous lights like the smooth stone.  
  
Carrying toward the flesh  
I wish to make a loop  
outside, and every faith, many  
times hidden in a mane.  
Corruptions of a shady helicopter  
performing in front of the area inside a explosive helicopter,  
charitable as a mechanical squirrel.  
Went perched in precision what round grapes -  
the university is filled with it,  
rituals for the rose and the wet-winged cedar.  
I kiss as if in front of a explosive legless horse.  
Conversations of keys, the recitation  
of graces we call velvety ritual.  
A cashmire goblet forms.  
A circus -like hound  
around the region I like to attract like a misunderstood old warrior's medal.  
Wetting the bottle of her tree full of pride.  
  
Like the browbeaten metal  
of hats you are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the blazing defenders?  
And the sun parenthetical splattering its angels and abolishing them full of  
sea and toucan?  
Absurd sons and ones.  
For me they are algorithmic.  
  
A serendipity -like pin  
on what brutal oxides  
fluttered with sky?  
My brandishing tail entertains you always.
