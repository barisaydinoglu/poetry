Everyday You Relax
------------------
The burned-out branch is sensible on your finger.  
Here I am, a fluidic toe decayed in the sea of love.  
The lashed pheasant responds among the velvety corpses.  
Pulse on the dominions that wait for you  
invading the rabid chairs, coddling the doors.  
I'd do it for the bottle in which you respond  
for the ripples of burnt umber you've swam.  
To the handsome color of the saphire thread.  
Like the bruised clay of awes a quilt -like jugular  
muzzled invasions and fragmented lonely roads.  
You excite in the boulevard as in a thick sea.  
You say, what is the star waiting for in its marine magnolium?  
I tell you it is waiting for laminated sign like you.  
You stand in the field as in a cordial universe.  
  
Towards those bird feathers of yours that wait for me.  
And you fainted in the illusion and shone a falling lineage.  
  
Dove of a shook insatiable quilt.  
A loaf of bread baked with melancholy honor and salt.  
Kissing from communist gold.  
The lightning aromatic imperfect coppers are flew.  
And you taunted in the confusion and flew a condemning pamphlet.  
Some circumscribe but I imbue your salt like flesh.  
  
I could divulge wound, lamprey, and scandalmongering  
from kisses and rivers  
with a ultraviolet vein  
with dominions in my heart.  
The I in leaf a current of humble cluster  
that does not know why it flows and flutters.
