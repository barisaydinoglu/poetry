How To Loathe Pioneer Noses
---------------------------
The browbeaten lobster protects among the nocturnal howls.  
Of a turqoise stranger that re-covers branches.  
And so that its extinctions will invade your shoulder.  
Everything putrid with verdure voices, the salt of the trouser  
and piles of irreducable bread amid day.  
Drinking from demonic ivory.  
Return to the homeland of the doors.  
Only chaotic and to a  
sailor they take on time, twenty-seven years  
How reflecting is the domestic night and it's thick coals?  
It was the sunset of the cat.  
Lunge me and let my substance discover.  
It was the morning of the lobster.  
We get the meaning  
they must lots to play  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but cold fires.  
Perhaps they are not bristled.  
And meetings of calculating eyeballs in the first reel, the original mother  
is killed by a god. In the second  
reel he returns, to recover and to promise.  
  
They are all astronauts  
professional stains in whose delicate goblets originate.  
Like moldy bananas striking with eddies.
