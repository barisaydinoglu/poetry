Hearing As Panics
-----------------
Realized cleansed hoove a clotting well day  
like serections petrifying inside aspens.  
Skeleton women and brides.  
For me they are individual.  
You see brain as human as the fog.  
Amid the red panic of the eternity.  
A hidden carpet making a manly thing of a probable meeting with a god.  
They hated it with dead leaves.  
What we say circumscribes to  
dawn some other mountaineer  
what a sequence may teach.  
You've asked me what the elephant is flying there with his opaque silvery heart?  
I reply, the rose knows this.  
Rising toward the crown be guided by the resplendent lighthouse's friendship.  
I saw how mists are upgraded  
by the delicious well.  
A snow of films a fellowship -like probe  
I am sobbed by serenity and blood, by bramble and sunshine.
