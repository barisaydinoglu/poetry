A Velvety Substance
-------------------
Reflecting from worn-out ivory.  
In the middle of the troubled ribbon, many guilt stenches.  
They penetrated it with troubled doves.  
The pastures exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
outside it in darkness.  
  
Inside the tear stained chimney of torrential film.  
From ocean wave to ocean wave,  
hidden stalkss of cattail drawn by serene channels, a  
calculating moon begins to pacify.  
Indicates the pasture's beginning breath.  
Not the sand-colored moment  
when the fortnight sets the wheatfields.
