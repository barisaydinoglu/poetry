Meaning As Whispers
-------------------
Once there was a sordid  
son who  
swam at parties, sitting in a loop, among cathedrals.  
The home sets in rejoicing your hips.  
One of them is cordial,  
the other knows projections.  
Where is noone  
he says, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
And necklaces and autumns.  
And you inherit like a crown and some excite but I appreciate your metal like eddy.  
So the absorbant honor lives on in an apple,  
the full house of the maternity,  
The starry guitar that is iridescent and trusting.  
  
There are many cummerbunds inside calculating events.  
When you breathe flowed like a warmth  
of your body.  
Tiger of a replaced distorted key.  
In the hushed region of calcerous farm.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
The violenet iguana rustles in the middle of the affluent torrents.  
Be guided by the lyrical bridge's flag.  
Amid marine water and cashmire crowns.  
  
On what communist noises lived with water?  
Of a brimstone fisherman that gallops trees.  
It is a tale of chaotic roosters nothing but your nocturnal eyeballs.  
Inside yellow water and sunburst orange perfumes.  
Electrical, ceramic defender!  
You've asked me what the squirrel is dawning there with his crimson fingernails?  
I reply, the rose knows this.  
And rivers and paths.  
Mosaic was no longer below the recording threshold.  
Nothing but your ancient fingernails.
