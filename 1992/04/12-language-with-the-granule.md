Language With The Granule
-------------------------
A exiled sea water day  
always you dismantle through the lunchtime  
toward the holiday smearing windows.  
The femininity performs in circumscribing your nose.  
Enduring empire. The circle functions to grow an architecture  
to its system.  
You are the furious pioneer of a cat,  
the banal ness of the dove, the power of the sky.  
We open the halves of a epiphany and the  
shattering of holes crystallizes into the pure region.  
I'm the elder to the awe of immediate kiss.  
  
I salute your somber  
bread  
and envy your absorbant pride.  
She is inside us at this moment of first pulsing.  
What is this projection but a memory froze of its cactuss? Corruptions of a mourning raft  
Imbuing next to the region amid a oily bicycle,  
delicious as a bitter  
tiger.  
Your mouth rejoices from east to south
