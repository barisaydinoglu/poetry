The Violence Fallen Into The Sea
--------------------------------
Enjoy the many lashed attempts to rejoice  
the scrupulous yeast.  
There is  
human fortune in reconciling it.  
If I could blossom the eternity and the heights.  
To imbue lost sweetness and for trousers.  
Among cinnamon water and transluscent transluscent yellow defenders.  
  
When the land is full of hollow shoulder  
amid lineages and melancholy atrocious phemonanas  
and the hairy essences and the acrobats  
at last give forth their inaccessible stick.
