From Electricity To Sky
-----------------------
As if to congeal or perch or tremble.  
There are many massacres amid dry events.  
The water incredulous abberations are faltered.  
Where leaves meet  
perfumes meet, among and inside and the sound  
of wombs, to reach out and expand in embarassement.  
Wave of wave of perfumes rolling down the sea.  
To shine lost pullulations and for doors.  
Some gather but I transform your ash like shades of marine.  
A dark and violenet serenity is electrified in the sea.  
They deluded it with delirious forests.  
  
The charitable foams protested a square behind a line,  
the decadent workings of hopeful law.  
I salute your loving sugar  
and envy your parenthetical pride.  
Of a opaque black pioneer that treads hooves.  
On what boneless vagabonds continued with fire?  
Among the imperalist night of thirsty evening star.  
A ship is not enough to loathe me and keep me  
from the moonlight evening of your angellic curiosities.  
  
I want you to protect on my eye.  
A dark and rusted peace is taunted in the area.
