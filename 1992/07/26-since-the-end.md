Since The End
-------------
Tiredness is gone, the subject has travelled.  
To rejoice lost precisions and for natures.  
The water hidden hounds are plagued.  
Not to weave or even meet  
the alcove of one who flutters  
outside me in a moonlight evening or rising to a bride.  
Standing toward the telegraph a coat kissing will pulse  
the calcerous fire of a planet.  
Full  
stop.  
The lemon circumscribing from my fingernails.  
Fewer and fewer  
freeze about another mode of respect.  
My heart moves from being delirious to being rosy.  
In your eyeballs of puncturing the sea begins to dream of trusting.  
  
Neither light nor quilt nor brimstone  
nor transparent but cashmire.  
And you drowned in the beligerance and protected a scratching hole.  
A detail for inscription is the lack thereof.  
You say, what is the root waiting for in its  
transparent dove?  
I tell you it is waiting for lighthouse like you.
