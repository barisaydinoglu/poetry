Hated Trouser
-------------
In the first take, the changeless child  
is filtered by a uncle. In the second  
scene he returns, to awaken and to grow.  
Refreshing toward the droplet a explosive camera penetrates  
even the perfect  
side field in synonym  
to which the metaphor  
will not be showered.  
For propeller was bitter and morally neutral.  
Motionless enemies and ironous oxides.  
And a morbid light's jungle will build you.  
With the heart of the city where you sleep,  
a dream buries into projections.  
  
The reasons for my respect  
are enriched in my eyeballs of fused quartz.  
Green and resplendent child,  
Among the careless chimney of frail trouser.  
The molested dew that reflects in your poppy.  
In your toe of silencing the heights begins to dream of carrying.  
The windows exists even  
when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
within it in darkness.  
Conversations of jars, the recitation  
of suns we call round foliage.  
They are all fishermen  
professional shadows in whose smooth rituals originate.  
As if to decay or set or scratch.  
Towards those times of yours that wait for me.  
Opaque yellow and somber pioneer,  
as soon as the incoming gardens  
gives the algorithmic indication.  
Always you steal through the sunrise  
toward the lunchtime forcing droplets.
