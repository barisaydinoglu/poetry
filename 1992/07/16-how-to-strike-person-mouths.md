How To Strike Person Mouths
---------------------------
The faucet dedicates in protecting your hips.  
Multitude of lakes!  
In and out of the sepia the burnt umber and the opaque sepia  
Your eyelids stands from east to north  
the resolute eddy gave it pride.  
Neither sphere nor reflection nor dark  
nor green but green.  
And a distorted cathedral's lightning will grow you.  
This disordered serenity and inheriting splendor condemns me  
with it's resplendent praises like ears and eyelids  
and rust colored coats like nose and fleshes.  
And so that its howls will brainwash your nose.  
I salute your brandishing lemon  
and envy your affluent pride.  
  
Behind deep brown water and cinnamon affections.  
You see eye as musical as the snow.
