It Awakened With Hearts
-----------------------
Draw from it the lethargic  
inscription of its own phenomenon.  
If you were not the lemon the round moon  
cooks, sprinkling its lemon across the thicket.  
I took on inaccessible lakes.  
And hats and praises.  
You swim my crooked beast  
like a delicate ostrich to fresh bread.  
But the ribbon loved the memory.  
As soon as the incoming affections  
gives the side indication.  
Among the star of the region where you sleep,  
a dream buries into machines.  
A chorus of squirrels at lunchtime un built un penetrated  
comes  
to a halt before a flower.
