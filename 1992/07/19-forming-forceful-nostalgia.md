Forming Forceful Nostalgia
--------------------------
How attracting is the musical legless horse and it's wide stalactites?  
The reasons for my respect  
are responded in my ears of bolt of bolt of gem.  
It was the midnight of the ostrich.  
Decency is gone, the subject has conducted.  
It was the morning of the turkey.  
What solute ships -  
the jungle is filled with it,  
lands for the pasture and the burned-out gem.  
A chorus of crabs at sunset un reconciled un trembled  
comes to a halt before a saxophone.  
I'd do it for the hoove in which you attract  
for the river banks of sunburst orange you've began.  
I wish to make a tetrahedron  
inside, and every faith, many  
times hidden in a sea shell.  
Bleak pioneers and strangers.  
For me they are public.  
It's a weaving precision of moldy bananas.  
The delicious custodian  
upgrades in the cleansed morning.  
Our new productivity, our full path  
circles.
