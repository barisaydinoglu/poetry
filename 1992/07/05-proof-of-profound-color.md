Proof Of Profound Color
-----------------------
And outside my hammock, during the sunset, I woke up naked  
and full of sincerity.  
Everything furious with ancient voices, the salt of the old warrior's medal  
and piles of self-assured bread outside midnight.  
If you were not the bread the wonderful moon  
cooks, sprinkling its plum across the area.  
Draw from it the arrogant  
projection of its own image.  
You've asked me what the jaguar is promising there with his sepia leg?  
I reply, the goblet knows this.  
In the first take, the soft elder  
is condemned by a goddess. In the second  
scene he returns, to preserve and to conduct.  
Pure imperfect saphire mixes the horses how carrying is the serene trash barge and it's infinite lineages?  
Like guilt banner, kisses  
pockets of metal converted into ivory.  
  
Rescuing a warmth  
awakened in the handsome wind.  
Shall we proceed?
