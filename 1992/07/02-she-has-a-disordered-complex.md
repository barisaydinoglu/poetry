She Has A Disordered Complex
----------------------------
Once there was a rabid god who  
enchanted at parties, sitting in a quadrangle, among stars. Draw from  
it the fatherless  
detail of its own projection.  
Be guided by the arcane path's well.  
  
Son of the depths of my heart - your recovering  
stills your poetic regard as  
though it were lightning.  
Like putrid maternity, saxophones  
to seek another land the reasons for my respect  
are seized in my hand of gem.
