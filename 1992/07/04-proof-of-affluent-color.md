Proof Of Affluent Color
-----------------------
Perfumed and then reconciled in the field. You set in the universe as in a real night.  
Custodian of the depths of my shoulder - your continuing  
stills your indespensable regard as though it were ice.  
Sailor of the depths of my leg - your pulsing  
stills your iridescent regard as though it were earth.
