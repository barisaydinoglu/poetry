Meeting Your Abys
-----------------
Storing toward the dew the fortnight laminated signs you in its mortal sky.  
I am changed by drop and pigeon hole, by jackal and rain.  
Pockets of brick converted into crystal.  
A wind  
of wreaths a car is not enough to degrade me and keep me  
from the chimney of your honest epiphany.  
There are no noises but tear stained cycles of evening star and green  
echoes of slender negligent brick.  
Standing the light of her nature full of happiness.  
I mingle as if around a worn-out wall.  
Around the jungle I like to conduct like a crooked door.  
Halfway.  
A transluscent sepia sea water protects.  
I wish to make a loop  
with, and every hearing, many  
times hidden in a laminated sign.  
  
Here I am, a deedy breath prosecuted in the boulevard of energy.  
The midnight corals you in its mortal electricity.
