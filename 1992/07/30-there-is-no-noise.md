There Is No Noise
-----------------
I was without doubt the custodian turkey  
there in the cheerless thicket.  
When it looked me with its fluidic root eyes  
it had neither heart nor hand  
but wooden aspens on its sides. I stayed gathered and green  
among the region.  
Around the chimney  
I like to hear like a clotting flesh.  
A chorus of toucans at midnight un protected un congealed  
comes to a halt before an apple.  
For a day, maybe three hundred,  
I rested under a palm tree leaf  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the giant to be behind.
