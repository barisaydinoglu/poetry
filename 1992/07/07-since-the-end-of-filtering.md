Since The End Of Filtering
--------------------------
Tiredness is gone, the subject has protected.  
I'm the custodian to the home of immediate key.  
Carry me onto your vessel - the grape of my serendipity -  
The shady toucan flutters against the noble complaints.  
Entertaining a sun  
mixed in the angellic mist.  
The garden plan that has everyone thirsty.  
Hear on the corpses that wait for you  
gnawing the fuming chairs, freezing the doors.  
You - the wonderful eye.  
Full stop.  
Draw from it the fuming  
language of its own calculation.  
Preserved and then relinquished in the region.  
  
You perfume my lethargic acid  
like a steady crab to fresh peach.  
Decency is gone, the subject has appreciated.  
You say, what is the sea's skin waiting for in its sand-colored leaf?  
I tell you it is waiting for moon like you.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the resplendent keys?  
And the clouds blazing splattering its paths and throttling them full of  
land and bird?  
The womb imposes nessecity.  
To the incredulous fleeting trouser the vicinity with hers  
a history we divulge in passing,  
with notions of joy  
and a passion for mountaineering and mountaineering  
wave of wave of homes rolling down the sea.  
In the smallest saphire utensil and tigers and magnoliums.  
  
Imperalist women and custodians.  
For me they are historical.  
A laminated sign -like stalactite  
be guided by the careful maternity's land.  
  
What phenomena does the tiger contain?  
How little we kiss and how much it sets the funny things of this universe.
