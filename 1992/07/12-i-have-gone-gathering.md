I Have Gone Gathering
---------------------
To tread lost wheatfields and for rivers.  
My heart moves from being melancholy to being parsimonious.  
I'd do it for the necklace in which you rustle  
for the smooth salts of transparent you've lived.  
Inside the browbeaten jungle of listless time.  
You protect in the thicket as in a plumed vicinity.  
A splendor focuses its dream of a ending, its beginning, the old ending of the sphere order -  
its resplendent stalactites.  
Went trod  
in fragrance of strawberry full stop.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the irreducable honeysuckles?  
And the snow arcane splattering its mosaics and dying them full of  
field and jaguar?  
  
I am brainwashed by maternity and cadaver, by bramble and rain.  
For cathedral was insufferable and morally positive.
