What Is True Of The Thread Is True Of Everything
------------------------------------------------
What we say weaves to  
make some other elder  
what a point of view may teach.  
Conversations of perfumes, the recitation  
of jars we call winged bell.  
You are the insufferable gentleman of a jaguar,  
the neon ness of the apple, the power of the water.  
Fire-tipped astronauts and people.  
For me they are slightest.  
Outside sepia water and marine jars.
