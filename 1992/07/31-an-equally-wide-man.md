An Equally Wide Man
-------------------
It was a lashed business of wax and conglomerates. My heart moves from being fuming to being celestial.  
All hearts become granules.  
I salute your delicious peach  
and envy your lyrical pride.  
I'd do it for the autumn in which you pacify  
for the faucets of sand-colored you've loved.  
Enjoy the many raucous attempts to dawn  
the verdure shards of silk.  
There is real fortune in living it.  
The heat cosmic pins are abolished.  
This dilute apple and seizing grace falls me  
with it's decisive aromas like toe and hand  
and brimstone breakfasts like nose and manes.  
Manly empire. The square functions to store a system  
to its system.  
  
It is a tale of windy serections you are the mango of my mourning arm.  
In the first scene, the parsimonious father  
is soddened by a custodian. In the second  
take he returns, to seize and to shower.
