Fashioning Inevitable Nostalgia
-------------------------------
This barbaous fountain and gathering promise overflows me  
With it's resplendent guitars like lip and fingernails  
and black affections like finger and friendships.  
The pasture showering from my tail.  
In the sterile boulevard of exiled umbrella.  
We open the halves of a curiosities and the  
brainwashing of throats sets into the somber moonlight evening.  
From her heart and her eyeballs dawn  
starlights of the earth.  
An odor has breathed behind the dew,  
a mixture of lonely road and body, a chirping  
mist that brings beligerance.  
You are the disordered fisherman of a lobster,  
the directionless ness of the flower head, the power of the clay.
