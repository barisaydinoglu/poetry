A Grape
-------
Sought and then dawned in the moonlight evening.  
I was without doubt the father cat  
There in the fractious room.  
When it looked me with its decisive flesh eyes  
it had neither foot nor mouth  
but gold aromas on its sides.  
Respect is gone, the subject has rejoiced.  
Nothing but that foliage of propellers.  
  
In your finger of illusion the divisions of shorelines mix.  
It's a mingling ripple of oxides.
