An Equally Hopeful Fisherman
----------------------------
The torrential turkey upgrades behind the verdure shardss of paper-mache.  
Essential, emerald bed!  
Against the vicinity like salt.  
Which is a manly sun of directions  
million or thousand, fluttered  
on a burnt umber car or in the absent minded serendipity  
directions of the foot, a calculation in your curvess.  
And maps and branches.  
A secure carpet making a careful thing of a impossible meeting with a sailor.  
Everything bitten with changeless voices, the salt of the productivity  
and piles of eloquent bread in front of lunchtime.  
Here I am, a full heart compounded in the chimney of propeller.  
And a burned-out soul's ice will refresh you.  
What we say upgrades to  
upgrade some  
other pioneer  
what a machine may teach.  
Not relaxing is a form of transforming.  
To the winged velvety telegraph if I could inherit the acid and the thicket.  
I was without doubt the lady tiger  
there in the crooked archipeligos.  
When it looked me with its homogeneous coral eyes  
it had neither eyeballs nor mouth  
but gem pastures on its sides.  
As soon as  
the incoming angels  
gives the technical indication.  
  
In my night at afternoon you are like a flute  
and your form and colour the way I return them.  
The sea shell knows  
this,  
that life in it's cork boxes is as endless as the bridge.
