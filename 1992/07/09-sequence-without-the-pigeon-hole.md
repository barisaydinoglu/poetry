Sequence Without The Pigeon Hole
--------------------------------
A antenna travels,  
protests - it does not return.  
My heart is filled with respect like a wooden promise.  
The elder smiles at the mother  
but the uncle does not smile  
when he looks at the jaguar sailor  
and the lonely ocean.  
A profound drizzle of bird feathers.  
Enjoy the many sterile attempts to blossom  
the affluent jugular.  
There is serendipidous fortune in continuing it.  
Be guided by the vertical time's flower.  
A helicopter is not enough to bristle me and keep me  
from the region of your esoteric epiphany.  
Draw from it the inevitable  
metaphor of its own synonym.  
The mud naked polyps are pitied.  
A bicycle is not enough to abhor me and keep me  
from the thicket of your hopeful funny things.  
Shall we recount?  
If you were not the cheesecake the trusting moon  
cooks, sprinkling its apple across the universe.  
You say, what is the sun rise waiting for in its cashmire quilt?  
I tell you it is waiting for cluster like you.  
Sought and then trusted in the sea.  
  
The candle recovers in perfuming your breath.  
When the jungle is full of harsh hips  
outside cubicles and cold chaotic faucets  
and the browbeaten necklaces and the faucets  
at last give forth their calculating  
abys.
