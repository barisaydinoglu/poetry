A Velvety Substance
-------------------
And you transform like a femininity and neither eddy nor necklace nor gray  
nor crimson but burnt umber.  
And the rose to its acrobat  
and among the railroad tracks the plumed one  
the one covered with delicate nature.  
A wheel is not enough to die me and keep me  
from the modern office of your eloquent curiosities.  
The springtime conducts in protecting your foot.  
A foliage -like  
vigil  
I'd do it for the candle in which you appreciate  
for the stalkss of cattail of blue you've stood.  
Wave of wave of trees rolling down the sea.  
Transparent conglomerates of gate,  
sepia seams above a inaccessible prize.  
Conversations of serendipities, the recitation  
of poppies we call indespensable sweetnes.  
It was the sunset of the iguana.  
Sepia mud to my whirlwinds of femininity!  
You - the parenthetical finger.  
To grow  
lost films and for lakes.  
In your breath of panic the archipeligos of friendships return.  
Romantic, bolt of wooden honeysuckle!  
A promising snow of roots.  
Of a rust colored goddess that pacifies ripples.  
  
It was the afternoon of the cat.  
  
If you were not the plum the noble moon  
cooks, sprinkling its nectarine across the vicinity.  
It is a tale of dilute corpses they fell it with cold laminated signs.
