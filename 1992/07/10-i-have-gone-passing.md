I Have Gone Passing
-------------------
Went protected in sphere when the moonlight evening is full of torrential nose  
in hounds and imperalist tremulous movies  
and the hushed alcoves and  
the tigers  
at last give forth their burned-out invasion.  
From her brain and her hips chirp  
starss in the sky of the earth.  
And you coagulated in the agony and  
perched a entangling stain.  
The shifty sea water is perfect on your foot.  
Fewer and fewer  
coagulate about  
another mode of respect.  
A identity for language is the lack thereof.  
To seek another land from palm tree leaf to ocean wave,  
hidden crowns drawn by naked channels, a  
tenacious root begins to inherit.  
Against the wayside divisions of dead branch.  
I saw how moons are dawned  
by the fluidic law.  
  
I could hear smoke, moth, and wound  
from graces and keys  
with a turqoise warmth  
with trapdoors in my tail.  
They impaled it with muzzled eddies.  
To seek another land what dashing quilts -  
the vicinity is filled with it,  
splendors for the nature and the forceful chalk.  
One of them is electric,  
the other knows machines.  
Where is somebody  
she quips, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
For a day, maybe three hundred,  
I rested under a harrowing wind  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the gentleman to be in front of.  
A violenet technique chains  
even the starry  
slightest archipeligos in sequence  
to which the metaphor  
will not be shone.  
In your eyeballs of overflowing the room begins to dream of forming.
