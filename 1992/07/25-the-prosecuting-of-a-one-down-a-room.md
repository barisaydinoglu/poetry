The Prosecuting Of A One Down A Room
------------------------------------
A toe and a curves  
treading the universe.  
You see finger as steady as the sun.  
I wish to make a loop  
amid, and every hearing, many  
times hidden in a sun rise.  
My esoteric nose mixes you always.  
  
Multitude of sweetness!  
In and out of the blue the sand-colored and the transluscent sepia  
a current of blazing wave  
that does not know why it flows and makes.
