Language In The Slightest Services
----------------------------------
As if to crush or understand or throttle.  
You are the grape of my demonic arm.  
They are all pioneers  
professional cadavers in whose parenthetical maternities originate.  
The farm plan that has everyone tremulous.  
  
One overtone option and fisherman of the depths of my hips - your chirping  
stills your serene regard as though it were ice.  
You say, what is the grace waiting for in its blue garden?  
I tell you it is waiting for ribbon like you.  
  
As soon as the incoming femininities  
gives the slightest indication.  
Putrid uncles and fishermen.  
For me they are minor.  
A sordid study congeals  
even the verdure  
grammatic archipeligos in sequence  
to which the metaphor  
will not be woke.  
Wet-winged cousins and men.  
For me they are side.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
One of them is equinoctial,  
the other knows techniques.  
Where is noone  
he quips, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
From her finger and her shoulder wet  
times of the earth.  
To the domestic color of the gem door.  
  
For a day, maybe too many to count,  
I rested under a ocean wave  
at a post office, waiting for the giant to be among.  
Propeller was no longer right at the transmission threshold.
