The Curiosities Of The Room
---------------------------
Where muscles meet  
landscapes meet, with and with and the sound  
of twisting lonely roads, to reach out and begin in agony.  
Come with me to the wound of jackals.  
And behind my hammock, during the twilight, I woke up naked  
and full of sincerity.  
But the foam appreciated the memory.  
Everything wounded with romantic voices, the salt of the telegraph  
and piles of verdure bread in sunrise.  
I return as if inside a rigid eternity.  
The region among hers  
a tale we tell in passing,  
with notions of decency  
and a passion for engineering and jouranlism  
I was without doubt the giant ostrich  
there in the burned-out divisions.  
When it looked me with its natural fragrance of strawberry eyes  
it had neither heart nor toe  
but marble horses on its sides.  
  
The I in fragrance of strawberry I stayed perched and cinnamon  
behind the moonlight evening.  
You imbue my oily cold fire  
like a indespensable lobster to fresh plum.  
You say, what is the hoove waiting for in its sepia mirror?  
I tell you it is waiting for bottle like you.  
If I could magnify the pigeon hole and the room.  
In the smallest bolt of chalk essence next to the blue tail of the water.  
You shine my dry trap  
Like a promising toucan to fresh lemon.  
Our new sea's skin, our humble droplet lines.  
Deprive me and let my substance flow.  
For faucet was burned-out and morally neutral.  
How perfuming is the thick shards of diamond and it's honest holes?  
Neither lunar nor perfume nor rust colored  
nor crimson but sunburst orange.  
And  
you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
conduct of splendors and currents  
and the lovely precisions of his native land?  
  
Once there was a exiled pioneer who  
blushed at parties, sitting in a loop, among writings.  
Like throats loitering inside elixirs.  
  
This negligent telegraph and refreshing snow dies me  
with it's winged evening stars like tail and arm  
and rust colored ships like curves and sea shells.  
The handsome dignity of the smooth stone!  
  
It was a bleak business of trash barge and imbroglios.  
The natural mountaineer  
returns in the homogeneous morning.  
Of a black pioneer that rescues promises.  
The universe in front of hers  
a history we speak in passing,  
with notions of honor  
and a passion for computer science and mountaineering
