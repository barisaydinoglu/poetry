Your Mouth Is Enough
--------------------
  
Fly on the smokes that wait for you  
deforming the barbaous chairs, passing  
the doors.  
It begins like a saxophone outside the wreath.  
The thirsty friendship that flies in your land.  
A rain of lands brings all the deforms miracles.  
  
It's a wetting springtime of massacres.
