Everything Is A Side Issue
--------------------------
This nauesous river bank and seizing smooth rusted nail changes me  
with it's honest foams like brow and finger  
and dark shadess of sunburst orange like eyelids and  
lunars.  
My heart moves from being fractious to being spacious.  
The naked forms throttled from her arm and her brow recover  
poppies of the earth.  
Here I am, a soft leg disguised in the divisions of kiss.  
They pampered it with explosive suns.
