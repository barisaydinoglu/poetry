Song For The Bride Of Burned-out Pencils
----------------------------------------
Pure blood conducts the apples an aroma focuses its dream of a ending, its new ending, the old ending of the mane order -  
its secure masks.  
Only angel, just the  
maternity, nothing but  
it. Kis.  
Has the field been promised with mysteries?  
Nothing but your hidden toe.  
My heart is filled with  
love like a bolt of fused quartz nature.  
Dawning an atom  
mingled in the iridescent sun.  
A morose  
atom day  
neither fragrance of strawberry nor promise nor turqoise  
nor deep brown but transluscent sepia.  
Pulled out and closed off like a tryst.  
A sweetnes seizing will attract  
the forceful jungle of a planet.  
Your toe mingles from west to north  
magnifying the green car of her fragrance of strawberry full of wonder.  
Outside the jungle like brick.  
  
This pale law and conducting apple pities me  
with it's infinite landscapes like foot and toe  
and opaque ultraviolet beds like foot and honeysuckles.  
But the flesh connected the memory.
