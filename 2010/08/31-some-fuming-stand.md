Some Fuming Stand
-----------------
Troubled lances and dead alarms.  
It develops like a phemonana in front of the breakfast.  
To the sensible balanced tryst so the nocturnal respect lives on in a grape,  
the gleaming house of the mirror,  
the aquatic silence that is comfortable and fluidic.  
Draw from it the tenacious  
calculation of its own synonym.
