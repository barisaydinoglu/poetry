I Have Gone Abandoning
----------------------
In my sea at late afternoon you are like a light  
and your form and colour the way I perch them. Our new circus, our slender kis triangles.  
One of them is celestial,  
the other knows points of view.  
Where is noone  
he says, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
In your ears of panic the region of knaves develop.  
In your foot of pitying the moonlight evening begins to dream of dawning.
