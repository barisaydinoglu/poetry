The Legless Horse Fallen Into The Sea
-------------------------------------
Because I love you, love, amid the ice and among the electricity.  
Once there was a fuming pioneer who  
recovered at parties, sitting in a tetrahedron, among doors.  
You - the velvety nose.  
  
Cinnamon and eloquent stranger,  
a loaf of bread baked with fire-tipped purity and salt.  
The heart imposes nessecity.  
  
This cheerless sun rise and setting utensil penetrates me  
with it's hidden rituals like brow and heart  
and turqoise dews like lip and clusters.  
I want you to gather on my mouth.  
The aquatic dignity of the juice! A calculation builds,  
drowns - it does not return.  
I salute your fluidic wine  
and envy your incredulous pride.  
Yellow earth to my sordid serendipity!  
Silvery vigils of alarm,  
opaque sepia seams above a clenched umbrella.  
A antenna flows,  
kills - it does not return.  
You see tail as plumed as the sunshine.  
Shut  
out and closed off like a tiger.
