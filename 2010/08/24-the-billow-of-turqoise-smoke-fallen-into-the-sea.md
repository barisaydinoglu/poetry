The Billow Of Turqoise Smoke Fallen Into The Sea
------------------------------------------------
One side option and frightened night and the disintered kis  
tremble at the walls of my house.  
Only blood-stained and to a  
one they take on time, too many to count years  
With the yellow hand of the jungle.  
In the silvery hand of the jungle.  
Full stop.  
Like the dead broken glass of flutes around the plaguing havocs.  
Everybody here is waiting for the next maternity.  
Rose. You excited yourself for shining.  
You, who is like a croak pheasant among the mixing of many bride.  
Towards those maternities of yours that wait for me.  
  
You are the shifty lady of a toucan,  
the rustling ness of the warmth, the power of the heat.  
You recover slowly into a jungle to perform your business.
