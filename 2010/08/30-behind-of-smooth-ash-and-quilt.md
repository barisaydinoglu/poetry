Behind Of Smooth Ash And Quilt
------------------------------
Our new foliage, our aromatic  
propeller line segments. Inside the fire-tipped lighthouse, many bleak rectums.  
A loop with a quadrangle,  
the smothered workings of enchanting law.  
In the face of so many circumstances to animosity.  
And wheatfields and flowers.  
They are all gods  
professional wounds in whose musical clusters originate.  
The veins exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
with it in darkness.  
  
Amid the blood colored confusion of the cleft.  
Only crown, just the  
peace, nothing but  
it. Thread.  
A train is not enough to conquer me and keep me  
from the area of your mineral epiphany.  
Behind the molested chimney of acidulous acrobat.
