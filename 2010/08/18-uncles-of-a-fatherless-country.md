Uncles Of A Fatherless Country
------------------------------
She is among us at this moment of first rescuing.  
Conversations of elixirs, the recitation  
of mists we call humble railroad track.  
The fortnight natures you in its mortal clay.  
Halfway.  
  
You see eyelids as mineral as the sunshine.  
If you were not the cheesecake the trusting moon  
cooks, sprinkling its sugar across the universe.
