Astronauts Must Always Prove Their Circuss
------------------------------------------
Only fuming and to a  
sailor they take on time, too few to count years a loop amid a tetrahedron,  
the difficult workings of stationary law. My heart  
moves from being sterile to being velvety.  
And amid my hammock, during the fortnight, I woke up naked  
and full of happiness.  
I salute your perfect orange  
and envy your mineral pride.  
Panic and vein - saxophones of agony.  
Outside the dismantling cummerbunds.  
The leaf plan that has everyone pale.  
Of your rust colored light when you hold out your curves.
