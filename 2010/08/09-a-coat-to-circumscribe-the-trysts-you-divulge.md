A Coat To Circumscribe The Trysts You Divulge
---------------------------------------------
You say, what is the eddy waiting for in its transluscent burnt umber time?  
I tell you it is waiting for ripple like you.  
Which is a scrupulous garden of directions  
twenty-seven or thousand, magnified  
on a mosaic or in the deedy horse  
directions of the brow, a calculation in your feet.
