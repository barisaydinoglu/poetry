The Disguising Of A Fisherman Down A Chimney
--------------------------------------------
Conversations of bird feathers, the recitation  
of manes we call natural perfume.  
Of musical lemon, spirit  
of the starss in the sky,  
overflowed person blood, your kisses  
chirp into exile  
and a droplet of diamond, with remnants of the area.  
Behind cashmire water and transparent pullulations.  
I could hear alarm, croak, and cubicle  
from wreaths and paths  
with a red rose  
with granules in my eye.  
Of a opaque opaque dark lady that hears books.  
And so that its trashes will tremble your eyeballs.  
Cashmire fire to my rigid stone!  
Sand-colored and incredulous bride,  
when you make set like a flower head.  
My heart moves from being tremulous to being poetic.
