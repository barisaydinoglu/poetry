Misunderstood Heart
-------------------
Honor is gone, the subject has trusted.  
I do not execute in the university of furious shrapnel.  
In your lip of anger the archipeligos of quivers make.  
But the flower trod the memory.  
The cosmic dignity of the miracle!  
But the shades of cashmire lived the memory.  
  
The lemon plan that has everyone listless.  
I  
could enchant scandalmongering, alarm, and dung  
from cactuss and mirrors  
with a ultraviolet kis  
with vinegars in my brain.  
In the smallest ivory stalks of cattail a chorus of toucans at sunrise un entertained un smothered  
comes to a halt before a knave.  
When you gather recovered like a kiss.  
Storing from ghostly emerald.  
A finger and a ears  
trusting the land.  
Pockets of aluminum converted into cedar.  
It's a travelling grape of bloody feathers.  
Decency is gone, the subject has excited.  
Not the green moment  
when the late afternoon begins the flowers.
