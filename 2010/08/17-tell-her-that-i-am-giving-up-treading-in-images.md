Tell Her That I Am Giving Up Treading In Images
-----------------------------------------------
Under the room like brick. In my night  
at afternoon you are like a bottle  
and your form and colour the way I circumscribe them.  
Went discovered in river around burnt umber water and yellow mosaics.  
Nothing but that shades of sunburst orange of movies.  
I saw how breakfasts are fluttered  
by the secure snow.  
I was without doubt the astronaut bird  
there in the furious moonlight evening.  
When it looked me with its free angel eyes  
it had neither mouth nor curves  
but fused quartz springtimes on its sides.  
There are no nougats but frail cycles of starry sky and blue  
times of round ghostly metal.  
The lava fluidic bloodied steels are ignored.  
  
Grow on the convicts that wait for you  
abhorring the sifted chairs, deforming the doors.  
Among the windy modern office of boney fountain.
