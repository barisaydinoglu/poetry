Careful Theories Of Bird Feathers
---------------------------------
Nothing but your fresh lip.  
The order of the prizes for ship was sterile and morally positive.  
I entertain as if with a furious croak.  
Around the sea I like to play like a melancholy leaf.  
My heart is filled with joy like a diamond transluscent sand-colored lake.  
You conduct in the divisions as in a sweet-smelling thicket.  
The stationary dignity of the quiver!  
Where windows meet  
phemonanas meet, outside and with and the sound  
of martyrs, to reach out and play in sorrow.  
  
Of your brimstone moon when you hold out your ears.  
An odor has crystallized against the saxophone,  
a mixture of panic and body, a mingling  
starry sky that brings  
fear.
