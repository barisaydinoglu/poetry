Breeding Boundless Affection
----------------------------
The reasons for my respect  
are attracted in my brain of marble.  
A sunburst orange candle stores.  
A chorus of cats at late afternoon  
un heard un died  
comes to a halt before a pullulation.  
We get the color  
they must lots to discover  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but pigeon holes.  
Perhaps they are not dropped.  
You - the electric lip.  
Not appreciating is a form of awakening.  
One of them is human,  
the other knows languages.  
Where is nobody  
he quips, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
My heart is filled with honor like a cedar pasture.  
Warm, gold moon!  
The path harasses, the soul of great  
attracts behind.  
Animosity and circus - dews of anger.  
  
To appreciate lost river banks and for ships.
