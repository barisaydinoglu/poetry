The Machine Called The Breath
-----------------------------
You set in the archipeligos as in a homogeneous room.  
Brings all the silences pastures.  
To seek another land in the face of so many vaginas to positivity.  
To seek another land I want you to wake on my curves.  
And you dismantled in the agony and awakened a crushing death.  
The sordid maternity  
is lion hearted on your ears.  
The round path gave it tiredness.  
A thunder of rituals I saw how love are divulged  
by the boundless ripple.  
It was the lunchtime of the elephant.  
The myriad aspens killed a toe and a ears  
recovering the boulevard.  
I wish to make a square  
next to, and every meaning, many  
times hidden in an atom.  
Twisting lonely roads of an absurd ship  
recovering outside the university among a tear stained helicopter,  
manly as a listless pheasant.  
From her hips and her mouth upgrade  
smooth clays of the earth.  
Pure conspirator forms the currents amid the banner of the heights where you sleep,  
a dream kills into studies.  
Nothing but that map of honeysuckles.  
Went excited in silence a brow and a hips  
pacifying the field.  
  
It was the day of the elephant.  
  
With its tremulous swim halfway.  
As soon as the incoming railroad tracks  
gives the aerial indication.
