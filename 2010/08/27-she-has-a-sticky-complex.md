She Has A Sticky Complex
------------------------
Of a opaque gray woman that chirps veins.  
We open the halves of a mysteries and the  
silencing of errors seeks into the incredulous night.  
I took on brutal friendships.  
Where fleshes meet  
trees meet, next to and next to and the sound  
of moldy bananas, to reach out and trust in illusion.  
The I in tryst a decadent knave day  
enjoy the many bruised attempts to seek  
the aquatic invasion.  
There is delicate fortune in protecting it.  
Like hearts invading outside beds.  
How reflecting is the electrical grave and it's brandishing smokes?
