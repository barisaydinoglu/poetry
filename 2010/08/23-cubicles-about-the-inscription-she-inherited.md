Cubicles About The Inscription She Inherited
--------------------------------------------
Rabid mothers and ones.  
For me they are technical. To the round homogeneous deep brown lake panic and well - wine bottles of beligerance.  
Return to the homeland of the trysts.  
  
A raucous image compounds  
even the enduring  
neutral heights in image  
to which the metaphor  
will not be heard.  
The thicket behind hers  
a history we tell in passing,  
with notions of pride  
and a passion for computer science and oceanography  
in your toe of freezing the archipeligos begins to dream of enchanting.  
The ghostly cat magnifies in the middle of the homogeneous shadows.  
A ship is not enough to wet me and keep me  
from the divisions of your verdure epiphany.  
Weaving the salt of her moon full of decency.  
  
To the moonlit color of the cork  
precision.  
Pioneer of the depths of my tail - your fluttering  
stills your irreducable regard as though it were earth.
