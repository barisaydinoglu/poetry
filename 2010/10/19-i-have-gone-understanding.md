I Have Gone Understanding
-------------------------
Noone here is waiting for the next flower.  
Ritual. You mixed yourself for flowing. I saw how silences are awakened  
by the mineral rose. The hoove living from my mouth.  
When you respond heard like a warmth.  
Fewer and fewer  
sodden about another  
mode of love.  
But I should be true to engineering, soddening among its  
sticky suns  
so let us begin to tell a story without grammatic redundancies.  
You swim in the region as in a solute sea.  
In the face of so many cubicles to positivity.  
In the face of so many croaks to animosity.
