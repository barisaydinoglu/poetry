Since The End Of Rising
-----------------------
A muscle focuses its dream of a new ending, its new beginning, the ending of the flint order -  
its acerb imbroglios.  
Only map, just the  
flute, nothing but  
it. Fountain.  
You've asked me what the ostrich is drinking there with his crimson fingernails?  
I reply, the flag knows this.  
But I should be untrue to mountaineering, loitering among its decadent planetariums  
so let us attempt to divulge a story without slightest redundancies.  
Sometimes a piece of the earth  
smothers like a quilt in my hand.  
A square in front of a loop,  
the guilt workings of handsome law.
