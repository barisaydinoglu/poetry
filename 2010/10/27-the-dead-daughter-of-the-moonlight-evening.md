The Dead Daughter Of The Moonlight Evening
------------------------------------------
Nothing but that quiver of roses.  
I took on harsh currents.  
Indicates the foam's continuing brain.  
I wish to make a line segment  
among, and every meaning, many  
times hidden in a precision.  
Of delicate plum, spirit  
of the starss in the sky,  
undulated mountaineer blood, your kisses  
wet into exile  
and a droplet of silk, with remnants of the room.  
Like the bitten aluminum of candles  
connect on the errors that wait for you  
prosecuting the morbid chairs, pampering the doors.  
Not growing is a form of enriching.  
I saw how pastures are mingled  
by the free ship. The springtimes exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
outside it in darkness.
