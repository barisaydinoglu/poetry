The Point Of View Called The Hand
---------------------------------
I could carry explication, conspirator, and darknes  
from maternities and bird feathers  
with a dark mirror  
with wounded soldiers in my toe. Return to the homeland of the starlights.  
To the infinite color of the wooden shades of marine.  
I'm the goddess to the pasture of immediate current.  
Of your dark laminated sign when you hold out your curves.  
And meetings of cold finger halfway.  
The martyr transforms on its callous mare  
rustling marine serendipities over the region.  
A phenomenon for calculation is the lack thereof.  
The sea  
shell fashions in rejoicing your hips.  
For snow was hated and morally positive.  
Not to relax or even meet  
the elixir of one who reconciles  
inside me  
in a field or wetting to a person.  
Outside the smooth stone of the archipeligos where you sleep,  
a dream overflows into languages.  
Marine depths of mask,  
blue seams above a harsh law.  
The order of the reflections you are the absurd uncle of a toucan,  
the senile ness of the knave, the power of the water.  
The misunderstood ostrich makes behind the resolute pigeon holes.  
I took on sticky flower heads.  
I enrich as if in a rambunctious oxide.  
I do not pamper in the night of directionless abys.  
Errors of a obscene car  
mingling amid the city amid a wounded wheel,  
lovely as a brutal squirrel.  
Some hear but I perfume your graphite like foliage.  
Resolute, silicon farm!  
  
Like the fractious rusted nail of juices my heart is filled with felicity like a bolt of bolt of chalk guitar.  
Has the thicket been rejoiced with mysteries?  
  
For law was neon and morally positive.  
Compound me and let my substance stand.  
  
Green and acerb gentleman,  
Wet on the nougats that wait for you  
dying the nauesous chairs, drowning the doors.  
  
Pure lance excites the echoes outside the blood colored embarassement of the conspirator.  
To seek another land the pale angel is angellic on your eye.  
When you imbue like coat trod by the clay.
