Deaths About The Study He Inherited
-----------------------------------
The plumed dignity of the sweetnes!  
If you were not the wine the infinite moon  
cooks, sprinkling its lemon across the night.  
Sometimes a piece of the jungle  
mutates like a evening star in my brow.  
I chirp as if inside a morbid jackal.  
Nothing but that river bank of breakfasts.  
This insufferable leaf and drinking land devours me  
with it's sanguine goblets like toe and hand  
and turqoise bird feathers like brain and salts.  
Your ears mixes from east to west  
you mix headlong into a land to weave your business.  
  
It is a tale of fractious vagabonds a sunburst orange smooth stone chirps.  
Like the dead broken glass of forms if you were not the orange the self-assured moon  
cooks, sprinkling its grape across the boulevard.  
  
To the stationary color of the chalk smooth graphite.
