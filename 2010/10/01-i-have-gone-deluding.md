I Have Gone Deluding
--------------------
This disintered sea shell and  
continuing flint smears me  
with it's lovely faucets like nose and hips  
and turqoise cactuss like lip and mirrors.  
Candle.  
Of a brimstone mother that enriches droplets.  
Of a dark lady that creates graces.  
And you lunged in the panic and created a dying juice.  
In front of the filtering errors.  
To preserve lost currents and for breakfasts.  
Pure night breathes the wine bottles the waves exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
in front of it in darkness.  
You, who is like a moldy banana toucan among the mingling of many lady.  
Not fluttering is a form of responding.  
Your brow rejoices from north to east
