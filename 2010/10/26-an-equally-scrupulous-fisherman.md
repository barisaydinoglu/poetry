An Equally Scrupulous Fisherman
-------------------------------
I'd do it for the tree in which you shower  
for the movies of green you've appreciated. What is this study but a memory smothered of its kisses?  
Chaotic whispers and fragmented lonely roads.  
I am lunged by magnolium  
and polyp, by ash and drizzle.
