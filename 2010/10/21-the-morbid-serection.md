The Morbid Serection
--------------------
Of your red horse when you hold out your eyeballs.  
I was without doubt the god oyster  
there in the directionless chimney.  
When it looked me with its boundless propeller eyes  
it had neither hand nor finger  
but gold wreaths on its sides.  
  
A study swims,  
prosecutes - it does not return.  
A transluscent transluscent transparent banner lives.  
Shall we move on?  
I am electrified by energy and viola, by yeast and clouds.  
Green and ancient one,  
the nail blushes on its bruised mare  
galloping cashmire lemons over the vicinity.  
Only lonely and to a  
lady they take on time, too few to count years  
  
There ought to be a sea's skin of a noble maternity protecting in a vicinity.  
I saw how sea's skins are woke  
by the resolute snow.  
As if to plague or light or dismantle.  
Among the dark beligerance of the martyr.
