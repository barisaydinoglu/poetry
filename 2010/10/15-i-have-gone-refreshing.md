I Have Gone Refreshing
----------------------
  
Transform on the massacres that wait for you  
erupting the obscene chairs, twisting the doors. Not magnifying is a form of building.  
Everything browbeaten with great voices, the salt of the perfume  
and piles of iridescent bread within twilight.  
Once there was a sordid uncle  
who  
dedicated at parties, sitting in a loop, among apples.  
So the scrupulous pride lives on in a fruit,  
the hopeful house of the warmth,  
the angellic  
heart that is somber and smooth.  
What decays the props of pride?  
Realized naked juice always you abduct through the midnight  
toward the night erupting currents.  
From ocean wave to uncomfortable turbulence,  
hidden smooth stones drawn by hidden channels, a  
boneless echo begins to inherit.  
  
My domestic finger sets you always.  
A soft linoleum making a domestic thing of a likely meeting with a bride.
