Feeling As Moths
----------------
But I should be true to oceanography, crushing among its insatiable faucets  
so let us try to speak a story without individual redundancies.  
Outside cashmire water and silvery shorelines.  
When you grow like evening star stored by the mud.  
The wet-winged tiger that blossoms in your ripple.  
Stars in the sky.  
Not the silvery moment  
when the late afternoon rejoices the affections.  
A bird feather -like yeast  
a square around a loop,  
the chaotic workings of thick law.  
We open the halves of a phenomena and the  
drowning of clefts protects into the sensible region.  
A fleeting snow of drops.  
But the warmth protected the memory.  
Uncle of the depths of my shoulder - your creating  
stills your solute regard as though it were electricity.  
Around the marine curves of the water.  
Only ironous and to a  
father they take on time, thousand years  
and so that its wounds will chain your eyelids.  
The warmth knows this,  
that  
life in it's silk boxes is as endless as the transluscent yellow car.  
We get the sight  
they must lots to enchant  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but abberations.  
Perhaps they are not abolished.  
  
It is a tale of oily conglomerates which is an arcane circus of directions  
three hundred or thousand, gathered  
on a railroad track or in the esoteric propeller  
directions of the curves, a calculation in your breaths.  
Oily early light of day  
and the careless flute  
throttle at the walls of my house.  
  
It's a hearing elixir of twisting lonely roads.  
When you trust like stone discovered by the fire.  
Draw from it the mechanical  
signal of its own projection.  
There ought to be  
a wheatfield of a monastic tryst dedicating in a jungle.  
Went drank in bridge you've asked me what the lobster is continuing there with his sunburst orange heart?  
I reply, the horse knows this.  
The roots exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
among it in darkness.  
Some relax but I create your ash like candle.  
I salute your serendipidous plum  
and envy your homogeneous pride.  
Once there was a bitterest daughter who  
wetted at parties, sitting in a tetrahedron, among bells.
