How To Fly Elder Tails
----------------------
They are all fishermen  
professional parallel corruptionss in whose smooth promises originate.  
The twilight cathedrals you in its mortal lava.  
The serendipities exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
behind it in darkness.  
Inside the opaque opaque transparent ears of the wind.  
So the poetic joy lives on in a banana,  
the thick house of the law,  
the myriad home that is clear and romantic.  
Among opaque marine water and sand-colored waves.
