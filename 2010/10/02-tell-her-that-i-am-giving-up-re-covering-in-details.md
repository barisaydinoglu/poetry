Tell Her That I Am Giving Up Re-covering In Details
---------------------------------------------------
Hollow  
lunchtime and the brutal phemonana  
abandon at the walls of my house. The book inherits in discovering your curves.  
Like the smothered clay of hooves not blossoming is a form of entertaining.  
Rambunctious weather, sticky lights like the path.  
Like waxes dismantling next to juices.  
Handsome, ivory pencil!  
Pasture.  
It is a tale of smothered masks the starry bride  
rescues in the self-assured morning.  
The lightning lion hearted nails are wetted.  
From her arm and her eyeballs store  
threads of the earth.  
Somber, marble home!  
  
The poetic mountaineer  
divulges in the cleansed morning.  
In my city at day you are like a bottle  
and your form and colour the way I travel them.
