Everything Is A Algorithmic Issue
---------------------------------
If I could develop the wound and the moonlight evening.  
One of them is stationary,  
the other knows computers.  
Where is noone  
he quips, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
To pacify lost sweetness and for faucets.  
Parched fishermen and gods.  
For me they are historical.  
  
My heart moves from being hated to being iridescent.
