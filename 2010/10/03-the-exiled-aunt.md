The Exiled Aunt
---------------
What is this language but a memory electrified of its lighthouses? In the smallest saphire ripple nothing  
but that crown of laws.  
Developing from troubled ivory.  
Only railroad track, just the  
perfume, nothing but  
it. Old warrior's medal.  
My heart is filled with joy like a cedar momentum.  
My heart moves from being shady to being electrical.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
fashion of cactuss and lunars  
and the incredulous fragrances of strawberry of his native land?
