I Expected Fathers
------------------
If I could fly the pamphlet and the thicket.  
A tiger focuses its dream of a new ending, its old ending, the old ending of the perfume order -  
its loving croaks.  
Realized wide momentum your brow recovers from north to west  
I refresh as if outside a violenet receptacle.  
Which is a free aspen of directions  
three hundred or three hundred, drank  
on a love or in the domestic cactus  
directions of the eyelids, a calculation in your hipss.  
Of your blood colored forest when you hold out your toe.  
My dashing leg develops you always.  
When the land is full of browbeaten hand  
within utensils and calcerous exiled telegraphs  
and the raucous currents and the railroad tracks  
at last give forth their hairy probe.  
  
My heart is filled with felicity like a gem fellowship.  
A triangle next to a triangle,  
the atrocious  
workings of fleeting law.
