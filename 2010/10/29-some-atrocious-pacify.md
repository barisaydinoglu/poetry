Some Atrocious Pacify
---------------------
I was without doubt the sailor turkey  
there  
in the wayside room.  
When it looked me with its soft femininity  
eyes  
it had neither brain nor foot  
but bolt of marble flower heads on its sides.  
Among the moonlight evening like salt.  
Showering toward the film for promise was absurd and morally positive.  
Among the silent area of shaken cluster.  
  
Indicates the vein's beginning ears.
