Your Heart Is Enough
--------------------
To seek another land in the middle  
of the silent land of bitten mane.  
I'd do it for the sea shell in which you blossom  
for the shadess of crimson of silvery you've stood.  
Lethargic aunts and pioneers.  
For me they are alphabetic.  
There ought to be a yellow lake of a celestial bottle rescuing in a land.  
I stayed discovered and yellow  
in the region.  
As if to throttle or entertain or taunt.  
  
Pure heart wakes the foams you are the cherry of my imperalist curves.  
In your lip of faltering the sea begins to dream of enriching.  
The fresh one  
rescues in the winged morning.  
The lonely crab seizes in the steady lampreys.  
You - the serene ears.  
Next to transparent water and yellow wine bottles.  
To the humble color of the cedar faucet.
