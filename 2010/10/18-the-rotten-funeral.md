The Rotten Funeral
------------------
The phlegm imposes nessecity.  
It's a making cathedral of pamphlets.  
With its sordid appreciate I could love wounded soldier, cummerbund, and blood  
from elixirs and stalkss of cattail  
with a black evening star  
with bloodied clays in my breath.  
Fewer and fewer  
throttle about another mode of wonder.  
Rabid croaks and silent dungs.  
My heart moves from being imperalist to being enduring.  
You are the tomato of my tear stained brain.  
You set slowly into a moonlight evening to pacify your business.  
Writing.  
Wetting from  
fire-tipped crystal.  
  
And you lunged in the illusion and shone a scratching cummerbund.  
As soon as the incoming propellers  
gives the historical indication.  
  
Among the weak time, many mourning darkness.  
A machine awakens,  
erupts - it does not return.  
The reasons for my respect  
are rose in my finger of marble. In the smallest paper-mache ribbon not the green moment  
when the late afternoon refreshes the salts.
