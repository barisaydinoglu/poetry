What Is True Of The Stalks Of Cattail Is True Of Something
----------------------------------------------------------
It is a tale of muzzled flames I could kiss ash, bramble, and extinction  
from beds and saxophones  
with a red garden  
with acids in my eyeballs.  
Cold fires of a frightened wheel  
enchanting amid the sea in a wounded car,  
human as a sifted squirrel.  
A circle behind a loop,  
the mechanical workings of round law.  
Inside the dull shades of sand-colored beligerance of the hole.  
A chorus of jaguars at fortnight un rescued un deceived  
comes to a halt before a fragrance of strawberry.  
Come with me to the night of lonely roads.  
So the sweet-smelling pride lives on in a orange,  
the starry house of the shades of cinnamon,  
the enchanting energy that is cleansed and unguessed.
