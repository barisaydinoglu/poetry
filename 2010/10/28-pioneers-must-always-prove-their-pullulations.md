Pioneers Must Always Prove Their Pullulations
---------------------------------------------
The aroma promises in dawning your hips. In the face of so many salts to functionality.  
The sunset evening stars you in its mortal earth.  
  
Pale imperfect silicons and callous invasions.  
You enchant my weak croak  
like an arcane turkey to fresh apple.  
The quilt knows this,  
that life in it's wooden boxes is as endless as the energy.  
Come with me to the bomb of sticks.  
Lighting the muscle of her old warrior's medal full of decency.  
There are no shrapnels but banal cycles of honeysuckle and silvery  
homes of rosy pale rusted nail.  
The faucets exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
behind it in darkness.
