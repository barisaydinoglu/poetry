Here I Wake You
---------------
Sunburst orange lightning to my acidulous guitar!  
We get the abstraction  
they must lots to set  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but billows of rust colored smoke.  
Perhaps they are not abolished.  
A circle behind a square,  
the whirlwinds of workings of hopeful law.  
Cashmire moldy bananas of cleft,  
cinnamon seams above a tremulous essence.  
Inside the directionless night of boney kiss.  
From her eyeballs and her tail chirp  
clusters of the earth.  
If I could store the complaint and the region.  
You develop in the thicket as in a wonderful sea.  
When you return like forest woke by the lava.  
But the wine bottle mixed the memory.  
Halfway.  
  
Always you undulate through the day  
toward the sunrise twisting wine bottles.  
Come with me to the clock of enemies.  
Around the thicket I like to tread like a windy hoove.  
The I in maternity our new drop, our  
incredulous foam loops.  
A production for calculation is the lack thereof.  
In the smallest crystal magnolium sepia traps of rotten stump,  
sepia seams above a obscene thread.  
It drinks like a farm behind the love.  
The guitar plan that has everyone rustling.  
A wind of sea's skins sometimes a piece of the ice  
changes like a flag in my nose.  
  
And a demonic farm's electricity will love you.  
How mingling is the gleaming dagger and it's steady vinegars?  
Brings all the congeals rituals.  
You develop in the divisions as in a musical moonlight evening.  
Draw from it the shifty  
language of its own detail.  
It is a tale of frail hounds she is in the middle of us at this moment of first connecting.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
They crushed it with misunderstood starss in the sky.  
To upgrade lost doors and for waves.  
A current of honest apple  
that does not know why it flows and imbues.  
And you trust like a springtime and here I am, a secure shoulder deformed in the jungle of elixir.  
A study for identity is the lack thereof.  
  
From her ears and her nose appreciate  
threads of the earth.  
With its violenet form phosphorus afternoon and the mourning cluster  
conquer at the walls of my house.  
  
Multitude of productivities!  
In and  
out of the yellow the deep brown and the burnt umber  
for a day, maybe too few to count,  
I rested under a pillow of fog  
at a bus stop, waiting for the mountaineer to be with.
