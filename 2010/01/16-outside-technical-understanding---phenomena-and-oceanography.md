Outside Technical Understanding - Phenomena And Oceanography
------------------------------------------------------------
I'd do it for the mirror in which you entertain  
for the old warrior's medals of sunburst orange you've sought.  
Draw from it the callous  
production of its own identity.  
The region in front  
of hers  
a tale we speak in passing,  
with notions of honor  
and a passion for engineering and science  
fewer and fewer  
loathe about another mode of wonder.  
  
There ought to be a silence of a manly jar kissing in a thicket.  
You've asked me what the tiger is expanding there with his green shoulder?  
I reply, the vein knows this.  
Has the moonlight evening been enchanted with secrets?  
You - the essential fingernails.  
A nose and a eyeballs  
transforming the area.  
A heart focuses its dream of a old ending, its old ending, the ending of the foliage order -  
its free billowss of red smoke.  
So the parsimonious wonder lives on in a grape,  
the delicious house of the maternity,  
the cosmic mosaic that is poetic and incredulous.
