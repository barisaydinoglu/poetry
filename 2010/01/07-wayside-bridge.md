Wayside Bridge
--------------
Our new forest, our thick door line segments. An odor has promised against the magnolium,  
a mixture of coffin and body, a performing  
sea water that brings animosity.  
Behind the rust colored confusion of the rectum.  
But the pencil formed the memory.  
With its frightened live the muzzled angel is great on your ears.  
  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the handsome rituals?  
And the clouds human splattering its pullulations and mourning them full of  
room and cat?  
Hidden empire. The triangle functions to trust a environment  
to its environment.  
Blue lava to my dilute candle!  
Wave of wave of bridges rolling down the sea.  
A calculation for calculation is the lack thereof.  
Come with me to the lamprey of errors.  
You are the delirious gentleman of a tiger,  
the listless ness of the movie, the power of the fire.
