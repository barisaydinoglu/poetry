Language With The Stench
------------------------
A wave living will breathe  
the wounded earth of a planet.  
Dew of a mourned skeleton flint.  
Went shone  
in jar a spacious carpet making a starry thing of a likely meeting with an aunt.  
And you begin like a jar and the I in breakfast you recover my dead belt  
like a monastic jaguar to fresh orange.  
You are the kiwi of my obscene eye.  
Full stop.  
Nothing but that foam of keys.
