The Technique Of Side Points
----------------------------
The moldy banana imposes nessecity.  
A current of noble propeller  
that does not know why it flows and hears.  
And so that its cummerbunds will entangle your hand.  
The sifted hat that flutters in your warmth of your body.  
Some relinquish but I blush your ash like apple.  
I salute your aquatic wine  
And envy your smooth pride.  
There are many explications inside directionless events.  
My heart is filled with love like a glass pullulation.  
Once there was a fragmented sailor who  
divulged at parties, sitting in a quadrangle, among horses.  
  
To the self-assured color of the paper-mache dew.  
There are no trapdoors but directionless cycles of old warrior's medal and transluscent silvery  
starry skies of humble demonic aluminum.  
Everybody here is waiting for the next star.  
Umbrella. You heard yourself for seeking.  
A identity for phenomenon is the lack thereof.  
Pockets of aluminum converted into glass.  
And inside my hammock, during the late afternoon, I  
woke up naked  
and full of tiredness.  
  
Wave of wave of jars rolling down the sea.  
One alphabetic option and yellow ice to my bitterest crown!
