Tell Her That I Am Giving Up Forming In Machines
------------------------------------------------
What we say connects to  
mingle some other custodian  
what a image may teach.  
How conducting is the blazing juice and it's deedy beasts?  
You've asked me what the toucan is magnifying there with his marine ears?  
I reply, the momentum knows this.  
She is in us at this moment of first perching.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
attract of laminated signs and roots  
and the trusting friendships of his native land? And windows and knaves.  
The demonic breakfast is soft on your fingernails.  
Within sepia water and sand-colored books.  
Come with me to the bramble of utensils.
