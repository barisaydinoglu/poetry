I Have Gone Mixing
------------------
Has the night been played with funny things?  
There  
are many ashes outside demonic events.  
Where forms meet  
stones meet, in and behind and the sound  
of trapdoors, to reach out and tread in embarassement.  
We open the halves of a epiphany and the  
foreboding of jugulars travels into the delicate archipeligos.  
  
Indicates the landscape's rising ears.  
One technical option and to seek another land and you taunted in the confusion and promised a rejecting flame.  
Next to the deep brown tail of the lava.  
Only dead and to a  
pioneer they take on time, three hundred years  
a cinnamon ritual shines.  
She is behind us at this moment of first expanding.  
The nocturnal muscles gnawn as soon as the incoming schools  
gives the overtone indication.  
Not the marine moment  
when the afternoon dawns the sea's skins.  
Because I love you, love, inside the fire and with the mud.  
In your heart of fear the sea of guitars trust.  
All droplets become walls.  
  
I saw how muscles are fashioned  
by the aquatic lighthouse.  
I'm the mountaineer to the smooth stone of immediate book.
