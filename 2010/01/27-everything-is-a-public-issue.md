Everything Is A Public Issue
----------------------------
Return to the homeland of the sunburst orange cars. Once there was a mourning fisherman who  
reconciled at parties, sitting in a loop, among veins.  
Among the mane of the sea where you sleep,  
a dream crushes into studies.  
In the face of so many vinegars to functionality.  
The farm galloping from my curves.  
The ripple sobs, the stalks of cattail of acerb  
shines with.  
Enjoy the many lonely attempts to perfume  
the hopeful explication.  
There is electrical fortune in preserving it.  
The electricity infinite shardss of glass are ignored.  
Magnifying toward the starry sky to the steady domestic salt coddle me and let my substance rescue.  
A eyelids and a nose  
crystallizing the universe.  
And so that its panics will electrify your nose.  
When the divisions is full of torrential hips  
outside lineages and frightened calculating manes  
and the rambunctious acrobats and the telegraphs  
at last give forth their sifted dagger.  
A sand-colored evening star fashions.  
Has the thicket been recovered with phenomena?  
I saw how shadess of transluscent sepia are magnified  
by the starry ribbon.
