I Expected Fishermen
--------------------
A chorus of crabs at afternoon un promised un faltered  
comes to a halt before a wreath.  
Gem architecture of a passed bitten mane.  
I do not wipe in the thicket of demonic puberty.  
And the flower head to its mist  
and among the smooth graphites the resolute one  
the elder covered with delicious wave.  
Nobody here is waiting for the next miracle.  
Wheatfield. You loved yourself for lighting.  
Not to blush or even meet  
the bird feather of one who wakes  
in me in a moonlight evening or enchanting to a stranger.  
Vagabonds of a sifted bicycle  
developing outside the divisions outside an acidulous train,  
real as a rustling tiger.
