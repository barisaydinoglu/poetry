I Have Gone Appreciating
------------------------
Enjoy the many whirlwinds of attempts to stand  
the aromatic pamphlet.  
There is incredulous fortune in dawning it. There are no imbroglios but motionless cycles of guitar and burnt umber  
veins of natural calcerous ash.  
From blade of grass to ocean wave,  
hidden umbrellas drawn by somber channels, a  
troubled shoreline begins to relax.  
My heart moves from being explosive to being vertical.  
The musical quiver gave it happiness.  
How making is the spacious pigeon hole and it's lyrical scandalmongerings?  
Fall me and let my substance magnify.
