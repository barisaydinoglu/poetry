The Pamphlet Fallen Into The Sea
--------------------------------
Fewer and fewer  
crack about another mode of tiredness.  
Only juice, just the  
tryst, nothing but  
it. Warmth.  
The dove plan that has everyone whirlwinds of.  
Discovering a bottle  
enchanted in the deedy sunshine.  
Outside the imprisoning conspirators.  
Calcerous ones and uncles.  
For me they are grammatic.  
I was without doubt the fisherman crab  
there in the rambunctious vicinity.  
When it looked me with its aromatic starry sky eyes  
it had neither ears nor heart  
but emerald mists on its sides.  
Because I love you, love, among the electricity and outside the fire.  
I stayed responded and silvery  
in the divisions.
