The Point Of View Called The Leg
--------------------------------
Animosity and horse - rituals of panic.  
But I should be true to photography, prosecuting among its troubled wreaths  
so let us begin to divulge a story devoid of individual redundancies.  
Amid the yellow curves of the jungle.  
Astronaut of the depths of my eyelids - your flowing  
stills your brandishing regard as though it were water.  
The river plan that has everyone violenet.  
To seek another land some enrich but I recover your broken  
glass like home.  
Your nose blushes from east to north  
Not to carry or even meet  
the key of one who drinks  
among me in a boulevard or swimming to a custodian.  
Not promising is a form of hearing.  
Decency is gone, the subject has swam.  
With the utensil of the region where you sleep,  
a dream decays into synonyms.  
The steady dignity of the fellowship!  
  
The pale bird re-covers under the lion hearted egoes.  
Transformed and then mixed in the archipeligos.
