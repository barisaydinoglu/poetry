Here I Fly You
--------------
A pale cluster day  
it was a guilt business of smoke and nights.  
Legumes of a wounded vessel  
lighting among the thicket in front of a obscene vessel,  
electric as a exiled cat.  
A loaf of bread baked with sticky respect and salt.  
And you develop like a tiger and indicates the starry sky's wetting breath.  
A chorus of ostriches at sunrise un awakened un stole  
comes to a halt before an awe.  
What we say trusts to  
continue some other mountaineer  
what a camera may teach.  
When the city is full of whirlwinds of ears  
outside moths and hairy obscene aspens  
and the negligent alcoves and the emerald architectures  
at last give forth their rotten night.  
So the deedy tiredness lives on in a orange,  
the clear house of the flute,  
the rosy farm that is cosmic and spacious.  
In the sunburst orange heart of the heat.  
The lake knows this,  
that life in it's chalk boxes is as endless as the map.  
For a day, maybe thousand,  
I rested under a unrelenting rain  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the giant to be inside.  
You continue my decadent twisting lonely road  
like a myriad tiger to fresh peach.  
In the thicket like clay.  
A line segment amid a triangle,  
the windy workings of homogeneous law.  
  
Crooked weather, clenched lights like the forest.
