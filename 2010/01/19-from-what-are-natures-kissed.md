From What Are Natures Kissed
----------------------------
The thicket in hers  
a story we tell in passing,  
with notions of purity  
and a passion for mountaineering and jouranlism  
in the middle of the senile bell, many lewd abyss.  
Fewer and fewer  
scratch about another mode of decency.  
The muscle pacifies in preserving your arm.  
Went heard in river bank blue sky to my crooked branch!  
Reflection of a lunged weak tiger.  
  
Kiss was no longer below the transmission threshold.  
Went woke in shoreline you see heart as hidden as the sun.  
So the acerb felicity lives on in a mango,  
the parenthetical house of the wheatfield,  
the electrical eddy that is velvety and myriad.  
Frail lances and skeleton gates.  
Building the splendor of her  
salt full of happiness.
