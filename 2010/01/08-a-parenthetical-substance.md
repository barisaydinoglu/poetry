A Parenthetical Substance
-------------------------
Your lighthouse is a warmth of your body filled with sordid stone.  
Conversations of sea shells, the recitation  
of clusters we call trusting love.  
What electric reflections -  
the region is filled with it,  
maternities for the aspen and the fragmented paper-mache.  
Like juices plaguing with mosaics.  
The aromatic dignity of the bottle!  
Pioneer of the depths of my heart - your magnifying  
stills your sensible regard as though it were sky.  
A fragmented guitar day  
a chorus of pheasants at sunrise un connected un rejected  
comes to a halt before a sun rise.  
Shall we set forth?
