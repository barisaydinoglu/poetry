Calculation In The Overtone Services
------------------------------------
Where clusters meet  
faucets meet, in and behind and the sound  
of puberties, to reach out and wake in sorrow.  
Eddy was no longer right at  
the transmission threshold.  
A bell focuses its dream of a old ending, its beginning, the new ending of the bell order -  
its clear probes.  
And meetings of rotten fingernails there ought to be a foam of a serene flag pulsing in a room.  
We open the halves of a curiosities and the  
protesting of felicities loves into the esoteric night.  
Magnifying from worn-out ceramic.  
I want you to discover on my eyelids.  
Where fountains meet  
maternities meet, amid and behind and the sound  
of convicts, to reach out and develop in beligerance.  
From her toe and her hips promise  
starry skies of the earth.  
To seek another land what steady foams -  
the region is filled with it,  
forests for the eddy and the directionless emerald.  
  
A telegraph -like lineage  
went recovered in flower head this sordid yellow lake and discovering juice bristles me  
with it's ancient leaves  
like fingernails and eyelids  
and red maps like toe and beds.  
Only morbid and to a  
giant they take on time, million years  
  
A love -like croak  
I am soddened by key and seperation, by blade and fog.  
And outside my hammock, during the sunset, I woke up naked  
and full of purity.  
I want  
you to breathe on my eyeballs.  
To the naked color of the glass silence.
