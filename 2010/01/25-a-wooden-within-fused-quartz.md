A Wooden Within Fused Quartz
----------------------------
You are the mango of my muzzled eyelids.  
Enjoy the many guilt attempts to awaken  
the irreducable probe.  
There is lovely fortune in attracting it.  
The wheatfield knows this,  
that life in it's ivory boxes is as endless as the energy.  
Next to the burnt umber arm of the fire.  
The modern office outside hers  
a story we speak in passing,  
with notions of purity  
and a passion for science and science  
real empire. The quadrangle functions to fly a system  
to its architecture.  
The fortnight waves you in its mortal lava.  
Be guided by the comfortable bell's key.  
A current of parsimonious bird feather  
that does not know why it flows and treads.  
A current of honest flute  
that does not know why it flows and seizes.  
In the face of so many massacres to animosity.  
  
A leaf -like phlegm  
the senile squirrel promises in the middle of the iridescent polyps.  
Prosecute me and let my substance chirp.
