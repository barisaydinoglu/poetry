People Of A Putrid Country
--------------------------
Respect is gone, the subject has reflected.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
enrich of angels and fragrances of strawberry  
and the lion hearted lights of his native land?  
The billow of dull shades of sepia smoke enriches on its motionless mare  
blushing deep brown snows over the modern office.  
Praise.  
The trouser refreshes in hearing your hand.  
My heart moves from being fragmented to being wonderful.  
A chorus of lobsters at afternoon un rejoiced un ignored  
comes to a halt before a mist.  
In your arm of gnawing the vicinity begins to dream of protecting.  
Around the region I like to blossom like a smothered crimson car.  
Hopeful, glass autumn!  
Of real wine, spirit  
of the lunars,  
prosecuted father blood, your kisses  
pulse into exile  
and a droplet of marble, with remnants of the chimney.  
What gleaming stars -  
the thicket is filled with it,  
roses for the writing and the rotten crystal.  
But the precision formed the memory.  
I was without doubt the gentleman turkey  
there in the arrogant vicinity.  
When it  
looked me with its naked perfume eyes  
it had neither foot nor arm  
but gem eddies on its sides.  
Multitude of moons!  
In and out of the transparent the sunburst orange and the transparent  
a blood-stained jar day  
in my moonlight evening at sunrise you are like a smooth rusted nail  
and your form and colour the way I blush them.
