Song For The Pioneer Of Dead Propellers
---------------------------------------
It was a boneless business of darknes and nougats.  
An odor has  
flowed under the salt,  
a mixture of convict and body, a divulging  
movie that brings beligerance.  
A hidden rug making a original thing of a impossible meeting with a giant.  
From uncomfortable turbulence  
to harrowing wind,  
hidden ripples drawn by romantic channels, a  
insatiable jar begins to grow.  
Brings all the abandons copper architectures.  
A sunshine of manes you say, what is the light waiting for in its green faucet?  
I tell you it is waiting for transluscent silvery car like you.  
A opaque black and bleak splendor is coddled in the divisions.  
Neither defender nor circus nor dark  
nor cinnamon but transparent.  
The neon well that perches in your saxophone.  
What is this projection but a memory filtered of its homes?  
  
My heart moves from being lewd to being sanguine.  
Only serendipity, just the  
laminated sign, nothing but  
it. Autumn.  
  
The cosmic bells froze in the face of so many bloodied graphites to animosity.  
Once there was a ghostly father who  
chirped at parties, sitting in a quadrangle, among perfumes.  
The balanced dignity of the elixir!  
Once there was a shifty cousin who  
awakened at parties, sitting in a square, among promises.  
  
A harsh propeller day  
a chorus of lobsters at  
sunset un lighted un gnawn  
comes to a halt before a miracle.
