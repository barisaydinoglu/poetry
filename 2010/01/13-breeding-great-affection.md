Breeding Great Affection
------------------------
Conversations of moons, the recitation  
of clusters we call electrical peace. With the maternity of the thicket where you sleep,  
a dream loathes into calculations.  
One neutral option and you respond my hollow saliva  
like a decisive oyster to fresh orange.  
  
You love headlong into a universe to make your business.  
I was without doubt the aunt toucan  
there in the frail land.  
When it looked me with its equinoctial heart eyes  
it had neither eyelids nor eye  
but silk waves on its sides.
