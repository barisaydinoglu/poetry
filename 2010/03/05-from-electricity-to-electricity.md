From Electricity To Electricity
-------------------------------
Not to enchant or even meet  
the splendor of one who reflects  
under me in a city or treading to a gentleman.  
It was the late afternoon of the lobster.  
Your saxophone is a promise filled with violenet snow.  
Return to the homeland of the flower heads.  
  
It was the afternoon of the squirrel.
