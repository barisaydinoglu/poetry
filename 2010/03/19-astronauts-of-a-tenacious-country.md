Astronauts Of A Tenacious Country
---------------------------------
The early light of day salts you in its mortal fire. Erupt me and let my substance circumscribe.  
Nothing but that sweetnes of springtimes.  
They buried it with parched waves.  
Directionless morning and the morbid juice  
degrade at the walls of my house.  
I attract as if behind a mourning jugular.  
From unrelenting rain to blade of grass,  
hidden lunars drawn by mineral channels, a  
molested time begins to make.  
A computer lights,  
freezes - it does not return.  
  
And you executed in the animosity and crystallized a flying legume.
