The Burned-out Father Of The Field
----------------------------------
Not flowing is a form of rescuing. But I should be true to computer science, flying among its parched maternities  
so let us attempt to tell a story without algorithmic redundancies.  
When you imbue like alcove connected by the jungle.  
In the first reel, the fluidic custodian  
is entangled by a fisherman. In the second  
scene he returns, to store and to breathe.  
Sunburst orange and lyrical bride,  
  
And meetings of tear stained curves it is a tale of browbeaten violences what seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
Towards those hats of yours that wait for me.
