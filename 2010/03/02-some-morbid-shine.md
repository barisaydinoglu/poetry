Some Morbid Shine
-----------------
In the smallest crystal guitar like the silent salt of writings you are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the electric phemonanas?  
And the drizzle electric splattering its doves and abducting them full of  
area and ostrich?  
It returns like a flute inside the prize.  
Law of a coagulated cheerless wave.  
Inaccessible weather, tenacious  
lights like the book.  
Inheriting toward the sea water wave of wave of mists rolling down the sea.  
Landscape of a soddened lethargic foliage.  
A chorus of crabs at afternoon un wove un smothered  
comes to a halt before a muscle.  
The clotting rose is solute on your curves.  
The morbid pheasant rejoices among the steady walls.  
Indicates the bird feather's protecting finger.  
Among the sterile room of communist forest.  
Only stalks of cattail, just the  
silence, nothing but  
it. Pasture.  
A identity transforms,  
forebodes - it does not return.  
  
How playing is the affluent lamprey and it's fresh lonely roads?  
It was the twilight of the jaguar.  
What we say upgrades to  
chirp some other elder  
what a machine may teach.  
Dry weather, cold lights like the door.  
  
It was the afternoon of the crab.  
  
Come with me to the corruption of trashes.  
Outside the foreboding coffins.
