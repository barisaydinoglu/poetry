There Is No Lonely Road
-----------------------
She is outside us at this moment of first making.  
The monastic dignity of the droplet!  
Confusion and umbrella - drops of fear.  
One side option and I do not undulate in the sea of dead ash.  
To blush lost quivers and for gardens.  
Multitude of friendships!  
In and out of the yellow the burnt umber and  
the transluscent silvery  
monastic, silicon affection!  
When you divulge like serenity fluttered by the ice.  
Indicates the dew's fluttering tail.  
The order of the spheres trusting the ship of her farm full of honor.
