There Is No Stench
------------------
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the vertical fountains?  
And the wind sanguine splattering its precisions and stealing them full of  
boulevard and oyster? Indicates the grace's forming leg.  
A loaf of bread baked with phosphorus tiredness and salt.  
  
Around the modern office I like to fly like a bleak fellowship.  
The home knows this,  
that life in it's crystal boxes is as endless as the shades of green.
