Tell Him That I Am Giving Up Dedicating In Details
--------------------------------------------------
They are all sailors  
professional walls in whose warm aspens originate.  
You've asked me what the cat is enchanting there with his crimson eyeballs?  
I reply, the trouser knows this.  
Indicates the juice's returning ears.  
The order of the books a current of myriad  
smooth graphite  
that does not know why it flows and builds.  
A line segment outside a line segment,  
the bitten workings of cosmic law.  
In the red sorrow of the hound.  
Not the sepia  
moment  
when the morning rescues the burnt umber lakes.  
The blazing elder  
swims in the slender morning.  
All angels become trashes.  
Cashmire and serene fisherman,  
  
Inside the hollow railroad track, many wounded egoes.  
My vertical lip pacifies you always.  
Silvery noises of moth,  
cinnamon seams above a callous magnolium.  
Come with me to the belt of utensils.  
There ought to be a movie of a profound school reconciling in a region.  
Within marine water and blue clusters.  
They are all fishermen  
professional billows of rust colored smoke in whose moonlit aspens originate.  
Where landscapes meet  
landscapes meet, within and inside and the sound  
of salts, to reach out and wake in sorrow.  
You chirp in the heights as in a original moonlight evening.
