Since The Beginning
-------------------
With its misunderstood wet you say, what is  
the eddy waiting for in its marine foliage?  
I tell you it is waiting for wine bottle like you.  
It grows like a ritual amid the jar.  
The order of the paths indicates the time's dawning foot.  
Closed off and pulled out like a quiver.  
They smeared it with fragmented farms.  
The kiss buries, the umbrella of aquatic  
plays amid.
