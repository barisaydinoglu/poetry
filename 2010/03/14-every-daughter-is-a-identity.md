Every Daughter Is A Identity
----------------------------
Towards those rituals of yours that wait for me.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
I stayed connected and burnt umber  
among the field.  
The lunchtime trees you in its mortal jungle.  
From her hand and her hand weave  
pencils of the earth.  
A full sun of fleshes.  
My  
heart moves from being misunderstood to being celestial.
