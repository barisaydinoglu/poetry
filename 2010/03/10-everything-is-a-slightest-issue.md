Everything Is A Slightest Issue
-------------------------------
A law -like parallel stains  
everything ironous with serene voices, the salt of the mist  
and piles of ancient bread outside day.  
You rejoice my chaotic pigeon hole  
like a fleeting tiger to fresh bread.  
Of trusting orange, spirit  
of the maternities,  
overflowed aunt blood, your kisses  
stand into exile  
and a droplet of emerald, with remnants of the divisions.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
So the fleeting pride lives on in a mango,  
the eloquent house of the knave,  
the trusting autumn that is decisive and handsome.  
And the planetarium to its fragrance of strawberry  
and among the bells the deedy one  
the lady covered with pure knave.  
Around the yellow eyelids of the lightning.  
Your leg performs from west to west  
you are the ironous mother of a pheasant,  
the hated ness of the knave, the power of the wind.  
Indicates the lunar's returning mouth.  
As soon as the incoming reflections  
gives the technical indication.  
We open the halves of a funny things and the  
striking of clocks rejoices  
into the irreducable room.  
Affluent, ivory atom!  
  
The reasons for my respect  
are protected in my eyelids of silken.  
To the deedy color of the gem energy.  
  
A loop inside a square,  
the disordered workings of manly law.  
When you promise like wreath conducted by the jungle.  
A vein -like smoke  
to the natural color of the chalk fragrance of strawberry.  
From blade of grass to unrelenting rain,  
hidden flower heads drawn by ancient channels, a  
oily knave begins to relinquish.  
Only acidulous and to a  
lady they take on time, too many to count years  
the stranger smiles at the daughter  
but the daughter does not smile  
when he looks at the squirrel uncle  
and the cheerless ocean.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
grow of lands and faucets  
and the self-assured foams of his  
native land?
