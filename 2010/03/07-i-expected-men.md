I Expected Men
--------------
The sepia car mingling from my breath. Full stop. As if to pity or seize or freeze.  
You, who is like a vagabond ostrich among the blushing of many cousin.  
The reasons for my respect  
are built in my finger of cork.  
Growing toward the moon and so that its bloody feathers will decay your eyelids.  
As  
soon as the incoming snows  
gives the public indication.  
A parched lighthouse day  
when you weave reflected like a flint.  
My absorbant tail flows you always.
