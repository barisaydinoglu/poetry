The Funny Things Of The Night
-----------------------------
The reasons for my respect  
are breathed in my ears of crystal.  
The early light of day praises you in its mortal sky.

for the perfumes of burnt umber you've recovered.  
A image for projection is the lack thereof.  
Wave of wave of lights rolling down the sea.
