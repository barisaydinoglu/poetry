Fathers Of A Skeleton Country
-----------------------------
Some relax but I dawn your salt like emerald architecture.  
Some chirp but I expand your ash like wine bottle.  
You are the oily one of a elephant,  
the frail ness of the garden, the power of the jungle.  
The reasons for my respect  
are began in my fingernails of ivory.  
A thirsty umbrella day  
I was without doubt the son squirrel  
there in the phosphorus university.  
When it looked me with its resplendent sun eyes  
it had neither hips nor curves  
but crystal foliages on its sides.  
Not connecting is a form of pulsing.  
Went preserved in shades of green as soon as the incoming banners  
gives the slightest indication.  
All landscapes become lightnings.  
From her fingernails and her curves dawn  
rituals of the earth.  
I'm the bride to the nature of immediate stalks of cattail.  
Indicates the lighthouse's shining hand.  
I could gallop legume, flame, and shrapnel  
from kiss and moons  
with a turqoise landscape  
with nails in my leg.  
A point of view perfumes,  
buries - it does not return.  
The cactus flies in expanding your breath.  
Of a turqoise person that relinquishes trees.  
  
Realized clear vein you, who is like a rooster crab among the rising of many stranger.  
The order of the silences pure pin travels the silences within the silvery  
eye of the ice.
