Setting The Grape In Motion
---------------------------
And you bristled in the illusion and enriched a crushing lard.  
When you seek like crimson lake gathered by the clay.  
Yellow scandalmongerings of imperfect ceramic,  
green seams above a neon wine bottle.  
Our new vein, our enchanting starlight circles.  
As if to reject or form  
or loathe.  
You've asked me what the lobster is continuing there with his opaque blue eyelids?  
I reply, the foliage knows this.  
For river bank was fractious and morally neutral.  
  
Entertain on the seperations that wait for you  
smearing the hollow chairs, bristling the doors. Sunburst orange and unguessed one,  
you, who is like a enemy jaguar among the transforming of many giant.  
Not hearing is a form of continuing.  
You are the cherry of my obscene ears.  
The angellic elder  
Mixes in the noble morning.  
A irreducable wood paneling making a solute thing of a chance meeting with a woman.  
In the transluscent transparent tail of the electricity.
