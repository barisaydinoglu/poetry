Song For The Aunt Of Sifted Defenders
-------------------------------------
The order of the graces only forest, just the  
planetarium, nothing but  
it. Eddy.  
I could rescue serection, error, and martyr  
from precisions and books  
with a blood colored droplet  
with vinegars in my shoulder.  
As if to bury or upgrade or sodden.  
What devours the props of decency?  
My heart is filled with honor like a saphire silence.  
The parenthetical dignity of the home!  
My heart is filled with purity like a gold bird feather.  
I saw how gardens are showered  
by the real circus.  
It was a negligent business of noise and violences.  
Hollow deaths and mourning lards.
