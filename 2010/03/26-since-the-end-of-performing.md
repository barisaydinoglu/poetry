Since The End Of Performing
---------------------------
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
I salute your hopeful peach  
and envy your eager pride.  
The resolute energies crushed a phenomenon expands,  
mourns - it does not return.  
A loaf of bread baked with morbid honor and salt.  
What is this machine but a memory wiped of its flower heads?  
The skeleton rose that upgrades in your bird feather.
