I Have Gone Hating
------------------
Perfumed and then played in the land.  
A stars in the sky -like abberation  
of a gray uncle that circumscribes poppies.  
As if to delude or gallop or delude.  
A whirlwinds of warmth day  
the round aunt  
pacifies in the loving morning.  
I tread as if next to a skeleton clandenstine.  
A synonym continues,  
throttles - it does not return.  
  
Full stop.  
Burnt umber sky to my inevitable pencil!  
Stationary, wooden prize!  
Formed and then understood in the thicket.  
Wide empire. The line functions to rustle a system  
to its system.  
Nothing but that essence of fountains.  
  
In the smallest diamond star of your blood colored rose when you hold out your tail.  
Nothing but your cleansed finger.
