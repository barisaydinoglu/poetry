Playing Listless Nostalgia
--------------------------
In my university at night you are like a writing  
and your form and colour the way I relinquish them.  
Like holes bristling amid lighthouses.  
There are no lards but tear stained cycles of stars in the sky and opaque blue  
evening stars of electrical ghostly broken glass.  
My heart moves from being careless to being balanced.  
Like dominions abandoning within souls.  
Nauesous giants and women.  
For me they are slightest.  
When you flow like kiss travelled by the mud.  
What soddens the props of purity?  
Realized warm sweetnes pacified and then dedicated in the city.  
  
Against the jungle like salt.  
A dilute computer chains  
even the changeless  
algorithmic vicinity in sequence  
to which the metaphor  
will not be imbued.
