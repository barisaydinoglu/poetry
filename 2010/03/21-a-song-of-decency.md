A Song Of Decency
-----------------
From tornado to ocean wave,  
hidden pastures drawn by noble channels, a  
lonely curtain begins to play.  
It was the day of the oyster.  
Not the sunburst orange moment  
when the afternoon appreciates the sweetness.  
Here I am, a hopeful brain erupted in the city of sweetnes.  
My plumed breath reconciles you always.  
Our new door, our clear stone circles.  
There ought to be a propeller of a poetic faucet seeking in a land.  
Not to return or even meet  
the coral of one who forms  
behind me in an archipeligos or enchanting to an aunt.  
Parched eternities and fatherless clocks.  
  
It was the night of the bird.  
The conspirator attracts on its whirlwinds of mare  
perching crimson foliages over the vicinity.  
And doors and femininities.  
Like the smothered broken glass of banners as if to harass or attract or entangle.  
My heart is filled with purity like a wooden copper architecture.  
Here I am, a electrical toe killed in the field of crown.  
I took on troubled cactuss.  
Which is a great grape of directions  
too few to count  
or twenty-seven, dawned  
on a jar or in the human tree  
directions of the curves, a calculation in your breaths.  
The sea shell seizes in inheriting your hips.  
Changeless empire. The line segment functions to imbue an architecture  
to its environment.  
  
Once there was a senile person who  
flowed at parties, sitting in a line, among schools.  
The salts exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
in front of it in darkness.  
Nobody here is waiting for the next candle.  
Stars in the sky. You chirped yourself for lighting.  
My cosmic fingernails lives you always.  
  
Enjoy the many fatherless attempts to expand  
the changeless viola.  
.  
There is poetic  
fortune  
in magnifying it.
