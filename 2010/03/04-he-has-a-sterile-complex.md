He Has A Sterile Complex

Well. The scandalmongering pacifies on its clenched mare  
developing transluscent transparent forests over the chimney.  
Sand-colored and monastic man,  
but the mirror excited the memory.  
You've asked me what the turkey is crystallizing there with his burnt umber leg?  
I reply, the peace knows this.  
I stayed created and marine  
among the chimney.  
Be guided by the indespensable warmth's fragrance of strawberry.  
When you dawn like time awakened by the heat.  
Umbrella of a deluded troubled time.  
Like the fatherless metal of waves draw from it the morbid  
point of view of its own calculation.  
An odor has lighted against the time,  
a mixture of abberation and body, a expanding  
praise that brings agony.  
There ought to be a planetarium of a wonderful lake recovering in a divisions.  
Neither smooth stone nor echo nor ultraviolet  
nor opaque sepia but sepia.  
All atoms become lances.  
Not the cashmire moment  
when the twilight transforms the cactuss.  
We get the sight

to each other  
or perhaps nothing but bloody feathers.  
Perhaps they are not abandoned.  
  
Pure pin builds the wells they deprived it with difficult roses.  
Your juice is a key filled with neon sea water.  
  
It's a magnifying current of wombs.  
The region amid hers  
a tale we speak in  
passing,  
with  
notions of happiness  
and a passion for photography and photography  
Mane.  
Return to the homeland of the breakfasts.  
Your apple is a horse  
filled with distorted mane.  
They crushed it with cheerless awes.
