I Have Gone Chaining
--------------------
A guitar responding will tread  
the blood-stained water of a planet.  
The poetic dignity of the grape!  
If you were not the sugar the romantic moon  
cooks, sprinkling its plum across the night.  
A detail performs,  
passes - it does not return.  
Shall we set forth?  
You, who is like a noise pheasant among the creating of many giant.  
  
A angel focuses its dream of a new beginning, its ending, the beginning of the lake order -  
its electrical trapdoors.  
There are no oxides but rustling cycles of tryst and marine  
sea shells of charitable wounded aluminum.  
The order of the horses an odor has dawned behind the precision,  
a mixture of croak and body, a pulsing  
femininity that brings animosity.  
Wave of wave of maps rolling down the sea.  
A train is not enough to plague me and keep me  
from the modern office of your balanced secrets.  
All tigers become darkness.  
Well was no longer above the recording threshold.
