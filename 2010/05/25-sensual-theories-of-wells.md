Sensual Theories Of Wells

And stars and ripples.  
This shaken current and treading juice changes me  
with it's nocturnal yellow cars like nose and foot  
and red sea  
shells like nose and drops.  
The brandishing foam gave it sincerity.  
Wave of wave  
of sea's skins rolling down the sea.  
You see lip as soft as the thunder.  
Unguessed, ceramic old warrior's medal!  
  
In your hand of animosity the thicket of momenta reflect.  
Which is a soft movie of directions  
three hundred or million, divulged  
on an angel or in the lovely starry sky  
directions of the brow, a calculation in your mouths.  
I was without doubt the pioneer bird  
there in the imperalist jungle.  
When it looked me with its lion hearted river eyes  
it had neither eye nor fingernails  
but silken phemonanas on its sides.  
We open the halves of a curiosities and the  
gnawing of cold fires re-covers into the sensible room.  
You crystallize my calculating salt  
like a sweet-smelling oyster to fresh sugar.
