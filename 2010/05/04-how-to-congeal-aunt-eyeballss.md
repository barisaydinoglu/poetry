How To Congeal Aunt Eyeballss
-----------------------------
A red and blood-stained light is soddened in the modern office.  
The esoteric giant  
blossoms in  
the brandishing morning.  
Neither knave nor smooth stone nor brimstone  
nor transluscent cinnamon but green.  
Sorrow and flint - planetariums of fear.  
Always you degrade through the midnight  
toward the midnight deceiving saxophones.  
Amid the land of the vicinity where you sleep,  
a dream abolishes into cameras.  
Fewer and fewer  
pass about another mode of decency.  
They harassed it with banal jars.  
Your foot blushes from south to south  
The imperalist ripple that reconciles in your grace.
