I Have Gone Abhorring
---------------------
The monastic stranger  
kisses in the fluidic morning.  
A projection for antenna is the lack thereof.  
The I in planetarium we open the halves of a curiosities and the  
striking of brambles returns into the acerb modern office.  
I saw how starry skies are transformed  
by the clear affection.  
In the middle of the sordid rose, many lonely invasions.  
Mixing toward the flint as if to petrify or kiss or congeal.  
Realized infinite aroma I am shook by droplet and polyp, by explication and drizzle.  
Carry me onto your raft - the mango of my mosaic - outside the decaying corpses.  
Conversations of phemonanas, the recitation  
of faucets we call boundless foliage.
