The Acid Fallen Into The Sea
----------------------------
Pure smoke magnifies the stars from her breath and her nose magnify  
lighthouses of the earth.  
And so that its imbroglios will disguise your brow.  
Which is a decisive bridge of directions  
three hundred or million, flowed  
on a wheatfield or in the humble defender  
directions of the mouth, a calculation in your shoulders.  
It was a putrid business of probe and evils.  
If I could grow the croak and the thicket.  
I  
saw how salts are built  
by the lion hearted ritual.  
Has the area been pacified with epiphany?  
Draw from it the cheerless  
signal of its own metaphor. Inside the turqoise embarassement of the self-production.
