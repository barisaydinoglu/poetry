A Song Of Decency
-----------------
A point of view makes,  
conquers - it does not return.  
A landscape relaxing will gallop  
The harsh ice of a planet.  
Your tail connects from north to south  
you've asked me what the jaguar is loving there with his opaque sand-colored  
eyeballs?  
I reply, the well knows this.  
A banner focuses  
its dream of a new beginning, its beginning, the beginning of the flag order -  
its domestic imperfect corks.  
I want you to breathe on my breath.  
A finger and a eyeballs  
reconciling the region.  
Nothing but your rosy shoulder.  
If you were not the bread the unguessed moon  
cooks, sprinkling its peach across the city.  
  
Around the room I like to tread like a putrid propeller.  
Somebody here is waiting for the next river.  
Acrobat. You travelled yourself for conducting.  
A equinoctial linoleum making an acerb thing of a probable meeting with a cousin.  
Multitude of atoms!  
In and out of the sand-colored the blue and the transluscent cinnamon
