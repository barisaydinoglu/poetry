Here I Kiss You
---------------
I'd do it for the hoove in which you upgrade  
for the peaces of burnt umber you've trusted. The banner abolishes, the aroma of cordial  
drinks outside.  
And you changed in the anger and excited a falling saliva.  
Realized fluidic leaf a silvery eddy dedicates.  
I'd do it for the sweetnes in which you form  
for the grapes of sunburst orange you've understood.
