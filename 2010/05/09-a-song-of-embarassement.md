A Song Of Embarassement
-----------------------
In the first reel, the handsome child  
is executed by an astronaut. In the second  
reel he returns, to excite and to wake.  
My heart is filled with tiredness like a silk candle.  
I am twisted by umbrella and probe, by moldy banana and sun.  
And you executed in the beligerance and made a impaling massacre.  
The bottles exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
within it in darkness.  
Our new flint, our lovely warmth of your body line segments.  
Which is a vertical grape of directions  
million or three hundred, pulsed  
on a mane or in the hopeful cluster  
directions of the heart, a calculation in your legs.  
A verdure rug making a electrical thing of a impossible meeting with a sailor.  
A current of rosy umbrella  
that does not know why it flows and attracts.  
  
Nothing but your equinoctial eye.  
The eloquent school gave it love.  
They conquered it with morbid gardens.  
I saw how foliages are rescued  
by the silent cathedral.
