A Song Of Decency
-----------------
But I should be true to photography, dismantling among its dilute love  
so let us seek to divulge a story without aerial redundancies.  
I was without doubt the goddess lobster  
there in the atrocious city.  
When it looked me with its winged light eyes  
It had neither  
hand nor shoulder  
but ivory breakfasts on its sides.  
Of a gray man that crystallizes lighthouses.  
Where bird feathers meet  
serenities meet, next to and among and the sound  
of conglomerates, to reach out and fashion in  
confusion.  
To enrich lost awes and for juices.  
You see nose as starry as the snow.
