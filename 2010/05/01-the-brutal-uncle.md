The Brutal Uncle
----------------
You are the fruit of my dead hand.  
Everything pale with  
sensual voices, the salt of the reflection  
and piles of humble bread among midnight.  
He is behind us at this moment of first fluttering.  
Outside the opaque dark confusion of the yeast.  
Not rescuing is a form of lighting.  
There are many pigeon holes with ghostly events.  
  
Enjoy the many disintered attempts to rescue  
the wonderful vortex.  
There is free fortune in conducting it.  
When you promise shone like a form.
