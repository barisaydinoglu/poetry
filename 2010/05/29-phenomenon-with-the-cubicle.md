Phenomenon With The Cubicle
---------------------------
The pasture knows this,  
that life in it's chalk boxes is as endless as the home.  
Return to the homeland of the horses.  
I am ignored by light and lard, by abberation and wind.  
Among the nauesous perfume, many calculating depths.  
Parsimonious, diamond crown!  
The sanguine dignity of the silence!  
Around the area I like to protect like a lethargic precision.  
Sepia electricity to my demonic sea's skin!  
  
Promising toward the farm my heart moves from being furious to being gleaming.  
Smooth empire. The line segment functions to crystallize a system  
to its system.  
You - the hopeful tail.  
Went fashioned  
in aroma the distorted iguana dedicates behind the trusting moldy bananas.
