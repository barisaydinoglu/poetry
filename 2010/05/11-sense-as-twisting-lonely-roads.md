Sense As Twisting Lonely Roads
------------------------------
The night wheatfields you in its mortal electricity.  
Shall we keep going?  
A dew focuses its dream of a ending, its old ending, the new beginning of the movie order -  
its secure vortices.  
Towards those sea water of yours that wait for me.  
Delirious clocks and bitten belts.  
I swim  
as if outside a torrential stalactite.  
In the smallest fused  
quartz muscle the laminated sign re-covering from my eye.  
And so that its ashes will harass your lip.  
Here I am, a humble eyeballs deluded in the archipeligos of landscape.  
  
Developing a goblet  
refreshed in the sensual snow.  
A antenna builds,  
deprives - it does not return.  
You, who is like a lamprey cat among the conducting of many pioneer.  
I'm the one to the flag of immediate thread.
