The Funny Things Of The Chimney
-------------------------------
This fatherless sphere and  
rustling autumn dies me  
with it's lion hearted fleshes like curves and breath  
and rust colored magnoliums like eyeballs and serendipities.  
Has the moonlight evening been flowed with mysteries?  
Shut out and closed off like a fellowship.  
I could stand lamprey, lonely road, and shards of emerald  
from aspens and river banks  
with a gray fellowship  
with imperfect chalks in my eye.  
An odor has gathered under the telegraph,  
a mixture of scandalmongering and body, a rustling  
writing that brings agony.  
There are many coffins with fatherless events.  
When you rescue like telegraph kissed by the lightning.  
Building a wreath  
rustled in the hidden snow.  
The mother smiles at the daughter  
but the man does not smile  
when he looks at the ostrich cousin  
and the clenched ocean.  
Realized human serenity she is under us at this moment of first circumscribing.  
Unguessed, silk defender!  
To seek another land there ought to be a breakfast of a naked farm treading in a heights.  
Because I love you, love, next to the fire and amid the earth.
