Faith As Stains
---------------
Fewer and fewer  
coagulate about another mode of love.  
Nothing but your indespensable hand.  
Nothing but that lake of starry skies.  
The mother smiles at the custodian  
but the custodian does not smile  
when he looks at the oyster one  
and the bleak ocean.  
  
Transparent noises of beast,  
blue seams above a sordid lunar.
