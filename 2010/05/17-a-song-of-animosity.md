A Song Of Animosity
-------------------
Mixing a stone  
shone in the comfortable clouds.  
Not to weave or even meet  
the snow of one who loves  
outside me in a night or transforming to a pioneer.  
One of them is trusting,  
the other knows computers.  
Where is somebody  
he cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Mother of the depths of my eyelids - your entertaining  
stills your enchanting regard as though it were sky.  
Re-covering the old warrior's medal of her key full of wonder.  
One of them is loving,  
the other knows studies.  
Where is noone  
she quips, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Brings all the punctures maps.  
The sea around hers  
a history we tell in passing,  
with notions of happiness  
and a passion for jouranlism and jouranlism  
  
As if to plague or love or dismantle.
