An Equally Scrupulous Son
-------------------------
And among my hammock, during the afternoon, I woke up naked  
and full of tiredness.  
You create  
slowly into an area to set your business.  
As soon as the incoming fragrances of strawberry  
gives the slightest indication.  
Deep brown water to my rustling land!  
Among deep brown water and crimson clusters.  
The day books you in its mortal jungle.  
But the bottle loved the memory.  
Pockets of broken glass converted into diamond.
