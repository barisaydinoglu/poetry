Hearing As Ghosts
-----------------
And the honeysuckle to its phemonana  
and among the souls the vertical one  
the sailor covered with equinoctial magnolium.  
Went relinquished in eddy the poetic dignity of the moon!  
The wound imposes nessecity.  
The graces exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
among it in  
darkness.  
And meetings of negligent arm the night around hers  
a story we speak in passing,  
with notions of tiredness  
and a passion for photography and photography  
pure cadaver lights the tigers a current of deedy flute  
that does not know why it flows and excites.  
Against the dilute city of distorted curtain.  
In the face of so many lances to animosity. I took on frightened  
rituals.  
Halfway.  
And with my hammock, during the night, I woke up naked  
and full of happiness.  
Like imbroglios mourning in front of bridges.  
You see mouth as decisive as the wind.  
You - the promising hand.  
I attract as if within a melancholy croak.
