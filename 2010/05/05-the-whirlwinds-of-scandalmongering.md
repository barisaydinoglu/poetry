The Whirlwinds Of Scandalmongering
----------------------------------
Conversations of railroad tracks, the recitation  
of starry skies we call fluidic productivity.  
The polyp appreciates on its crooked mare  
wetting crimson splendors  
over the region.  
A cheerless projection ignores  
even the resolute  
side vicinity in point of view  
to which the metaphor  
will not be magnified.  
The afternoon faucets you in its mortal mud.  
Waking from negligent silicon.  
Pockets of iron converted into gem.  
Of your opaque dark foliage when you hold out your heart.  
You are the careless aunt of a toucan,  
the thirsty ness of the circus, the power of the fire.  
  
Fewer and fewer  
decay about another mode of felicity.  
To the starry color of the marble bird feather.
