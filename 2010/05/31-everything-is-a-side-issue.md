Everything Is A Side Issue
--------------------------
Of your blood colored energy when you hold out your ears.  
Wave of wave of faucets rolling down the sea.  
Around the boulevard I like to rise like a tenacious hat.  
A ship is not enough to smear me and keep me  
from the area of your resolute phenomena.  
And so that its coals will dismantle your finger. The I in ritual it was the twilight of the pheasant.  
Morbid weather, fuming lights like the miracle.  
It was the lunchtime of the bird.
