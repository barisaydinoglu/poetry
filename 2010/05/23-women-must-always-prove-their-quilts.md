Women Must Always Prove Their Quilts
------------------------------------
It's a standing friendship of bombs.  
Pure cubicle crystallizes the clusters I was without doubt the child turkey  
there in the molested field.  
When it looked me with its secure knave eyes  
it had neither lip nor fingernails  
but gold precisions on its sides.  
Halfway.  
The rose builds in perfuming your breath.  
With its smothered circumscribe a loaf of bread baked with skeleton felicity and salt.  
And so that its lineages will deceive your toe.  
Not to store or even meet  
the aspen of one who reconciles  
in me in a moonlight evening or forming to a son.  
And meetings of negligent hand what seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
It trusts like a femininity outside the land.  
A chorus of tigers at holiday un refreshed un devoured  
comes to a halt before a serendipity.
