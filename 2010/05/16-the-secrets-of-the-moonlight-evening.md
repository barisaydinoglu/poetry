The Secrets Of The Moonlight Evening
------------------------------------
All rituals become invasions.  
A language for identity is the lack thereof.  
In the wayside branch, many negligent self-productions.  
Multitude of bottles!  
In and out of the sepia the marine and the transparent  
  
The wet-winged crab plays against the noble complaints.  
You've asked me what the cat is growing there with his crimson hand?  
I reply, the bird feather knows this.  
Banal weather, dilute lights like the planetarium.  
And maps and stones.  
Enjoy the many shaken attempts to relinquish  
the fluidic puberty.  
There is stationary fortune in kissing it.  
I'd do it for the breakfast in which you attract  
for the horses of blue you've formed.  
Around the region I like to shower like a molested coral.
