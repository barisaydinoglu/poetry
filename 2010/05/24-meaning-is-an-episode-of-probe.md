Meaning Is An Episode Of Probe
------------------------------
The heart begins in flowing your ears.  
A chorus of squirrels at day un sought un hated  
comes to a halt before a promise.  
The soft moons silenced clenched weather, boney lights like the silence.  
Joy is gone, the subject has relaxed.  
Not discovering is a form of rustling.  
All awes become juices.  
There are no lightnings but neurotic cycles of phemonana and crimson  
moons of trusting putrid graphite.  
To seek another land you are the parched aunt of a tiger,  
the tenacious ness of the love, the power of the ice.  
  
Apple.  
And amid my hammock, during the lunchtime, I woke up naked  
and full of felicity.  
On what exiled conspirators built with heat?  
Nothing but your pure heart.  
You - the real lip.  
You are the obscene mother of a tiger,  
the weak ness of the essence, the power of the water.  
What fleeting telegraphs -  
the vicinity is filled with it,  
ships for the maternity and the tremulous cedar.  
My deedy nose showers you always.  
Where fleshes meet  
cactuss meet, around and in and the sound  
of seperations, to reach out and recover in embarassement.  
Towards those guitars of yours that wait for  
me.
