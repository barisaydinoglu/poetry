I Have Gone Expanding
---------------------
Only  
browbeaten and to a  
pioneer they take on time, three hundred years  
the polyp imposes nessecity.  
To seek another land the father smiles at the mother  
but the bride does not smile  
when he looks  
at the pheasant pioneer  
and the morbid ocean.  
What curiosities does the oyster contain?  
How little we dedicate and how much it seizes the phenomena of this universe.  
I'd do it for the promise in which you blush  
for the flints of cashmire you've gathered. Only springtime, just the  
home, nothing but  
it. Thread.  
With its parched live a image discovers,  
brainwashes - it does not return.
