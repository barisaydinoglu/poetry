The Antenna Called The Hand
---------------------------
There are many clandenstines inside rambunctious events.  
And you fell in the illusion and conducted a soddening seperation.  
Like lances devouring in fellowships.  
A flag pacifying will awaken  
the calculating clay of a planet.  
All waves become legless horses.  
A laminated sign -like stalactite  
a synonym perches,  
kills - it does not return.  
.  
Fatherless shrapnels and fuming shardss of silk.  
You are the tremulous person of a lobster,  
the windy ness of the faucet, the power of the water.  
We open the halves of a epiphany and the  
shattering of blades re-covers into  
the scrupulous archipeligos.  
  
Neither ritual nor cluster nor brimstone  
nor sepia but yellow.  
The water sweet-smelling complaints are decayed.  
All spheres become waxes.  
Within marine water and transparent apples.  
Outside the land like ash.  
A ultraviolet and oily friendship is brainwashed in the divisions.  
Went dawned in banner neither grape nor eddy nor turqoise  
nor blue but blue.
