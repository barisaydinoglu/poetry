A Song Of Anger
---------------
In the face of so many lances to animosity.  
This sifted flint and perching light disguises me  
with it's perfect mists like lip and ears  
and ultraviolet starry skies like hand and wheatfields.  
The reasons for my respect  
are expanded in my brow of copper.  
If you were not the sugar the aromatic moon  
cooks, sprinkling its sugar across the modern office.  
Eager, paper-mache sphere!  
You love headlong into an archipeligos to flutter your business.  
Towards those leaves of yours that wait for me.
