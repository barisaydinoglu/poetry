It Discovered With Kisses
-------------------------
Refreshing toward the miracle trusting the flag of her rose full of happiness. A sweet-smelling drizzle of momenta.  
From her shoulder and her breath create  
laminated signs of the earth.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the lion hearted necklaces?  
And the sunshine thick splattering its fellowships and wetting them full of  
city and bird?  
Multitude of horses!  
In and out  
of the transluscent crimson the marine and the marine
