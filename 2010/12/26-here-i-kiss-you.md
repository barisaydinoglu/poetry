Here I Kiss You
---------------
A train is not enough to strike me and keep me  
from the archipeligos of your plumed phenomena. When the divisions is full of mourning mouth  
in front of lards and pale insatiable mosaics  
and the blood-stained forms and the fleshes  
at last give forth their insatiable wounded soldier.  
The fragrance of strawberry travels in awakening your breath.  
  
Hearing from parched gold.  
Mixing a fellowship  
refreshed in the cosmic rain.
