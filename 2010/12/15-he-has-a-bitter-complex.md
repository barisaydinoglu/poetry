He Has A Bitter Complex
-----------------------
You - the parenthetical shoulder.  
The raucous jaguar blossoms against the great conspirators.  
What penetrates the props of purity?  
A chorus of squirrels at fortnight un breathed un dismantled  
Comes to a halt before an autumn.  
It is a tale of boney flasks gentleman of the depths of my hand - your discovering  
stills your resplendent regard as though it were earth.  
Violenet salivas and acidulous puberties.  
A cinnamon crown mixes.  
The starlights exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
with it in darkness.  
Be guided by the balanced mist's starlight.  
The dashing dignity of the jar!  
You promise slowly into a divisions to fashion your business.  
  
Return to the homeland of the friendships.  
If you were not the sugar the fluidic moon  
cooks, sprinkling its lemon across the city.
