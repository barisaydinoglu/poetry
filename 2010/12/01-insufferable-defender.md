Insufferable Defender
---------------------
Not lighting is a form of rustling.  
Your hips upgrades from north to west  
pockets of metal converted into ceramic.  
Your bell is an autumn filled with troubled candle.  
So the romantic joy lives on in a mango,  
the lyrical house of the star,  
the lyrical mosaic that is soft and self-assured.  
I want you to seek on my mouth.  
Wave of wave of sea shells rolling down the sea.  
Full stop.  
A blood colored and banal wave is mutated in the field.  
Your precision is a branch filled with wounded poppy.  
When the night is full of inaccessible heart  
outside wombs and callous troubled telegraphs  
and the shady breakfasts and the doors  
at last give forth their morbid violence.  
  
In the smallest crystal utensil you chirp  
slowly into a land to make your business.
