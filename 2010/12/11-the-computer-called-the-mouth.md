The Computer Called The Mouth
-----------------------------
Not  
perfuming is a form of rustling. Galloping from worn-out silicon.  
Brings all the rejects crowns.  
Sunburst orange fire to my boney knave!  
Shut  
up and shut up like a shades of sunburst  
orange.  
The utensils exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
inside it in darkness.  
An odor has built against the wave,  
a mixture of evil and body, a protecting  
shoreline that brings sorrow.  
A sweet-smelling linoleum making a lion hearted thing of a unlikely meeting with a man.  
  
Halfway.  
Green sky to my mourning aspen!
