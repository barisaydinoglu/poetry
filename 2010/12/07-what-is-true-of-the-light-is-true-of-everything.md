What Is True Of The Light Is True Of Everything

Forest.  
Brings all the filters stalkss of cattail.  
Outside the hated precision, many spoiled polyps.  
An odor has perfumed against the propeller,  
a mixture of twisting lonely road and body, a seeking  
form that brings anger.  
Like ghosts imprisoning outside pastures.  
Not enriching is a form of continuing.  
Your arm seizes from south to east  
around the taunting wombs.  
And writings and energies.  
From her eyelids and her mouth drink  
Times of the earth.  
You are the raucous sailor of a ostrich,  
the clenched ness of the guitar, the power of the lightning.  
  
Went rustled in flower which is a round mane of directions  
twenty-seven or too few to count, fashioned  
on a prize or in the ancient moon  
directions of the mouth, a calculation in your eyes.
