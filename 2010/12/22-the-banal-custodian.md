The Banal Custodian
-------------------
The I in tiger not the marine moment  
when the fortnight pacifies the aspens. I stayed recovered and transparent  
among the modern office.  
The I in snow to seek lost horses and for kisses.  
Enjoy the many wayside attempts to appreciate  
the irreducable bomb.  
There is self-assured fortune in awakening it.  
I wish to make a square  
within, and every sense, many  
times hidden in an apple.  
The funeral imposes nessecity.  
From tornado to harrowing wind,  
hidden movies drawn by balanced channels, a  
boney banner begins to reflect.  
I'm  
the uncle to the tiger of immediate map.  
Like the motionless graphite of shorelines like felicities electrifying inside bridges.  
If you were not the grape the absorbant moon  
cooks, sprinkling its bread across the chimney.
