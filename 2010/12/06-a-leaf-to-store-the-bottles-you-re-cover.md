A Leaf To Store The Bottles You Re-cover
----------------------------------------
In the blood colored agony of the depth.  
Multitude of foliages!  
In and out of the opaque deep brown the marine and the opaque cinnamon  
Sordid night and the boney ivory architecture  
forebode at the walls of my house. Because I love you, love, among the earth and around the heat.
