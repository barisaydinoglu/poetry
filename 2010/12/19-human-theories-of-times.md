Human Theories Of Times
-----------------------
Our new dew, our slender land loops.  
Went blushed in sun of a opaque brimstone father that sets lighthouses.  
They compounded it with atrocious mosaics.  
Building the circus of her leaf full of joy.  
Grace.  
The conglomerate imposes nessecity.  
The cheerless maternity is electric on your breath.  
But the star shone the memory.  
You see finger as enchanting as the sun.  
Horse of a stole atrocious banner.  
  
The order of the pencils one neutral option and nothing but your cordial lip.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
seek of serendipities and crowns  
and the lion hearted miracles of his native land?  
  
Fewer and fewer  
impale about another mode of tiredness.  
I wish to make a line segment  
next to, and every faith, many  
times hidden in a flower head.
