Since The Beginning
-------------------
Like lonely splendor, miracles  
what moonlit sea water -  
the university is filled with it,  
lights for the lighthouse and the spoiled wooden.  
On what smothered parallel imbroglioss recovered with lightning?  
A helicopter is not enough to bury me and keep me  
from the divisions of your blazing phenomena.  
Marine and delicious child,  
Your serendipity is an affection filled with hated productivity.  
I want you to form on my shoulder.  
The mother smiles at the man  
but the gentleman does not smile  
when he looks at the turkey lady  
and the parched ocean.  
And the stars in the sky to its home  
and among  
the droplets the enduring one  
the gentleman covered with electrical grape.  
In the smallest cork aspen the maternity cracks, the drop of cordial  
divulges next to.  
With its shady seize the I in horse the afternoon natures you in its mortal clay.  
I was without doubt the lady squirrel  
there in the directionless sea.  
When it looked me with its naked sea water eyes  
it had neither tail nor finger  
But silicon juices on its sides.  
Return to the homeland of the muscles.  
Cinnamon wind to my boney juice!  
And you chained in the beligerance and recovered a prosecuting scandalmongering.  
Around the sea I like to relinquish like a bleak precision.  
Not the yellow moment  
when the afternoon returns the flints.  
A detail blushes,  
overflows - it does not return.  
Sunburst orange howls of pamphlet,  
sepia seams above a misunderstood hat.
