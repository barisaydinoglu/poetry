A Gold Within Emerald
---------------------
The order of the mirrors what we say reconciles to  
store some other daughter  
what a phenomenon may teach.  
And meetings of mechanical hips I travel as if with a blood-stained yeast.  
Be guided by the musical home's  
bottle.  
And the candle to its maternity  
and among the smooth stones the myriad one  
the astronaut covered with clear starlight.  
And so  
that its pamphlets will loathe your heart. Honeysuckle.
