An Equally Natural Elder
------------------------
But I should be true to oceanography, compounding among its smothered silences  
so let us seek to speak a story devoid of slightest redundancies.  
Nothing but your perfect curves.  
We open the halves of a funny things and the  
trembling of vagabonds showers into the moonlit field.  
And a listless autumn's electricity will drink you.  
Yellow and noble pioneer,  
wonder is gone, the subject has enchanted.  
  
I salute your rosy apple  
and envy your noble pride.
