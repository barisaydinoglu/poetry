Your Hand Is Enough
-------------------
  
Build on the abberations that wait for you  
abandoning the distorted chairs, drowning the doors.  
Enjoy the many sterile attempts to promise  
the great gate.  
There is eloquent fortune in developing it.  
On what oily oblivions understood with heat?  
Carry me onto your boat - the fruit of my magnolium -  
You say, what is the sun waiting for in its opaque sepia sea water?  
I tell you it is waiting for autumn like you.  
Connecting from senile diamond.  
  
A loaf of bread baked with brutal tiredness and salt.  
Draw from it the fragmented  
camera of its own identity.
