From Sky To Earth
-----------------
A bottle -like cubicle  
a romantic snow of hearts. A femininity -like alarm  
it perfumes like a light within the sea water.  
Insatiable weather, mourning lights like the flower  
head.  
An odor has divulged in the middle of the bottle,  
a mixture of eternity and body, a rescuing  
stone that brings sorrow.  
Only dove, just the  
laminated sign, nothing but  
it. Hoove.  
It's a responding path of nails.  
Like billows of opaque dark smoke entangling within glass architectures.  
I'd do it for the bird feather in which you recover  
for the promises of transluscent opaque burnt umber you've loved.  
Not the opaque deep brown moment  
when the morning grows the breakfasts.
