Everyday You Fly
----------------
Because I love you, love, with the lightning and outside the earth.  
I want you to imbue on my brain.  
You are the orange of my hairy brain.  
A chorus of jaguars at  
late afternoon un protected un shook  
comes to a halt before a ritual.  
The flower knows this,  
that life in it's wooden boxes is as endless as the productivity.  
I stayed transformed and transparent  
in the room.  
  
Wave of wave of mists rolling down the sea.
