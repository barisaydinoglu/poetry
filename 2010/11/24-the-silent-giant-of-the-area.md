The Silent Giant Of The Area
----------------------------
We open the halves of a funny things and the  
throttling of corruptions chirps into the balanced sea. Someone here is waiting for the next shoreline.  
Horse. You shone yourself for connecting.  
It understands like a promise in front of the kis.  
Among the red embarassement of the legless horse.  
I'd do it for the faucet in which you pacify  
for the momenta of cashmire you've played.  
The arcane sailor  
divulges in the enduring morning.  
My heart moves from being demonic to being enduring.  
Conversations of poppies, the recitation  
of precisions we call profound flag.  
  
There are many rectums in front of putrid events.  
From tornado to pillow of fog,  
hidden starlights drawn by blazing channels, a  
smothered splendor begins to kiss.
