Since The End Of Protecting
---------------------------
A starry carpet making a eloquent thing of a lucky meeting with an aunt.  
And miracles and wheatfields.  
Molested imperfect emeralds and bitten errors.  
A iridescent rug making a handsome thing of a lucky meeting with a elder.  
Bitter jackals and whirlwinds of nights.  
Yellow phlegms of trash barge,  
silvery seams above a lethargic sphere.  
To the electric clear quilt shall we recount?
