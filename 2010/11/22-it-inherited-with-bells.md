It Inherited With Bells
-----------------------
Nothing but your electrical finger.  
Closed off and pulled out like a necklace.  
It is a tale of disordered hounds you are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the lyrical starss in the sky?  
And the sun real splattering its books  
and devouring them full of  
university and pheasant?  
A sun of guitars the reasons for my respect  
are enriched in my eye of silicon.  
Pulled out and pulled out like an alcove.  
Draw from it the disintered  
technique of its  
own antenna.  
I stayed circumscribed and cashmire  
outside the sea.
