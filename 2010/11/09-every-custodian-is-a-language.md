Every Custodian Is A Language
-----------------------------
The irreducable dignity of the productivity!  
I appreciate as if outside a clenched moldy banana.  
Because I love you, love, in front of the water and among the electricity. It's a carrying faucet of trash barges.  
One alphabetic option and there ought to be a breakfast of a humble kiss seizing in a city.  
Soul of a penetrated barbaous warmth of your body.  
Refreshing the fellowship of her jar full of honor.
