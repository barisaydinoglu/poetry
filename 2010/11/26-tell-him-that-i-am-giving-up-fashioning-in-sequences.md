Tell Him That I Am Giving Up Fashioning In Sequences
----------------------------------------------------
Understanding toward the peace the cummerbund imposes nessecity.  
Nobody here is waiting for the next foliage.  
Door. You heard yourself for flying.  
For heart was muzzled and morally negative.  
When the thicket is full of worn-out brow  
Behind legless horses and forceful exiled dews  
and the bitterest moons and the threads  
at last give forth their violenet wound.  
The order of the juices amid the green breath of the mud.  
A line segment inside a line,  
the phosphorus workings of sweet-smelling law.  
The seperation refreshes on its wounded mare  
Setting cashmire paths over the room.  
And so that its wombs will decay your ears.  
I am deprived by flower head and clandenstine, by stick and fog.  
The forceful evening star is electrical on your brow.  
You - the humble eyelids.  
You perch my dead invasion  
like a friendly iguana to fresh bread.  
Closed off and shut up like a telegraph.  
I'd do it for the faucet in which you understand  
for the snows of marine you've breathed.  
The order of the hooves so the fleeting respect lives on in  
a kiwi,  
The mineral house of the ritual,  
the deedy sun that is spacious and acerb.  
Of a blood colored stranger  
that rejoices laminated signs.  
Transparent electricity to my fuming star!  
  
Realized stationary aroma in the face of so many vortices to positivity.  
Full stop.
