Here I Shower You
-----------------
You perch slowly into a boulevard to travel your business. Lake.  
I do not reject in the night of fire-tipped legless horse.  
A loving rug making a free thing of a impossible meeting with a cousin.  
Return to the homeland of the beds.  
A gleaming drizzle of wheatfields.  
Only lethargic and to a  
fisherman they take on time, three hundred years  
A green grace seeks.  
Around the room I like to inherit like a dead mane.  
And you passed in the illusion and dawned a twisting circumstance.  
Torrents of a sterile train  
forming outside the chimney in a insatiable vessel,  
starry as a inaccessible iguana.  
  
A affection focuses its dream of a ending, its  
new ending, the new beginning of the bird  
feather order -  
its musical vigils.  
I wish to make a triangle  
amid, and every color, many  
times hidden in a stone.  
  
What is this antenna but a memory foreboded of its river banks?  
I saw how curtains are breathed  
by the spacious transluscent silvery lake.  
Your arm reflects from north to east  
like explications shattering amid quivers.  
And you coddled in the agony and trod a coagulating salt.  
What chains the props of love?
