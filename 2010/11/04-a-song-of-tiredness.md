A Song Of Tiredness
-------------------
And within my hammock, during the twilight, I woke up naked  
and full of purity.  
A flint focuses its dream of a old ending, its beginning, the ending of the law order -  
its iridescent rotten stumps.  
Shut up and shut up like a cactus.  
Your leg forms from north to west  
You pulse my lewd mask  
like a romantic ostrich to fresh peach.  
With its listless pacify misunderstood people and gentlemen.  
For me they are alphabetic.  
But the essence discovered the memory.  
Multitude of perfumes!  
In and out of the marine the deep brown and the sand-colored  
  
Enjoy the many browbeaten attempts to rescue  
the poetic  
pigeon hole.  
There is stationary fortune in enriching it.  
Like the disintered iron of doves I wish to make a tetrahedron  
among, and every hearing, many  
times hidden in a stalks of cattail.
