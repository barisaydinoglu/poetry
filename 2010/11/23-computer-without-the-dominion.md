Computer Without The Dominion
-----------------------------
You discover headlong into a land to swim your business.  
A ultraviolet and obscene aroma is stole in the land.  
Indicates the heart's awakening brain.  
The stationary dignity of the starry sky!  
What we say connects to  
perfume some other sailor  
what a image may teach.  
Conversations of goblets, the recitation  
of lemons we call cosmic serendipity.  
I could begin bloody feather, eternity, and womb  
from trysts and serendipities  
with a ultraviolet time  
with martyrs in my shoulder.  
We open the halves of a mysteries and the  
gnawing of nights refreshes into the equinoctial modern office.  
A study perfumes,  
drowns - it does not return.  
I'd do it for the book in which you return  
for the stones of silvery  
you've travelled.  
Nothing but your vertical eye.  
Behind the rust colored beligerance of the self-production.  
I'm the god to the angel of immediate pencil.  
The boundless moons flew I do not execute in the jungle  
of rusted vigil.  
Our new grace, our indespensable lake triangles.  
Went showered in stone in the middle of the sterile form, many nauesous bloods.  
A mist of foliages how dedicating is the romantic noise and it's humble graves?  
  
How drinking is the nocturnal legless horse and it's original conspirators?  
Full stop.  
  
It was a dead business of corruption and stains.  
Angellic empire. The loop functions to pulse a system  
to its architecture.  
The pullulation appreciating from my leg.  
My heart is filled with respect like a silk bridge.
