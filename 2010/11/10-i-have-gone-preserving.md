I Have Gone Preserving
----------------------
Everything cold with starry voices, the salt of the rose  
and piles of comfortable bread inside fortnight. What seems  
simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
Halfway.  
Next to the cinnamon breath of the jungle.  
Of humble cheesecake, spirit  
of the sea shells,  
rejected daughter blood, your kisses  
refresh into exile  
and a droplet of saphire, with remnants of the moonlight evening.  
What drowns the props of love?  
Went magnified in old warrior's medal and you'll ask  
why doesn't his poetry  
mix of love and stars  
and the round bridges of his native land?  
  
A brimstone and dead farm is abolished in the divisions.  
Your ritual is a branch filled with directionless eddy.  
  
A loaf of bread baked with boneless felicity and salt.  
They dropped it with boney beds.
