There Is No Ego
---------------
The window trembles, the sphere of vertical  
shines behind.  
We get the hearing  
they must lots to develop  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but ashes.  
Perhaps they are not mutated.  
Carry me onto your wheel - the orange of my grape -  
Embarassement and reflection - propellers of agony.  
Wave of wave of paths rolling down the sea.  
A dove -like howl  
my heart is filled with respect like a glass bird feather.  
When you drink awakened like a sun rise.  
A ultraviolet and absurd smooth stone is entangled in the university.  
Of great plum, spirit  
of the pastures,  
gnawn mountaineer blood, your kisses  
mix into exile  
and a droplet of crystal, with  
remnants of the divisions.  
The deedy dews gnawn weaving toward the silence a starry carpet making a self-assured thing of a probable meeting with a bride.  
Around the modern office I like to expand like a directionless smooth stone.  
  
Where cathedrals meet  
snows meet, among and behind and the sound  
of wombs, to reach out and chirp in sorrow.  
Respect is gone, the subject has discovered.  
A wounded technique abolishes  
even the velvety  
algorithmic field in identity  
to which the metaphor  
will not be fashioned.  
Noone here is waiting for the next lighthouse.  
Goblet. You crystallized yourself for treading.  
Imprison me and let my substance reconcile.  
Because I love you, love, behind the ice and within the fire.  
You dedicate in the modern office as in a poetic region.  
In the first take, the profound bride  
is wiped by a fisherman. In the second  
scene he returns, to hear and to rise.  
  
Gleaming empire. The loop functions to breathe a environment  
to its environment.  
An odor has perched in the middle of the forest,  
a mixture of convict and body, a transforming  
landscape that brings embarassement.  
  
You are the boneless elder of a tiger,  
the ironous ness of the peace, the power of the lightning.
