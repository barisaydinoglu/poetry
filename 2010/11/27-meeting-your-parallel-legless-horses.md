Meeting Your Parallel Legless Horses
------------------------------------
Which is a monastic writing of directions  
too few to count or too many to count, swam  
on a quiver or in the resplendent school  
directions of the curves, a calculation in your eyelidss.  
You are the grape of my ghostly brain.  
Realized full essence it was the holiday of the turkey.  
Tree of a died dead path.  
And you imprisoned in the beligerance and relaxed a fainting lance.  
  
It was the sunrise of the toucan.  
Wave of wave of writings rolling down the sea.
