Gentlemen Must Always Prove Their Elixirs
-----------------------------------------
An odor has formed behind the wheatfield,  
a mixture of funeral and body, a responding  
smooth steel that brings confusion.  
I stayed stood and silvery  
against the land.  
Evening star.  
A femininity -like trash  
from her tail and her curves divulge  
autumns of the earth.  
Nothing but your plumed eye.  
Like stalactites twisting around flints.  
Outside the obscene room of bruised prize.  
I took on bitter flowers.  
Wreath.  
In my  
sea at lunchtime you are like a quiver  
and your form and colour the way I excite them.  
On what muzzled cummerbunds flew with sky?
