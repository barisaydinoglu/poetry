Everyday You Reflect
--------------------
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the lyrical magnoliums?  
And the thunder eloquent splattering its poppies and shattering them full of  
city and tiger?  
To the cosmic color of the ivory atom.  
A red and harsh maternity is struck in the land. You see nose as cleansed as the sun.
