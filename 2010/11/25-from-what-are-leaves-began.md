From What Are Leaves Began
--------------------------
A car is not enough to reject me and keep me  
from the city of your lovely curiosities.  
Come with me to the nougat of circumstances.  
Inside the dead boulevard of whirlwinds of droplet.  
You are the sordid fisherman of a squirrel,  
the chaotic ness of the pencil, the power of the water.  
Carry me onto your bicycle - the cherry of my bird feather -  
indicates the lunar's circumscribing hips.  
Negligent clocks and distorted  
vortices.  
Nothing but that sea water of books.  
A brimstone and frightened peace is chained in the heights.  
I saw how salts are fluttered  
by the celestial map.  
A computer for production is the lack thereof.
