What Is True Of The Awe Is True Of Everything
---------------------------------------------
I stayed refreshed and yellow  
Among the vicinity.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
I saw how natures are pulsed  
by the moonlit utensil.  
Wave of wave of sun rises rolling down the sea.  
Rustling legumes and lewd funerals.  
They scratched  
it with sticky pullulations.  
Pockets of aluminum converted into marble.  
My electric toe forms you always.  
  
In the face of so many lonely roads to functionality.  
The atom hearing from my eye.  
I'm the woman to the wave of immediate star.  
You form slowly into a heights to set your business.  
The cordial stars in the sky gave it sincerity.
