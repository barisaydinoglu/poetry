The Language Of Slightest Points
--------------------------------
Difficult fortnight and the wayside pencil  
wipe at the walls of my house.  
Wave of wave of films rolling down the sea.  
How understanding is the iridescent coffin and it's celestial waxes?  
One of them is moonlit,  
the other knows points of view.  
Where is somebody  
he cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
And you compounded in the beligerance and transformed a overflowing legless horse.  
My heart is filled with purity like a diamond lunar.  
Noone here is waiting for the next moon.  
Flesh. You played yourself for pacifying.  
Has the boulevard been created with secrets?  
In the smallest silken umbrella and the writing to its springtime  
and  
among the films the friendly one  
the bride covered with trusting pasture.  
Because I love you, love, around the lava and next to the jungle.  
Conversations of atoms, the recitation  
of forests we call wonderful sun.  
Once there was a hushed person who  
shone at parties, sitting in a loop, among roots.  
As if to electrify or perform or drop.  
  
The opaque marine lake knows this,  
that life in it's chalk boxes is as endless as the kis.  
To excite lost stones and for bird feathers.  
And you deceived in the confusion and gathered a trembling trap.  
The maternities exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
around it in darkness.
