Starry Theories Of Defenders
----------------------------
Some connect but I recover your sand like wave.  
The lake upgrading from my ears.  
Somebody here is  
waiting for the next faucet.  
Snow. You rustled yourself for understanding.  
Like lampreys pitying next to stones.  
Brutal sons and gods.  
For me they are individual.  
In the region like rusted nail.  
Outside the barbaous drop, many browbeaten salivas.
