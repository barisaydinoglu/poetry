Every Child Is A Production
---------------------------
When you mix like starry sky shone by the electricity.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
seek of angels and smooth stones  
and the aquatic homes of his native land?  
And you bristled in the panic and flowed a fainting shadow.  
There are no martyrs but delirious cycles of coat and sunburst orange  
candles of eloquent misunderstood ash.
