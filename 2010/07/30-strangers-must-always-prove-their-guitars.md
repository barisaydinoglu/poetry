Strangers Must Always Prove Their Guitars
-----------------------------------------
You shower in the modern office as in a noble night.  
Come with me to the ego of rotten stumps.  
Has the chimney been entertained with secrets?  
My heart moves from being misunderstood to being soft.  
When the area is full of lashed curves  
within wounded soldiers and wounded phosphorus flowers  
and the clotting wheatfields and the knaves  
at last give forth their clenched probe.  
My heart is filled with felicity like a silken deep brown car.  
The mane disguises, the telegraph of eloquent  
sets inside.  
I am abandoned by quilt and cold fire, by clock and thunder.  
How chirping is the pure lance and it's silent clefts?  
The sea water erupts, the knave of mineral  
entertains within.  
  
You are the tomato of my exiled mouth.  
Our new leaf, our vertical smooth graphite  
triangles.  
  
Everything lethargic with irreducable voices, the salt of the angel  
and piles of balanced bread inside afternoon.  
A deep brown shades of burnt umber stores.
