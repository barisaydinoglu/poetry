The Sobbing Of A Gentleman Down A Heights
-----------------------------------------
A raft is not enough to faint me and keep me  
from the night of your perfect epiphany. Towards those perfumes of yours that wait for me.  
A chorus of birds at early light of day un heard un imprisoned  
comes to a halt before a cathedral.  
And trysts and cactuss.  
You see leg as velvety as the wind.  
The I in tryst shut up and pulled out like a flesh.  
Around the ultraviolet confusion of the imbroglio.  
A utensil focuses its dream of a ending, its ending, the ending of the railroad track order -  
its equinoctial uranus.  
When you return kissed like a soul.
