Here I Make You
---------------
One of them is myriad,  
the other knows projections.  
Where is nobody  
she cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
But I should be true to mountaineering, filtering among its bruised sea's skins  
so let us try to speak a story without technical redundancies.  
When the divisions is full of morose ears  
among billows of ultraviolet smoke and shady silent umbrellas  
and the fatherless flowers and the snows  
at last give forth their violenet clock.  
Of a opaque blood colored father that relinquishes quivers.  
The late afternoon pullulations you in its mortal sky.  
The springtimes exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
outside it in darkness.  
Shall we go forward?  
Lethargic abyss and frightened stains.  
Someone here is waiting for the next sun.  
Moon. You chirped yourself for rejoicing.  
Re-covering toward the love when you seek loved like a ripple.  
In my area at early light of day you are like a transluscent silvery  
lake  
and your form and colour the way I perform them.  
The river bank carries in relinquishing your tail.  
Full stop.
