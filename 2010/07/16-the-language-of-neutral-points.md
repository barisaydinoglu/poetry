The Language Of Neutral Points
------------------------------
I  
saw how wreaths are fluttered  
by the slender writing.  
Skeleton mountaineers and mothers.  
For me they are slightest.  
You see eye as myriad as the snow. Like the bitter ash of fountains like clocks protesting inside snows.  
It was a sifted business of trash barge and juices.
