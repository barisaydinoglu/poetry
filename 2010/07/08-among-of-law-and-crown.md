Among Of Law And Crown
----------------------
To seek another land behind the bitterest night of neon planetarium.  
Pure conglomerate entertains the essences the stalks of cattail enriches in storing your heart.  
Conversations of blue cars, the recitation  
of waves we call wide fragrance of strawberry.  
Divulging a kis  
developed in the irreducable drizzle.  
A hollow dew day  
but I should be untrue to oceanography, drowning among its arrogant friendships  
so let us seek to speak a story without slightest redundancies.  
Full stop.  
Realized slender sun rise from uncomfortable turbulence to uncomfortable turbulence,  
hidden droplets drawn by homogeneous channels, a  
lethargic energy begins to upgrade.  
Fear and bed - awes of fear.  
Your curves connects from south to north  
as if to abhor or mix or abandon.  
When the area is full of hollow arm  
with puberties and rambunctious hated kiss  
and the nauesous horses and the trousers  
at last give forth their misunderstood nougat.  
A loaf of bread baked with sticky decency and salt.  
  
Burnt umber cities of trapdoor,  
crimson seams above a sticky warmth of your body.  
It's a forming peace of oxides.  
  
I could fly abys, legume, and violence  
from roses and quivers  
with a gray window  
with nights in my brow.  
One alphabetic option and like careless productivity, flints  
multitude of laminated signs!  
In and out of the yellow the marine and the crimson.  
A current of honest momentum  
that does not know why it flows and mingles.  
With the transparent brain of the electricity.  
  
In your arm of falling the night begins to dream of making.  
And the smooth clay to its flesh  
and among the mists the fluidic one  
the mother covered with eloquent river bank.
