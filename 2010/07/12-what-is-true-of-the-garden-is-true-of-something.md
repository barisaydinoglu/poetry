What Is True Of The Garden Is True Of Something
-----------------------------------------------
And sea's skins and mists.  
Joy is gone, the subject has perched.  
To the absorbant human laminated sign the delicate astronaut  
rejoices in the verdure morning.  
From her leg and her fingernails mingle  
bottles of the earth.  
Where mirrors meet  
peaces meet, inside and inside and the sound  
of walls, to reach out and continue in fear.  
Pulled out and closed off like a drop.  
Everything dry with honest voices, the salt of the acrobat  
and piles of fresh bread behind late afternoon.  
The bell mourns, the maternity of unguessed  
swims inside.  
Some set but I seek your metal like ritual.  
She is behind us at this moment of first recovering.  
Magnifying a movie  
relaxed in the parenthetical  
sun.  
For a day, maybe too few to count,  
I rested under a tornado  
at a post office, waiting for the uncle to be among.  
Conversations of eddies, the recitation  
of doors we call noble phemonana.  
The order of the branches sifted mothers and ladies.  
For me they are alphabetic.  
Which is a vertical landscape of directions  
too few to count or million, responded  
on an angel or in the infinite starry sky  
directions of the breath, a calculation in your mouths.  
  
Some imbue but I grow  
your sand like school.  
To preserve lost coats and for eddies.  
  
In the face of so many cubicles to functionality.  
A brow and a leg  
flying the boulevard.
