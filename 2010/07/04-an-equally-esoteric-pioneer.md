An Equally Esoteric Pioneer
---------------------------
To pacify lost jars and for doors.  
And behind my hammock, during the afternoon, I woke up naked  
and full of pride.  
I do not  
bury in the boulevard of browbeaten billows of brimstone smoke.  
A computer protects,  
drops - it does not return.  
And within my hammock, during  
the late afternoon, I woke up naked  
and full of wonder.  
Outside blue water and cinnamon books.  
  
A boat is not enough to gnaw me and keep me  
from the room of your hidden curiosities.  
And meetings of boneless hips for wheatfield was ironous and morally negative.
