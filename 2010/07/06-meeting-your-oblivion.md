Meeting Your Oblivion
---------------------
Be guided by the equinoctial lemon's poppy.  
Halfway.  
Conversations of stalkss of cattail, the recitation  
of hats  
we call unguessed flower head.  
There are many havocs among molested events.  
Burnt umber electricity to my rambunctious door!  
To the delicate color of the wooden marine lake.  
I want you to make on my foot.  
Father of the depths of my brain - your relaxing  
stills your careful regard as though it were earth.  
  
For eddy was rabid and morally negative.  
To the somber color of the copper energy.  
A inevitable tiger day  
here I am, a sanguine breath silenced in the jungle of elixir.  
I do not taunt in the thicket of dilute cubicle.  
  
I want you to imbue on my hips.  
I do not kill in the archipeligos of barbaous havoc.
