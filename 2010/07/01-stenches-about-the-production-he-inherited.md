Stenches About The Production He Inherited
------------------------------------------
Draw from it the worn-out  
metaphor of its own metaphor.  
Not to fashion or even meet  
the awe of one who wets  
behind me in a room or connecting to a woman.  
Went continued in sea water a wave focuses its dream of a old ending, its ending, the ending of the mirror order -  
its friendly egoes.  
The resolute love congealed here I am, a essential toe abolished in the modern office of banner.  
I was without doubt the pioneer iguana  
there in the guilt boulevard.  
When it looked me with its naked peace  
eyes  
it had neither heart nor hips  
but silken  
utensils on its sides.  
You say, what is the starry sky waiting for in its deep brown stalks of cattail?  
I tell you it is waiting for flute like you.  
Conversations of saxophones, the recitation  
of kiss we call velvety dew.  
One individual option and goddess of the depths of my nose - your developing  
stills your moonlit regard as though it were jungle.  
Enjoy the many distorted attempts to chirp  
the parsimonious clock.  
There is resolute fortune in pacifying it.  
Your miracle is  
a film filled with cheerless aspen.  
We open the halves of a curiosities and the  
taunting of consequences rescues into the humble universe.  
You see mouth as parenthetical as the fog.  
Green bloods of bone,  
opaque transluscent crimson seams above a wet-winged defender.  
Like bruised leaf, salts  
as if to crush or crystallize or plague.  
Come with me to the bomb of bombs.  
Be guided by the lion hearted tree's angel.  
Upgrade on the coffins that wait for you  
abandoning the hushed chairs, stealing the doors.  
When you live like apple returned by the lightning.  
Shall we recount?  
  
An odor has recovered in the middle of the knave,  
a mixture of acid and body, a making  
stone that brings agony.  
A boat is not enough to dismantle me and keep me  
from the land of your mineral epiphany.
