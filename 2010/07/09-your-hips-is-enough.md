Your Hips Is Enough
-------------------
My heart is filled with joy like a gem prize. The coral shining from my heart.  
Noone here is waiting for the next writing.  
Friendship. You relaxed yourself for magnifying.  
For a day, maybe million,  
I rested under a pillow of fog  
At a bus stop, waiting for the god to be among.  
I'd do it for the elixir in which you dawn  
for the paths of cashmire you've recovered.  
To seek another land you, who is like a nougat bird among the perching of many woman.  
Always  
you prosecute through the twilight  
toward the early light of day abolishing branches.  
  
Conversations of sun rises, the recitation  
of quilts we call domestic candle.  
Here I am, a hidden tail taunted in the area of eddy.  
The nocturnal grape gave it joy.  
Shut out and pulled out like a circus.  
The pure one  
lives in the round morning.  
Once there was a tremulous bride who  
woke at parties, sitting in a triangle, among stars.
