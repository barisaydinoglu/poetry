Your Mouth Is Enough
--------------------
How rustling is the blazing imbroglio and it's vertical lampreys?  
I do not electrify in the area of melancholy havoc.  
An odor has conducted against the sea water,  
a mixture of moth and body, a developing  
productivity that brings sorrow.  
The silent cousin  
rustles in the nocturnal morning.  
  
She is in us at this moment of first protecting.  
A ship is  
not enough to coagulate me and keep me  
from the land of your thick phenomena.  
Enjoy the many rotten attempts to continue  
the plumed probe.  
There is cosmic fortune in refreshing it.  
I could rejoice lamprey, stalactite, and  
conglomerate  
from shorelines and lunars  
with a red window  
with abberations in my heart.  
If I could rustle the bone and the boulevard.  
It is a tale of torrential masks a spoiled language flies  
even the aquatic  
side land in technique  
to which the metaphor  
will not be dawned.  
A signal gathers,  
replaces - it does not return.
