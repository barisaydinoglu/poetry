What Is True Of The Trouser Is True Of Nothing
----------------------------------------------
Mingling a quilt  
sought in the serendipidous thunder.  
I want you to tread on my hips.  
The somber dignity of the flute!  
Multitude of spheres!  
In and out of the opaque marine the green and the silvery  
the imperfect silicon sets on its rabid mare  
upgrading cashmire rituals over the night.  
Always you sob through the sunset  
toward the late afternoon replacing poppies.  
  
Nothing but your spacious tail.  
Neither sweetnes nor laminated sign nor blood colored  
nor sand-colored but cinnamon.
