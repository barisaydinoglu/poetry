The Banal Son Of The Sea
------------------------
The spoiled pheasant weaves in the equinoctial blades. You are the senile aunt of a squirrel,  
the tear stained ness of the rose, the power of the fire.  
Only utensil, just the  
peace, nothing but  
it. Saxophone.  
A loaf of bread baked with boney pride and salt.  
A current of musical serenity  
that does not know why it flows and breathes.  
Be guided by the electric echo's poppy.  
The I in utensil sometimes a piece of the sky  
drops like a quiver in my leg.  
The order of the lakes I wish to make a line segment  
In front of, and every hearing, many  
times hidden in a sun.  
A pale springtime day  
you are the difficult lady of a jaguar,  
the dead ness of the wreath, the power of the water.  
With the cashmire fingernails of the lava.  
Making from wet-winged silk.  
A harsh elixir day  
burnt umber and round astronaut,
