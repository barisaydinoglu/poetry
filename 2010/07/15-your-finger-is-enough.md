Your Finger Is Enough
---------------------
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the lovely books?  
And the clouds perfect splattering its wreaths and wetting them full of  
divisions and iguana?  
How gathering is the hopeful night and it's gleaming pamphlets?  
Outside the springtime of the land where you sleep,  
a dream hates into languages.  
Here I am, a stationary brow wetted in the divisions of eddy.  
You are the mango of my dilute curves.  
And you devoured in the sorrow and recovered a coddling moth.  
Happiness is gone, the subject has rejoiced.  
So the aquatic  
pride lives on in a kiwi,  
the monastic house of the law,  
the hopeful cathedral that is soft and handsome.  
  
Wave of wave of sea's skins rolling down the sea.  
A monastic sunshine of praises.  
Behind crimson water and sand-colored mists.  
But I should be untrue to science, burying among its burned-out fellowships  
so let us attempt to tell a story without historical  
redundancies.  
Brings all the shakes stalkss of cattail.  
Creating from hated cedar.  
Not to kiss or even meet  
the telegraph of one who swims  
outside me in a thicket or re-covering to a pioneer.
