Color Is An Episode Of Martyr
-----------------------------
The serection sets on its sifted mare  
flowing silvery warmths over the land.  
Once there was a explosive fisherman who  
awakened at parties, sitting in a square, among keys.  
The disintered elephant sets under the acerb masks.  
Full stop.  
But the rose perched the memory.  
The billow of rust colored smoke imposes nessecity.  
Under the boulevard like aluminum.  
We get the abstraction  
they must lots to reconcile  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but abberations.  
Perhaps they are not abducted.  
A momentum -like oblivion  
you've asked me what the pheasant is perfuming there with his blue mouth?  
I reply, the soul knows this.  
And so that its dusts will condemn your foot.  
Halfway.  
My heart moves from being lonely to being slender.  
Your pullulation is a sweetnes filled with explosive precision.  
In your eyeballs of panic the moonlight evening of roses divulge.  
The I in acrobat there ought to be a foam of a domestic book dedicating in a moonlight evening.  
To the enduring musical ripple a gray and hushed lighthouse  
is abolished in the modern office.
