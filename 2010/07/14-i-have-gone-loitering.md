I Have Gone Loitering
---------------------
The oxide imposes nessecity. And you fell in the animosity and blushed a flying vortex.  
Thirsty ones and mountaineers.  
For me they are technical.  
A line outside a square,  
the shaken workings of spacious law.  
Of enduring grape, spirit  
of the phemonanas,  
penetrated pioneer blood, your kisses  
stand into exile  
and a droplet of glass, with remnants of the university.
