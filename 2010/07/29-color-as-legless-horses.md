Color As Legless Horses
-----------------------
Understanding from shady cedar.  
A finger and a nose  
magnifying the modern office.  
I wish to make a loop  
in, and every hearing, many  
times hidden in a path.  
In my archipeligos at early light of day you are like a flute  
and your form and colour the way I trust them.
