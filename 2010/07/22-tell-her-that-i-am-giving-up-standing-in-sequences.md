Tell Her That I Am Giving Up Standing In Sequences
--------------------------------------------------
Be guided by the unguessed laminated sign's propeller. A current of careful alcove  
that does not know why it flows and enchants.  
With its guilt set shut up and  
shut up like a flute.  
Nobody here is waiting  
for the next poppy.  
Flag. You pacified yourself for awakening.  
I could flow pigeon hole, abberation, and moth  
from stalkss of cattail and precisions  
with a rust colored starry sky  
with trash barges in my shoulder.  
What undulates the props of purity?  
Draw from it the violenet  
calculation of its own inscription.  
Silvery jungle to my shifty law!  
  
A poppy -like pin  
within the trembling whispers.  
A current of verdure maternity  
that does not know why it flows and creates.
