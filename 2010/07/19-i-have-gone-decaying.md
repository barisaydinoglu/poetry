I Have Gone Decaying
--------------------
Enjoy the many lashed attempts to inherit  
the serene granule.  
There is serendipidous fortune in seizing it.  
You are the mango of my obscene brain.  
The blazing dignity of the river bank!  
On what skeleton scandalmongerings magnified with heat?  
The law making from my fingernails.  
You are the grape of my fuming ears.  
She is against us at this moment of first responding.  
The corruption imposes nessecity.  
Outside the brimstone fear of the smoke.  
Has the area been entertained with mysteries?  
It's a building quiver of jugulars.  
When you pacify like goblet kissed by the heat.  
Chaotic sunrise and the inevitable curtain  
conquer at the walls of my house.
