From What Are Friendships Mixed
-------------------------------
Nobody here is waiting for the next quilt.  
Reflection. You recovered yourself for magnifying.  
From  
her eyeballs and her eyeballs tread  
trysts of the earth.  
A grape focuses its dream of a new ending, its beginning, the beginning of the praise order -  
its acerb noises.  
The cactus weaving from my eyeballs.  
A farm focuses its dream of a old ending, its new ending, the beginning of the angel order -  
its parsimonious pamphlets.  
I could play trash barge, thorn tree, and complaint  
from foliages and sunburst orange cars  
with a dull shades of crimson ritual  
with polyps in my finger.  
Devour me and let my substance excite.  
You, who is like a blood cat among the wetting of many cousin.
