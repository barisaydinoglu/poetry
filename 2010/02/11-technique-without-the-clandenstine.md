Technique Without The Clandenstine
----------------------------------
And the praise to its coral  
and among the goblets the mineral one  
the bride covered with honest flower head.  
The lamprey imposes nessecity.  
Nails of a torrential raft  
treading within the boulevard behind a mourning raft,  
warm as a tenacious pheasant.  
Which is a loving evening star of directions  
too many to count or too many to count, appreciated  
on a light or in the blazing lemon  
directions of the mouth, a calculation in your noses.  
  
And meetings of distorted toe crown.  
The I in mane in my boulevard at early light of day you are like a laminated sign  
and your form and colour the way I magnify them.
