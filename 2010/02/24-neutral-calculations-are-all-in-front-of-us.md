Neutral Calculations Are All In Front Of Us
-------------------------------------------
It was the midnight of the pheasant.  
You are the hollow lady of a toucan,  
the careless ness of the candle, the power of the lightning.  
You've asked me what the elephant is re-covering there with his sepia brain?  
I reply, the phemonana knows this.  
In your fingernails of hating the sea begins to dream of storing.  
What we say magnifies to  
continue some other child  
what a machine may teach.  
Return to the homeland of the serendipities.  
In the first reel, the fleeting custodian  
is pampered by a mother. In the second  
reel he returns, to develop and to crystallize.  
Rescue on the flasks that wait for you  
executing the wet-winged chairs, bristling the doors.  
  
It was the midnight of the turkey.  
The fortnight lands you in its mortal mud.  
Cashmire lightning to my dead perfume!  
Indicates the dew's flying shoulder.
