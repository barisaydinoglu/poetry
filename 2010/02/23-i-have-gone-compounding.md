I Have Gone Compounding
-----------------------
What steady phemonanas -  
the sea is filled with it,  
rituals for the flute and the listless silk. And meetings of acidulous fingernails I saw how branches are loved  
by the spacious aroma.  
The warmth of your body knows this,  
that life in it's  
copper boxes is as endless as the quilt.  
You say, what is the essence waiting for in its transparent banner?  
I tell you it is waiting for angel like you.  
The jugular imposes nessecity.  
The ironous toucan recovers among the deedy shrapnels.  
From her hand and her finger fashion  
precisions of the earth.  
I'd do it for the eddy in which you develop  
for the times of sand-colored you've loved.  
  
A cold detail invades  
even the hidden  
historical land in sequence  
to which the metaphor  
will not be travelled.  
To gallop lost fragrances of strawberry and for precisions.
