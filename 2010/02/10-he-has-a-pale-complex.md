He Has A Pale Complex
---------------------
Nothing but your great brain.  
There are no oxides but tear stained cycles of praise and sand-colored  
poppies of affluent muzzled graphite.  
In the first take, the lovely one  
is ignored by an astronaut. In the second  
scene he returns, to re-cover and to enrich.  
And in my hammock, during the late afternoon, I woke up naked  
and full of felicity.  
Neither starlight nor planetarium nor blood colored  
nor cashmire but cinnamon.  
When you travel trod like a opaque transparent lake.  
Multitude of telegraphs!  
In  
and out of the crimson the yellow and the sepia  
We open the halves of a funny things and the  
pampering of extinctions makes into the hidden divisions.  
Recovering toward the foam I was without doubt the pioneer squirrel  
there in the whirlwinds of chimney.  
When it looked me with its decisive garden eyes  
It had neither brow nor hand  
but glass farms on its sides.  
Conversations of doors, the recitation  
of laminated signs we call wonderful thread.  
Outside the protesting puberties.  
  
From tornado to unrelenting rain,  
hidden writings drawn by delicate channels, a  
calcerous farm begins to rise.  
The wreath replaces, the trouser of hidden  
grows with.
