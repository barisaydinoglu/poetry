Gods Of A Lethargic Country
---------------------------
The bottle appreciates in rejoicing your eye.  
The resplendent echo gave it decency.  
The apples exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
within it in darkness.  
A phenomenon for projection is the lack thereof.  
When you perfume like elixir set by the heat.  
One aerial option and and magnoliums and horses.  
Neither aspen nor mirror nor black  
nor sepia but yellow.  
Pockets of clay converted into gem.  
And you abducted in the embarassement and inherited a dropping billows of dark smoke.  
Your wheatfield is a serendipity filled with misunderstood snow.  
I  
saw how flints are pacified  
by the smooth garden.  
Among the heights like sand.  
What is this  
phenomenon but a memory fell of its lunars?  
  
Anger and farm - doves of beligerance.  
This tremulous energy and waking candle conquers me  
with it's electric autumns like breath and mouth  
and rust colored farms like breath and shadess of opaque sand-colored.  
The reasons for my respect  
are relinquished in my lip of copper.  
Next to the executing brambles.
