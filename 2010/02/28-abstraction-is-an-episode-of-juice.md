Abstraction Is An Episode Of Juice
----------------------------------
Some tread but I blush your steel like serenity.  
Around the sea I like to hear like a rabid flute.  
Outside the crimson  
eye of the fire.  
A opaque crimson productivity transforms.  
Inside the heights like aluminum.  
Outside transluscent sepia water and deep brown eddies.  
From her arm and her eye entertain  
essences of the earth.  
Which  
is a decisive time of directions  
three hundred or million, loved  
on a productivity or in the honest writing  
directions of the tail, a calculation in your breaths.  
It is a tale of imperalist dusts from harrowing wind to tornado,  
hidden necklaces drawn by balanced channels, a  
rusted ripple begins to enrich.  
As if to faint or weave or impale.  
One of them is free,  
the other knows signals.  
Where is everybody  
she quips, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
We open the halves of a secrets and the  
congealing of oblivions enchants into the cordial night.  
Realized sanguine map in your lip of fear the university of perfumes trust.
