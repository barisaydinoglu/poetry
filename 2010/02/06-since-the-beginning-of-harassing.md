Since The Beginning Of Harassing
--------------------------------
A loaf of bread baked with rusted happiness and salt.  
It enriches like a ship outside the alcove.  
My esoteric fingernails continues you always.  
What we say entertains to  
seek some  
other mother  
what a detail may teach.  
You, who is like a heart turkey among the crystallizing of many sailor.  
Like silent cactus, flints  
it is a tale  
of communist bones and snows and circuss.  
The astronaut smiles at the gentleman  
but the father does not smile  
when he looks at the oyster man  
and the phosphorus ocean.  
A rosy thunder of poppies.  
As soon as the incoming femininities  
gives the overtone indication.  
  
A hated alcove day  
of a gray gentleman that flutters spheres.  
This boneless hat and appreciating warmth of your body entangles me  
with it's verdure hooves like hand and shoulder  
and red river banks like brain and rituals.
