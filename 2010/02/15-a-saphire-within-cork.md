A Saphire Within Cork
---------------------
A flower head focuses its dream of a beginning, its new ending, the old ending of the guitar order -  
its self-assured granules.  
Everything chaotic with absorbant voices, the salt of the bed  
and piles of natural bread within midnight.  
One of them is smooth,  
the other knows productions.  
Where is nobody  
he says, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Recovered and then dedicated in the city.  
If you were not the cheesecake the sweet-smelling moon  
cooks, sprinkling its lemon across the archipeligos.  
A helicopter is not  
enough to smother me and keep me  
from the field of your noble secrets.  
The hushed book that inherits in your cathedral.  
I stayed refreshed and green  
inside the night.  
Our new umbrella, our poetic mist loops.  
Silvery and clear woman,
