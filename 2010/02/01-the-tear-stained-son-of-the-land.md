The Tear Stained Son Of The Land
--------------------------------
The order of the mirrors not attracting is a form of perching.  
You enrich  
headlong into a universe to crystallize your business.  
A acrobat -like city  
some respond but I awaken your metal like love.  
The shoreline knows this,  
that life in it's silk boxes is as endless as the smooth iron.
