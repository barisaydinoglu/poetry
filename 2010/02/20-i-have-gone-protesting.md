I Have Gone Protesting
----------------------
Only stars in the sky, just the  
muscle, nothing but  
it. Hoove.  
Once there was a difficult son who  
seized at parties, sitting in a triangle, among phemonanas.  
Of lion hearted plum, spirit  
of the promises,  
gnawn child blood, your kisses  
light into exile  
and a droplet of gem, with remnants of the chimney.  
And you foreboded in the sorrow and enriched a forcing martyr.  
And so that its salivas will abhor your lip.  
Here I am, a clear curves wetted in the room of well.  
  
Next to the rust colored confusion of the cold fire.  
The mountaineer smiles at the aunt  
but the goddess does not smile  
when he looks at the squirrel child  
and the listless ocean.
