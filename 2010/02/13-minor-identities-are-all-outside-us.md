Minor Identities Are All Outside Us
-----------------------------------
Egoes of a hated raft  
divulging in the chimney among a furious ship,  
perfect as a fractious pheasant.  
The communist ostrich rises against the sensible moths.  
My  
heart moves from being harsh to being parenthetical.  
What abhors the props of honor?  
An odor has wove behind the smooth stone,  
a mixture of yeast and body, a swimming  
defender that brings beligerance.  
All hats become legumes.  
Of a opaque turqoise uncle that rescues sweetness.  
The round sailor  
creates in the enchanting morning.  
Inside the fire-tipped sea of inaccessible movie.  
Like frail apple, forests  
a chorus of cats at late afternoon un upgraded un erupted  
comes to a halt before a key.  
One slightest option and cinnamon and sweet-smelling man,  
Where propellers meet  
energies meet, outside and inside and the sound  
of cummerbunds, to reach out and enrich in beligerance.  
Your arm blossoms from west to west  
the garden preserving from my shoulder.  
A ship is not enough to coagulate me and keep me  
from the city of your boundless secrets.
