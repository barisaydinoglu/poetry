She Has A Lethargic Complex
---------------------------
Noone here is waiting for the next lunar.  
Rose. You performed yourself for setting.  
A friendship protecting will rejoice  
the shaken clay of a planet.  
My heart moves from being muzzled to being serene.  
Like rustling movie, rituals  
skeleton fathers and custodians.  
For me  
they are minor.  
  
Your eyelids attracts from south to west  
neither mirror nor serenity nor rust colored  
nor blue but cinnamon.
