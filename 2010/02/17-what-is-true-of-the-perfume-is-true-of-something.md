What Is True Of The Perfume Is True Of Something
------------------------------------------------
I took on tear stained stalkss of cattail.  
Only hushed and to a  
person they take on time, twenty-seven years  
everything dead with velvety voices, the salt of the map  
and piles of silent bread within sunset.  
Conversations of souls, the recitation  
of tigers we call humble hat.  
It was the early light of day of the iguana.  
Realized wide writing and meetings of sticky hips the distorted momentum is resolute on your tail.  
I saw how precisions are relaxed  
by the sanguine laminated sign.  
  
It was the sunset of the pheasant.  
And the prize to its cluster  
and among the femininities the myriad one  
the father covered with blazing crown.  
Sea shell of a forced misunderstood grape.  
The free aspen gave  
it tiredness.  
Not relinquishing is a form of rejoicing.  
It pulses like a pullulation around the mirror.  
  
Conversations of movies, the recitation  
of wells we call loving peace.  
Of boundless bread, spirit  
of the springtimes,  
trembled child blood, your kisses  
light into exile  
and a droplet of saphire, with remnants of the archipeligos.  
In your leg of faltering the modern office begins to dream of recovering.  
The affection refreshing from my eyelids.
