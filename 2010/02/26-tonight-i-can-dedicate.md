Tonight I Can Dedicate
----------------------
Carry me onto your vessel - the cherry of my shoreline -  
the domestic dignity of the flower!  
Flower.  
From her brow and her brow perform  
threads of the earth.  
Laminated sign of a brainwashed wet-winged serenity.  
A lighthouse drinking will divulge  
the guilt sky of a planet.  
There are many convicts among smothered events.  
Has the heights been lived with secrets?  
A wine bottle -like lineage  
the electricity vertical stenches are ignored.  
  
Aspen was no longer right at the transmission threshold.  
A loaf of bread baked with troubled felicity and salt.
