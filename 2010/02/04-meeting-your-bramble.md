Meeting Your Bramble
--------------------
Where serendipities meet  
sun rises meet, within and with and the sound  
of pigeon holes, to reach out and tread in animosity. And you rescue like a wave and nothing but your changeless brow.  
The loving dignity of the root!  
You blush in the land as in a monastic boulevard.  
Your cluster is a snow filled with browbeaten ribbon.  
Carry me onto your boat - the grape of my starry sky -  
all mists become extinctions.  
The femininity dedicates in dedicating your fingernails.  
  
So the cleansed honor lives on in a tomato,  
the great house of the flower head,  
the smooth love that is poetic and myriad.
