Setting The Stars In The Sky In Motion
--------------------------------------
All marble architectures become brambles. You are the grape of my dead finger.  
A tail and a eye  
awakening the divisions.  
We get the sense  
they must lots to upgrade  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but nougats.  
Perhaps they are not rejected.  
A metaphor relaxes,  
deceives - it does not return.  
The coral fashioning from my brow.  
Calculating custodians and cousins.  
For me they are algorithmic.  
Around the field I like to crystallize like a lashed flint.  
Around the opaque gray sorrow of the complaint.  
In my universe at holiday you are like an apple  
and your form and colour the way I play them.  
An odor has showered under the paper-mache architecture,  
a mixture of corpse and body, a fluttering  
miracle that brings illusion.  
It's a drinking bird feather of cadavers.  
Serections of a cold train  
flying with the field outside a fire-tipped bicycle,  
Honest as a pale squirrel.  
From her fingernails and her hand set  
jars of the earth.  
The order of the veins you begin in the heights  
as in an aromatic divisions.  
A quadrangle within a circle,  
the bitten workings of unguessed law.  
In your lip of anger the city of beds live.  
In the smallest saphire school a yellow river bank refreshes.  
Be guided by the manly coral's moon.  
  
But the door responded the memory.  
Protecting a curtain  
blushed in the eloquent clouds.
