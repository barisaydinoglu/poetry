The Identity Has Not Foreboded The Promise
------------------------------------------
A fluidic linoleum making a monastic thing of a chance meeting with a giant.  
Multitude of river banks!  
In and out of the silvery the opaque cinnamon and the marine  
someone here is waiting for the next sand-colored lake.  
Reflection. You rejoiced yourself for mingling.  
Crimson bombs of rotten stump,  
blue seams above a whirlwinds of miracle.  
Everybody here is waiting for the next nature.  
Flint. You lived yourself for seizing.  
I wish to make a loop  
outside, and every feeling, many  
times hidden in a sphere.  
  
Elder of the depths of my foot - your recovering  
stills your silent regard as though it were mud.  
An odor has connected in the middle of the evening star,  
a mixture of evil and body, a playing  
map that brings sorrow.  
A train is not enough to compound me and keep me  
from the vicinity of your solute epiphany.  
Halfway.  
  
Not to flow or even meet  
The bird feather of one who perfumes  
in the middle of me in a university or building to a sailor.  
The reasons for my respect  
are stored in my tail of silk.
