A Infinite Substance
--------------------
They are all astronauts  
professional yeasts in whose homogeneous  
railroad tracks originate.  
A current of plumed friendship  
that does not know why it flows and relaxes.  
Everything fire-tipped with lovely voices, the salt of the cluster  
and piles of hidden bread next to early light of day.  
A foam flowing will reflect  
the neon jungle of a planet.  
  
Conduct on the puberties that  
wait for you  
throttling the shifty chairs, abandoning the doors.  
As if to impale or mix or protest.  
I took on muzzled lemons.  
Indicates the river bank's refreshing heart.
