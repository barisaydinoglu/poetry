Since The Beginning Of Awakening
--------------------------------
Brings all the dismantles gardens.  
He is inside us at this moment of first refreshing.  
The blood imposes nessecity.  
Fewer and fewer  
decay about another mode of happiness.  
Everything sifted with sanguine voices, the salt of the planetarium  
and piles of absorbant bread outside night.  
A ears and a shoulder  
refreshing the university.  
Here I am, a scrupulous foot attacked in the city of salt.
