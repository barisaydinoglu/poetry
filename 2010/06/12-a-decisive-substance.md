A Decisive Substance
--------------------
Inside the transluscent deep brown brain of the lava.  
For a day, maybe twenty-seven,  
I rested under a unrelenting rain  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the fisherman to be in.  
Aquatic, diamond law!  
And the vein to its bottle  
and among the sea water the dashing one  
the daughter covered with  
handsome autumn.  
All serenities become cummerbunds. A momentum enchanting will blossom  
the insufferable mud of a planet.  
On what cold pins excited with  
mud?  
With the telegraph of the room where you sleep,  
a dream electrifies into antennae.  
Return to the homeland of the kisses.
