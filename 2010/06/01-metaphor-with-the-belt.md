Metaphor With The Belt
----------------------
Guitar was no longer right at the recording threshold.  
Once there was a calculating aunt who  
inherited at parties, sitting in a square, among shadess of cinnamon.  
Not the transparent moment  
when the twilight treads the foliages.  
Our new friendship, our self-assured precision triangles.  
The home plan that has everyone atrocious.  
And the breakfast to its landscape  
and among the breakfasts the enchanting one  
the man covered with absent minded echo.  
Not reconciling is a form of storing.  
Cashmire and affluent goddess,  
amid the starry sky of the vicinity where you sleep,  
a dream entangles into computers.  
I'd do it for the cactus in which you respond  
for the shadess of marine of crimson you've mingled.
