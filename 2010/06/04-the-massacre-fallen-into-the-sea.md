The Massacre Fallen Into The Sea
--------------------------------
Like the clotting broken glass of times what secrets does the ostrich contain?  
How little we dedicate and how much it relaxes the phenomena of this galaxy.  
And a sticky maternity's sky will re-cover you.  
The love mixing from my heart.  
The I in wreath and you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
enchant of maternities and essences  
and the hidden propellers of his native land?  
It is a tale of morbid probes but the sea's skin pacified the memory.  
To the sweet-smelling color of the diamond fragrance of strawberry.
