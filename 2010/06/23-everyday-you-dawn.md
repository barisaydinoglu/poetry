Everyday You Dawn
-----------------
You say, what is the kiss waiting for in its cashmire sun rise?  
I tell you it is waiting for awe like you. From pillow of fog to pillow of fog,  
hidden wells drawn by lion hearted channels, a  
morbid hoove begins to travel. Draw from it the mechanical  
antenna of its own computer.  
Went transformed in curtain replace me and let my substance perch.
