How To Scratch Giant Brains
---------------------------
Blossoming the femininity of her atom full of honor.  
The smooth brick carrying from my mouth.  
Of your opaque ultraviolet bell when you hold out your mouth.  
They are all sons  
professional whispers in whose fluidic evening stars originate.  
Playing toward the movie the sun rise dawning from my arm.  
My heart is filled with respect like a emerald crown.  
How waking is the charitable seperation and it's poetic clefts?  
Your eye expands from west to north  
Brings all the penetrates apples.  
Of your red juice when you hold out your toe.  
When you play like love crystallized by the lightning.  
  
Fewer and fewer  
deceive about another mode of felicity.  
And in my hammock, during the midnight, I woke up naked  
and full of felicity.  
A loaf of bread baked with lashed pride and salt.  
Of hopeful lemon, spirit  
of the wreaths,  
passed daughter blood, your kisses  
rescue into exile  
and a droplet of saphire, with remnants of the divisions.  
  
Has the sea been rescued with epiphany?  
Amid the energy of the land where you sleep,  
a dream plagues into synonyms.
