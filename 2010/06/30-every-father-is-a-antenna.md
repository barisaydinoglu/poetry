Every Father Is A Antenna
-------------------------
Sunburst orange and brandishing elder,  
the bleak horse is hidden on your ears.  
I wish to make a circle  
inside, and every sight, many  
times hidden in a door.  
Of your ultraviolet river bank when you hold out  
your fingernails.  
What dies the props of happiness?  
My heart moves from being boneless to being plumed.  
  
Where splendors meet  
forms meet, in front of and outside and the sound  
of convicts, to reach out and chirp in agony.  
They devoured it with shady starlights.
