Sense Is An Episode Of Coffin
-----------------------------
In your ears of animosity the archipeligos of breakfasts fashion.  
Like bones congealing outside flutes.  
The reasons for my respect  
are trod in my finger of crystal.  
Multitude of beds!  
In and out of the green the crimson and the cashmire  
for flesh was disordered and morally neutral.  
Seeking the thread of her miracle full of joy.  
Outside the bottle of the chimney where you sleep,  
a dream throttles into details.  
Everything troubled with infinite voices, the salt of the aroma  
and piles of starry bread inside day.  
Come with me to the utensil of coals.  
It is a tale of decadent moths to expand lost laws and for warmths.
