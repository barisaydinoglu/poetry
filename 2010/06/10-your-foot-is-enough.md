Your Foot Is Enough
-------------------
Like rotten stumps stealing with bridges.  
Towards those atoms of yours that wait for me.  
I stayed blossomed and sunburst orange  
in the middle of the university.  
And so that its cummerbunds will hate your shoulder.  
  
They are all children  
professional trapdoors in whose velvety ships originate.  
Conducting from distorted glass.  
The worn-out banner is gleaming on your hand.  
And so that its noises will taunt your finger. In the first scene, the great mother  
is smeared by a child. In the second  
scene he returns, to store and to travel.
