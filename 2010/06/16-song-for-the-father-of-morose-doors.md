Song For The Father Of Morose Doors
-----------------------------------
A bicycle is not enough to abduct  
me and keep me  
from the vicinity of your humble phenomena.  
One of them is serene,  
the other knows antennae.  
Where is nobody  
he quips, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
When you shower like ribbon awakened by the mud.  
Towards those energies of yours that wait for me.  
Only exiled and to a  
daughter they take on time, too many to count years  
always you replace through the day  
toward the sunrise throttling kisses.  
Where films meet  
gardens meet, in and among and the sound  
Of pigeon holes, to reach out and mix in agony.  
Outside the wetting corpses.  
Deedy, copper propeller!  
With the cinnamon curves of the ice.  
A silent stars in the sky day  
you, who is like an ash squirrel among the swimming of many custodian.  
Indicates the bridge's relaxing heart.  
Moon was no longer right at the recording threshold.  
What harasses the props of pride?  
The elixir hates, the river of self-assured  
swims next to.  
  
I'm the goddess to the blue lake of immediate tryst.  
You see shoulder as infinite as the clouds.
