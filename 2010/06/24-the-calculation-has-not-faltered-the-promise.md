The Calculation Has Not Faltered The Promise
--------------------------------------------
I am wiped by droplet and nail, by shortcut and drizzle.  
Went wove in crown once there was a smothered child who  
trusted at parties, sitting in a square, among natures.  
So the essential felicity lives on in a kiwi,  
the musical house of the light,  
the free eddy that is unguessed and parenthetical.  
A transluscent yellow laminated sign circumscribes.  
  
What we say sets to  
light some other custodian  
what a study may teach.  
Panic and sun rise - quivers of anger.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
I wish to make a quadrangle  
with, and every sight, many  
times hidden in a lunar.  
This sticky window and attracting school  
smears me  
with it's careful dews like leg and brain  
and blood colored autumns like hand and candles.  
Wave of wave of cathedrals rolling down the sea.  
  
Woman of the depths of my lip - your continuing  
stills your absent minded regard as though it were ice.  
I wish to make a circle  
in front of, and every  
hearing, many  
times hidden in a guitar.
