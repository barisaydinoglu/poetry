A Drop To Dawn The Awes You Flutter
-----------------------------------
Always you erupt through the early light of day  
toward the sunrise condemning sea's skins.  
The lunchtime curtains you in its mortal jungle.  
Wonder is gone, the subject has perfumed.  
Somebody here is waiting for the next eddy.  
Apple. You refreshed yourself for protecting.  
Only cold and to a  
one they take on time, twenty-seven years  
The trash barge reconciles on its burned-out mare  
imbuing yellow magnoliums over the modern office.  
The winged dignity of the home!  
What curiosities does the oyster contain?  
How little we imbue and how much  
it refreshes the funny things of this galaxy.  
  
Wave of wave of starss in the sky rolling down the sea.  
I do not replace in the thicket of disordered cold fire.  
Plumed, marble sun!  
As soon as the incoming guitars  
gives the grammatic indication.  
In the face of so many cummerbunds to functionality.  
Nothing but  
that mist of laws.  
You are the apple of my shady breath.  
Blue and balanced pioneer,  
in crimson water and transluscent deep  
brown perfumes.
