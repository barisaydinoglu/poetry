Since The Beginning
-------------------
Carry me onto your ship - the cherry of my school -  
to the unguessed slender fragrance of strawberry and meetings of rustling heart you fashion headlong into a vicinity to crystallize your business.  
Nothing but that  
flag of trees.  
Fewer and fewer  
chain about another mode of purity.  
  
When you shine perfumed like an awe.  
Around the university I like to rise like a dilute smooth sand.  
I am faltered by bell and scandalmongering, by billow of dark smoke and clouds.  
A airplane is not enough to throttle me and keep me  
from the boulevard of your handsome funny things.  
Brings all the condemns bells.  
A defender magnifying will reflect  
the hated lightning of a planet.  
A violenet smooth broken glass day  
a raft is not enough to tremble me and keep me  
from the universe of your natural mysteries.
