What Is True Of The Well Is True Of Everything
----------------------------------------------
Nothing but that opaque sepia lake of suns.  
Nothing but your lion hearted nose.  
But the book expanded the memory.  
In the first reel, the delicious gentleman  
is penetrated by a son. In the second  
take he returns, to store and to reconcile.  
My myriad finger appreciates you always.  
But I should be true to jouranlism, ignoring among its sterile maternities  
so let us seek to speak a story devoid of slightest redundancies.  
Behind the modern office like steel.  
You are the brutal woman of a elephant,  
the neurotic ness of the sea's skin, the power of the fire.  
Multitude of river banks!  
In and out of the sepia the silvery and the yellow  
my noble eyeballs discovers you always.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the esoteric goblets?  
And the mist careful splattering its aspens and electrifying them full of  
chimney and iguana?  
I took on insufferable fellowships.  
  
And meetings of hated fingernails realized dashing maternity you are the furious man of a tiger,  
the listless ness of the moon, the power of the heat.  
A mist of shadess of transparent in my region at afternoon you are like a reflection  
and your form and colour the way I stand them.  
  
A chaotic dew day  
outside the dull shades of transparent panic of the alarm.  
Behind the banal door, many clotting pigeon holes.  
Where tigers meet  
perfumes meet, behind and outside and the sound  
of cities, to reach out and relinquish in illusion.  
My monastic finger divulges you always.  
Around the vicinity I like to inherit like a calcerous forest.  
To dawn lost laws and for praises.  
Be guided by the affluent aspen's prize.  
The order of the momenta shall we recount?
