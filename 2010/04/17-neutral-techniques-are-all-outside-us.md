Neutral Techniques Are All Outside Us
-------------------------------------
I could perch darknes, city, and hound  
from shorelines and dews  
with a rust colored thread  
with errors in my tail. The droplet congeals, the awe of promising  
gathers within.  
Only salt, just the  
phemonana, nothing but  
it. Candle.  
The fresh smooth stones froze you mix in the land as in a iridescent region.  
In the smallest gem cathedral you've asked me what the toucan is fashioning there with his cashmire brain?  
I reply, the stalks of cattail knows this.  
The charitable dignity of the crown!  
Rescued and  
then preserved in the university.  
  
Of rosy apple, spirit  
of the flutes,  
abducted gentleman blood, your kisses  
attract into exile  
and a droplet of cedar, with remnants of the sea.  
All branches become holes.  
  
What is this synonym but a memory lunged of its suns?  
A turqoise and  
crooked kis is degraded in the vicinity.  
Multitude of flower heads!  
In and out of the deep brown the opaque transparent and the transparent  
a delirious rose day  
our new landscape, our noble mane triangles.  
There ought to be a diamond architecture of an ancient rose pacifying in a sea.  
There are no rotten stumps but rusted cycles of time and cashmire  
flowers of changeless calculating ash.  
If I could gallop the dust and the land.
