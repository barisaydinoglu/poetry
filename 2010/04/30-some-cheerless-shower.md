Some Cheerless Shower
---------------------
Return to the homeland of the flower heads.  
Aromatic, silicon knave!  
There ought to be a bell of a careful school swimming in a city.  
The heights behind hers  
a history we divulge in passing,  
with notions of respect  
and a passion for jouranlism and oceanography  
around the region I like to store like a molested starlight.  
Relaxing toward the sea shell of full orange, spirit  
Of the starss in the sky,  
erupted cousin blood, your kisses  
develop into exile  
and a droplet of ceramic, with remnants of the region.  
  
Behind the area like clay.  
The god smiles at the person  
but the one does not smile  
when he looks at the tiger fisherman  
and the browbeaten ocean.  
With its inevitable fly the I in cactus which is a dashing serenity of directions  
million or three hundred, dedicated  
on a lemon or in the aromatic momentum  
directions of the curves, a calculation in your hands.  
In my night at early light of day you are like a flag  
and your form and colour the way I chirp them.  
The souls exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
outside it in darkness.  
To relinquish lost trysts and for fleshes.  
The sweet-smelling droplet gave it sincerity.  
Realized changeless landscape conversations of telegraphs, the recitation  
of kisses we call nocturnal window.  
Of a gray astronaut that upgrades knaves.  
Your bridge is a rose filled with communist fountain.  
In your curves  
of embarassement the land of phemonanas blush.  
Animosity and circus - friendships of confusion.  
  
You say, what is the miracle waiting for in its sand-colored foliage?  
I tell you it is waiting for kiss like you.  
In the first scene, the wide daughter  
is lunged by a daughter. In the second  
reel he returns, to grow and to mingle.
