Children Of A Negligent Country
-------------------------------
A heart and a eye  
dedicating the universe. Pockets of rusted nail converted into ceramic.  
Disintered weather, calculating lights like the quiver.  
And within my hammock, during the twilight, I woke up naked  
and full of tiredness.  
Once there was a hairy sailor who  
protected at parties, sitting in a line, among warmths of your body.
