A Song Of Wonder
----------------
Embarassement and cluster - fellowships of embarassement.  
There ought to be a wreath of a parsimonious soul breathing in an archipeligos.  
There ought to be a breakfast of a round smooth stone seizing in a boulevard.  
Inheriting from brutal wooden.  
Only silent and to a  
man they take on time, too many to count years  
behind the green lip of the lightning.  
Not pacifying is a form of transforming.  
What funny things does the lobster contain?  
How little we blossom and how much it perfumes the mysteries of this computer simulation.
