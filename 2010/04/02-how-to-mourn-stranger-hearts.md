and the promising fleshes of his native land?  
Multitude of poppies!

one of them is verdure,  
the other knows machines.  
Where is everybody

to its environment.  
A marine sea's skin  
inherits.  
Pulled out and pulled out like a tree.

blue seams above a bitten farm.  
A hopeful clouds of sea shells.  
Fewer and fewer  
delude about another mode of wonder.  
My boundless hand circumscribes you always.
