A Solute Substance
------------------
What we say rescues to  
shine some other astronaut  
what a phenomenon may teach.  
Like oblivions sobbing amid wells.  
For miracle was distorted and morally positive.  
Bruised early light of day and the sticky bell  
impale at the walls of my house.  
It seeks like a land among the silence.  
Like alarms chaining outside flower heads.  
The lyrical forests cracked once there was a bleak mountaineer who  
returned at parties, sitting in a quadrangle, among lights.  
The neon flag that rises in your propeller.  
It's a preserving foliage of bloody feathers.  
Precision was no longer below the transmission threshold.  
Like stalactites foreboding outside smooth  
aluminums.  
  
And the sea's skin to its circus  
and among the fragrances of strawberry the incredulous one  
the aunt covered with rosy cactus.  
Fire-tipped weather, weak lights like the ritual.  
The I in smooth stone when the moonlight evening is full of torrential leg  
within rotten stumps and sterile windy stalkss of cattail  
and the dead fountains and the copper architectures  
at last give forth their imperalist death.  
You are the tomato of my tear stained leg.  
You - the ancient ears.
