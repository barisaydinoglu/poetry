Meeting Your Utensil
--------------------
And a sifted stone's lightning will form you.  
Only soul, just the  
praise, nothing but  
it. Necklace.  
For a day, maybe too few to count,  
I rested under a tornado  
at a post office, waiting for the woman to be outside.  
The honest cousin  
makes in the fresh morning.  
Chirped and then lighted in the universe.  
A phenomenon promises,  
rejects - it does not return.  
I saw how sea's skins are trusted  
by the celestial angel.  
It's a expanding sweetnes of coals.  
I salute your original sugar  
and envy your celestial pride.  
In your shoulder of overflowing the modern office begins to dream of mixing.  
You, who is  
like a wounded soldier toucan among the forming of many elder.  
Of your dark maternity when you hold out your brow.  
If I could kiss the clock and the city.  
Our new faucet, our decisive path tetrahedrons.  
  
This worn-out quiver and enriching root forebodes me  
with it's pure pencils like mouth and brain  
and ultraviolet ripples like hips and waves.  
Be guided by the gleaming rose's current.
