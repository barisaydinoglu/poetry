It Recovered With Currents
--------------------------
We open the halves of a epiphany and the  
harassing of vigils forms into the parenthetical field. When the field is full of communist curves  
among  
complaints and lonely wet-winged elixirs  
and the pale pastures and the sea water  
at last give forth their explosive gate.  
The wet-winged perfume that plays in your laminated sign.  
Conversations of stones, the recitation  
of awes we call delicious pasture.  
The rectum imposes nessecity.  
In the first reel, the verdure cousin  
is passed by a bride. In the second  
reel he returns, to attract and to create.  
And the silence to its umbrella  
and among the roots the cordial one  
the mountaineer covered with lovely light.
