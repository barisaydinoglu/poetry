Since The Beginning
-------------------
What secrets does the lobster contain?  
How little we gallop and how much it stores the mysteries of this galaxy. Among the field  
like salt. Hollow vigils and insatiable vigils.  
The enduring warmth gave it felicity.  
Return to the homeland of the silken architectures.  
Pure depth protects the sun rises I'm the child to the sun of immediate knave.  
Showering from cold crystal.  
Against the modern office like clay.  
So the serendipidous wonder lives on in an apple,  
the lovely house of the energy,  
the silent love that is indespensable and lovely.
