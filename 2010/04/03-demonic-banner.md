Demonic Banner
--------------
With the conquering conglomerates.  
What undulates the props of decency?  
This imperalist ritual and appreciating soul deludes me  
with it's electric fountains like eye and mouth  
and dark stones like hips and kiss.  
A signal for sequence is the lack thereof.  
Neither prize nor  
ribbon nor opaque blood colored  
nor sepia but opaque sunburst orange.  
Bombs of a clenched vessel  
preserving among the chimney in front of a weak  
airplane,  
free as a bitterest toucan.  
  
What changeless foams -  
the moonlight evening is filled with it,  
hearts for the momentum and the sifted crystal.  
But the maternity pulsed the memory.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
A brutal language abandons  
even the acerb  
historical chimney in study  
to which the metaphor  
will not be returned.
