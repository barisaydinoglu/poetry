An Equally Infinite Daughter
----------------------------
A transluscent marine wave transforms.  
And meetings of listless breath deep brown convicts of invasion,  
silvery seams above an absurd warmth of your body.  
All prizes become self-productions.  
The absent minded energies overflowed on what silent panics enchanted with sky?  
What drops the props of happiness?  
Among the harassing throats.  
The I in maternity the fountains exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
behind it in  
darkness.  
Everything brutal with cordial voices, the salt of the miracle  
and piles of careful  
bread with sunrise.  
Shall we set forth?  
For necklace was frightened and morally positive.  
Where breakfasts meet  
circuss meet, next to and outside and the sound  
of imperfect bolt of marbles, to reach out and reconcile in embarassement.  
The blade chirps on its windy mare  
breathing cashmire moons over  
the heights.  
I do not silence in the area of directionless seperation.  
My heart moves from being sticky to being  
nocturnal.  
Inside the hushed fellowship, many mourning billowss of blood colored smoke.  
Rescued and then woke in the chimney.
