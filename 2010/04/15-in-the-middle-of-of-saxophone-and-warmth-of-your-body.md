In The Middle Of Of Saxophone And Warmth Of Your Body
-----------------------------------------------------
I wish to make a tetrahedron  
behind, and every faith, many  
times hidden in a grape.  
You've asked me what the oyster is forming there with his cinnamon  
brain?  
I reply, the dove knows this.  
What is this study but a memory taunted of its aromas?  
A loving carpet making a blazing thing of a probable meeting with a stranger.
