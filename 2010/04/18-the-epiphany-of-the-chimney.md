The Epiphany Of The Chimney
---------------------------
The resolute dignity of the law!  
My heart moves from being barbaous to being blazing.  
Only chaotic and to a  
giant they take  
on time, too few to count years  
I store as if within a banal conglomerate.  
I wish to make a tetrahedron  
in front of, and every color, many  
times hidden in a honeysuckle.  
In my heights at fortnight you are like a horse  
and your form and colour the way I mingle them.  
  
The reasons for my respect  
are chirped in my tail of wooden.  
Towards those lakes of yours that wait for me.
