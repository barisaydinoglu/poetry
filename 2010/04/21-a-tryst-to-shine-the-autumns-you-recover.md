A Tryst To Shine The Autumns You Recover
----------------------------------------
A kis focuses its dream of a ending, its beginning, the ending of the juice order -  
its enduring dusts.  
Conversations of lunars, the recitation  
of branches we call fresh garden.  
Enjoy the many shaken attempts to pulse  
the essential error.  
There is serendipidous fortune in reconciling it.  
A free fog of maternities.  
  
You - the eloquent fingernails.  
But the stalks of cattail pulsed the memory.
