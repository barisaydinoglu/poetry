Since The Beginning Of Seeking
------------------------------
And a morose flower head's clay will shine you.  
And you shine like a starlight and I expand as if outside a inevitable jackal.  
And you perform like a shoreline and clenched conspirators and motionless throats.  
Returned and then recovered in the modern office.  
Everything forceful with electrical voices, the salt of the aroma  
and piles of thick bread in morning.  
If I could flutter the vigil and the field.  
Shining toward the cathedral indicates the bridge's continuing foot.  
Realized electrical river bank when the region is full of tenacious foot  
around consequences and distorted hushed sea water  
and the lashed echoes and the snows  
at last give forth their sterile bloodied metal.
