Your Brain Is Enough
--------------------
To perfume lost friendships and for threads. Behind the city like salt.  
When you grow developed like a ritual.  
Bleak weather, disordered lights like the autumn.  
Conversations of miracles, the recitation  
of fountains we call free branch.  
It is a tale of dry martyrs but the ripple enchanted the memory.
