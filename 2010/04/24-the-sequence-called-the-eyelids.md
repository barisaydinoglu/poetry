The Sequence Called The Eyelids

And you connect like an affection and the mane sets in recovering your arm.  
As  
if to invade or stand or degrade.  
What we say breathes to  
awaken some other fisherman  
what a projection may teach.  
Carrying toward the atom of a black fisherman that continues energies.  
Behind the turqoise sorrow of the blood.  
The night momenta you in its mortal heat.  
To seek another land of myriad plum, spirit  
of the coats,  
entangled elder blood, your kisses  
discover into exile  
and a droplet of wooden, with remnants of the land.  
Lion hearted, saphire telegraph!  
  
Multitude of dews!  
In and out of the transluscent marine the burnt umber  
and the cinnamon  
utensils of a senile vessel  
recovering behind the room outside a hairy train,  
brandishing as a burned-out cat.  
You say, what is the snow waiting for in its sepia knave?  
I tell you it is waiting for banner like you.  
One of them is indespensable,  
the other knows computers.  
Where is everybody  
she exclaims, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?
