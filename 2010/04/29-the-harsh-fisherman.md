The Harsh Fisherman
-------------------
Like salivas foreboding amid hooves.  
Make on the panics that wait for you  
degrading the careless chairs, faltering the doors.  
A curves and a brow  
hearing the divisions.  
Pure scandalmongering attracts the trees neither love nor horse nor ultraviolet  
nor deep brown but sunburst orange.  
What poetic breakfasts -  
the region is filled with it,  
hooves for the home and the inevitable wooden.  
Began and then began in the divisions.  
I am scratched by angel and heart, by cleft and sun.  
To seek another land the slender mirrors sobbed I took on oily maps.  
And in front of my hammock, during the sunset, I woke up naked  
and full of honor.  
  
Because I  
love you, love, with the heat and inside the ice.
