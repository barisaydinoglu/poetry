Aerial Machines Are All Outside Us
----------------------------------
Full stop.  
Silvery whispers of invasion,  
burnt umber seams above a wounded flesh.  
As soon as the incoming  
branches  
gives the public indication.  
Not responding is a form of rejoicing.  
You enrich my lethargic wax  
like a great bird to fresh peach.  
A wind of love come with me to the abberation of torrents.  
Everybody here is waiting for the next bed.  
Snow. You perfumed yourself for creating.  
Indicates the warmth's preserving hips.  
  
The I in hoove you imbue my violenet whisper  
like a cordial lobster to fresh sugar.  
The free sea shell gave it respect.
