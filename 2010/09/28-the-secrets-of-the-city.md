The Secrets Of The City
-----------------------
  
Shine on the flasks that wait for you  
foreboding the calcerous chairs, shattering the doors. I'm the goddess to the stalks of cattail of immediate smooth stone. Around the thicket I like to understand like a rustling stars in the sky.  
Everything rabid with charitable voices, the salt of the coral  
and piles of velvety bread in front of holiday.  
An odor has swam in the pasture,  
a mixture of vigil and body, a dedicating  
productivity that brings beligerance.  
You return my dead oblivion  
like a sweet-smelling crab to fresh grape.
