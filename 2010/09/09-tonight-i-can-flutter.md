Tonight I Can Flutter
---------------------
Around the chimney I like to relax like a decadent thread.  
She is inside us at this moment of first mingling.  
I took on sifted drops.  
I saw how graces are built  
by the human sphere.  
  
The bleak crab seeks inside the resplendent circumstances.  
Sepia earth to my pale bottle!
