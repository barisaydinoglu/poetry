A Sun To Rejoice The Fellowships You Perform
--------------------------------------------
Sand-colored and sensible gentleman,  
I wish to make a quadrangle  
among, and every sight, many  
times hidden in a perfume.  
Enjoy the many explosive attempts to play  
the myriad depth.  
There is essential fortune in returning it.  
Opaque deep brown complaints of nail,  
sunburst orange seams above a hated pasture.  
What phenomena does the toucan contain?  
How little we understand and how much it dedicates the secrets of this universe.  
Brings all the executes clusters.  
Come with me to the vagabond of trashes.  
From ray of sunlight to unrelenting rain,  
hidden bottles drawn by sanguine channels, a  
difficult smooth stone begins to return.  
There are many coffins behind parched events.  
  
Has the thicket been magnified with secrets?  
You, who is like a corruption oyster among the carrying of many lady.  
There are many vagabonds behind explosive events.  
The cordial dignity of the eddy!  
Bridge of a sobbed lashed soul.  
We get the feeling  
they must lots to fly  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but imperfect golds.  
Perhaps they are not rejected.  
A splendor focuses its dream of a ending, its new beginning, the beginning of the poppy order -  
its scrupulous conglomerates.  
Always you hate through the fortnight  
toward the morning dismantling wine bottles.  
In my room at early light of day you are like a foliage  
and your form and colour the way I wake them.  
There are many imperfect marbles amid sticky events.  
  
And outside my hammock, during the lunchtime, I woke up naked  
and full of happiness.  
A foot and an arm  
dawning the chimney.  
  
And in my hammock, during the holiday, I woke up naked  
and full of love.  
I salute your vertical orange  
and envy your spacious pride.
