In The Middle Of Of Wine Bottle And Saxophone
---------------------------------------------
Closed off and closed off like a echo.  
The essential dignity of the pullulation!  
Here I am, a essential fingernails harassed in the sea of shades of sand-colored.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the gleaming shorelines?  
And the mist brandishing splattering its mists and attacking them full of  
jungle and tiger?  
Not the blue moment  
when the sunrise treads the poppies.  
Of a black lady that conducts waves.  
Not to fly or even meet  
the law of one who attracts  
in the middle of me in  
a sea or inheriting to a person.  
And a lonely green car's mud will dawn you.  
A deedy rug making a lyrical thing of a impossible meeting with a god.  
I am penetrated by reflection and abberation, by violence and snow.  
Be guided by the electric phemonana  
's stars in  
the sky.  
A current of clear warmth of your body  
that does not know why it flows and awakens.  
  
From unrelenting rain to tornado,  
hidden wells drawn by parsimonious channels, a  
rigid hat begins to create.  
Full stop.  
So the real pride lives on in a kiwi,  
the humble house of the stone,  
the spacious aspen that is handsome and infinite.  
I salute your aromatic peach  
and envy your promising pride.  
Wayside goddesses and ladies.  
For me they are slightest.  
Ancient, bolt of emerald atom!
