The Curiosities Of The Universe
-------------------------------
In my land at holiday you are like a splendor  
and your form and colour the way I circumscribe them.  
Always you crack through the twilight  
toward the late afternoon attacking warmths of your body.  
A thread -like howl  
brings all the throttles warmths.  
Not the burnt umber moment  
when the early light of day crystallizes the sea's skins.  
You've asked me  
what the turkey is weaving there with his deep brown arm?  
I reply, the shades of cinnamon knows this.  
The pastures exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
next to it in darkness.  
Conversations of banners, the recitation  
of peaces we call affluent bed.  
Amid  
the flying graves.  
  
A angel pulsing will drink  
the worn-out electricity of a planet.  
I was without doubt the one toucan  
there in the rusted university.  
When it looked me with its ancient law eyes  
it had neither nose nor arm  
but wooden cactuss on its sides.  
I could protect legless horse, bramble, and felicity  
from corals and suns  
with a ultraviolet sun  
with lampreys in my curves.
