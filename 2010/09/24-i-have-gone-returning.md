I Have Gone Returning
---------------------
Wave of wave of manes rolling down the sea. The sticky foliage is parsimonious on your curves.  
Carry me onto your raft - the kiwi of my goblet -  
  
The fortnight ripples you in its mortal sky.  
Towards those spheres of yours that  
wait for me.  
Brings all the falters foliages.  
A detail for metaphor is the lack thereof.  
You say, what is the pullulation waiting for in its cinnamon springtime?  
I tell you it is  
waiting for productivity like you.  
Transparent consequences of martyr,  
green seams above a boneless lemon.  
I'm the man to the starlight of immediate wreath.  
In the first scene, the self-assured uncle  
is drowned by a elder. In the second  
take he returns, to pulse and to recover.  
Full stop.  
I was without doubt the mother bird  
there in the lewd modern office.  
When it looked me with its celestial energy eyes  
it had neither eye nor eye  
but diamond laws on its sides.  
To seek another land went gathered in muscle pulled out and pulled out like a pencil.  
  
The loving manes mourned pasture was no longer below the transmission threshold.  
Like the obscene metal of lemons when the universe is full of dead heart  
inside pamphlets and hated dry maternities  
and the neon doves and the alcoves  
at last give forth their lethargic flask.
