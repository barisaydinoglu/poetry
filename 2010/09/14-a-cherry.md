A Cherry
--------
They soddened it with browbeaten wine bottles.  
Re-cover on the felicities that wait for you  
undulating the disordered chairs, drowning the doors.  
Realized lyrical map you - the incredulous shoulder.  
The serendipity plan that has everyone inaccessible.  
Our new eddy, our boundless acrobat loops.  
As soon as the incoming pencils  
gives the neutral indication.
