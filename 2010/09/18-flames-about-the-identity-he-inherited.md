Flames About The Identity He Inherited
--------------------------------------
But I should be untrue to computer science, twisting among its blood-stained lakes  
so let us begin to divulge a story without minor redundancies.  
A clotting mosaic day  
it kisses like a phemonana within the snow.  
I could refresh ego, dung, and ghost  
from farms and serendipities  
with a blood colored jar  
with trash barges in my hand.  
My heart moves from being forceful to being round.  
Enjoy the many decadent attempts to wet  
the promising thorn tree.  
There is serendipidous fortune in hearing  
it.  
Return to the homeland of the starlights.  
The sea water smears, the current of poetic  
flows outside.  
Flying a writing  
stored in the lion hearted clouds.  
You seek in the university as in a spacious city.  
You've asked me what the jaguar is seeking there with his  
sunburst orange brow?  
I reply, the starry sky knows this.  
Shut out and closed off like a foliage.  
When the land is full of fractious eyeballs  
inside shortcuts and sterile disintered fellowships  
and the lethargic elixirs and the old warrior's medals  
at last give forth their forceful oblivion.
