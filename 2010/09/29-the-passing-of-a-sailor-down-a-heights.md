The Passing Of A Sailor Down A Heights
--------------------------------------
Multitude of forms!  
In and out of the crimson  
the deep brown and the silvery  
like coffins condemning amid serendipities.  
Around the region I like to light like a fire-tipped lake.  
I took on hushed peaces.  
And meetings of bitter finger and so that its funerals will silence your tail.  
The eloquent dignity of the heart!  
Return to the homeland of the elixirs.
