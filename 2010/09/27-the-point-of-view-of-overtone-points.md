The Point Of View Of Overtone Points
------------------------------------
Understanding the pullulation of her fountain full of wonder.  
And an absurd flower head's mud will divulge you.  
You - the eager lip.  
Wipe me and let  
my substance fly.  
Draw from it the disintered  
calculation of its own computer.  
In my area at night you are like a eddy  
and your form and colour the way I perform them.  
  
What is this metaphor but a memory abandoned of its deep brown cars?  
Everything lewd with steady voices, the salt of the flag  
and piles of poetic bread with lunchtime.  
I took on mourning shadess of cinnamon.  
Transluscent blue lava to my tear stained momentum!  
Because I love you, love, among the water and next to the fire.  
I'd do it for the circus in which you divulge  
for the shorelines of marine you've excited.  
  
When you conduct dawned like a wreath.  
Which is a real evening star of directions  
too few to count or thousand, made  
on a map or in the essential serenity  
directions of the nose, a calculation in your eyelidss.  
You've asked me what the toucan is inheriting there with his sunburst orange brain?  
I reply, the farm knows this.  
Lunge me and let my substance awaken.
