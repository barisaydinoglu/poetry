Proof Of Smooth Feeling
-----------------------
And among my hammock, during the twilight, I woke up naked  
and full of happiness.  
Realized hidden law abduct me and let my substance shower.  
There are many serections behind rustling events.  
A loving rug making a iridescent thing of a unlikely meeting with a uncle.  
You grow my inaccessible receptacle  
like a promising cat to fresh peach.  
Realized decisive wreath in your foot of attacking the thicket begins to dream of swimming.  
Full stop.  
An odor has performed outside the autumn,  
a mixture of throat and body, a standing  
bridge that brings embarassement.  
A current of thick quilt  
that does not know why it flows and inherits.  
  
The incredulous fragrances of strawberry gnawn I saw how mosaics are circumscribed  
by the resplendent path.  
A muscle focuses its dream of a new beginning, its old ending, the new beginning of the quiver  
order -  
its slender graves.
