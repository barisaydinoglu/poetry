Calculation With The Bramble
----------------------------
Our new branch, our acerb essence tetrahedrons.  
I saw how femininities are blushed  
by the domestic prize.  
Your candle is a heart filled with decadent sea water.  
A serendipidous fog of laminated signs.  
You are the kiwi of my pale eyeballs.  
Conversations of aspens, the recitation  
of flutes we call absent minded miracle.  
With its torrential connect you are the boney lady of a squirrel,  
the harsh ness of the tryst, the power of the ice.
