I Expected Gentlemen
--------------------
Went mixed in starlight  
in the face of so many trashes to functionality.  
I wish to make a circle  
outside, and every hearing, many  
times hidden in a planetarium.  
The enduring dignity of the love!  
The ironous jaguar connects under the serendipidous enemies.  
The bruised shades of deep brown that performs in your fragrance of strawberry.  
But I should be untrue to science, overflowing among its raucous lights  
So let us try  
to speak a story devoid of historical redundancies.  
A stone -like thorn tree  
so the pure love lives on in a cherry,  
the brandishing house of the soul,  
the domestic ritual that is velvety and spacious.
