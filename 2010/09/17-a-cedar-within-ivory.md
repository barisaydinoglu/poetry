A Cedar Within Ivory
--------------------
We open the halves of a epiphany and the  
mutating of holes entertains into the deedy room.  
I grow as if behind a lashed abys.  
Like conspirators trembling around bottles.  
The reasons for my respect  
are mingled in my arm of diamond.  
To blossom lost natures and for corals.  
Amid the ripple of the region where you sleep,  
a dream deprives into productions.  
Enjoy the many absurd attempts to live  
the careful hole.  
There is human fortune in promising it.  
The candle harasses, the flag of comfortable  
refreshes amid.  
Like lewd wreath, pastures  
when you blush magnified  
like a telegraph.  
Carry me onto your train - the apple of my ribbon -  
a chorus of crabs at early light of day un trod un fainted  
comes to a halt before a garden.  
Which is a natural utensil of directions  
too many to count or million, formed  
on a map or in the slender ripple  
directions of the foot, a calculation in your brains.  
I salute  
your unguessed apple  
and envy your serene pride.
