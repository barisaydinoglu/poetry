From What Are Keys Carried
--------------------------
What mysteries does the pheasant contain?  
How little we flow and how much it forms the phenomena of this computer simulation.  
You say, what is the river bank waiting for in its marine crown?  
I tell you it is waiting for rose like you.  
A square in front of a loop,  
the pale workings of original law.  
If I could circumscribe the flask and the area.  
They are all mothers  
professional lineages in whose incredulous lighthouses originate.  
One algorithmic option and she is in us at this moment of first gathering.  
Browbeaten ones and ones.  
For me they are individual.
