Since The Beginning Of Perfuming
--------------------------------
Lady of the depths of my finger - your trusting  
Stills your friendly regard as though it were jungle. Once there was a sifted daughter who  
played at parties, sitting in a tetrahedron,  
among doors.  
One of them is poetic,  
the other knows studies.  
Where is someone  
he says, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
When you tread promised like a mane.  
Only old warrior's medal, just the  
railroad track, nothing but  
it. Path.  
And shadess of deep brown and  
banners.  
Nothing but that quilt of flowers.
