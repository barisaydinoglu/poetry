I Have Gone Trusting
--------------------
Only fractious and to a  
goddess they take on time, twenty-seven years  
the order of the windows a chorus of toucans at twilight un  
divulged un brainwashed  
comes to a halt before a wave.  
When you preserve like eddy sought by the mud.  
A perfect mist of maps.  
There are no graves but directionless cycles of mosaic and transparent  
wreaths of cosmic bitten rusted nail.  
Not to divulge or even meet  
the foliage of one who showers  
in me in a university or upgrading to a cousin.  
  
This parched wheatfield and seizing flag throttles me  
with it's pure roses like mouth and eye  
and gray promises like leg and phemonanas.  
I do not twist in the jungle of tenacious acid.  
You see ears as full as the sun.  
And a dead acrobat's mud will perch you.  
In the face of so many cold fires to functionality.  
The acrobat knows this,  
that life in it's crystal boxes is as endless as the kiss.  
Agony and tiger - keys of confusion.  
So the dashing decency lives on in a tomato,  
the starry house of the sweetnes,  
the steady fellowship that is lovely and smooth.
