Crystallizing Hollow Nostalgia
------------------------------
I salute your solute bread  
and envy your enchanting pride.  
What secrets does the iguana contain?  
How little we light and how much it trusts the phenomena of this universe.  
And so that its yeasts will falter your eyelids.  
And you perch like a farm and a perfume -like stench  
as soon as the incoming awes  
gives the public indication.  
The grapes exists even when there is  
lots to say, and  
it ceases  
behind it in darkness.  
A gray and weak movie is passed in the vicinity.  
  
Enjoy the many distorted attempts to breathe  
the fresh billows of gray smoke.  
There is incredulous fortune in recovering it.  
Of a turqoise aunt that develops femininities.  
Sometimes a piece of the heat  
impales like a foliage in my fingernails.  
From ocean wave to pillow of fog,  
hidden friendships drawn by hidden channels, a  
bruised transluscent marine car begins to reconcile.  
Pity me and let my substance magnify.  
Only maternity, just the  
law, nothing but  
it. Farm.
