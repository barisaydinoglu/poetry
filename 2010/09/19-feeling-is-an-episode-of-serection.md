Feeling Is An Episode Of Serection
----------------------------------
It blossoms like a cactus inside the laminated sign.  
Nothing but  
your myriad finger.  
Multitude of angels!  
In and out of the yellow the transluscent transparent and the sepia  
I could store pigeon hole, violence, and rooster  
from affections and bells  
with a turqoise key  
with clandenstines in my nose.  
Brings all the dismantles flutes.  
I took  
on shifty roots.  
A decisive rain of bridges.  
With the transparent leg of the wind.  
Conversations of quilts, the recitation  
of praises we call lion hearted shades of green.  
Building the echo of her pencil full of sincerity.
