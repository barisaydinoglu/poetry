The Listless Elder
------------------
Fashioning the honeysuckle of her mist full of tiredness.  
Conversations of hearts, the recitation  
of hearts we call blazing hoove.  
Fewer and fewer  
bristle about another mode of tiredness.  
On what rusted vaginas travelled with clay?  
The torrential wreath that fashions in your sea shell.  
Realized secure tree our new mirror, our humble praise circles.  
  
Full stop.  
We get the faith  
they must lots to perch  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but invasions.  
Perhaps they are not hated.  
They punctured it with chaotic spheres.  
Return to the homeland of the awes.  
And meetings of acidulous fingernails I wish to make a loop  
next to, and every sight, many  
times hidden in a map.  
Outside silvery water and yellow smooth ashes.  
Not carrying is a form of fluttering.
