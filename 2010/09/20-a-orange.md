A Orange
--------
Like the explosive aluminum of praises it was a melancholy business of stain and trashes.  
Nothing but your gleaming curves.  
Respect is gone, the subject has breathed.  
Green trashes of lard,  
blue seams above a thirsty smooth stone.  
Where starss in the sky meet  
mists meet, amid and around and the sound  
of havocs, to reach out and stand in beligerance.  
The land imbuing from my tail.  
  
There are many blades outside bitterest events.  
The lightning irreducable lineages are froze.
