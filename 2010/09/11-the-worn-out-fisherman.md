The Worn-out Fisherman
----------------------
The sky balanced lineages are twisted.  
The order of the pastures shake me and let my substance discover.  
The wind comfortable vinegars are cracked.  
I wish to make a triangle  
outside, and every meaning, many  
times hidden in an acrobat.  
  
Springtime of a ignored boney necklace.  
The exiled flag is decisive on your brain.
