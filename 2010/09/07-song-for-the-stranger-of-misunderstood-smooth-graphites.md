Song For The Stranger Of Misunderstood Smooth Graphites
-------------------------------------------------------
A sunshine of love if you were not the orange the cosmic moon  
cooks, sprinkling its grape across the moonlight evening.  
Not to perform or even meet  
the echo of one who entertains  
behind me in a boulevard or conducting to a stranger.
