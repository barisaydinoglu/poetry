Tell Them That I Am Giving Up Inheriting In Images
--------------------------------------------------
A blood colored and parched love is ignored in the area.  
Has the heights been appreciated with funny things?  
And meetings of absurd arm a cactus -like funeral  
a book focuses its dream of a beginning, its new beginning, the new ending of the cactus order -  
its free vaginas.  
In your mouth of fear the area of knaves set.  
Marine jugulars of trapdoor,  
opaque sepia seams above a tenacious stars  
in the sky.  
In the smallest emerald essence conversations of veins, the recitation  
of fountains we call lovely mist.  
And a bitter foliage's wind will drink you.  
Not to fly or even meet  
the necklace of one who refreshes  
behind me in a room or protecting to a mother.  
How galloping is the aquatic extinction and it's aromatic nougats?  
As if to congeal or chirp or electrify.  
Conversations of kisses, the recitation  
of autumns we call vertical perfume.
