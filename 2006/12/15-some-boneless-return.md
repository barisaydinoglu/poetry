Some Boneless Return
--------------------
Return to the homeland of the flutes.  
But I should be true to jouranlism, loathing among its insufferable flints  
so let us attempt to tell a story without technical redundancies.  
A current of balanced soul  
that does not know why it flows and travels.  
To the aquatic original mirror because I love you, love, outside the lava and among the jungle.
