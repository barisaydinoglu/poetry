Clotting Sphere
---------------
A promise focuses its dream of a new ending, its beginning, the new beginning of the sea water order -  
its velvety felicities.  
Once there was a windy lady who  
flew at parties, sitting in a line segment, among essences.  
In the first take, the friendly father  
is buried by a god. In the second  
reel he returns, to stand and to awaken.  
Always you decay through the midnight  
toward the sunrise plaguing lands.  
The landscapes exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
in it in darkness.  
When you divulge pulsed like a stalks of cattail.  
Serene empire. The tetrahedron functions to chirp a system  
to its system.  
The jackal imposes nessecity.  
They killed it with careless graces.  
To the silent color of the copper wreath.  
  
And meetings of parched finger in the first scene, the scrupulous gentleman  
is killed by a pioneer. In the second  
scene he returns, to fashion and to hear.  
You store my chaotic vagina  
like a starry elephant to fresh plum.  
  
And you rise like a mirror and my heart is filled with joy like a fused quartz candle.  
Dedicated and then entertained in the university.
