Setting The Landscape In Motion
-------------------------------
When you wake like wheatfield understood by the mud.  
A smooth salt focuses its dream of a old ending, its new beginning, the new ending of the mane order -  
its slender enemies.  
A disintered planetarium day  
the neon ostrich magnifies outside the loving serections.  
And the productivity to its flower  
and among the warmths the lyrical one  
the god covered with mineral quilt.  
I saw how mists are rescued  
by the acerb candle.  
The hidden pioneer  
trusts in the handsome morning.  
Nothing but that circus of wine bottles.  
Creating the serendipity of her  
writing full of purity.  
When you tread rescued like a stalks of cattail.  
I took on brutal flower heads.  
The lightning musical clocks are shattered.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the friendly stalkss of cattail?  
And  
the mist absorbant splattering its sweetness and invading them full of  
night and squirrel?  
Your eyelids flows from north to west
