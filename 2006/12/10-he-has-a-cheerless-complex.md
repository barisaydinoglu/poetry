He Has A Cheerless Complex
--------------------------
So the moonlit pride lives on in a grape,  
the comfortable house of the salt,  
the stationary stars in the sky that is myriad and essential. In the middle of the jungle like clay. With its mourning pulse what is this sequence but a memory deformed of its necklaces?  
Honor is gone, the subject has gathered.  
Like weak current, clusters  
only juice, just the  
crown, nothing but  
it. Dove.  
Blushing from listless  
ivory.  
Only absurd and to a  
daughter they take on time, twenty-seven years  
the electric person  
flies in the cordial morning.  
Acidulous dominions and morbid oxides.
