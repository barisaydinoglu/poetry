How To Invade Pioneer Curvess
-----------------------------
To rustle lost aspens and for trousers.  
The acid  
travels on its arrogant mare  
hearing burnt umber sea shells over the chimney.  
The enemy imposes nessecity.  
Land of a protested wounded acrobat.  
Anger and magnolium - affections of embarassement.  
The boneless squirrel gathers in the ancient ghosts.  
Within silvery water and burnt umber salts.  
For a day, maybe thousand,  
I rested under a tornado  
at a bus stop, waiting for the pioneer to be amid.  
I'm the child to the writing of immediate candle.  
  
Because I love you, love, next to the wind and in the jungle.
