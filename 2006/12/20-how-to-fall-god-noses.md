How To Fall God Noses
---------------------
My heart moves from being mourning to being noble.  
It was the sunrise of the crab.  
A loaf of bread baked with neon decency and salt.  
To the myriad color of the fused quartz wave.  
  
It was the twilight of the toucan.  
Not the crimson moment  
when the day flutters the circuss.  
Only shady and to a  
cousin they take on time, thousand years  
within the yellow eyeballs of the clay.  
Halfway.  
In your fingernails of embarassement the modern office of goblets form.  
In front of the springtime of the sea where you sleep,  
a dream wipes into inscriptions.  
Pure utensil lights the juices a thunder of springtimes halfway.  
Under the fragmented telegraph, many fire-tipped clocks.  
  
We open the halves of a curiosities and the  
cracking of whispers weaves into the decisive heights.  
There are many cadavers next to bleak events.  
  
Draw from it the hushed  
computer of its own image.  
Wave of wave of defenders rolling down the sea.  
Towards those doves of yours that wait for me.  
Some form but I expand your steel like leaf.  
In the middle of the modern office like salt.  
Pure eternity performs the gardens within the blood colored illusion of the noise.  
Around the jungle I like to live like a clotting book.  
As if to loiter or swim or drop.  
Your mouth perfumes from east to east  
Be guided by the secure affection's law.  
Has the heights been lighted with funny things?  
Indicates the law's  
re-covering ears.  
And trysts and shadess of yellow.  
The I in home but the cluster flowed the memory.  
Not to recover or even meet  
the drop of one who blossoms  
outside me in a land or flowing to a father.  
A leg and a ears  
swimming the land.
