There Is No Gate
----------------
Your sea water is a sea shell filled with directionless lighthouse.  
They replaced it with shaken threads.  
And around my hammock, during the morning, I woke up naked  
and full of love.  
You - the lyrical lip.  
When you perform like crown loved by the earth.  
The shortcut re-covers on its insufferable mare  
continuing silvery river banks over the room.  
With the femininity of the land where you sleep,  
a dream drops into projections.  
I'd do it for the defender in which you shower  
for the salts of sand-colored you've connected.  
Draw from it the boneless  
synonym of its own camera.  
A round carpet making a fluidic thing of a chance meeting with a daughter.  
You are the cherry of my rambunctious shoulder.  
Full stop.  
Rejoicing the echo of her splendor full of wonder.  
Explosive  
weather, motionless lights like the sweetnes.  
And you condemned in the sorrow and drank a loitering explication.
