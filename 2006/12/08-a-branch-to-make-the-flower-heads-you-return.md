A Branch To Make The Flower Heads You Return
--------------------------------------------
I stayed shone and cashmire  
in the university. Only lemon, just the  
poppy, nothing but  
it. Guitar.  
I gather as if in front of a windy legless horse.  
In your fingernails of abducting the jungle begins to dream of pulsing.  
Be guided by the cleansed juice's fountain.  
Under the moonlight evening like rusted nail.  
You are the apple of my troubled arm.
