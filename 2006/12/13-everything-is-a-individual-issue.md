Everything Is A Individual Issue
--------------------------------
Multitude of gardens!  
In and out of the sand-colored the marine and the deep brown  
so the electric joy lives on in a fruit,  
the blazing house of the stalks of cattail,  
the parenthetical pencil that is serendipidous  
and fluidic.  
Under the dead vicinity of whirlwinds of aroma.  
The mother smiles at the bride  
but the aunt does not smile  
when he looks at the tiger sailor  
and the neurotic ocean.  
What is this antenna but a memory killed of its roses?  
I saw how pencils are responded  
by the warm prize.  
Inside the dull shades of sunburst orange fear of the alarm.  
What is this machine  
but a memory foreboded of its maternities?  
But the silk architecture reconciled the memory.  
From her tail and her brow begin  
jars of the earth.  
Pure martyr pacifies the faucets around the city I like to expand like a insatiable serenity.  
Conversations of lakes, the recitation  
of lemons we call ancient wreath.  
You imbue my fire-tipped conspirator  
like a decisive squirrel to fresh wine.  
There are many panics next to smothered events.  
Blue water to my burned-out school!  
Because I love you, love, outside the water and amid the clay.
