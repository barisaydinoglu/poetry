Jackals About The Detail She Inherited
--------------------------------------
Draw from it the torrential  
detail of its own inscription.  
Nothing but that sun rise of keys.  
There are no trash barges but dry cycles of telegraph and sunburst orange  
stars of poetic smothered sand.  
The order of the productivities how attracting is the great shards of gold and it's balanced whispers?  
Always you twist through the holiday  
toward the night depriving  
rivers.  
Whirlwinds of elders and uncles.  
For me they are slightest.  
Return to the homeland of the green lakes.  
I reflect as if with a hushed shadow.  
You - the honest leg.  
When you create carried like a flute.  
Not relaxing is a form of galloping.  
In my field at morning you are like a snow  
and your form and colour the way I drink them.  
In your fingernails of illusion the archipeligos of apples stand.  
What curiosities does the cat contain?  
How little we develop and how much it lives the curiosities of this universe.  
Dedicate on the self-productions that wait for you  
petrifying the dilute chairs, crushing the doors.
