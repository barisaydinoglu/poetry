Breeding Nocturnal Affection
----------------------------
It was a dead business of shards of gem and clocks.  
Closed off and shut up like a fountain.  
Like the frail aluminum of smooth ashes for a day, maybe too few to count,  
I rested under a unrelenting rain  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the elder to be among. I stayed refreshed and crimson  
against the land.  
I took on rustling guitars.  
Come with me to the cubicle of serections.  
In the first reel, the aquatic woman  
is conquered by a mother. In the second  
scene he returns, to wet and to pulse.  
What epiphany does the iguana contain?  
How little we reconcile and how much it dedicates the curiosities of this universe.  
Panic and reflection - flower heads of sorrow.  
For sea water was shifty and morally neutral.
