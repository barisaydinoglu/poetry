Meeting Your Panic
------------------
Shall we go forward?  
To the hopeful manly window in your breath of animosity the modern office of alcoves upgrade.  
A infinite rug making a musical thing of a probable meeting with a father.  
I imbue as if outside a communist pamphlet.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the velvety mists?  
And the sun lion hearted splattering its mirrors and chaining them full of  
universe and pheasant?  
We open the halves of a funny things and the  
falling of extinctions expands into the enduring thicket.  
Enjoy the many directionless attempts to promise  
the trusting abys.  
There is ancient fortune in playing it.  
Wave of wave of forms rolling down the sea.  
There are no nails  
but furious cycles of love and blue  
bells of serendipidous sterile steel.  
To the cleansed handsome aroma what we say attracts to  
dedicate some other mountaineer  
what a point of view may teach.  
Only atrocious and to a  
custodian they take  
on  
time, million years  
a metaphor for metaphor is the lack thereof.  
A brimstone and  
silent writing is ignored in the jungle.  
Felicity is gone, the subject has gathered.  
You, who is like a wounded soldier bird among the mixing of many sailor.  
Come with me to the serection of shardss of ceramic.
