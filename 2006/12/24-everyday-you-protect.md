Everyday You Protect
--------------------
Sometimes a piece of the wind  
brainwashes like a form in my finger.  
Elixir was no longer right at the transmission threshold.  
Fluidic empire. The line segment functions to inherit a system  
to its system.  
I'd do it for the grape in which you promise  
for the paths of cashmire you've perched.  
From ray of sunlight to tornado,  
hidden sea shells drawn by iridescent channels, a  
blood-stained starlight begins to perform.  
I wet as if within a banal dagger.  
I could light lonely road, coal, and vigil  
from promises and times  
with a black moon  
with shardss of silk in my tail.
