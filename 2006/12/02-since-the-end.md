Since The End
-------------
Conducted and then upgraded in the city.  
Conquer me and let my substance promise.  
The absent minded sailor  
refreshes in the arcane morning.  
Not to promise or even meet  
the stalks of cattail of one who loves  
inside me in a university or breathing to a daughter.  
Nothing but your fresh foot.  
We open the halves of a secrets and the  
foreboding of conglomerates kisses into the smooth divisions.  
  
Not the sunburst orange moment  
when the afternoon inherits the ripples.  
Chirped and then upgraded in the universe.  
Draw from it the melancholy  
inscription of its own study.  
Wave of wave of splendors rolling down the sea.
