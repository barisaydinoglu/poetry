An Equally Free Child
---------------------
Inevitable morning and the tremulous evening star  
change at the walls of my house.  
To the electric friendly forest you say, what is the poppy waiting for in its burnt umber wheatfield?  
I tell you it is waiting for door like you.  
One algorithmic option and the order of the grapes carry me onto your train - the fruit of my peace -  
the reasons for my respect  
are crystallized in my leg of cork.  
Neither map nor peace nor opaque black  
nor silvery but sunburst orange.  
A current of electric essence  
that does not know why it flows and perches.  
In my modern office at early light of day you are like a echo  
And your form and colour the way I connect them.  
The friendly dignity of the map!
