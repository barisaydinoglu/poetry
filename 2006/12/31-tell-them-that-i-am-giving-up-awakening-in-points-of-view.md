Tell Them That I Am Giving Up Awakening In Points Of View
---------------------------------------------------------
Only tremulous and to a  
mountaineer they take on time, three hundred years  
you - the careful eyeballs.  
I do not bristle in the room of explosive self-production.  
If I could refresh the alarm and the room.  
Realized plumed hat it is a tale of harsh graves from ray of sunlight to unrelenting rain,  
hidden  
apples drawn by full channels, a  
browbeaten window begins to seek.  
The fuming turkey perches inside the careful waxes.  
A signal re-covers,  
overflows - it does not return.  
Pockets of broken glass converted into glass.  
Fatherless pioneers and fathers.  
For me they are overtone.  
Ribbon was no longer right at the recording threshold.
