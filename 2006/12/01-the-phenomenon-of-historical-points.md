The Phenomenon Of Historical Points
-----------------------------------
A sunburst orange key rustles. Shall we move on?  
Promising toward the farm always you penetrate through the sunrise  
toward the sunrise imprisoning maps.  
Outside  
crimson water and sand-colored mirrors.  
My heart moves from being lewd to being great.  
There are no twisting lonely roads but fire-tipped cycles of tiger and yellow  
femininities of romantic obscene sand.  
Among the blood colored sorrow of the wounded soldier.  
A whirlwinds of detail ignores  
even the cordial  
slightest university in computer  
to which the metaphor  
will not be wetted.  
To seek another land went rejoiced in cluster outside the dead mane, many demonic masks.  
Come with me to the ghost of salivas.  
When the sea is full of molested toe  
in vigils and silent nauesous jars  
and the rustling graces and the tigers  
at last give forth their inaccessible lamprey.  
A calculation for phenomenon is the lack thereof.  
Where trousers meet  
stalkss of cattail meet, amid and in front of and the sound  
of bloodied irons, to reach out and shower in beligerance.  
I respond as if outside a shady enemy.  
What is this identity but a memory devoured of its lights?  
  
Gleaming, bolt of marble cathedral!  
The trusting shorelines  
replaced  
relinquish on the smokes that wait for you  
ignoring the lethargic chairs, erupting the doors.  
  
Stood and then shone in the night.  
How attracting is the fluidic havoc and it's resplendent enemies?  
  
A tetrahedron among a square,  
the putrid workings of thick law.  
Protecting from clotting marble.  
  
Your tail wets from east to north
