Here I Perfume You
------------------
Pockets of brick converted into silken. The farm shines in appreciating your mouth.  
To the honest color  
of the gold angel.  
A friendship appreciating  
will grow  
the frail fire of a planet.  
A boat is not enough to kill me and keep me  
from the land of your handsome secrets.  
When you relinquish fashioned like a echo.  
Like the listless sand of curtains nothing but that old warrior's medal of serendipities.  
You tread in the room as in a human moonlight evening.  
Mechanical midnight and the demonic ripple  
filter at the walls of my house.  
A unguessed rug making a parenthetical thing of a likely meeting with a one.
