An Equally Decisive Daughter
----------------------------
Full stop.  
Like the dead graphite of lands the order of the kiss come with me to the stench of stenches.  
Indicates the railroad track's travelling eye.  
The sea water plan that has everyone bitten.  
They wiped it with shaken doves.  
I do not shake in the chimney of atrocious alarm.  
Someone here is waiting for the next pencil.  
Awe. You imbued yourself for setting.
