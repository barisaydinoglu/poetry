What Is True Of The Bird Feather Is True Of Something
-----------------------------------------------------
To seize lost laminated signs and for river banks. The dust kisses on its insatiable mare  
trusting burnt umber lunars over the heights.  
Respect is gone, the subject has enriched.  
If I could imbue the ghost and the region.  
A circle in a tetrahedron,  
the skeleton workings of cleansed law.  
If I could connect the bloodied iron and the boulevard.  
A fluidic linoleum making a smooth thing of a likely meeting  
with a daughter.  
Everybody here is waiting for the next cathedral.  
Angel. You gathered yourself for inheriting.  
A thunder of kisses my heart is filled with tiredness like a crystal angel.  
The acerb momentum gave it love.
