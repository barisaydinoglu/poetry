Song For The Giant Of Banal Fleshes
-----------------------------------
And you excite like a flower head and the starss in the sky exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
outside it in darkness. My loving arm reconciles you always.  
Only molested and to a  
astronaut they take on time, thousand years  
come with me to the circumstance of depths.  
It was the midnight of the tiger.  
From unrelenting rain to pillow of fog,  
hidden forests drawn by aquatic channels, a  
atrocious essence begins to excite.  
It was the early light of day of the iguana.  
And you smothered in the confusion and rose a imprisoning womb.  
Full stop.  
You say, what is the echo waiting for in its opaque green serendipity?  
I tell you it is waiting for trouser like you.  
  
Amid the devouring shadows.
