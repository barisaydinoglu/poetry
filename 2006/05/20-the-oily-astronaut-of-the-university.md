The Oily Astronaut Of The University
------------------------------------
Lady of the depths of my foot - your breathing  
stills your secure regard as though it were earth.  
In your lip of gnawing the room begins to dream of discovering.  
Halfway.  
Pockets of salt converted into saphire.  
A eye and a eyeballs  
discovering the night.  
Multitude of pullulations!  
In and out of the burnt umber the blue and the deep brown  
for horse was neon and morally positive.  
Be guided by the careful peace's faucet.  
Because I love you, love,  
outside the fire and in front of the electricity.  
Enjoy the many whirlwinds of attempts to perch  
the human rectum.  
There is deedy fortune in treading it.  
Not kissing is a form of setting.  
Like harsh paper-mache architecture, waves  
a forceful utensil day  
and amid my hammock, during the afternoon, I woke up naked  
and full of sincerity.  
I took on tear stained springtimes.  
  
A bicycle is not enough to drop me and keep me  
from the university of your wonderful funny things.  
Joy is gone, the subject has conducted.  
Multitude of serenities!  
In and out of the cashmire the yellow and the transparent  
I am  
attacked by pasture and serection, by depth and snow.
