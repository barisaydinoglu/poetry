The Dismantling Of A Goddess Down A Heights
-------------------------------------------
Inside the productivity of the moonlight evening where you sleep,  
a dream buries into details.  
Your mouth divulges from west to west  
And so that its nights will bury your nose.  
Within the old warrior's medal of the city where you sleep,  
a dream drowns into calculations.  
  
If you were not the peach the fresh moon  
cooks, sprinkling its orange across the area.  
The balanced goblets wetted soft, copper serendipity!
