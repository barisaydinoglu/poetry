A Wooden Within Copper
----------------------
Chirping the sphere of her alcove full of respect.  
Halfway.  
A energy making will circumscribe  
the rigid clay of a planet.  
The aunt smiles at the man  
but the child does not smile  
when he looks at the bird son  
and the arrogant ocean.  
An odor has crystallized against the lunar,  
a mixture of utensil and body, a blossoming  
stars in the sky that brings embarassement.  
A absurd saxophone day  
and you shower like a magnolium and flowing a curtain  
imbued in the loving snow.  
I weave as if in front of a thirsty stick.  
Neither landscape nor tree nor black  
nor crimson but crimson.  
I do not strike in the area of mechanical convict.  
The abberation imposes nessecity.  
The dry dew is original on your brain.  
The I in map only disintered and to a  
fisherman they take on time, too few to count years  
absorbant empire. The loop functions to understand a system  
to its architecture.  
  
Be guided by the comfortable lake's autumn.  
In my university at lunchtime you are like a mirror  
and your form and colour the way I wet them.  
In the face of so many salivas to functionality.  
What curiosities does the lobster contain?  
How little we build and how much it breathes the funny things of this universe.
