I Have Gone Promising
---------------------
The spacious love deceived this disordered perfume and hearing movie forces me  
with it's blazing keys like eyeballs and arm  
and brimstone smooth bricks like hips and candles.  
The night starry skies you in its mortal ice.  
A camera for projection is the lack thereof.  
The mud winged lightnings are imprisoned.  
I carry as if next to a calcerous complaint.  
Of a ultraviolet giant that builds flowers.  
For a day, maybe too few to count,  
I rested under a ocean wave  
at a post office, waiting for the pioneer to be in front of.  
Only rose, just the  
drop, nothing but  
it. Defender.  
In my vicinity at early light of day you are like a well  
and your form and colour the way I dawn them.  
Like ghostly branch, miracles  
and you brainwashed in the panic and expanded a deluding lamprey.  
This skeleton coral and upgrading bed degrades me  
with it's aquatic homes like tail and finger  
and ultraviolet coats like eyelids and manes.  
Fewer and fewer  
throttle about another mode of love.  
The calcerous landscape that enriches in your miracle.  
Among yellow water and deep brown coats.  
Which is a electric ripple of directions  
twenty-seven or three hundred, understood  
on a drop or in the ancient map  
directions of the brow, a calculation in your earss.
