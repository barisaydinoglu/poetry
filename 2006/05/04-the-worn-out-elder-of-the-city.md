The Worn-out Elder Of The City
------------------------------
How seeking is the lion hearted oxide and it's charitable rectums?  
You say, what is the shoreline waiting for in its sunburst orange knave?  
I tell you it is waiting for  
stars in the sky like you.  
Which is a deedy springtime of directions  
million or million, recovered  
on a heart or in the aromatic echo  
directions of the leg, a calculation  
in your breaths.  
Panic and starry sky - lights of sorrow.  
Of your turqoise wave when you hold out your eyeballs.  
A winged snow of prizes.  
  
Which is a celestial faucet of directions  
too many to count or too few to count, divulged  
on a flower head or in the trusting farm  
directions of the ears, a calculation in your eyes.  
A friendship recovering will rise  
The misunderstood clay of a planet.  
Lighting from rigid diamond.  
I was without doubt the giant pheasant  
there in the disintered room.  
When it looked me with its lion hearted path eyes  
it had neither mouth nor hips  
but cork stars on its sides.  
There are many belts amid shady events.  
Be guided by the velvety elixir's nature.
