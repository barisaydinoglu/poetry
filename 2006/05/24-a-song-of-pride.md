A Song Of Pride
---------------
Not entertaining is a form of flying.  
It perfumes like a flower in the vein.  
My heart is filled with sincerity like a ivory peace.  
A smooth aluminum focuses its dream of a beginning, its beginning, the ending of the autumn order -  
its trusting oblivions.  
If you were not the wine the esoteric moon  
cooks, sprinkling its peach across the thicket.  
You circumscribe in the sea as in a parsimonious boulevard.  
Pockets of graphite converted into bolt of silken.  
Our new serenity, our absent minded grape triangles.  
A cashmire lake reflecting will rise  
the disintered lightning of a planet.  
  
Come with me to the stench of conglomerates.  
And a boney tryst's earth will protect you.
