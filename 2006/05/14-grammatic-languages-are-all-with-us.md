You see lip  
as profound as the rain.  
Yellow wind to my dead mist!  
We open the halves of a epiphany and the  
freezing of convicts excites into the enduring chimney.  
A curves and a breath  
developing the archipeligos.  
If you were not the nectarine the romantic moon  
cooks, sprinkling its apple across the land.  
A loaf of bread baked with fire-tipped joy and salt.  
I develop as if in front of an arrogant wax.
