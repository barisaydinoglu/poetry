The Vagabond Fallen Into The Sea
--------------------------------
And next to my hammock, during the sunrise, I woke up naked  
and full of felicity.  
As if to coddle or love or plague.  
A directionless tree day  
some pacify but I drink your salt like moon.  
It's a showering maternity of gates.  
Silvery and romantic fisherman,  
for maternity was disintered and morally neutral.  
Develop on the waxes that wait for you  
dying the atrocious chairs, decaying the doors.  
What funny things does the elephant contain?  
How little we wake and how much it stands the funny things of this universe.  
  
Wave of wave of smooth graphites rolling down the sea.
