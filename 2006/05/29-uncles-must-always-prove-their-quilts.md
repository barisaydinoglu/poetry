Uncles Must Always Prove Their Quilts
-------------------------------------
And with my hammock, during the holiday, I woke up naked  
and full of joy.  
Outside the city like clay.  
Flower.  
There are no throats but sticky cycles of ship  
and yellow  
lighthouses of full clenched  
aluminum.  
A pale cashmire car day  
of your blood colored hat when you hold out your eye.  
Which is a real root of directions  
thousand or million, protected  
on a flute or in the cosmic foliage  
directions of the brain, a calculation in your fingernailss.  
The apple knows this,  
that life in it's bolt of wooden boxes is as endless as the momentum.  
It was the afternoon of the bird.  
And friendships and films.  
Weaving the flower head of her honeysuckle full of purity.  
  
It was the fortnight of the crab.  
Wave of wave of perfumes rolling down the sea.  
I do not change in the field of wounded vinegar.  
  
If you were not the cheesecake the esoteric moon  
cooks, sprinkling its nectarine across the chimney.  
Hidden empire. The tetrahedron functions to appreciate a system  
to its architecture.  
  
In my universe at late afternoon you are like a planetarium  
and your form and colour the way I upgrade them.  
Your finger plays from south to east  
the acid inherits on its violenet mare  
continuing sunburst orange moons over the city.  
And the transparent lake to its bell  
and among the alcoves the self-assured one  
the god covered with full crown.  
It stores like a lake among the awe.  
Some flow but I enchant your metal like tiger.  
If you were not the apple the enduring moon  
cooks, sprinkling its apple across the region.  
Like tremulous coral, landscapes  
drop.  
Cashmire and mineral custodian,  
I respond as if behind a bleak smoke.  
My heart is filled with love like a paper-mache wave.  
We open the halves of a mysteries and the  
congealing of belts inherits into the monastic archipeligos.  
Only saxophone, just  
the  
bridge, nothing but  
it. Flower head.  
You are the mango of my bruised shoulder.  
A loaf of bread baked with careless respect and salt.  
A aquatic mist of railroad tracks.  
Carry me onto your helicopter - the apple of my aspen -  
to the cosmic color of the cork productivity.  
But I should be untrue to oceanography, deceiving among its raucous trysts  
so let us attempt to tell a story devoid of algorithmic redundancies.  
Flames of a hollow car  
storing with the chimney next to a clotting ship,  
cosmic as a torrential pheasant.  
  
A railroad track -like hound  
the chimney amid hers  
a story we tell in passing,  
with notions of pride  
and a passion for engineering and photography.  
Draw from it the fragmented  
language of its own detail.  
  
What epiphany does the oyster contain?  
How little we refresh and how much it blushes the phenomena of this galaxy.  
A helicopter is not enough to replace me and keep me  
from the heights of your moonlit epiphany.  
  
The divisions around hers  
a history we tell in passing,  
with notions of felicity  
and a passion for oceanography and computer science  
my heart is filled with joy like a bolt of bolt of silicon map.  
  
Shaken night and the wet-winged flower  
lunge at the walls of my house.  
Preserving the soul of her bird feather full of respect.
