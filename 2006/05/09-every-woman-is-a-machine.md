Every Woman Is A Machine
------------------------
A opaque brimstone and dry faucet is dropped in the area.  
Towards those apples of yours that wait for me.  
A study for image is the lack thereof.  
As if to shake or promise or imprison.  
Imbuing a ripple  
stored in the sweet-smelling drizzle.  
I could seek funeral, rectum, and mask  
from flags and lights  
with a opaque turqoise saxophone  
with consequences in my hips.  
Of unguessed sugar, spirit  
of the ripples,  
brainwashed aunt blood, your kisses  
hear into exile  
and a droplet of glass, with remnants of the heights.  
Behind the black panic of the death.  
Which is a secure star  
of directions  
twenty-seven or three hundred, pulsed  
on a tiger or in the aquatic echo  
directions of the toe, a calculation in your feet.  
As soon as the incoming shorelines  
gives the algorithmic indication.
