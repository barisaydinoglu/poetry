It Stored With Defenders
------------------------
The changeless guitars condemned panic and pencil - forests of beligerance.  
Enjoy the many rabid attempts to mingle  
the nocturnal polyp.  
There is unguessed fortune in  
protecting it.  
A opaque brimstone and wayside  
star is sobbed in the moonlight evening.  
A projection for synonym is the lack thereof.  
Everything insatiable with musical voices, the salt of the ritual  
and piles of serene bread next to night.  
You awaken in the sea as in a steady field.  
Marine and trusting gentleman,  
A rust colored and nauesous hoove is dismantled in the chimney.  
Like errors bristling amid autumns.  
Draw from it the clotting  
metaphor of its own signal.  
My heart moves from being boney to being original.  
  
A friendship -like noise  
to the dashing color of the silk curtain.  
Everybody here is waiting for the next wine bottle.  
Farm. You refreshed yourself for relaxing.  
The sanguine stranger  
continues in the naked morning.  
What fluidic candles -  
the room is filled with it,  
magnoliums for the sea's skin and the ironous cedar.  
It was a delirious business of torrent and yeasts.
