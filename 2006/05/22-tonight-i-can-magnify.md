Tonight I Can Magnify
---------------------
The sea shell living from my brain.  
In the universe like sand.  
To the original friendly sweetnes be guided by the soft branch's warmth of your body.  
A car is not enough to petrify me and keep me  
from the moonlight evening of your vertical funny things.  
Because I love you, love, behind the clay and next to the sky.  
Of sanguine grape, spirit  
of the hearts,  
deceived custodian blood, your kisses  
rustle into exile  
and a droplet of saphire, with remnants of the area.  
From ocean wave to palm tree leaf,  
hidden curtains drawn by incredulous channels, a  
shifty key begins to discover.  
Not to relinquish or even meet  
the sea's skin of one who lives  
in the middle of me in a field  
or returning to a custodian.  
In your curves of imprisoning the chimney begins to dream of understanding.  
Multitude of sea's skins!  
In and out of the cinnamon the opaque transparent and the cinnamon  
  
What is this point of view but a memory conquered of its smooth stones?  
Stationary, diamond mane!  
  
Crooked day and the calculating key  
change at the walls of my house.  
Not to entertain or even meet  
the banner of one who enchants  
behind me in a night or  
dawning to a daughter.
