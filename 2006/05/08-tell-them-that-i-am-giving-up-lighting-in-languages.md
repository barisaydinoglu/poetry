Tell Them That I Am Giving Up Lighting In Languages
---------------------------------------------------
Inside the school of the moonlight evening where you sleep,  
a dream shakes into phenomena.  
Wave of wave of stalkss  
of cattail rolling down the sea.  
The heights in hers  
a tale we divulge in passing,  
with notions of decency  
and a passion for engineering and photography  
and meetings of barbaous hand you see hips as steady as the rain.  
You weave in the region as in a blazing field.  
Pulled out and shut up like a well.  
What seems simultaneous to one will  
not seem so to another.  
I'd do it for the flute in which you form  
for the serenities of transluscent marine you've reconciled.  
And you reflect like an alcove and I want you to understand on my curves.  
  
The round awes sobbed but I should be untrue to oceanography, faltering among its insufferable reflections  
so let us seek to speak a story devoid of alphabetic redundancies.
