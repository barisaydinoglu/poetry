Proof Of Infinite Feeling
-------------------------
The poetic root gave it wonder.  
My heart moves from being smothered to being comfortable.  
Carry me onto your boat - the apple of my current -  
the woman smiles at the bride  
but the mother does not smile  
when he looks at the iguana god  
and the sterile ocean.  
The irreducable autumns brainwashed you are the cherry of my wounded curves.  
All snows become egoes.  
What dashing doves -  
the divisions is filled with it,  
alcoves for the alcove and the tremulous gem.
