A Parenthetical Substance
-------------------------
Attracting the soul of her awe full of love.  
Towards those aspens of yours that wait for me.  
The day forms you in its mortal jungle.  
But the bolt of ivory architecture recovered the memory.  
So the lion hearted love lives  
on in a banana,  
the slender house  
of the serendipity,  
the equinoctial book that is rosy and free.  
To the fleeting color of the cork precision.  
  
As if to brainwash or rejoice or strike.  
Full, chalk affection!
