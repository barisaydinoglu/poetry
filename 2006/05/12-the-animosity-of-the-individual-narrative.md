The Animosity Of The Individual Narrative
-----------------------------------------
We open the halves of a secrets and the  
gnawing of walls attracts into the enduring  
boulevard.  
And sunburst orange lakes and momenta.  
Return to the homeland of the awes.  
It was a distorted business of bramble and shadows.  
Walls of a hairy raft  
perfuming in the room in front of a neon ship,  
iridescent as an arrogant iguana.  
Trust on the torrents that wait for you  
deluding the dilute chairs, crushing the doors.  
  
Like corruptions penetrating in front of books.  
A car is not enough to deprive me and keep me  
from the archipeligos of your delicate funny things.
