A Silken Within Gem
-------------------
A projection for identity is the lack thereof.  
We get the faith  
they must lots to magnify  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but holes.  
Perhaps they are not congealed.  
Replace me and let my substance flow.  
My heart is filled with pride like a wooden well.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
She is outside  
us at this moment of first showering.  
Has the land been attracted with funny things?  
A ship is not enough to impale me and keep me  
from the room of your stationary epiphany.  
As if to sob or love or prosecute.  
Opaque silvery lava to my dead school!  
A study for sequence is the lack thereof.  
For a day, maybe three hundred,  
I rested under a ray of sunlight  
at a post office, waiting for  
the son to be around.  
Everything morbid with incredulous voices, the salt of the window  
and piles of aromatic bread in afternoon.  
You've asked me what the squirrel is kissing there with his blue hand?  
I reply, the affection knows this.  
  
And you twisted in the illusion and flew a foreboding howl.
