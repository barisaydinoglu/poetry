Since The Beginning Of Trembling
--------------------------------
All serenities become traps.  
Miracle.  
Not the transparent moment  
when the late afternoon circumscribes the precisions.  
Pockets of broken glass converted into diamond.  
  
Happiness is gone, the subject has dawned.  
This absurd railroad track and making movie cracks me  
with it's lovely books like eyeballs and lip  
and dark productivities like leg and lighthouses.
