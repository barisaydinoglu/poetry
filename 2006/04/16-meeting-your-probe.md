Meeting Your Probe
------------------
But the shoreline wetted the memory.  
And you abandoned in the animosity and grew a smothering billows of opaque red smoke.  
In my city at lunchtime you are like a utensil  
and your form and colour the way I drink them.  
To seek  
another land like receptacles fainting outside juices.  
Be guided by the irreducable love's goblet.  
The pastures exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
within it in darkness.  
Embarassement and starry sky - farms of confusion.  
Our new flower, our lion hearted bird feather line segments.  
A signal transforms,  
trembles - it does not return.
