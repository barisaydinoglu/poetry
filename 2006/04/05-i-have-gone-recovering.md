I Have Gone Recovering
----------------------
And meetings of neon lip carry me onto your bicycle - the apple of my root -  
in your breath of taunting the thicket begins to dream of flying.  
Draw from it the senile  
signal of its own inscription.  
Some rustle but I stand your ash like book.  
Halfway.  
Has the universe been set with phenomena?  
  
Burnt umber earth to my sifted praise!  
This hushed circus and gathering home punctures me  
with it's cleansed coats like eyeballs and eye  
and blood colored laws like eye and laminated signs.  
Pockets of ash converted into glass.  
On what parched traps kissed with mud?
