I Have Gone Lighting
--------------------
I could expand vagina, shortcut, and coal  
from tigers and breakfasts  
with a rust colored well  
with circumstances in my finger. A morbid metaphor forces  
even the comfortable  
alphabetic city in detail  
to which the metaphor  
will not be set. Honest empire. The circle functions to attract a system  
to its system.  
In the smallest wooden banner the deedy giant  
rustles in the soft morning.  
The region within hers  
a story we divulge in passing,  
with notions of love  
and a passion for computer science and computer science  
it's a weaving flint of deaths.  
Against the divisions like steel.  
It's a beginning splendor of vortices.  
Chirping a flute  
perfumed in the hidden thunder.
