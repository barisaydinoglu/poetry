Meeting Your Grave
------------------
The clear forests wiped transparent heat to my melancholy apple!  
Garden.  
Transluscent crimson and hidden daughter,  
pulsing from guilt diamond.  
It understands like a perfume among the peace.  
In the face of so many clandenstines to functionality.  
You are the mango of my mourning hand.  
In your mouth of embarassement the room of fountains rescue.  
  
In the first reel, the eager daughter  
is devoured by a pioneer. In the second  
scene  
he returns, to reflect and to tread.
