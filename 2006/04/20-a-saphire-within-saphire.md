A Saphire Within Saphire
------------------------
Transparent oxides of cold fire,  
cashmire seams above a guilt energy.  
A vessel is not enough to silence me and keep me  
from the sea of your acerb funny things.  
Neither vein nor old warrior's medal nor brimstone  
nor yellow but burnt umber.  
Enjoy the many shifty attempts to protect  
the angellic hole.  
There is trusting fortune in storing it.  
And you grow like a pencil and the serendipities exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
within it in darkness.  
Full stop.  
She is in the middle of us at this moment of first fluttering.  
Fisherman of the depths of my arm - your loving  
stills your velvety regard as though it were heat.
