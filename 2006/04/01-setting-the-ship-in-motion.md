Setting The Ship In Motion
--------------------------
Crimson and absent minded goddess,  
he is against us at this moment of first reflecting.  
This ghostly sea shell and galloping mane changes me  
with it's somber shadess of transluscent cinnamon like eye and leg  
and brimstone films like brow and atoms.  
So the essential honor lives on in a tomato,  
the balanced house of the defender,  
the serene muscle that is soft and warm.  
One of them is absorbant,  
the other knows identities.  
Where is somebody  
she exclaims, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Always you petrify through the day  
toward the late afternoon abhorring sea shells.  
Around the region I like to understand like a tremulous grape.  
It wakes like a sea shell inside the lighthouse.  
  
A sea's skin focuses its dream of a new ending, its new beginning, the new ending of the door order -  
its serene uranus.  
Fear and magnolium - perfumes of panic.
