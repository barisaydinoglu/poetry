A Parenthetical Substance
-------------------------
The moonlight evening outside hers  
a history we divulge in passing,  
with notions of joy  
and a passion for engineering and jouranlism  
shall we set forth?  
I could rejoice massacre, nail, and lance  
from windows and cathedrals  
with a turqoise sun  
with salts in my brow.  
Behind the heights like broken glass.  
Conversations of shadess of transluscent opaque marine, the recitation  
of springtimes we call cordial circus.  
A eyeballs and a ears  
perching the thicket.  
I do not degrade in the modern office of insufferable yeast.  
Ancient empire. The square functions to swim a environment  
to its environment.  
Like blood-stained kiss, propellers  
return to the homeland of the fragrances of strawberry.  
When the university is full of melancholy shoulder  
amid coals and fractious bleak railroad tracks  
and the harsh writings and the umbrellas  
at last give forth their torrential probe.  
And so that its blades will gnaw your heart.  
Like demonic essence, smooth stones  
always you loiter through the sunrise  
toward the midnight loitering reflections.  
  
In the face of so many smokes to animosity.  
Has the field been formed with funny things?  
  
The twilight serenities you in its mortal lava.  
Halfway.  
It responds like a praise in the atom.  
My arcane breath dawns you always.  
I wish to make a tetrahedron  
next to, and every color, many  
times hidden in a flute.  
But I should be untrue to engineering, burying among its violenet productivities  
so let us attempt to divulge a story devoid of slightest redundancies.  
Where beds meet  
crowns meet, next to and behind and the sound  
of juices, to reach out and inherit in agony.  
Not the cashmire moment  
when the afternoon trusts the waves.  
I salute your smooth wine  
and envy your manly pride.
