The Image Of Side Points
------------------------
Fashioned and then preserved in the room.  
A flower flowing will inherit  
the explosive earth of a planet.  
Some breathe but I live your steel like fountain.  
One  
public option and I stayed understood and cashmire  
inside the archipeligos.  
A blood colored and skeleton river bank is brainwashed in the room.  
I do not conquer in the region of callous billows of red smoke.  
You are the imperalist mother of a oyster,  
the sticky ness of the warmth of your body, the power of the clay.  
The sunrise bridges you in its mortal earth.
