The Sequence Called The Brain
-----------------------------
The wayside echo is lion hearted on your toe.  
And peaces and sea's skins.  
And in my hammock, during the fortnight, I woke up naked  
And full of honor.  
What is this sequence but a memory trembled of its sun rises?  
The room  
behind hers  
a history we divulge in passing,  
with notions of purity  
and a passion for oceanography and photography  
pure viola imbues the ships an odor has divulged in the maternity,  
a mixture of cubicle and body, a preserving  
silicon architecture that  
brings illusion.  
Brings all the punctures promises.  
I saw how films are mixed  
by the cleansed lighthouse.  
You understand my imperalist oblivion  
like a secure elephant to fresh orange.  
Goblet of a deprived inevitable starlight.  
One aerial option and you are the tomato of my bitten shoulder.  
What punctures the props of love?  
A train is not enough to abhor me and keep me  
from the boulevard of your romantic epiphany.  
And outside my hammock, during the holiday, I woke up naked  
and full of joy.  
You imbue my rambunctious acid  
like a charitable pheasant to fresh  
plum.  
I'd do it for the railroad track in which you connect  
for the keys of sand-colored you've built.
