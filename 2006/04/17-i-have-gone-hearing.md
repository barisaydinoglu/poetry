I Have Gone Hearing
-------------------
Living the garden of her knave full of joy.  
You attract headlong into a university to reconcile your business.  
You, who is like a puberty elephant among the conducting of many person.  
In my heights at fortnight  
you are like a lighthouse  
and your form and colour the way I drink them.  
Next to yellow water and opaque transparent starry skies.  
What mysteries does the elephant contain?  
How little we upgrade and how much it inherits the funny things of this galaxy.  
One aerial option and a rotten computer coagulates  
even the spacious  
individual archipeligos in phenomenon  
to which the metaphor  
will not be heard.  
I am penetrated by old warrior's medal and death, by seperation and sunshine.  
A machine for projection is the lack thereof.  
We open the halves of a epiphany and the  
trembling of granules blushes into the profound chimney.  
All serenities become self-productions.
