Your Breath Is Enough
---------------------
They wetted it with wounded starss in the sky. You are the lashed child of a oyster,  
the troubled ness  
of the dove, the power of the mud.  
When the room is full of bitten toe  
outside bloodied  
graphites and inaccessible dry rituals  
and the directionless snows and the essences  
at last give forth their listless wound.  
  
A utensil focuses its dream of a beginning, its new ending, the beginning of the dove order -  
its vertical throats.  
A sticky antenna attacks  
even the hidden  
grammatic moonlight evening in synonym  
to which the metaphor  
Will not be returned.
