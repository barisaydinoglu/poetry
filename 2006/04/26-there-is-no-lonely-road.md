There Is No Lonely Road
-----------------------
When the boulevard is full of putrid brow  
in front of hounds and silent phosphorus cashmire cars  
and the sifted branches and the circuss  
at last give forth their chaotic lamprey.  
How responding is the winged night and it's free dominions?
