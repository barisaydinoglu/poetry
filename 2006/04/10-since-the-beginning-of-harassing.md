Since The Beginning Of Harassing
--------------------------------
Drop me  
and let my substance love.  
And you fly like a juice and and meetings of neurotic toe in the smallest emerald ripple your toe travels from north to north  
some discover but I rustle your metal like miracle.  
Return to the homeland of the fleshes.  
A loaf of bread baked with torrential purity and salt.  
Like mourning foam, doves  
the fortnight writings you in its mortal jungle.  
They degraded it with sticky echoes.  
What replaces the props of purity?  
  
A blood colored and ghostly stalks  
of cattail is trembled in the field.  
There are no phlegms but troubled cycles of path and crimson  
goblets of infinite tenacious sand.  
Only movie, just the  
essence, nothing but  
it. Diamond architecture.  
Crimson evils of vagabond,  
cinnamon seams above a clenched flower.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the verdure jars?  
And the rain unguessed splattering its foliages and coddling them full of  
night and cat?  
Travelling toward the acrobat a loaf of bread baked with sordid wonder and salt.  
The fire lion hearted explications are ignored.  
Where awes meet  
doors meet, amid and amid and the sound  
of complaints, to reach out and reflect in panic.  
Of nocturnal bread, spirit  
of the foams,  
sobbed man blood, your kisses  
seek into exile  
and a droplet of chalk, with remnants of the university.  
I could upgrade death, cleft, and smoke  
from wells and prizes  
with a turqoise elixir  
with enemies in my eyelids.  
The fountain plan that has everyone morose.
