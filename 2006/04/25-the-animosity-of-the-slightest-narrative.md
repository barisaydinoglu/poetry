The Animosity Of The Slightest Narrative
----------------------------------------
Only guitar, just the  
aroma, nothing but  
it. Serendipity.  
I do not bristle in the moonlight evening of imperalist lamprey.  
Re-covering the foam of her foliage full of purity.  
The morning forms you in its mortal fire.  
Neither femininity nor leaf nor red  
nor transluscent yellow but green.  
Wave of wave of shorelines rolling down the sea.  
  
A sea shell -like billow of brimstone smoke  
once there was a cold son  
who  
pacified at parties, sitting in a tetrahedron, among  
lakes.  
Sometimes a piece of the lightning  
bristles like a lemon in my brow.  
For snow was phosphorus and morally neutral.  
Mingling from dilute paper-mache.
