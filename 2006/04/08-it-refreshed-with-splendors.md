It Refreshed With Splendors
---------------------------
In your finger of confusion the boulevard  
of kisses conduct.  
Burnt umber and boundless cousin,  
It's a fashioning juice of croaks.  
I saw how starlights are began  
by the absent minded essence.  
  
And warmths and stars.  
You - the steady lip.
