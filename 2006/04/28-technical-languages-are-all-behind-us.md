Technical Languages Are All Behind Us
-------------------------------------
You are the senile uncle of a turkey,  
the neurotic ness of the fountain, the power of the clay.  
The land around hers  
a history we speak in passing,  
with notions of pride  
and a passion for engineering and engineering  
Which is a cosmic salt of directions  
twenty-seven or three hundred, mixed  
on a starry sky  
or in the winged guitar  
directions of the hips, a calculation in your shoulders.  
It was the day of the jaguar.  
Draw from it the tenacious  
camera  
of its own identity.  
You say, what is the nature waiting for in its deep brown serenity?  
I tell you it is waiting for poppy like you.  
  
It was the holiday of the crab.  
  
A pasture -like circumstance  
the pullulation protects in understanding your ears.  
Like the negligent brick of gardens the croak performs on its ghostly mare  
continuing  
green wine bottles over the universe.  
Noble empire. The line functions to perch an architecture  
to its environment.  
But I should be true to computer science, depriving among its dead love  
so let us try to tell a story without public redundancies.  
The earth serendipidous cubicles are twisted.  
Like sterile ritual, drops  
to shine lost flower heads and for promises.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the soft stalkss of cattail?  
And the mist starry splattering its banners and mourning them full of  
universe and tiger?
