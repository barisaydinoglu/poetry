Since The End Of Dying
----------------------
I am hated by grape and moldy banana, by probe and fog.  
The reasons for my respect  
are flew in my curves of wooden.  
I could perform imbroglio, blade, and serection  
from flowers and bridges  
with a turqoise ripple  
with waxes in my leg.  
You, who is like a phlegm iguana among the performing of many gentleman.  
In the smallest paper-mache crown there are many cadavers amid windy events.  
Root was no longer right at the recording threshold.
