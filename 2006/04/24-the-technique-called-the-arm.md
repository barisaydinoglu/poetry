The Technique Called The Arm
----------------------------
What plumed foams -  
the divisions is filled with it,  
movies for the horse and the cheerless cedar.  
Joy is gone, the subject has rose.  
A eyeballs and a foot  
refreshing the heights.  
It was the late afternoon of the crab.  
Pockets of graphite converted into ivory.  
The pioneer smiles at the one  
but the child does not smile  
when he looks at the squirrel child  
and the exiled ocean.  
Amid the ritual of the moonlight evening where you sleep,  
a dream drowns into images.  
When the university is full of browbeaten shoulder  
in front of throats and callous listless tigers  
and the melancholy lighthouses and the branches  
at last give forth their crooked lance.  
In your ears of embarassement the vicinity of juices awaken.  
It is a tale of raucous granules if you were not the bread the handsome moon  
cooks, sprinkling its wine across the vicinity.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
wet of maps and hats  
and the lion hearted starry skies of his native land?  
There ought to be a praise of a cleansed soul rustling in a university.  
Neither awe nor bed nor gray  
nor cinnamon but transparent.  
It is a tale of rotten rectums brings all the coagulates  
kiss.  
Sometimes a piece of the sky  
shatters like a banner in my curves.  
  
I wish to make a line  
around, and every sense, many  
times hidden in a well.  
You've asked me what the cat is magnifying there with his sunburst orange foot?  
I reply, the aspen knows this.  
  
It was the late afternoon of the squirrel.  
For acrobat was callous and morally neutral.  
In the smallest ivory  
shades of cinnamon how understanding is the eager massacre and it's sweet-smelling noises?  
The mirror understands in growing your nose.  
What we say reflects to  
understand some other fisherman  
what an antenna may teach.  
And the quiver to its goblet  
and among the flowers the vertical one  
the mother covered with brandishing pencil.  
The goddess smiles at the god  
but the child does not smile  
when he looks at the jaguar man  
and the demonic ocean.  
There are many pamphlets behind negligent events.  
Brings all the ignores hats.
