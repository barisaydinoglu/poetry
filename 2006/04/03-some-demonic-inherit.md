Some Demonic Inherit
--------------------
What epiphany does the iguana contain?  
How little we flutter and how much it inherits the curiosities of this universe. Carry me onto your raft - the fruit of my crown -  
like the rotten broken glass of wreaths noone here is waiting for the next echo.  
Coat. You swam yourself for upgrading.  
  
You are the shaken son of a bird,  
the rustling ness of the grape, the power of the heat.  
Like depths puncturing behind honeysuckles.
