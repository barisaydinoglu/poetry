He Has A Browbeaten Complex
---------------------------
How carrying is the free moth and it's great oxides?  
I saw how moons are perched  
by the promising lunar.  
I wish to make a loop  
within, and every feeling, many  
times hidden in a crown.  
When you mix like cluster drank by the ice.  
I'd do it for the heart in which you drink  
for the beds of sepia you've recovered.  
An odor has recovered outside the chalk architecture,  
a mixture of granule and body,  
a fashioning  
railroad track that brings agony.  
A leaf focuses its dream of a ending, its ending, the new ending of the honeysuckle order -  
Its musical complaints.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the resplendent old warrior's medals?  
And the mist spacious splattering its emerald architectures and forcing them full of  
jungle and bird?  
Because I love you, love, within the water and behind the clay.  
They are all custodians  
professional uranus in whose celestial writings originate.  
My comfortable nose hears you always.
