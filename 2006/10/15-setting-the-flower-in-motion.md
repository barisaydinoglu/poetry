Setting The Flower In Motion
----------------------------
The sticky jaguar rejoices against the clear gates. In front of the landscape of the thicket where you sleep,  
a dream soddens into studies.  
The I in lake the frail crab begins outside the brandishing pamphlets.  
I wish to make a quadrangle  
in front of, and every sense, many  
times hidden in a well.
