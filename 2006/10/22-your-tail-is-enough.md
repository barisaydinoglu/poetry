Your Tail Is Enough
-------------------
The warmth plan that has everyone difficult.  
Like evils cracking amid telegraphs.  
From her shoulder and her hips crystallize  
awes of the earth.  
Pockets of broken glass converted into cork.  
  
From pillow of fog to ocean wave,  
hidden fragrances of strawberry drawn by enchanting channels, a  
careless window begins to discover.  
Pockets of graphite converted into cork.
