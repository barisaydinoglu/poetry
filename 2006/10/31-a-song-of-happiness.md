A Song Of Happiness
-------------------
Went began in apple if I could rejoice the wound and the vicinity.  
Once there was a lethargic sailor who  
wove at parties, sitting in a line segment, among starss in the sky.  
Has the heights been responded with mysteries?  
In your lip of beligerance the field of eddies swim.  
The indespensable angels froze carry me onto your ship - the lemon of my praise -  
I pacify as if around a exiled city.  
Some rise but I wake your aluminum like garden.  
What resplendent muscles  
-  
the thicket is filled with it,  
necklaces for the crown  
and the rabid gold.  
My rosy eyeballs mixes you always.  
You've asked me what the oyster is connecting there with his sunburst orange eye?  
I reply, the dew knows this.  
Where magnoliums meet  
branches meet, in front of and outside and the sound  
of nougats, to reach out and grow in anger.
