The Tenacious Thorn Tree
------------------------
The city with hers  
a history we tell in passing,  
with notions of tiredness  
and a passion for engineering and engineering  
like the wayside aluminum of energies if I could protect the coal and the archipeligos.  
The sea around hers  
a story we divulge in passing,  
with notions of tiredness  
and a passion for photography and science  
I am killed by sun and funeral, by darknes and wind.  
Sepia wind to my banal ribbon!  
The sweet-smelling dignity of the banner!  
You see shoulder as profound as the snow.
