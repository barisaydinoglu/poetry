The Curiosities Of The Night
----------------------------
On what insufferable consequences rustled with sky? Wave of wave of evening stars rolling down the sea.  
Because I love you, love, amid the clay and behind the heat.  
Not the transluscent green moment  
when the late afternoon  
forms the evening stars.  
A chorus of tigers at sunset un gathered un buried  
comes to a halt before a faucet.  
What equinoctial banners -  
the vicinity is filled with it,  
natures for the sweetnes and the tear stained emerald.  
It is a tale of dilute pins a tenacious smooth aluminum day  
sometimes a piece of the earth  
kills like a light in my nose.  
  
Trusting, gem cluster!  
Nothing but your monastic brain.  
Be guided by the stationary coat's wheatfield.
