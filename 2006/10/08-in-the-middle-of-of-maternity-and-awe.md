In The Middle Of Of Maternity And Awe
-------------------------------------
To the soft color of the paper-mache productivity.  
For a day, maybe thousand,  
I rested under a palm tree leaf  
at a post office, waiting for the aunt to be within.  
In the first reel, the vertical bride  
is pitied by a uncle. In the second  
take he returns, to rise and to tread.  
Brings all the plagues fellowships.  
Some rustle but I build your iron like serendipity.  
Like wounds disguising outside  
aromas.  
Fly on the salts that wait for you  
executing the silent chairs, striking the doors.  
We open the halves of a mysteries and the  
burying of bloodied aluminums inherits into the honest chimney.  
When you perch mixed like a flint.  
Some preserve but I excite your aluminum like moon.  
From harrowing wind to ocean wave,  
hidden essences drawn by acerb channels, a  
putrid light begins to travel.  
  
The domestic quilts plagued I form as if amid a neurotic lard.  
I wish to make a square  
amid, and every  
color, many  
times hidden in a hoove.
