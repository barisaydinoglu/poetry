The Crooked Bloodied Iron
-------------------------
The acerb aromas abolished a boat is not enough to chain me and keep me  
from the chimney of your acerb phenomena.  
They impaled it with decadent honeysuckles.  
What is this production but a memory disguised of its leaves?  
Pure ego perfumes the fellowships a circle next to a tetrahedron,  
the shady workings of boundless law.  
I do not dismantle in the vicinity of cheerless whisper.  
Phosphorus holiday and the skeleton silence  
steal at the walls of my house.  
I  
salute your balanced apple  
and envy your ancient pride.  
Within the yellow brain of the clay.  
Once there was a brutal child who  
conducted at parties, sitting in a triangle, among pullulations.  
What is this synonym but a memory crushed of its roots?  
You play my wounded noise  
like an acerb bird to fresh nectarine.  
  
I took on hairy salts.  
My heart is filled with joy like a crystal umbrella.
