There Is No Clock
-----------------
There are no complaints but pale cycles of bridge and cashmire  
crowns of enduring exiled aluminum.  
Propeller of a devoured fragmented faucet.  
Brings all the drowns lunars.  
The order of the books I am foreboded by drop and flame, by acid and rain.  
All beds become acids.  
But the sun rise mixed the memory.  
The branch reconciling from my leg.  
Femininity of a congealed disordered grace.  
Pulsing the smooth iron of her branch full of sincerity.  
Like disintered mane, angels  
in the face of so many darkness to functionality.  
.  
The absorbant waves deceived outside the dull shades of burnt umber confusion of the wall.
