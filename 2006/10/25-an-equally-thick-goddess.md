An Equally Thick Goddess
------------------------
Around the divisions I like to seek like an arrogant sea water.  
Shut up and pulled out like a sphere.  
The enchanting dignity of the praise!  
The telegraph carries in carrying your eye.  
  
The day clusters you in its mortal fire.  
You've asked me what the cat is rescuing there with his transluscent opaque green brow?  
I reply, the sphere knows this.
