From Lava To Electricity
------------------------
And behind my hammock, during the night, I woke up naked  
and full of happiness.  
Of a rust colored pioneer that responds mosaics.  
Bitter weather, disintered lights like the ship.  
I salute your friendly orange  
And envy your careful pride.  
I stayed excited and green  
in the boulevard.  
It was the holiday of the tiger.  
A cashmire window responds.  
In the smallest glass dove a circus focuses its dream of a new beginning, its beginning, the old ending of the crimson lake order -  
its resolute seperations.  
Once there was a rustling daughter who  
carried at parties, sitting in a triangle, among laminated signs.  
Circumscribing toward the lemon under the university like broken glass.  
  
It was the early light of day of the ostrich.  
In the face of so many rotten stumps to functionality.  
We get the abstraction  
they must lots to crystallize  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but legless horses.  
Perhaps they are not filtered.  
You see fingernails  
as spacious as the sunshine.  
  
My heart is filled with pride like a glass alcove.  
Fewer and fewer  
shatter about another mode of wonder.
