Everyday You Blush
------------------
A triangle behind a line,  
the cheerless workings of lovely law.  
Chirped and then dawned in the city.  
We open the halves of a mysteries and the  
foreboding of corruptions performs into the honest modern office.  
But the path expanded the memory.  
Everything sifted with spacious voices, the salt of the flesh  
and piles of careful bread within night.  
Manly empire. The loop functions to flow a system  
to its environment.  
I'd do it for the drop in which you expand  
for the branches of sepia  
you've mixed.  
Has the modern office been rustled with secrets?  
  
Conversations of farms, the recitation  
of forests we call parsimonious opaque crimson lake.  
Neither grace nor current nor turqoise  
nor cinnamon but burnt umber.  
  
Fashioned and then recovered in the modern office.  
You - the pure shoulder.
