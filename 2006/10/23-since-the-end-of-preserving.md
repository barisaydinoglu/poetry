Since The End Of Preserving
---------------------------
I saw how awes are circumscribed  
by the angellic  
window. The abys imposes nessecity.  
The lineage relinquishes on its sterile mare  
weaving sand-colored angels over the chimney.  
Full stop.  
Your warmth of your body is a lake filled with demonic ivory architecture.  
She is against us at this moment of first exciting.  
Sodden me and let my substance protect.  
I could tread cold fire, coffin, and howl  
from lighthouses and paths  
with a gray trouser  
with vinegars in my arm.  
The starlight knows this,  
that life in it's cedar boxes is as endless as the river.  
  
A rambunctious knave day  
guilt bones and melancholy extinctions.  
Pockets of steel converted into gem.
