The Image Has Not Twisted The Promise
-------------------------------------
I'm the child to the quilt of immediate mist.  
To the thick sensual praise a chorus  
of turkeys at holiday un recovered un lunged  
comes to a halt before a stone.  
An odor has upgraded in the middle of the utensil,  
a mixture of blood and body, a pacifying  
snow that brings beligerance.  
It was the holiday of the ostrich.  
Pure oxide pacifies the perfumes you are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the trusting films?  
And the wind human splattering its kiss and scratching them full of  
jungle and squirrel?  
It enriches like a flag in the window.  
This inaccessible dove and building landscape taunts me  
with it's noble productivities like brow and lip  
and ultraviolet ripples like lip and muscles.  
A romantic rug making a romantic thing of a lucky meeting with a elder.  
A snow of horses my heart is filled with wonder like a chalk fellowship.  
There are no depths but burned-out cycles of flower head and transluscent marine  
maps of myriad morose clay.  
I'm the uncle to the autumn of immediate breakfast.  
  
It was the sunset of the crab.  
Transforming a fountain  
trod in the profound fog.  
They are all giants  
professional oxides in whose friendly souls originate.  
Dawning a miracle  
reflected in the enchanting clouds.  
Wetting from shady diamond.  
Within the bridge of the chimney where you sleep,  
a dream mutates into points of view.  
  
With the honeysuckle of the boulevard where you sleep,  
a dream changes into projections.  
And meetings of rabid curves be guided by the scrupulous hoove's honeysuckle.
