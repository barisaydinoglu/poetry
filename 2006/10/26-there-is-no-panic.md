There Is No Panic
-----------------
In the browbeaten book, many dry hearts.  
It was the fortnight of the bird.  
The vein standing from my breath.  
Appreciating toward the bell and amid my hammock, during the afternoon, I woke up naked  
and full of happiness.  
There ought to be a magnolium of a free nature crystallizing in a divisions.  
I want you to build on my lip.  
A chorus of turkeys at late afternoon un trusted un congealed  
comes to a halt before a wreath.  
A fog of lemons multitude of reflections!  
In and out of the sepia the opaque sand-colored and the green  
  
In front of sunburst orange water and sand-colored hats.  
You - the sweet-smelling fingernails.  
  
It was the night of the bird.  
I salute your parsimonious grape  
and envy your humble pride.  
You see nose as boundless as the rain.  
The well changes, the elixir  
of slender  
loves inside.  
If I could breathe the eternity and the boulevard.
