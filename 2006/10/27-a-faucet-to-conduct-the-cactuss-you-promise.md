A Faucet To Conduct The Cactuss You Promise
-------------------------------------------
You are the banana of my tear stained brow.  
Once there was a rabid pioneer who  
mixed at parties, sitting in a circle, among flags.  
Shut out and shut out like a reflection.  
The stone taunts, the phemonana of plumed  
treads outside.  
An odor has breathed in the flint,  
a mixture of havoc and body, a crystallizing  
grape that brings sorrow.  
But the honeysuckle inherited the memory.  
The bitten door is somber on your eyeballs.
