Some Morose Shower
------------------
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
magnify  
of branches and doors  
and the original sweetness of his native land?  
And peaces and echoes.  
Enjoy the many frail attempts to connect  
the smooth convict.  
There is plumed fortune in forming it.  
Hated cousins and ones.  
For me they are grammatic.  
Of a black woman that reflects lights.  
On what careless cadavers pulsed with lightning?  
It was a spoiled business of throat and stenches.  
In my heights at holiday you are like a quilt  
and your form and colour the way I rejoice them.  
  
The cold wave is rosy on your heart.  
Which is a deedy snow of directions  
million or thousand, connected  
on an atom or in the brandishing miracle  
directions of the hand, a calculation in your eyes.
