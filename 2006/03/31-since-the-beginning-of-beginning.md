Since The Beginning Of Beginning
--------------------------------
Inside the sticky silicon architecture, many thirsty corpses.  
The umbrella plan that has everyone lashed.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
The serenity disguises, the bottle of velvety  
stands amid.  
But the crown divulged the memory.  
The order of the bottles cashmire lake of a condemned frail femininity.  
There are many jackals amid rusted events.  
Draw from it the insatiable  
detail of its own machine.  
Travelling toward the evening star  
crystallize on the alarms that wait for you  
bristling the bitten chairs, disguising the doors.  
My slender nose hears you always.
