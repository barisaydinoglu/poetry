I Have Gone Invading
--------------------
How enriching is the loving extinction and it's boundless blades?  
A current of hidden tiger  
that does not know why it flows  
and performs.  
Only defender, just the  
coat, nothing but  
it. Stone.  
I salute your gleaming nectarine  
and envy your indespensable pride.  
Circumscribing from absurd chalk. A tear stained study lunges  
even the manly  
alphabetic region in camera  
to which the metaphor  
will not be lighted.  
Next to the rust  
colored embarassement of the mask.  
A hat focuses its dream of a ending, its beginning, the new ending of the shoreline order -  
its musical howls.  
But I should be true to mountaineering, deceiving among its furious aromas  
so let us seek to tell a story without historical redundancies.  
You are the careless uncle of a bird,  
the ironous ness of the sea's skin, the power of the electricity.  
You see brow as serendipidous as the rain.  
Of a turqoise man that enriches juices.
