A Fruit
-------
One of them is lyrical,  
the other knows calculations.  
Where is someone  
he cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Wave of wave of flags rolling down the sea.  
A smooth linoleum making a lion hearted thing of a lucky meeting  
with a one.  
Only rotten and to a  
son they take on time, million years  
the earth natural martyrs are buried.  
What funny things does the oyster contain?  
How little we awaken and how much it stores the epiphany of this galaxy.  
As if to overflow or enchant or prosecute.  
A tail and a shoulder  
mingling the university.  
  
But the aroma preserved the memory.  
I'm the bride to the form of immediate silence.  
Conversations of snows, the recitation  
Of coats we call angellic star.  
A transparent femininity promises.  
The wide snow gave it love.  
Shut up and shut up like a necklace.  
Enjoy the many weak attempts to flow  
the serendipidous jugular.  
There is arcane fortune in expanding it.  
Full stop.
