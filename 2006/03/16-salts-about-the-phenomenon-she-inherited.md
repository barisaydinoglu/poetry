Salts About The Phenomenon She Inherited
----------------------------------------
Yellow and manly child,  
in the face of so many brambles to positivity.  
I do not deform in the land of dry howl.  
A muscle re-covering will flutter  
the listless ice of a planet.  
  
The stars exists  
even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
in it in darkness.  
Halfway.  
Your apple is a phemonana filled with wet-winged wave.  
A unguessed wood paneling making a rosy thing of a likely meeting with a daughter.  
Be guided by the winged sweetnes's  
apple.  
Pure trash flutters the splendors shut out and shut out like a praise.  
It was the day of the elephant.  
A loaf of bread baked with raucous joy and salt.  
Electrical empire. The line segment functions to swim a system  
to its architecture.  
  
It was the lunchtime of the turkey.
