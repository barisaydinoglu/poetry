Song For The Man Of Dry Acrobats
--------------------------------
Blue and hopeful gentleman, the tenacious pheasant dedicates behind the ancient moldy bananas.  
Brings all the abhors autumns.  
I could chirp cummerbund, acid, and consequence  
from flints and maps  
with a brimstone curtain  
with eternities in my eye.
