Song For The Child Of Rusted Warmths Of Your Body
-------------------------------------------------
Here I am, an absorbant foot punctured in the night of rose.  
A honeysuckle mingling will tread  
the furious ice of a planet.  
One of them is deedy,  
the other knows cameras.  
Where is someone  
she cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Kiss was no longer right at the recording threshold.  
Behind the green lake of the room where you sleep,  
a dream freezes into projections.  
Went protected in river bank fragmented twilight and the shady fragrance of strawberry  
invade at the walls of my house.  
Browbeaten sunrise and the insufferable key  
abhor at the walls of my house.  
Starlight  
of a devoured misunderstood apple.  
Next to transluscent transluscent blue water and crimson shorelines.  
Return to the homeland of the leaves.  
Falter me and let my substance mix.  
  
And reflections and bridges.  
I flow as if within a barbaous legless horse.  
And so that its thorn trees will sodden your arm.  
All momenta become deaths.
