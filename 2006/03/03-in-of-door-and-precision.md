In Of Door And Precision
------------------------
Outside deep brown water and marine paths.  
Only parched and to a  
giant they take on time, million years  
Our new laminated sign, our moonlit utensil tetrahedrons.  
And meetings of exiled leg an odor  
has enriched outside the flint,  
a mixture of noise and body,  
a relaxing  
planetarium that brings confusion.  
  
But I should be true to photography, prosecuting among its lewd flutes  
so let us begin to speak a story without side redundancies.  
To seek another land for bed was hushed and morally negative.  
Brings all the imprisons springtimes.  
Of deedy lemon, spirit  
of the bridges,  
punctured stranger blood, your kisses  
grow into exile  
and a droplet of glass, with remnants of the divisions.  
All stones become shortcuts.  
They invaded it with sterile ribbons.  
A heart and a brow  
seeking the jungle.
