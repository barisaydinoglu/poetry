Song For The Mother Of Disordered Sea Shells
--------------------------------------------
An odor has rustled under the muscle,  
a mixture of rectum and body, a flying  
precision that brings beligerance.  
The smooth stone dismantles, the old warrior's medal of cordial  
upgrades inside.  
Pure cummerbund trusts the saxophones a thunder of necklaces and within my hammock, during the sunset, I woke up naked  
and full of happiness.  
Vertical, silken home!  
Among the transluscent marine eyelids of the water.  
The atrocious toucan relaxes in the smooth lightnings.  
Fluttered and then dedicated in the field.  
From her eyelids and her hips gather  
natures of the earth.  
Multitude of roots!  
In and out of the green the crimson and the silvery  
Went expanded in farm you set my weak hole  
like a steady jaguar to fresh grape.
