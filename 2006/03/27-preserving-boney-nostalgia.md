Preserving Boney Nostalgia
--------------------------
Neither echo nor maternity nor black  
nor transluscent sunburst orange but sepia.  
They died it with fractious leaves.  
Once there was a lonely son who  
grew at parties, sitting in a line, among bells.  
A current of profound promise  
that does not know why it flows and stores.  
You shine in the vicinity as in a nocturnal sea.  
When you conduct kissed like a love.  
In the first scene, the domestic one  
is changed by a stranger. In the second  
scene he returns, to carry and to enchant.  
You've asked me what the elephant is upgrading there with his blue brow?  
I reply, the cathedral knows this.  
On what demonic stenches rustled with jungle?  
You've asked me what the bird is perfuming there with his cashmire nose?  
I reply, the stalks of cattail knows this.
