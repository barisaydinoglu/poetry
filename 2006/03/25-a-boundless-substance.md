A Boundless Substance
---------------------
A marine quiver breathes.  
You are the cherry of my decadent brain.  
Frail fathers and ones.  
For me they are neutral.  
Of your black evening star when you hold out your eyelids.  
You say, what is the mirror waiting for in its sunburst orange lighthouse?  
I tell you it is waiting for salt like you.  
Full stop.  
A fog of leaves what seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.
