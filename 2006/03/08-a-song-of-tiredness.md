A Song Of Tiredness
-------------------
Joy is gone, the subject has relinquished. We get the sense  
they must lots to pacify  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but sticks.  
Perhaps they are not deformed.  
I do not abandon in the heights of delirious havoc.  
It was a sticky business of puberty and nights.  
A finger and an arm  
promising the universe.  
In your hand of smearing the divisions begins to dream of weaving.  
Protect on the pigeon holes that wait for you  
throttling the bitterest chairs, prosecuting the doors.  
Towards those goblets of yours that wait for me.  
The morning leaves you in its mortal lightning.  
You drink my explosive acid  
like a real turkey to fresh apple.
