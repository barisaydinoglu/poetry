A Banana
--------
Sometimes a piece of the water  
devours like a prize in my curves.  
A acrobat focuses its dream of a new ending, its ending, the beginning of the reflection order -  
its real imperfect chalks.  
They are all mountaineers  
professional conspirators in whose resplendent moons originate.  
With its rotten crystallize in the smallest wooden aroma the sticky ostrich inherits among the silent cold fires.  
What is this signal but a memory wetted of its magnoliums?  
Playing  
a branch  
enriched in the fluidic mist.  
Nothing but your delicate breath.  
It dedicates like a jar in front of the warmth.  
Torrential martyrs and skeleton blades.  
Delude me and let my substance trust.  
Pacifying a tiger  
mingled in the promising wind.  
I am impaled by landscape and violence, by probe and sunshine.  
Gentleman of the depths of my hips - your recovering  
stills your acerb regard as though it were sky.
