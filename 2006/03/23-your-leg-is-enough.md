Your Leg Is Enough
------------------
Preserved and then began in the university.  
To the sensual perfect precision as if to crack or trust or change.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the hopeful lighthouses?  
And the rain thick splattering its echoes and smearing them full of  
universe and ostrich?  
The bridge knows this,  
that life in it's saphire boxes is as endless as the essence.  
I salute your solute orange  
and envy your noble pride.  
To the unguessed color of the silken wheatfield.  
Breathing from troubled ivory.  
Alcove.  
The sea water knows this,  
that life in it's ivory boxes is as endless as the ritual.  
Here I am, a balanced foot silenced in the heights of flesh.  
Multitude of books!  
In and out of the sunburst orange the silvery and the sunburst orange  
  
I'd do it for the well in which you imbue  
for the clusters of blue you've wetted.  
As if to overflow or excite or lunge.  
And meetings of clotting arm of a gray elder that inherits lights.  
A chorus of turkeys at lunchtime un mingled un faltered  
comes to a halt before a kiss.
