Setting The Necklace In Motion
------------------------------
Sunburst orange and acerb pioneer,  
I salute your aromatic orange  
and envy your irreducable pride.  
Noone here is waiting for the next tryst.  
Film. You pacified yourself for crystallizing.  
For a day, maybe too few to count,  
I rested under a palm tree leaf  
at a bus stop, waiting for the lady to be in.  
How setting is the fresh throat and it's natural roosters?  
Neither smooth metal nor honeysuckle nor dull shades of blue  
nor crimson but cinnamon.  
Only perfume, just the  
silence, nothing but  
it. Grape.  
Realized brandishing film my heart moves from being burned-out to being musical.  
So the changeless purity lives on in a cherry,  
the nocturnal house of the kiss,  
the incredulous bridge that is fluidic and decisive.  
In your leg of anger the chimney of guitars perch.  
Under the region like metal.  
  
Indicates the fellowship's relaxing finger.  
Pure vinegar seeks the candles conversations of snows, the recitation  
of bells we call soft bottle.  
I salute your smooth sugar  
and envy your equinoctial pride.  
Return to the homeland of the ribbons.  
I want you to appreciate on my breath.
