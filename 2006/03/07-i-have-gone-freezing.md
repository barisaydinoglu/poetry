I Have Gone Freezing
--------------------
The one smiles at the giant  
but the child does not smile  
when he looks at the iguana astronaut  
and the ironous ocean.  
I salute your handsome bread  
and envy your plumed pride.  
I was without doubt the mountaineer elephant  
there in the windy chimney.  
When it looked me with its promising sun rise eyes  
it had neither ears nor leg  
but bolt of marble defenders on its sides.  
Next to green water and transluscent green planetariums.  
Within the dull shades of green embarassement of the wasteland.  
Around sand-colored water and blue moons.  
The lunchtime promises you in its mortal fire.  
Raucous cubicles and rigid explications.
