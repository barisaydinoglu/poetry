Everything Is A Technical Issue
-------------------------------
The resplendent son  
enchants in the humble morning.  
Your autumn is an angel filled with muzzled grace.  
When the sea is full of putrid nose  
among acids and careless dead sea's skins  
and the bitter bird feathers and the evening stars  
at last give forth their difficult blood.  
I saw how suns are fashioned  
by the human apple.  
There are no nougats but skeleton cycles of ritual and cashmire  
banners of parsimonious bruised steel.  
The free juice gave it  
purity.  
  
Burned-out salts and communist puberties.  
My sweet-smelling breath forms you always.
