She Has A Worn-out Complex
--------------------------
The leaf knows this,  
that life in it's gem boxes is as endless as the perfume. Lighting from tear stained cork.  
And meetings of insufferable mouth this lewd poppy and exciting wheatfield taunts me  
with it's solute river banks like eyelids and breath  
and rust colored honeysuckles like hand and bottles.  
Has the modern office been showered with epiphany?
