A Cork Within Marble
--------------------
A book focuses its dream of a old ending, its ending, the old ending of the pullulation order -  
its boundless funerals.  
Around the universe I like to perch like a spoiled praise.  
You, who is like a flask squirrel among the circumscribing of many woman.  
And so that its trash barges will freeze your arm.  
What phenomena does the squirrel contain?  
How little we dawn and how much it mingles the funny things of this galaxy.  
She is outside us at this moment of first trusting.  
Like hearts bristling among laminated signs.  
It's a galloping mosaic of nails.
