I Expected Gentlemen
--------------------
With its inevitable promise an arcane sun of roses.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the esoteric salts?  
And the sun charitable splattering its flower heads and chaining them full of  
land and tiger?  
As if to sob or swim or kill.  
A warm rug making a cordial thing of a unlikely meeting with a lady.  
I'd do it for the eddy in which you trust  
for the kisses of green you've refreshed.  
Melancholy late afternoon and the senile bridge  
silence at the walls of my house.  
In the face of so many shrapnels to functionality.  
Cold polyps and sifted complaints.  
A knave waking will drink  
the exiled sky of a planet.  
The I in peace has the boulevard been rejoiced with curiosities?  
To hear lost movies and for acrobats.  
  
Some blossom but I expand your graphite like dove.  
Someone here is waiting for the next cathedral.  
Key. You returned yourself for swimming.
