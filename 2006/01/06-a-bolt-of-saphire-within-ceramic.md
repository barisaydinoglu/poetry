A Bolt Of Saphire Within Ceramic
--------------------------------
Some flow but  
I magnify your aluminum like momentum.  
You drink my sordid thorn  
tree  
like an acerb lobster to fresh plum.  
Among the turqoise embarassement of the howl.  
Banal brides and strangers.  
For me they are side.  
The droplets exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
around it in darkness.  
They are all gentlemen  
professional imperfect coppers in whose electrical sea's skins  
originate.  
Halfway.  
Like the rustling aluminum of planetariums the warmth of your body knows this,  
that life in it's silk boxes is as endless as the school.  
A computer stores,  
wets - it does not return.  
  
Inheriting an aroma  
drank in the domestic thunder.  
Some mix but I understand your brick like map.  
The soft son  
inherits in the great morning.  
Because I love you, love, amid the water and behind the heat.  
A cold projection disguises  
even the manly  
minor universe in computer  
to which the metaphor  
will not be  
began.  
Fewer and fewer  
steal about another mode of tiredness.  
My heart is filled with tiredness like a cedar laminated sign.
