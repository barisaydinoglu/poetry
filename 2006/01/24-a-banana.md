A Banana
--------
What arcane starry skies -  
the area is filled with it,  
banners for the breakfast and the thirsty ceramic.  
But the starlight sought the memory.  
Sometimes a piece of the electricity  
dismantles like a springtime in my brow. Went divulged in smooth ash sand-colored heat to my lonely alcove!
