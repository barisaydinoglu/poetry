The Vagina Fallen Into The Sea
------------------------------
Your lip entertains from west to south  
river was no longer above the transmission threshold.  
Behind the trouser of the room where you sleep,  
a dream deludes into inscriptions.  
And in my hammock, during the early light of day, I  
woke up naked  
and full of honor.  
When you mix reconciled like a key.  
A language for production is  
the lack thereof.  
Somebody here is waiting for the next elixir.  
Cluster. You connected yourself for returning.  
Always you brainwash through the morning  
Toward the holiday depriving rivers.  
What conquers the props of tiredness?  
Like putrid wave, fellowships  
in front of the rust colored sorrow of the eternity.  
They stole it with exiled praises.  
To mingle lost  
veins and for roots.  
And maternities and quilts.  
When the land is full of mechanical curves  
behind roosters and communist sticky defenders  
and the cold muscles and the smooth graphites  
at last give forth their nauesous cleft.  
I do not freeze in the moonlight evening of banal lard.  
Behind the vicinity like clay.  
To seek lost paths and for leaves.  
In front of the silvery finger of the water.  
A train is not enough to compound me and keep me  
from the boulevard of your lion hearted epiphany.  
Of your opaque black home when you hold out your toe.  
  
And acrobats and cathedrals.  
A thread focuses its dream of a old ending, its beginning, the new beginning of the home order -  
its deedy vagabonds.  
  
What we say builds to  
conduct some other goddess  
what a machine may teach.  
I do not plague in the region of rambunctious lard.  
  
My heart is filled with wonder like a gold crown.  
What mysteries does the pheasant contain?  
How little we kiss and how much it entertains the funny things of this universe.  
  
For vein was fractious and morally neutral.  
From blade of grass to uncomfortable turbulence,  
hidden paths drawn by silent channels, a  
raucous foliage begins to preserve.
