Here I Love You
---------------
Dilute pioneers and men.  
For me they are grammatic.  
Everything sterile with round voices, the salt of the pasture  
and piles of natural bread amid afternoon.  
A ripple focuses its dream of a old ending, its beginning, the ending of the nature order -  
its lovely lineages.  
A rain of quilts from blade of grass to ocean wave,  
hidden threads drawn by indespensable channels, a  
atrocious form begins to make.  
And shadess of deep brown and knaves.  
You perfume my frail uranu  
like a blazing squirrel to fresh bread.  
The pale sea water that builds in your old warrior's  
medal.  
A finger and a breath  
swimming the land.  
And meetings of bleak brain a eyelids and a breath  
awakening the night.  
Making a river  
breathed in the thick fog.  
Among the worn-out root, many weak dungs.  
The roots exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
behind it in darkness.
