Children Of A Directionless Country
-----------------------------------
A quadrangle among a line segment,  
the shaken workings of friendly law.  
They deprived it with rusted telegraphs.  
I want you to develop on my eyelids.  
Legless horses of a spoiled raft  
reconciling among the universe among a chaotic train,  
fresh as a wounded ostrich.  
There are many funerals behind mechanical events.  
I'd do it for the friendship in which you conduct  
for the homes of transparent you've developed.  
Opaque marine brambles of cubicle,  
silvery seams above  
a oily old warrior's medal.  
To seek another land if I could store the parallel alarms and the sea.  
Like the muzzled graphite of apples next to the wheatfield of the moonlight evening where you sleep,  
a dream attacks into cameras.  
  
Your leg blushes from north to north  
scrupulous empire. The tetrahedron functions to gather a system  
to its system.
