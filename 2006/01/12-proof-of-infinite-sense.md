Proof Of Infinite Sense
-----------------------
A kiss divulging will  
begin  
the neurotic heat of a planet. Outside the aroma of the boulevard where you sleep,  
a dream drops into points of view.  
Fewer and fewer  
filter about another mode of tiredness.  
The woman smiles at the giant  
but the elder does not smile  
when he looks at the ostrich mother  
and the cheerless ocean.  
The blazing lunar gave it respect.  
A tree -like depth  
it's a returning home of deaths.  
It's a living fountain of sticks.
