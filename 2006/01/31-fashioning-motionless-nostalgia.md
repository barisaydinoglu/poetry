Fashioning Motionless Nostalgia
-------------------------------
To the myriad scrupulous wreath map was no longer below the recording threshold.  
All perfumes become circumstances.  
I was without doubt the bride squirrel  
there in the motionless city.  
When it looked me with its irreducable law eyes  
it had neither lip nor brain  
but cedar praises on its sides.  
And starlights and kisses.  
Multitude of flutes!  
In and out of the sand-colored the crimson and the green  
Be guided by the blazing atom's time.  
Pockets of graphite converted into bolt of chalk.  
Pulled out and pulled out like a sea's skin.  
  
Pity me and let my substance swim.  
In your foot of flying the heights begins to dream of magnifying.  
The calculating tiger inherits  
among the angellic shrapnels.  
Some reflect  
but I rescue your sand like acrobat.
