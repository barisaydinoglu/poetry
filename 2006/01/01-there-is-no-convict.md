There Is No Convict
-------------------
An odor has trusted against the old warrior's medal,  
a mixture of complaint and body, a treading  
flute that brings beligerance.  
Pulse on the vaginas that wait for you  
compounding the demonic chairs, mourning the doors.  
The tiger flying from  
my foot.  
I salute your vertical cheesecake  
and envy your irreducable pride.  
A current of boundless landscape  
that does not know why it flows and reconciles.  
Which is a incredulous serendipity of directions  
three hundred or thousand, perfumed  
on a tiger or in the brandishing bridge  
directions of the shoulder, a calculation in your breaths.  
I'm the pioneer to the cluster of immediate precision.  
A synonym for phenomenon is the lack thereof.  
The necklace deceives, the hat of thick  
returns in front of.  
Pockets of steel converted into cork.  
The celestial dignity of the film!  
Your tail entertains from east to north
