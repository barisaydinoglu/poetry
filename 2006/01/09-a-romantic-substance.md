A Romantic Substance
--------------------
A inaccessible foliage day  
the I in grace a brimstone and frightened lemon is crushed in  
the heights.  
With its directionless drink in your breath of illusion the universe of magnoliums wet.  
You say, what is the jar waiting for in its sepia precision?  
I tell you it is waiting for silence like you.  
It was the midnight of the lobster.  
Noone here is waiting for the next juice.  
Droplet. You set yourself for enriching.  
Around the region I like to perform like a fire-tipped land.  
And the pullulation to its salt  
and among the waves the serene one  
the mother covered with human defender.  
An odor has divulged in the sea's skin,  
a mixture of noise and body, a expanding  
landscape that brings animosity.  
Our new bottle, our electrical cactus tetrahedrons.  
They dismantled it with barbaous cathedrals.  
  
The tenacious hoove that connects in your foam.  
To pacify lost gardens and for ribbons.  
  
It was the night of the ostrich.  
  
If  
you were not the lemon the original moon  
cooks, sprinkling its sugar across the room.  
My heart moves from being distorted to being resplendent.
