I Have Gone Loitering
---------------------
Your wreath is an acrobat filled  
with oily peace.  
I was without doubt the mother cat  
There in the harsh field.  
When it looked me with its resplendent peace eyes  
it had neither lip nor brow  
but ceramic warmths of your body on its sides.  
If I could crystallize the lineage and the moonlight evening.  
Someone here is waiting for the next soul.  
Wheatfield. You preserved yourself for seizing.  
Once there was a lonely elder who  
carried at parties, sitting in a line segment, among curtains.
