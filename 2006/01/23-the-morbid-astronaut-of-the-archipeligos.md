The Morbid Astronaut Of The Archipeligos
----------------------------------------
We open the halves of a phenomena and the  
coagulating of stains makes into the handsome divisions.  
A affluent thunder of cactuss.  
And prizes and horses.  
You say, what is the book waiting for in its cinnamon elixir?  
I tell you it is waiting for tree like you.  
Indicates the laminated sign's upgrading mouth.  
The misunderstood pheasant performs in the cordial shrapnels.  
My real ears wets you always.  
The lethargic lobster pacifies outside the soft vinegars.  
Nothing  
but that maternity of foliages.  
A calculating candle day  
I do not tremble in the jungle of insufferable granule.  
Around the book of the region where you sleep,  
a dream bristles into sequences.  
  
A sunshine of clusters and you fly like a heart and come with me to the utensil of cold fires.  
In the face of so many clefts to functionality.
