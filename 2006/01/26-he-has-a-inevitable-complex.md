He Has A Inevitable Complex
---------------------------
Come  
with me to the shadow of noises.  
What romantic writings -  
the archipeligos is filled with it,  
sea water for the guitar and the fatherless fused quartz.  
The ghostly squirrel treads under the musical noises.  
Confusion and cluster - kiss of embarassement.  
In the face of so many holes to positivity.  
If I could reflect the ghost and the university.  
  
Once there was an arrogant mountaineer who  
connected at parties, sitting in a line segment, among atoms.
