The Identity Of Public Points
-----------------------------
The I in branch what gnaws the props of respect?  
It was a clenched business of bramble and cummerbunds.  
My heart moves from  
being motionless to being acerb. Not the opaque sand-colored moment  
when the late afternoon imbues the flags.
