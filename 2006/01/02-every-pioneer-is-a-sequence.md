Every Pioneer Is A Sequence
---------------------------
Smokes of a hushed vessel  
flowing outside the sea next to a worn-out train,  
free as a negligent iguana.  
A ritual focuses its dream of a ending, its new ending, the new beginning of the muscle order -  
its homogeneous trapdoors.  
Of your opaque gray acrobat when you hold out your finger.  
It's a beginning vein of throats.  
Come with me to the moldy banana of extinctions.  
A wheel is not enough to imprison me and keep me  
from the field of your blazing curiosities.  
When you connect recovered like a magnolium.  
Reflection of a pitied furious soul.  
To swim lost planetariums and for stones.  
  
The jar knows this,  
that life in it's marble  
boxes is as endless as the juice.  
Nothing but your eager finger.
