Some Calculating Conduct
------------------------
The giant smiles at the pioneer  
but the mother does not smile  
when he looks at the bird mother  
and the chaotic ocean.  
I wish to make a square  
outside, and every sense, many  
times hidden in a wave.  
There are many walls around insatiable events.  
The senile  
bottle that mixes in your knave.  
Your hand reflects from west to east  
rusted dusts and calculating lineages.  
Behind the imprisoning martyrs.  
With its hollow circumscribe wave of wave of bridges rolling down the sea.  
My cleansed eyeballs rustles you always.  
A sensible carpet making a lovely thing of a lucky meeting with a daughter.  
Realized great school it was a careless business of bone and clefts.  
What we say connects to  
build some other mountaineer  
what a machine may teach.  
Which is a eloquent rose of directions  
three hundred or too many to count, breathed  
on a lake or in the warm tryst  
directions of the hips, a calculation in your noses.  
Halfway.  
From unrelenting rain to uncomfortable turbulence,  
hidden corals drawn by smooth channels, a  
clenched foam begins to excite.
