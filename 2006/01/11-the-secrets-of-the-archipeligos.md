The Secrets Of The Archipeligos
-------------------------------
Multitude of energies!  
In and out of the sepia the green and the transparent  
which is a monastic coat of directions  
thousand or  
too many to count, perched  
on a banner or in the musical moon  
directions of the foot, a calculation in your shoulders.  
The praises exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
outside it in darkness.  
There are no complaints but molested cycles of circus and transluscent burnt umber  
echoes of moonlit molested ash.  
A identity returns,  
forces - it does not return.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
  
The mist knows this,  
that life in it's paper-mache boxes is as endless as the salt.  
It is a tale of bruised oxides in the middle of the sea like steel.
