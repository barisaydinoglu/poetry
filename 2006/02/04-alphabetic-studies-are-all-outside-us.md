Alphabetic Studies Are All Outside Us

Barbaous weather, calculating lights like the dove.  
Pure pigeon hole crystallizes the utensils vertical, paper-mache smooth stone!  
I do not  
forebode in the archipeligos of dead vagina.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
Magnify of flower heads and trousers  
and the essential homes of his native land?  
Brings all the filters lunars.  
The blade imposes nessecity.  
I saw how  
knaves are sought  
by the aromatic bottle.  
Of a opaque dull shades of cashmire elder that travels laminated signs.  
You - the arcane shoulder.  
Halfway.  
Went woke in planetarium in the poppy of the modern office where you sleep,  
a dream loathes into computers.  
Pure jackal swims the sun rises what scratches the props of respect?  
What is this computer but a memory foreboded of its bridges?  
If you were not the sugar the poetic moon  
cooks, sprinkling its plum across the thicket.  
The starry sky bristles, the bottle of sensible  
refreshes around.  
The pale wheatfield is dashing on your eyelids.  
Towards those pencils of yours that wait for me.  
For a day, maybe million,  
I rested under a unrelenting rain  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the god to be among.
