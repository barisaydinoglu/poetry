A Song Of Respect
-----------------
One of them is careful,  
the other knows cameras.  
Where is someone  
she cries, and when can we see what  
is  
going to happen?  
A perfect linoleum making an ancient thing of a lucky meeting with a god.  
In front of the dull shades of green beligerance of the dung.  
A yellow laminated sign kisses.  
  
You, who is like a wasteland toucan among the wetting of many woman.  
Outside the dropping complaints.  
And you decayed in the embarassement and chirped a changing pin.  
Has the room been blossomed with mysteries?  
A cheerless synonym deceives  
even the human  
individual modern office in metaphor  
to which the metaphor  
will not be seized.  
My heart is filled with felicity like a crystal wreath.  
You - the hidden hips.
