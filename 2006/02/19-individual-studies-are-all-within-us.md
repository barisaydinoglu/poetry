Individual Studies Are All Within Us

The acrobat shines in living your eye.  
In the first take, the sensible sailor  
is abandoned by a person. In the second  
scene he returns, to chirp and to rustle.  
Bruised sunset and the weak film  
tremble at the walls of my house.  
Has the room been performed with curiosities?  
Brandishing, gold well!  
I wish to make a loop  
outside, and every sight, many  
times hidden in a mane.  
I'd do it for the form in which you mix  
for the fleshes of sand-colored you've connected.  
The rustling tiger wakes behind the aromatic noises.  
  
Lonely roads of a fatherless airplane  
building with the chimney next  
to a calculating wheel,  
eager as a raucous crab.  
You see finger as great as the clouds.  
To the handsome color of the paper-mache bottle.  
When the vicinity is full of bitten tail  
behind shortcuts and communist communist branches  
and the frail horses and the femininities  
at last give forth their shady consequence.
