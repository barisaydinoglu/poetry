The Faltering Of A Mountaineer Down A Divisions
-----------------------------------------------
What we say seeks to  
kiss some other man  
what a detail may teach.  
Bruised sunset and the guilt lake  
puncture at the walls of my house.  
For a day, maybe million,  
I rested under a ray of sunlight  
at a bus stop, waiting for the bride to be outside. As  
soon as the incoming spheres  
gives the minor indication.
