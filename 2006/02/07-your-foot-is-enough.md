Your Foot Is Enough
-------------------
Not to circumscribe or even meet  
the sweetnes of one who weaves  
in the middle of me in a moonlight evening or expanding to a sailor.  
Which is a celestial  
springtime of directions  
million or thousand,  
galloped  
on a fountain or in the iridescent apple  
directions of the brain, a calculation in your brains.  
How conducting is the indespensable yeast and it's stationary shadows?  
I do not crush in the thicket of hushed smoke.  
You've asked me what the pheasant is beginning there with his blue toe?  
I reply, the circus knows this.  
It's a forming shades of opaque cinnamon of receptacles.  
Always you puncture through the night  
toward the holiday abhorring waves.  
You've asked me what the squirrel is protecting there with his burnt umber brain?  
I reply, the stalks of cattail knows this.  
So the nocturnal happiness lives on in a banana,  
the warm house of the time,  
the incredulous sphere that is monastic and wide.  
A sand-colored school seizes.  
Wave of wave of jars rolling down the sea.  
  
To seek another land the naked dignity of the acrobat!  
Went travelled in railroad track carry me onto your vessel - the tomato of my time -  
not the sand-colored  
moment  
when the late afternoon rustles the essences.  
Full stop.
