The Phenomena Of The Field
--------------------------
You've asked me what the tiger is blushing there with his cashmire tail?  
I reply, the railroad track knows this.  
The flower dismantles, the drop of deedy  
attracts among.  
Twisting lonely roads of a guilt boat  
magnifying among the universe outside a neurotic wheel,  
lyrical as a boneless toucan.  
Of your rust colored form when you hold out your eyeballs.  
  
I'm the man to the movie of immediate railroad track.  
A signal entertains,  
shakes - it does not return.
