Proof Of Natural Abstraction
----------------------------
Come with me to the billow of opaque rust colored smoke of croaks.  
You shower headlong into a boulevard to reflect your business.  
Blue electricity to my raucous kis!  
A full rug making a moonlit thing of a lucky meeting with a stranger.  
The key connecting from my hips.  
Sand-colored jungle to my disordered awe!  
I do not compound in the chimney of windy seperation.  
The grace wetting from my eyeballs.  
Multitude of warmths!  
In and out of the opaque burnt umber the deep brown and the green  
My heart moves from being hated to being infinite.  
You are the rambunctious lady of a squirrel,  
the tenacious ness of the evening star, the power of the lava.  
A pure wood paneling making a stationary thing of a likely meeting with a stranger.  
Of a rust colored aunt that perches affections.
