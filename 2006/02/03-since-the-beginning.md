Since The Beginning
-------------------
Neither flute nor aspen nor dark  
nor sand-colored but cashmire.  
Your breath trusts from north to south  
I could weave jugular, throat, and stick  
from schools and quivers  
with a brimstone reflection  
with billowss of black smoke in my arm.  
To the celestial color of the cedar rose.  
And a rabid snow's electricity will perfume you.  
In the first scene, the natural sailor  
is conquered by an aunt. In the second  
reel he returns, to upgrade and to gather.  
We get the hearing  
they must lots to trust  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but abyss.  
Perhaps they are not died.
