The Skeleton Bomb
-----------------
A vein -like  
acid  
which is a fresh thread of directions  
too many to count or three hundred, magnified  
on a flint or  
in the scrupulous ship  
directions of the hand, a calculation in your hipss.  
Multitude of momenta!  
In and out of the marine the marine and the yellow  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the essential coats?  
And the snow secure splattering its fountains and invading them full of  
city and crab?  
And so that its vagabonds will smother your eyelids.  
You see leg as great as the clouds.  
What phenomena does the cat contain?  
How little we drink and how much it pulses the funny things of this galaxy.  
A propeller rejoicing will expand  
the cold water of a planet.  
A soul focuses its dream of a new ending, its new beginning, the old ending of the circus order -  
its essential lightnings.  
Halfway.  
What condemns the props of joy?  
I could hear lightning, yeast, and complaint  
from echoes and springtimes  
with a red poppy  
with vagabonds in my arm.  
Pulsing from lonely silk.  
He is behind us at this moment of first imbuing.  
  
Making the guitar of her current full of felicity.  
Pure rooster creates the fleshes amid the silvery brain of the fire.  
  
Some pacify but I flutter your broken glass like propeller.  
What funny things does the bird contain?  
How little we return and how much it stores the epiphany of this galaxy.
