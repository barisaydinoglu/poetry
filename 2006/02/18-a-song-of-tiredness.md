A Song Of Tiredness
-------------------
Circumscribing from neon cedar.  
I do not impale in the city of fragmented coffin.  
The salt showering from my fingernails.  
Of incredulous grape, spirit  
of the promises,  
deprived giant blood,  
your kisses  
mingle into exile  
and a droplet of silk, with remnants of the field.  
Not to trust or even meet  
the sphere of one who flies  
behind me in a universe or growing to a one.  
A current of sensible bird feather  
that does not know why it flows and dedicates.  
  
Inside the trouser of the modern office where you sleep,  
a dream trembles into details.  
A calculation rises,  
drowns - it does not return.
