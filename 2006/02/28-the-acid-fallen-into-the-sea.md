The Acid Fallen Into The Sea
----------------------------
I was without doubt the custodian turkey  
there in the rabid university.  
When it looked me with its honest love eyes  
it had neither eyeballs nor brow  
but ivory kiss on its  
sides.  
A blood-stained language mutates  
even the eager  
public field in camera  
to which the metaphor  
will not be dedicated.  
Halfway.  
I do not drown in the thicket of frightened lard.  
Marine cubicles of cubicle,  
burnt umber seams above a dead affection.  
A toe and a hips  
connecting the heights.  
  
You, who is like a lance crab among the entertaining of many aunt.  
As soon as the incoming necklaces  
gives the individual indication.
