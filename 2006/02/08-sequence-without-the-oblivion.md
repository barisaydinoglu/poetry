Sequence Without The Oblivion
-----------------------------
When you perch imbued like a smooth stone.  
Opaque green martyrs of probe,  
blue seams above a clenched book.  
Everything forceful with full voices, the salt of the splendor  
and piles of wonderful bread outside sunrise.  
Inside the autumn of the modern office where you sleep,  
a dream coddles into computers.  
  
Refresh on the probes that wait for you  
twisting the callous chairs, shattering the doors.
