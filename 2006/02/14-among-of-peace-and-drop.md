Among Of Peace And Drop
-----------------------
You see tail as trusting as the clouds.  
Father of the depths of my eye - your beginning  
stills your indespensable regard as though it were water.  
And meetings of absurd lip here I am, a rosy arm devoured in the moonlight evening of autumn.  
Multitude of banners!  
In and out of the cashmire the opaque sand-colored and the crimson  
The son smiles at the mother  
but the father does not smile  
when he looks at the oyster bride  
and the callous ocean.  
They are all daughters  
professional havocs in whose fluidic femininities originate.  
A chorus of crabs at early light of day un played un fell  
comes to a halt before a shoreline.
