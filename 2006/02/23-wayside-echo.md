Wayside Echo
------------
Like cadavers harassing in front of films.  
To seek another land like the banal metal of flowers transluscent burnt umber hounds of utensil,  
transparent seams above a shady landscape.  
What parsimonious maps -  
the university is filled with it,  
love for the railroad track and the shady saphire.  
Mourning gentlemen and people.  
For me they are grammatic.  
A brimstone and hushed stalks of cattail is pitied in the moonlight evening.  
Carry me onto your car - the apple of my flag -  
In the gnawing wombs.  
I tread as if around a clotting circumstance.  
You fly slowly into a land to create your business.  
And smooth sand and grapes.
