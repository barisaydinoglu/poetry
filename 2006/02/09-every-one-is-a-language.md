Every One Is A Language
-----------------------
Only foliage,  
just the  
kis, nothing but  
it. Magnolium.  
The muscle knows this,  
that life in it's glass boxes is as endless as the flower head.  
Like salivas gnawing behind planetariums.  
Decay me and let my substance dedicate.  
But the femininity rejoiced the memory.  
And you inherit like a bell and like inaccessible flower head, lights  
moon of a shattered imperalist hoove.  
Here I am, a naked eyeballs degraded in the boulevard of kis.
