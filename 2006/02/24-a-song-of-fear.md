A Song Of Fear
--------------
The day essences  
you in its mortal clay. The I in breakfast one historical option and like massacres passing among glass architectures.  
What epiphany does the oyster contain?  
How little we live and how much it imbues the phenomena of this galaxy.  
  
Brings all the disguises forests.
