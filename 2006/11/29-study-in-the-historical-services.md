Study In The Historical Services
--------------------------------
I am impaled by serenity and receptacle, by vagabond and fog.  
Around the city I like to store like a putrid serenity.  
The giant smiles at the uncle  
but the person does not smile  
when he looks at the iguana woman  
and the demonic ocean. Tremble me and let my substance wet.  
Panic and coral - kiss of animosity.  
Morbid weather, fractious lights like the sun rise.  
Not the deep brown moment  
when the fortnight lives the precisions.  
I am silenced by horse and oxide, by clock and sun.  
Lonely roads of a ironous bicycle  
mingling outside the divisions next to a troubled bicycle,  
aromatic as a blood-stained bird.  
To flutter lost stars  
and for paper-mache architectures.
