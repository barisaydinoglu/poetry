And outside my hammock, during the early light of day, I woke up naked  
and full of purity.  
Not storing is a form of discovering.  
A circle inside a line segment,  
the boneless workings of round law.  
Wave of wave of bird feathers rolling down the sea.  
Closed off and pulled out like a ribbon.  
Like lethargic thread, lemons  
they died it with boneless laminated signs.  
  
The I in aspen one slightest option and and meetings of rotten arm my heart is filled with love like a paper-mache hat.  
A lunar divulging will promise  
the oily heat of a planet.
