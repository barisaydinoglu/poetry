From What Are Flower Heads Fashioned
------------------------------------
A circle around a line,  
the obscene workings of poetic law.  
One neutral option and you are the shaken aunt of a jaguar,  
the fuming ness of the movie, the power of the water.  
My spacious hips protects you always.  
Of your dark star when you hold out your eyelids.  
Within the dark sorrow of the vagina.  
Like the violenet ash of knaves love.
