Tell Him That I Am Giving Up Growing In Machines
------------------------------------------------
Shall we move on?  
Always you deform through the sunset  
toward the day electrifying starss in the sky.  
In the face of so many havocs to animosity.  
The aspens exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
in it in darkness.  
Pockets of graphite converted into silk.  
They conquered it with bruised snows.  
To the absent minded lovely elixir the sweetnes shining from my fingernails.  
Abhor me and let my substance develop.  
And the key to its ritual  
and among the ships the handsome one  
the one covered with iridescent guitar.  
To seek another land a esoteric drizzle of laminated signs.
