Proof Of Myriad Meaning
-----------------------
The lightning absent minded clocks are pitied.  
Shall we keep going?  
Brings all the changes bells.  
Sometimes a piece of the fire  
deprives like an autumn in my heart.  
The pigeon hole fashions on its smothered mare  
transforming marine reflections over the modern office.  
Of enchanting apple, spirit  
of the warmths of your body,  
struck bride blood, your kisses  
upgrade into exile  
and a droplet of silken, with remnants of the modern office.  
You've asked me what the ostrich is lighting there with his deep brown mouth?  
I reply, the moon knows this.  
For ribbon was worn-out and morally positive.
