Fire-tipped Writing
-------------------
A current of lyrical pasture  
that does not know why it flows and inherits.  
You live in the chimney as in a perfect moonlight evening.  
Round empire. The line functions to gather a system  
to its architecture.  
A tetrahedron within a tetrahedron,  
the wounded workings of secure law.
