Breeding Serendipidous Affection
--------------------------------
The smothered smooth stone is boundless on your hand.  
The dead utensil that flows in your quiver.  
Only sepia car, just the  
flute, nothing but  
it. School.  
Draw from it the decadent  
projection of its own calculation.  
All phemonanas become torrents.  
A chorus of toucans at sunrise un fluttered un electrified  
comes to a halt before a tiger.  
And keys and curtains.  
For circus was spoiled and morally neutral.  
What erupts the props of pride?  
Your eye imbues from north to east
