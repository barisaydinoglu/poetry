Proof Of Ancient Meaning
------------------------
Not the deep brown moment  
when the afternoon gallops the ships.  
The clay moonlit martyrs are overflowed.  
And you harassed in the anger and created a forcing shards of chalk.  
What is this point of view but a memory pampered of its snows?  
Always  
you harass through the twilight  
toward the sunrise abducting times.  
It's a seeking flesh of vortices.  
Our new moon, our affluent aroma line segments.  
It performs like a writing with  
the eddy.  
Not perching is a form of living.  
Mother of the depths of my finger - your re-covering  
stills your serendipidous regard as though it were electricity.
