Everything Is A Algorithmic Issue
---------------------------------
What throttles the props of honor?  
So the sanguine pride lives on in a lemon,  
the smooth house of the juice,  
the natural coral that is enchanting and arcane.  
The enchanting dignity of the banner!  
A chorus of toucans at afternoon un perfumed un electrified  
comes to a halt before a horse.  
A point of view for phenomenon is the lack thereof.  
From pillow of fog to tornado,  
hidden doors drawn by somber channels, a  
lonely muscle begins to rescue.  
Because I love you, love, with the mud and around the jungle.  
Friendship was no longer above the transmission threshold.  
Pockets of sand converted into copper.  
Pure  
pamphlet kisses the starry skies as soon as the incoming  
drops  
gives the alphabetic indication.  
Burnt umber lightning to my browbeaten energy!  
The day flowers you in its mortal wind.  
  
Grace was no longer above the transmission threshold.  
Wave of wave of muscles rolling down the sea.  
  
Be guided by the full prize's poppy.  
With sunburst orange water and crimson pastures.  
Crimson and decisive cousin,  
my heart moves from being hated to being soft.
