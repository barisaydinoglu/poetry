A Song Of Panic
---------------
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the romantic landscapes?  
And the clouds promising splattering its  
currents and sobbing them full of  
university and ostrich?  
Refreshing a forest  
awakened in the parenthetical wind.  
The I in jar deep brown jungle to my sterile flag!  
I want you to seize on my shoulder.  
The rooster imposes nessecity.  
Only miracle, just the  
ritual, nothing but  
it. Grape.  
As soon as the incoming bells  
gives the historical indication.  
Burnt umber probes of wounded soldier,  
sunburst orange seams above a frightened candle.  
In the middle of the bitterest vicinity  
of harsh  
sun.  
If I could upgrade the violence and the universe.  
The horses exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
outside it in darkness.  
  
Drinking from shady gem.  
Some store but I rustle your salt like coat.  
Carry me onto your bicycle - the mango of my kiss -  
you see breath as nocturnal as the fog.  
To seek another land you magnify in the university as in a romantic land.
