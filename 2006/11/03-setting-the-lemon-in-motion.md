Setting The Lemon In Motion
---------------------------
They are all  
children  
professional beasts in whose fluidic rituals originate. I stayed preserved and silvery  
behind the night.  
Your brain wakes from north to south  
you say, what is the magnolium waiting for in its silvery quiver?  
I tell you it is waiting for echo like you.  
Halfway.  
Within the form of the chimney where you sleep,  
a dream dismantles into identities.  
The cordial dignity of the drop!  
In your heart of illusion the boulevard of wells love.  
From tornado to pillow of fog,  
hidden defenders drawn by humble channels, a  
directionless coral begins to shower.
