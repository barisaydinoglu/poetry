Here I Rise You
---------------
In your brain of smearing the modern  
office begins to dream of rising.  
A loaf of bread baked with hushed purity and salt.  
The parsimonious railroad track gave it respect.  
I could live viola, moth, and wounded soldier  
from lights and rivers  
with a blood colored stars in the sky  
with blades in my nose.  
The reasons for my respect  
are transformed in my eyelids of cedar.  
I'd do it for the yellow lake in which you trust  
for the goblets of cinnamon you've fluttered.  
A leg and a eyelids  
rejoicing the night.  
Inside the bitter sea of raucous smooth ash.  
Around the region I like to understand like a tenacious heart.  
Here I am, a enchanting leg soddened in the modern office of autumn.  
To the soft color of the paper-mache wave.  
I do not imprison in the moonlight evening of rustling blood.  
My  
heart moves from being spoiled to being blazing.  
Everything lethargic with homogeneous voices, the salt of the praise  
and piles of free bread around day.  
A river bank focuses its dream of a old ending, its new beginning, the beginning of the planetarium order -  
its sensible sticks.  
And breakfasts and writings.  
Our new femininity, our round thread loops.  
  
Only smooth stone, just the  
door,  
nothing but  
it. Tree.  
Nothing but that femininity of rivers.  
  
In my modern office at day you are like a muscle  
and your form and colour the way I weave them.  
So the promising sincerity lives on in a mango,  
the fresh house of the heart,  
the clear planetarium that is fluidic and soft.  
A enchanting clouds of foams.
