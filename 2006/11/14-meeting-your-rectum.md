Meeting Your Rectum
-------------------
I want you to grow on my eyeballs.  
There are no shortcuts but tremulous cycles of current and burnt umber  
momenta of winged neurotic ash.  
The crooked writing that chirps in your green car.  
Of infinite grape, spirit  
of the guitars,  
fell elder blood, your kisses  
preserve into exile  
and a droplet of crystal, with remnants of the jungle.  
What is this synonym but a memory lunged of its trysts?  
Once there was a hairy giant who  
formed at parties, sitting in a triangle, among trees.  
Serendipidous, silken elixir!  
And a callous flute's fire will relinquish you.  
  
Grace was no longer right at the transmission threshold.  
Wave of wave of saxophones rolling down the sea.
