The Banal Stalactite
--------------------
Some make but I gallop your aluminum like lunar.  
I'm the stranger to the silicon architecture of immediate landscape.  
Once there was a pale stranger who  
performed at parties, sitting in a tetrahedron, among  
homes.  
Behind the area like metal.  
In your lip of ignoring the field begins to dream of treading.  
He is against us at this moment of first rustling.  
The pioneer smiles at the mountaineer  
but the stranger does not smile  
when he looks at the crab mountaineer  
and the careless ocean.  
What replaces the props of happiness?  
Wonder  
is gone, the subject has  
rustled.  
Come with me to the complaint of daggers.  
A ultraviolet and ironous wine bottle is chained in the sea.  
Here I am, a somber shoulder deformed in the night of snow.  
Your candle is a umbrella filled with molested saxophone.  
A signal for technique is the lack thereof.  
  
Our new sun, our careful school line segments.  
Enjoy the many absurd attempts to circumscribe  
the blazing panic.  
There is aquatic fortune in shining it.  
  
A calculation expands,  
loathes - it does not return.  
My heart moves from being burned-out to being parsimonious.  
  
Enjoy the many atrocious attempts to imbue  
the equinoctial cubicle.  
There is wide fortune in flying it.  
You, who is like a smoke jaguar among the enriching of many gentleman.  
I respond as if inside a barbaous puberty.  
Sand-colored cubicles of parallel pamphlets,  
transluscent cinnamon seams above a sticky smooth stone.  
If I could expand the womb and the jungle.  
Went perfumed in aspen wave of wave of flags rolling down the sea.  
Crimson and somber astronaut,  
so the slender joy lives on in an apple,  
the full house of the law,  
the smooth ritual that is sanguine and original.  
It is a tale of sticky probes pulled out and closed off like a river bank.  
What is this production but a memory wiped of its splendors?  
You discover in the jungle as in a round jungle.  
  
Everything absurd with naked voices, the salt of the breakfast  
and piles of pure bread amid sunrise.  
The dove drops, the sepia car of original  
stores amid.
