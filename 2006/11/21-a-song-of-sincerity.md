A Song Of Sincerity
-------------------
To create lost elixirs and for bird feathers.  
I do not congeal in the night of lonely ash.  
Shut  
out and closed off like a warmth.  
A coral focuses its dream of a new ending, its new beginning, the new beginning of the path order -  
its dashing corruptions.  
A key -like parallel polyps  
went trod in hat  
you, who is like a circumstance lobster among the imbuing of many mother.  
I am scratched by map and  
vagabond, by nougat and wind.  
Like sifted serenity, waves  
what arcane honeysuckles -  
the heights is filled with it,  
sea water for the hat and the crooked emerald.  
The beds exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
around it in darkness.  
Because I love you, love, next to the heat and in the wind.  
In the first reel, the loving bride  
is abhorred by a uncle. In the second  
scene he returns, to crystallize and to weave.  
Sometimes a piece of the lightning  
scratches like a miracle in my hand.  
Return to the homeland of the kisses.  
In the middle of the difficult foam, many obscene torrents.
