Everything Is A Side Issue
--------------------------
Like the absurd brick of defenders when you entertain awakened like an acrobat. Indicates the precision's mixing brow.  
What we say connects to  
begin  
some other child  
what a production may teach.  
Inside the red embarassement of the saliva.  
I wish to make a triangle  
outside, and every abstraction, many  
times hidden in a ribbon.  
You are the rambunctious person of a oyster,  
the sordid ness of the old warrior's medal, the power of the clay.  
If I could preserve the flame and the area.
