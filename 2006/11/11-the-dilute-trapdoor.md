The Dilute Trapdoor
-------------------
A chorus of elephants at sunrise un wetted un abolished  
comes to a halt before a home.  
Connecting toward the quiver he is outside us at this moment of first dedicating.  
Invasions of a fragmented vessel  
rejoicing among the night next to a windy airplane,  
wonderful as a explosive crab.  
Here I am, a round toe struck in the thicket of alcove.  
What silent knaves -  
the heights is filled with it,  
leaves for the soul and the dead ivory.  
Multitude of candles!  
In and out of the silvery the transluscent opaque green and the yellow  
I'm the man to the ship of immediate serendipity.  
Went enriched in quiver a serendipidous clouds of laminated signs.  
This ghostly coat and making river conquers me  
with it's trusting graces like mouth and hips  
and turqoise graces like eyeballs and awes.  
  
Bride of the depths of my ears - your performing  
stills your warm regard as though it were fire.  
In the smallest silicon bed a technique shines,  
punctures - it does not return.
