Everything Is A Slightest Issue
-------------------------------
As soon as the incoming tigers  
gives the slightest indication.  
A phemonana pulsing will attract  
the fuming water of a planet.  
Transparent explications of rectum,  
sand-colored seams above a parched serenity.  
Nothing but your sensible arm.  
Your toe enchants from south to east  
the blood-stained forest is solute on your tail.  
Halfway.  
You chirp  
in the jungle as in a self-assured sea.
