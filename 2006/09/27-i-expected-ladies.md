I Expected Ladies
-----------------
A tetrahedron outside a line,  
the barbaous workings of comfortable law. Not performing is a form of refreshing.  
Only telegraph, just the  
saxophone, nothing but  
it.  
Flower head.  
Next to the time of the city where you sleep,  
a dream  
filters into phenomena.  
Not awakening is a form of flowing.  
Respect is gone, the subject has travelled.
