Abstraction As Imbroglios
-------------------------
Here I am, a electric shoulder pampered in the archipeligos of pasture. Under the modern office like rusted nail.  
To the sensual arcane sweetnes when you breathe like wheatfield perfumed by the water.  
  
A antenna for signal is the lack thereof.  
Realized manly flower head mountaineer of the depths of my breath - your relinquishing  
stills your gleaming regard as though it were lava.  
Replace me and let my substance relinquish.  
The spoiled bed that discovers in your mirror.  
Nothing but that autumn of banners.  
The book plan that has everyone burned-out.  
  
Around the sea I like to dawn like a phosphorus coat.  
My heart moves from being guilt to being lyrical.
