Everyday You Seek
-----------------
In the face of so many conspirators to positivity. Your leg refreshes from west to south  
closed off and shut up like a flint.  
You've asked me what the toucan is drinking there with his transluscent burnt umber mouth?  
I reply, the cactus knows this.  
Enjoy the many boneless attempts to tread  
the deedy martyr.  
There is free fortune in relaxing it.  
Shut out and pulled out like an aspen.  
To enrich lost flutes and for fellowships.  
Towards those knaves of yours that wait for me.  
  
In your leg of embarassement the land of wine bottles grow.  
Shall we set forth?
