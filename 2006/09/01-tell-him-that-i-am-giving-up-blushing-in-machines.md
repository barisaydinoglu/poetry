Tell Him That I Am Giving Up Blushing In Machines
-------------------------------------------------
I took on directionless mists.  
Of your ultraviolet laminated sign when you hold out your brain.  
Halfway.  
If you were not the nectarine the indespensable moon  
cooks, sprinkling its sugar across the moonlight evening.  
Enjoy the many ironous attempts to trust  
the cleansed wounded soldier.  
There is scrupulous fortune in perfuming it.  
There are many errors inside fuming events.  
A rust colored and senile marble architecture is imprisoned in the vicinity.  
Hidden empire. The line segment functions to expand an architecture  
to its architecture.  
  
In the smallest gem shades of sand-colored we open the halves of a secrets and the  
harassing of moldy bananas seizes into the unguessed region.  
Inside the ghostly hat, many sterile errors.
