The Tremulous Bride Of The City
-------------------------------
Neither tree nor film nor turqoise  
nor transluscent cashmire but sepia.  
We get the sight  
they must lots to tread  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but daggers.  
Perhaps they are not rejected.  
You see lip as wide as the rain.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
recover of mists and times  
and the full fellowships of his native land?  
I want you to gallop on my hand.  
The brutal forest that weaves in your cinnamon car.  
Brings all the falters doves.  
Our new cactus, our cordial cathedral loops.
