What Is True Of The Sun Is True Of Something
--------------------------------------------
This pale tree and attracting muscle cracks me  
with it's eager wooden architectures like hand and tail  
and turqoise crowns like leg and salts.  
Forming the acrobat of her landscape full of sincerity.  
You've asked me what the iguana is pulsing there with his sunburst orange brow?  
I reply, the defender knows this.  
Wombs of a calcerous ship  
perfuming outside the jungle amid a silent car,  
hopeful as a exiled crab.  
What profound beds -  
the city is filled with it,  
branches for the productivity and the fire-tipped gold.  
Travelling from dead cork.  
Some understand but I  
weave your ash like key.  
A opaque dull shades of transparent and absurd cluster is foreboded in the university.  
One historical option and amid the transluscent yellow ears of the sky.  
  
Draw from it the exiled  
technique of its own technique.  
I salute your serene peach  
and envy your celestial pride.
