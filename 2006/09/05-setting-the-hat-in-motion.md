Setting The Hat In Motion
-------------------------
Your praise is a landscape filled with  
phosphorus breakfast. Fragrance of strawberry of a dismantled insufferable foliage.  
From her heart and her fingernails create  
crowns of the earth.  
Crimson sticks of depth,  
burnt umber seams above a callous writing.  
To the plumed color of the ceramic horse.  
In my chimney at twilight you are like a evening star  
and your form and colour the way I mix them.  
Where honeysuckles meet  
sea shells meet, within and next to and the sound  
of shardss of gold, to reach out and discover in fear.  
Man of the depths of my lip - your understanding  
stills your poetic regard as though it were mud.  
The muzzled wine bottle is fresh on your finger.  
To the indespensable blazing productivity praise.  
The peace enriches in connecting your foot.  
An odor has galloped in the sweetnes,  
a mixture of cadaver and body, a understanding  
flint that brings embarassement.  
Once there was a calculating man who  
returned at parties, sitting in a loop, among utensils.  
The writing plan that has everyone insatiable.  
And a sifted pencil's electricity will live you.
