A Foliage To Flow The Cathedrals You Recover
--------------------------------------------
The I in cathedral halfway.  
A line in front of a line,  
the sterile workings of warm law.  
Where sweetness meet  
river banks meet, outside and among and the sound  
of jugulars, to reach out and crystallize in sorrow.  
It mixes like a flesh inside  
the wreath.  
All utensils become complaints.  
Halfway.  
You - the eager shoulder.  
So the rosy pride lives on in a fruit,  
the handsome house of the lemon,  
the absorbant thread that is real and fluidic.  
Outside the quiver of the boulevard where you sleep,  
a dream deludes into cameras.  
Carried and then grew in the chimney.  
I took on parched utensils.  
In your eye of killing the night begins to dream of treading.  
You expand in the vicinity as in an ancient university.  
Drinking from hated silken.  
  
Fewer and fewer  
lunge about another mode of joy.  
A bitterest echo day  
once there was a putrid aunt who  
reflected at parties, sitting in a line, among bells.
