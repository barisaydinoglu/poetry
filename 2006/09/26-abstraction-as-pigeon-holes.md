Abstraction As Pigeon Holes
---------------------------
A profound linoleum making a careful thing of a chance meeting with a mother.  
We open the halves of a funny things and the  
mourning of lances treads into the irreducable room.  
All sun rises become pamphlets.  
And meetings of calculating curves a dull shades of marine and muzzled mist is soddened in the chimney.  
One of them is deedy,  
the other knows phenomena.  
Where is everybody  
he cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
One of them is indespensable,  
the other knows details.  
Where is someone  
he says, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
  
She is in the middle of us at this moment of first responding.  
My full hips crystallizes you always.
