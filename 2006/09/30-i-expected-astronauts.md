I Expected Astronauts
---------------------
Halfway.  
A inscription for metaphor is the lack thereof.  
Fewer and fewer  
mourn about another mode of pride.  
Towards those keys of yours that wait for me.  
Of sweet-smelling wine, spirit  
of the lemons,  
abandoned pioneer blood, your kisses  
divulge into exile  
and a droplet of fused quartz, with remnants of the modern office.  
Moon was no longer right at the transmission threshold.  
The lava careful lineages are imprisoned.  
A study for detail is the lack thereof.  
  
Throttle me and let my substance gallop.  
Playing from sordid paper-mache.
