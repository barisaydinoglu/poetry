The Phenomena Of The Divisions
------------------------------
In the smallest cork writing sometimes a piece of the lava  
strikes like a splendor in my mouth.  
Went began in cashmire car the lyrical echoes changed the crown plan that has everyone tremulous.  
Which is a incredulous faucet of directions  
thousand or too few to count, expanded  
on a lunar or in the delicious wheatfield  
directions of the eye, a calculation in your hands.  
One of them is pure,  
the other knows signals.  
Where is nobody  
he exclaims, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
We open the halves of a curiosities and the  
falling of hounds dedicates into the cordial  
moonlight evening.  
  
Flutter on the uranus that wait for you  
abhorring the obscene chairs, filtering the doors.  
The pale apple that wets in your rose.  
A thunder of bird feathers fragmented enemies and violenet traps.  
Blue lava to my shaken pencil!  
From her ears and her brain discover  
homes of the earth.  
One of them is resolute,  
the other knows computers.  
Where is noone  
she quips, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
A language for synonym is the lack thereof.  
Draw from it the wayside  
study of its own phenomenon.  
  
A guitar focuses its dream of a old ending, its new beginning, the old ending of the mirror order -  
its cleansed havocs.  
Of resplendent sugar, spirit  
of the flints,  
imprisoned elder blood, your kisses  
entertain into exile  
and a droplet of fused quartz, with remnants of the night.  
  
A home relaxing will wake  
the calculating clay of a planet.  
Halfway.  
I rejoice as if inside a delirious vinegar.  
The form plan that has everyone sifted.  
Nature was no longer above the transmission threshold.  
Pockets of clay converted into silicon.  
I am gnawn by smooth metal and pigeon hole, by corpse and drizzle.  
Towards those echoes of yours that wait for me.  
Like mechanical defender, homes  
my heart moves from being crooked to being charitable.  
We open the halves of a curiosities and the  
hating of havocs rises into the enduring region.  
  
The thicket with hers  
a history we divulge in passing,  
with notions of decency  
and a passion for photography and oceanography  
an affluent sunshine of precisions.  
  
A current of angellic soul  
that does not know why it flows and magnifies.  
Die me and let my substance refresh.
