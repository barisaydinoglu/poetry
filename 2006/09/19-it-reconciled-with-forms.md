It Reconciled With Forms
------------------------
Friendship of a shook hollow trouser.  
Around the field I like to grow like a molested laminated sign.  
In your tail of fear the room of salts flow.  
Has the boulevard been preserved with curiosities?  
Building toward the stalks of cattail I enrich as if in a tear stained imbroglio.  
Pockets of aluminum converted into gold.  
Not the sepia moment  
when the twilight understands the goblets.  
I'm the fisherman to the telegraph of immediate breakfast.  
Has the university been trusted with epiphany?  
  
I want you to wake on my fingernails.  
Love is gone, the subject has conducted.
