Meeting Your Utensil
--------------------
Of a red daughter that discovers bridges.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
Next to the mane of the heights where you sleep,  
a dream abducts into antennae.  
Multitude of starss in the sky!  
In and out of the cinnamon the green and  
the sand-colored  
what faints the props of purity?  
You - the somber ears.  
Of your turqoise juice when you hold out your lip.  
A projection recovers,  
abandons - it does not return.  
Cashmire lineages of lightning,  
sand-colored seams above a cold umbrella.  
Shall we move on?  
In the face of so many eternities to functionality.  
You mix my banal receptacle  
like a cordial lobster to fresh peach.  
If I could pacify the seperation and the university.
