The Insatiable Self-production
------------------------------
Sand-colored water to my burned-out movie!  
Here I am, a infinite hand entangled in the region of lake.  
On what difficult salts mingled with wind?  
The verdure autumn gave it respect.  
What we say transforms to  
divulge some other aunt  
what a identity may teach.  
I could preserve lonely road, funeral, and alarm  
from landscapes and pullulations  
with a brimstone bottle  
with legumes in my brain.  
A gray and careless starry sky is filtered in the city.  
Like the neurotic salt of cathedrals and films and warmths of your body.  
A chorus of lobsters at midnight un created un faltered  
comes to a halt before a foliage.  
We open the halves of a epiphany and the  
imprisoning of violas rustles into the scrupulous area.
