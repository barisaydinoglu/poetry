There Is No Trapdoor
--------------------
What is this technique but a memory abolished  
of its clusters?  
I want you to awaken on my curves.  
There are no moths but rustling cycles of acrobat and yellow  
droplets of warm motionless clay.  
The homes exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
in it in darkness.  
And beds and muscles.  
Kiss.  
Halfway.  
Outside marine water and cinnamon miracles.  
The tryst treading from my eyelids.  
To the loving color  
of the saphire starlight.  
In the chaining cities.  
Once  
there was a wayside custodian who  
gathered at parties, sitting in a loop, among flutes.  
Here I am, a slender brow scratched in the moonlight evening of flute.
