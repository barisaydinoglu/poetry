Sight As Phlegms
----------------
Inside the dull shades of sepia beligerance of the extinction. Our new flute, our celestial horse circles.  
To reconcile lost sea's skins and for ripples.  
What condemns the props of sincerity?  
Nobody here is waiting for the next splendor.  
Warmth of your body. You conducted yourself for living.
