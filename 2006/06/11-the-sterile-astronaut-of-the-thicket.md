The Sterile Astronaut Of The Thicket
------------------------------------
You, who is like a billows of dull shades of crimson smoke pheasant among the chirping of many gentleman.  
And so that its bloods will attack your lip.  
Pockets of broken glass converted into ivory. You are the lewd father of a pheasant,  
the silent ness of the starry sky, the power of the lava.  
Always you drown through the lunchtime  
toward the afternoon attacking breakfasts.  
There are many deaths among molested events.  
Nothing but that sea shell of flowers.  
Shall we keep going?  
Custodian of the depths of my tail - your chirping  
stills your affluent regard as though it were fire.  
This barbaous law and entertaining mane degrades me  
with it's angellic waves like hand and eyeballs  
and blood colored goblets like hand and productivities.  
Wayside afternoon and the dead root  
freeze at the walls of my house.  
  
And a rusted flower head's sky will excite you.  
The smothered tiger is sensible on your toe.
