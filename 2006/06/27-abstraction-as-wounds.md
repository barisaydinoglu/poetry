Abstraction As Wounds
---------------------
The enduring dignity of the sphere!  
In your lip of killing the university begins to dream of understanding.  
The fresh gentleman  
drinks in the resplendent morning.  
In the smallest paper-mache silence the shady elephant blushes in the middle of the esoteric probes.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
crystallize of peaces and promises  
and the aromatic banners of his native land?  
Outside the rust colored agony of the nail.  
I'm the child to the mane of immediate autumn.  
They bristled it with sifted honeysuckles.  
Only demonic and to a  
pioneer they take on time, three hundred years  
what lunges the props of pride?  
From pillow of fog to blade of grass,  
hidden necklaces drawn by sensual channels, a  
rigid bird feather begins to appreciate.  
Wave of wave of films rolling down the sea.  
The telegraph plan that has everyone forceful.  
Halfway.  
Pure invasion crystallizes the precisions we open the halves of a epiphany and the  
fainting of vaginas wakes into the iridescent field.  
Nothing  
but your affluent brow.  
I stayed mixed and cashmire  
behind the modern office.  
But  
I should be untrue  
to photography, striking among its boneless jars  
so let us begin to tell a story without algorithmic redundancies.  
You are the tomato of my atrocious brow.  
  
I stayed gathered and green  
under the area.  
A image rescues,  
replaces - it does not return.
