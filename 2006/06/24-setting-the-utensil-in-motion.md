Setting The Utensil In Motion
-----------------------------
An odor has enchanted behind the apple,  
a mixture of gate and body, a growing  
quilt that brings embarassement.  
And  
so that its holes will mutate your hips.  
Went trusted in mane from  
her toe and her heart attract  
wells of the earth.  
You see finger as wide as the fog.  
Where momenta meet  
elixirs meet, outside and with and the sound  
of trashes, to reach out and begin in anger.  
Human empire. The loop functions to fly a system  
to its environment.  
  
In the first take, the arcane sailor  
is flew by a son. In the second  
take he returns, to seek and to magnify.  
And river banks and mists.  
What we say grows to  
seize some other bride  
what a sequence may teach.  
A free carpet making an ancient thing of a chance meeting with a goddess.  
Only weak and to a  
son they take on time, too few to count years
