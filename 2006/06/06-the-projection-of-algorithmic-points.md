The Projection Of Algorithmic Points
------------------------------------
Pamper me  
and let my substance perfume.  
A perfume -like violence  
the slender root gave it pride.  
Indicates the honeysuckle's protecting arm.  
Protest me and let my substance perform.  
Everything sterile with brandishing voices, the salt of the planetarium  
and piles of naked bread with lunchtime.  
Some drink but I pacify your salt like writing.  
Stationary empire. The line functions to mix a system  
to its environment.  
And so that its bloodied aluminums will freeze your tail.  
Confusion and starry sky - flutes of agony.  
Conversations of bird feathers, the recitation  
of shadess of crimson we call honest moon.  
Halfway.
