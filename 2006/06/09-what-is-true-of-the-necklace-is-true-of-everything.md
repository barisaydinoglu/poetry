What Is True Of The Necklace Is True Of Everything

In the first scene, the friendly father  
is protested by a god. In the second  
scene he returns, to rescue and to live.  
I saw how paths are returned  
by the arcane fellowship.  
Like bloods dismantling next to threads.  
And you congealed in the confusion and chirped a degrading receptacle.  
Full stop.  
And inside my hammock, during the night, I woke up naked  
and full of tiredness.
