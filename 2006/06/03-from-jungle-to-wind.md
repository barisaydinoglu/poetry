From Jungle To Wind
-------------------
The order of the pencils come with me to the bone of lonely roads.  
A pullulation focuses its dream of a old ending, its beginning, the new beginning of the quiver order -  
its wide violences.  
I do not die in the chimney of troubled wall.  
Which is a deedy poppy of directions  
three hundred or twenty-seven, travelled  
on a movie or in the electric starry sky  
directions of the tail, a calculation in your eyelidss.  
Only dove, just the  
horse, nothing  
but  
it. Promise.  
A current of soft land  
that does not know why it flows and dedicates.  
The handsome hooves twisted rustling a nature  
promised in the full snow.
