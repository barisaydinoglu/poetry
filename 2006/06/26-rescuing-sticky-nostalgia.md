Rescuing Sticky Nostalgia
-------------------------
Opaque green howls of jugular,  
sepia seams above a phosphorus movie.  
Rustling astronauts and custodians.  
For me they are public.  
Of a red cousin that blossoms quivers.  
To attract lost windows and for corals.  
Outside the jungle like brick.  
Brings all the wets flags.  
Halfway.  
Everything dry with stationary voices, the salt of the fountain  
and piles of eloquent bread in sunset.  
You've asked me what the elephant is divulging there with his blue eyelids?  
I reply, the grape knows this.  
Our new elixir, our resolute candle triangles.  
And you stand like a wave and in my sea at sunrise you are like a flint  
and your form and colour the way I discover them.  
Silvery and moonlit child,  
Your ears circumscribes from south to north  
and a furious coral's water will protect you.  
On what absurd stenches chirped with sky?
