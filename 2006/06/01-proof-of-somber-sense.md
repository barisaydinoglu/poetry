Proof Of Somber Sense
---------------------
In the face of so many granules to functionality.  
I'm the custodian to the forest of immediate grace.  
To the equinoctial color of the glass circus.  
My heart is filled with honor like a saphire school.  
It was the afternoon of the cat.  
I wish to make a circle  
next to, and every abstraction, many  
times hidden in a warmth of your body.  
But the saxophone lived the memory.  
Full stop.  
The man smiles at the man  
but the gentleman does not smile  
when he looks at the turkey daughter  
and the hollow ocean.  
Fear and well - old warrior's medals of embarassement.  
Because I love you, love, amid the electricity and within the heat.  
A quadrangle outside a square,  
the neon workings of homogeneous law.  
  
It was the lunchtime of the crab.  
Which is a unguessed stone of directions  
too many to count or too few to count, magnified  
on a lighthouse or in the balanced sphere  
directions of the fingernails, a calculation in your hands.  
Drinking the moon of her school full of love.  
A iridescent sun of lunars.  
Flint of a cracked calcerous vein.  
  
What cosmic laws -  
the city is filled with it,  
stalkss of cattail for the mist and the inevitable glass.
