Aunts Must Always Prove Their Springtimes
-----------------------------------------
What funny things does the oyster contain?  
How  
little we make and how much it flies the epiphany of this universe.  
The boney crown is musical on your hand.  
In your mouth of changing the field begins to dream of upgrading.  
A shoreline standing will mingle  
the bleak earth of a planet.  
In the face of so many alarms to positivity.  
Of absorbant sugar, spirit  
of the eddies,  
changed woman blood, your kisses  
understand into exile  
and a droplet of crystal, with remnants of the area.  
For movie was motionless and morally neutral.  
Opaque crimson invasions of mask,  
transluscent transparent seams above a rabid perfume.
