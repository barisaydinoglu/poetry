Sense Is An Episode Of Acid
---------------------------
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
weave of sweetness and friendships  
and the changeless laws of his native  
land?  
A rain of lunars a metaphor lights,  
harasses - it does not return.  
Bitterest complaints and brutal blades.  
I took on demonic flints.  
Around the universe I like to expand like a directionless quilt.  
Sometimes a piece of the fire  
forebodes like a wreath in  
my eyeballs.  
The shady flint is parsimonious on your brain.  
You, who is like a flask ostrich among the pacifying of many son.  
Uncle of the depths of my heart - your gathering  
stills your enduring regard as though it were wind.  
A loaf of bread baked with tenacious happiness and salt.  
Enjoy the many phosphorus attempts to refresh  
the trusting ash.  
There is changeless fortune in creating it.  
And a shady banner's lava will transform you.  
Discovering from whirlwinds of silk.
