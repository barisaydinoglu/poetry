Color As Trash Barges
---------------------
For a day, maybe three hundred,  
I rested under a unrelenting rain  
at a post office, waiting for the astronaut to be outside.  
Against the city like iron.  
A chorus of squirrels at lunchtime un drank un changed  
comes to a halt before a sea water.  
Brings all the coagulates phemonanas.  
Halfway.  
Enjoy the many tremulous attempts to rise  
the blazing croak.  
There is natural fortune in galloping it.  
I stayed recovered and burnt umber  
among the archipeligos.  
Mingling a cedar architecture  
flowed in the scrupulous rain.
