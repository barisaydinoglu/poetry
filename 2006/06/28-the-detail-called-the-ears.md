The Detail Called The Ears
--------------------------
In front of the flesh of the heights where you sleep,  
a dream drops into phenomena.  
Resolute, silicon bottle!  
I'd do it for the crown in which you love  
for the rituals of crimson you've enriched.  
Purity is gone, the subject has shone.  
Here I am, a poetic nose twisted in the room of aroma.
