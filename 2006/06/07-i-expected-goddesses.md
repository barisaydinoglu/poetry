I Expected Goddesses
--------------------
An odor has wove among the kiss,  
a mixture of corruption and body, a showering  
affection that brings beligerance.  
Atrocious twilight and the violenet old warrior's medal  
reject at the walls of my house.  
Great empire. The line functions to shine a environment  
to its architecture.  
A synonym fashions,  
abhors - it does not return.  
A worn-out candle day  
sometimes a piece of the water  
smears like a silence in my leg.  
When the region is full of violenet toe  
outside lances and careless sticky bridges  
and the violenet warmths of your body and the splendors  
at last give  
forth their cold phlegm.  
Only foam, just the  
flower, nothing but  
it. Form.
