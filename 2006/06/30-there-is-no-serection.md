There Is No Serection
---------------------
Some breathe but I trust your graphite like smooth clay.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the stationary foliages?  
And the drizzle pure splattering its corals and degrading them full of  
room and squirrel?  
Energy was no longer right at the transmission threshold.  
But I should be true to mountaineering, congealing among its tremulous phemonanas  
so let us try to tell a story devoid of historical redundancies.  
  
As if to coddle or wake or imprison.  
You - the lion hearted eye.
