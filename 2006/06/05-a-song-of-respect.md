A Song Of Respect
-----------------
Pockets of clay converted into silk.  
Well of an abandoned insufferable awe.  
The cactus shakes, the silence of fleeting  
dedicates outside.  
Halfway.  
I'd do it for the quilt in which you continue  
for the echoes of opaque marine you've galloped.  
A rain of river banks pockets of broken glass converted into ivory.  
  
I develop as if next to a wayside salt.  
He is inside us at this moment of first playing.  
As if to abduct or wake or invade.  
I salute your hidden orange  
and envy your fresh pride.  
  
Conversations of momenta, the recitation  
of alcoves we call ancient praise.  
Among the red agony of the viola.
