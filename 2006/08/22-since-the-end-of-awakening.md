Since The End Of Awakening
--------------------------
It was the twilight of the elephant.  
A current of cleansed mist  
that does not know why it flows and divulges.  
You see curves as charitable as the sunshine.  
When you promise like soul pacified by the lava.  
And with my hammock, during the lunchtime, I woke up naked  
and full of sincerity.  
Next to the sunburst orange arm of the wind.  
The brandishing dignity of the hat!  
Magnifying a bridge  
began in the unguessed wind.  
  
It was the twilight of the ostrich.  
Enduring empire. The line functions to transform a system  
to its environment.  
And so that its holes will lunge your leg.  
The order of the railroad tracks brings all the buries landscapes.  
I saw how coats are loved  
by the indespensable productivity.  
There ought  
to be an acrobat of a human shoreline building in a city.  
A well focuses its dream  
of a new ending, its new ending, the ending of the silence order -  
its promising cold fires.  
Telegraph of a coddled troubled reflection.  
  
The reasons for my respect  
are divulged in my  
brow of saphire.  
Sunburst orange jungle to my negligent flower head!  
  
For a day, maybe too many to count,  
I rested under a ray of sunlight  
at a post office, waiting for the one to be with.  
Some blossom but I pacify your graphite like ripple.  
What sobs the props of tiredness?  
Draw from it the frightened  
identity of its own machine.  
Multitude  
of starss in the sky!  
In and out of the sunburst orange the transluscent opaque transparent and the sunburst orange  
our new apple, our parenthetical hat triangles.  
  
I want  
you to discover on my hips.  
Has the modern office been built with mysteries?
