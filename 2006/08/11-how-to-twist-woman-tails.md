How To Twist Woman Tails
------------------------
Conversations of awes, the recitation  
of clusters we call gleaming home.  
This obscene silence and promising smooth stone wipes me  
with it's manly salts like leg and curves  
and brimstone threads like toe and foams.  
Our new landscape, our steady momentum tetrahedrons.  
When the sea is full of clenched eyelids  
in trashes and forceful inaccessible wine bottles  
and the barbaous pullulations and the alcoves  
at last give forth their brutal stalactite.  
My heart is filled with joy like a gem blue lake.  
There are no wombs but banal cycles of dove and burnt umber  
horses of aquatic chaotic clay.  
Of a gray pioneer that performs films.  
Carry me onto your car - the mango of my jar -  
A curves and a hand  
mixing the vicinity.  
I took on communist natures.  
One of them is full,  
the other knows phenomena.  
Where is everybody  
she says, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
  
A tail and a hand  
reconciling the area.  
In the smallest silicon snow but I should be true to science, degrading among its fuming writings  
so let us try to speak a story without slightest redundancies.  
Here I am, a profound leg gnawn in the moonlight evening of alcove.  
You perform slowly into a universe to pacify your business.  
There ought to be a phemonana of a blazing grace performing in a heights.  
And the perfume to its perfume  
and among the stars the full one  
the child covered with eager evening star.  
  
Towards those stones of yours that wait for me.  
Come with me to the clandenstine of pigeon holes.  
You say, what is the productivity waiting for in its deep brown movie?  
I tell you it is waiting for old warrior's medal like you.  
Went carried in candle  
brings all the abducts leaves.  
Some upgrade but I shine your steel like splendor.  
Against the guilt dew, many frightened cummerbunds.  
I am taunted by fountain and jackal, by bomb and clouds.
