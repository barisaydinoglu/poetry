The Calculation Has Not Conquered The Promise
---------------------------------------------
And within my hammock, during the lunchtime, I woke up naked  
and full of purity.  
And the landscape to its goblet  
and among the droplets the full one  
the gentleman covered with absent  
minded sepia lake.  
Directionless sunset and the listless bed  
puncture at the walls of my house.  
I do not deceive  
in the heights of melancholy bloodied metal.  
You entertain in the city as in a electric universe.
