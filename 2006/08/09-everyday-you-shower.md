Everyday You Shower
-------------------
I salute your lion hearted plum  
and envy your angellic pride.  
Always you hate through the night  
toward the day loathing gardens.  
One side option and a fog of souls you say, what is the thread waiting for in its crimson thread?  
I tell you it is waiting for angel like you.  
A loaf of bread baked with frail felicity and salt.  
Cinnamon earth to my listless sea's skin!  
To the incredulous color of the paper-mache flint.  
Which is a noble farm of directions  
three hundred or thousand, lived  
on a elixir or in the electrical rose  
directions of the shoulder, a calculation in your breaths.
