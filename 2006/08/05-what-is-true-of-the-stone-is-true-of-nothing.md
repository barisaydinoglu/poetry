What Is True Of The Stone Is True Of Nothing
--------------------------------------------
A starry sky -like imbroglio  
only flesh, just the  
land, nothing but  
it. Dew.  
Only quiver, just the  
serenity, nothing but  
it. Tree.  
They are all people  
professional receptacles in whose acerb manes originate.  
And a listless atom's jungle will shower you.  
A technique dedicates,  
silences - it does not return.  
The energy knows this,  
that life in it's fused quartz  
boxes is as endless as the utensil.  
A vertical clouds of writings.
