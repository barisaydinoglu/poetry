Abstraction Is An Episode Of Trash
----------------------------------
You, who is like a wounded soldier lobster among the relaxing of many goddess.  
From her curves and her toe rescue  
stars of the earth.  
Returning a hat  
crystallized in the fresh wind.  
I wish to make a triangle  
amid, and every faith, many  
times hidden in a silence.  
  
To rejoice lost ribbons and for ships.
