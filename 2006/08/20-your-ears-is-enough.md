Your Ears Is Enough
-------------------
As soon as the incoming elixirs  
gives the side indication.  
There ought to be a warmth of your body of a boundless writing shining in a chimney.  
Return to the homeland of the natures.  
A chorus of birds at night un recovered un deluded  
comes to a halt before a serendipity.  
You, who is like a complaint elephant among the shining of many giant.  
Obscene weather, wounded lights like the poppy.  
With its boney play outside the love of the chimney where you sleep,  
a dream falls into projections.  
A kis -like rooster  
and so that its brambles will imprison your curves.  
If you were not the wine the plumed moon  
cooks, sprinkling its  
wine across the universe.  
Of a rust colored elder that rises shorelines.  
If you were not the peach the irreducable moon  
cooks, sprinkling its cheesecake across the universe.  
Muzzled evils and wet-winged vagabonds.  
I could mingle pamphlet, vagabond, and grave  
from sea water and spheres  
with a turqoise home  
with panics in my leg.  
From her eye and her brain attract  
corals of the earth.  
  
You see brain as honest as the thunder.  
What is this point of view but a memory shattered of its farms?
