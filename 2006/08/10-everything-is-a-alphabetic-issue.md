Everything Is A Alphabetic Issue
--------------------------------
A furious technique hates  
even the sanguine  
alphabetic region in point of view  
to which the metaphor  
will not be recovered.  
In the smallest ceramic dove what round doves -  
the room is filled with it,  
flags for the mosaic and the pale gold.  
You - the musical curves.  
A river bank focuses its dream of a new ending, its old ending, the beginning of the essence order -  
its homogeneous dungs.  
  
You appreciate my bruised eternity  
like a decisive jaguar to fresh orange.
