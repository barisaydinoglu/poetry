Everyday You Kiss
-----------------
Only clenched and to a  
gentleman they take on time, too few to count years  
what we say blushes to  
set some other woman  
what a phenomenon may teach.  
Wave of wave of hearts rolling down the sea.  
This disordered stars in the sky and protecting path entangles  
me  
with it's profound railroad tracks like brow and foot  
and rust colored lakes like fingernails and faucets.  
Return to the homeland of the suns.
