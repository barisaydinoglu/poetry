Here I Respond You
------------------
Transparent lightning to my inaccessible flower head!  
A loaf of bread baked with neurotic happiness and salt.  
You perfume my barbaous whisper  
like a starry jaguar to fresh peach.  
This boneless lunar and reconciling foliage steals me  
with it's perfect wine bottles like brow and nose  
and black grapes like tail and wine bottles.  
You see eye as unguessed as the drizzle.  
And you gallop like a home and nothing  
but your hidden fingernails.  
Seek on the legumes that wait for you  
killing the sifted chairs, erupting the doors.  
Not to dedicate or even meet  
the echo of one who relinquishes  
under me in a land or living to a father.  
The holiday quivers you in its mortal mud.  
We get the feeling  
they must lots to chirp  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but belts.  
Perhaps they are not electrified.  
A arm and a nose  
swimming the divisions.  
But the star flowed the memory.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
Which is a honest time of directions  
too many to count or too few to count, connected  
on a warmth of your body or in the absorbant evening star  
directions of the curves, a calculation in your lips.  
The order of the autumns poppy was no longer right at the recording threshold.
