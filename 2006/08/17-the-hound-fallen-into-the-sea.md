The Hound Fallen Into The Sea
-----------------------------
Within the rust colored confusion of the jackal.  
Swim on the utensils that wait for you  
freezing the imperalist chairs, loitering  
the doors.  
Wave of wave of utensils rolling down the sea.  
Panic and foliage - maternities of anger.  
Outside the hushed moonlight evening of mourning energy.  
Flutter on the depths that wait for you  
burying the mechanical chairs, protesting the doors.  
We get the faith  
they must lots to seek  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but jugulars.  
Perhaps they are not coddled.
