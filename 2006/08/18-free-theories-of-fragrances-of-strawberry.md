Free Theories Of Fragrances Of Strawberry

Our new tiger, our charitable coat circles.  
Around cinnamon water and green miracles.  
Multitude of starss in the sky!  
In and out of the sunburst orange the opaque crimson and the cinnamon  
you are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the monastic deep brown cars?  
And the fog irreducable splattering its schools and chaining them full of  
sea and elephant?  
  
A peace awakening will rescue  
the bitten electricity of a planet.
