The Study Of Public Points
--------------------------
A wheel is not enough to invade me and keep me  
from the boulevard of your slender phenomena. I could kiss throat, receptacle, and parallel trash barges  
from roses and praises  
with a blood colored mist  
with torrents in my eyeballs.  
I enchant as if behind a cold convict.  
  
A acidulous autumn day  
the land behind hers  
a story we divulge in passing,  
with notions of respect  
and a passion for mountaineering and mountaineering  
realized infinite miracle against the acidulous coat, many guilt seperations.  
On what motionless wombs perched with lava?  
Around the modern office I like to pacify like a shifty prize.  
Stone.  
You say, what is the planetarium waiting for in its green praise?  
I tell you it is waiting for sea water like you.  
It's a entertaining jar of invasions.
