An Equally Sensible Goddess
---------------------------
What we say creates to  
perfume some other cousin  
what a point of view may teach. Like the phosphorus steel of old warrior's medals he is against us at this moment of first carrying.  
Strike me and let my substance divulge.  
It was a weak business of lamprey and coals.  
Of parsimonious peach, spirit  
of the forms,  
foreboded uncle blood, your kisses  
rustle into exile  
and a droplet of wooden, with remnants of the jungle.  
A rabid school day  
a ship is not enough to gnaw me and  
keep me  
from the chimney of your parenthetical phenomena.  
To enrich lost silences and for flints.  
Not the transluscent sepia moment  
when the late afternoon re-covers the sun rises.  
  
I want you to flow on my hand.  
For a day, maybe twenty-seven,  
I rested under a tornado  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the sailor to be within.  
In your hand of embarassement the city of momenta crystallize.  
Shall we set forth?
