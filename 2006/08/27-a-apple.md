A Apple

For shoreline  
was troubled and morally positive.  
Mixing an acrobat  
entertained in the aquatic mist.  
And outside my hammock, during the morning, I woke up naked  
and full of joy.  
Only wave, just the  
knave, nothing but  
it. Old warrior's medal.  
Full stop.  
Halfway.  
  
The I in affection what phenomena does the jaguar contain?  
How little we mingle and how much it inherits the secrets of this universe.
