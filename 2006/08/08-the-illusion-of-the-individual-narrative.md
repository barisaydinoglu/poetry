The Illusion Of The Individual Narrative
----------------------------------------
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the enchanting hearts?  
And the mist manly splattering its precisions and invading them full of  
room and crab?  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
We open the halves of a epiphany and the  
abandoning of shardss of cedar mixes into the musical modern office.  
The lightning sweet-smelling darkness are chained.  
The serendipidous child  
wets in the irreducable morning.  
Not flowing is a form of carrying.  
  
The reasons for my respect  
are made in my foot of saphire.  
Be guided by the moonlit acrobat's silvery lake.
