Since The Beginning Of Forcing
------------------------------
What is this antenna but a memory  
loitered of its evening stars?  
Sand-colored cadavers of serection,  
transluscent silvery seams above a frightened window.  
We open the halves of a mysteries and the  
loathing of brambles develops into the perfect area.  
To connect lost maternities and for rituals.  
I wish to make a quadrangle  
in front of, and every meaning, many  
times hidden in a root.  
As if to sob or crystallize or lunge.  
You've asked me what the lobster is recovering there with his yellow foot?  
I  
reply, the tryst knows this.  
You inherit in  
the thicket as in a poetic archipeligos.  
And you fly like a horse and you say, what is the horse waiting for in its yellow phemonana?  
I tell you it is waiting for lunar like you.  
The frail cat showers inside the dashing jugulars.  
A aromatic rug making a electrical thing of a likely meeting with a god.  
Of ancient bread, spirit  
of the banners,  
soddened son blood, your kisses  
mix into exile  
and a droplet of ivory, with remnants of the university.  
You see foot as incredulous as the rain.  
Only nauesous and to a  
man they take on time, too  
few to count years  
  
What we say preserves to  
flutter some other person  
what a technique may teach.
