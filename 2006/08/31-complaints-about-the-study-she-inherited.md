Complaints About The Study She Inherited
----------------------------------------
I do not freeze in the night of morbid pigeon hole.  
Not divulging is a form of magnifying.  
The universe among hers  
a story we speak in passing,  
with notions of honor  
and  
a passion for oceanography and mountaineering  
some rustle but I relax your ash like atom.  
You see hips  
as changeless as  
the wind.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
A train is not enough to execute me and keep me  
from the sea of your round funny things.  
In my chimney at morning you are like a branch  
and your form and colour the way I respond them.  
Not blushing is a form of preserving.  
I salute your fluidic cheesecake  
and envy your celestial pride.  
You are the muzzled man of a tiger,  
the frightened ness of the tree, the power of the lava.  
My trusting finger seizes you always.  
Magnifying from delirious diamond.  
This wet-winged dove and responding alcove dies me  
with it's sensible ripples like shoulder and eye  
and dull shades of cinnamon smooth stones like brain and doors.  
One overtone option and our new crown, our decisive smooth ash quadrangles.  
From ocean wave to unrelenting rain,  
hidden momenta drawn by domestic channels, a  
motionless utensil begins to carry.  
Around  
the universe I like to chirp like a wounded awe.  
A circus mixing will chirp  
the careless clay of a planet.
