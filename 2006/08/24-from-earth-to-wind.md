From Earth To Wind
------------------
It was the day of the turkey.  
And a boneless banner's lightning will seek you.  
I connect as if with a pale receptacle.  
Felicity is gone, the subject has perched.  
Towards those burnt umber cars of yours that wait for me.  
  
It was the early light of day of the bird.  
The violenet  
ostrich continues under the great moths.  
I stayed enchanted and cashmire  
behind the room.  
Outside the area like aluminum.  
Creating from wet-winged paper-mache.  
What curiosities does the turkey contain?  
How little we inherit and how much it inherits the funny things of this universe.  
  
Brings all the condemns trysts.  
When you wake reconciled like a peace.  
And a neon bridge's wind will enrich you.  
Pure bramble loves the doves a current of indespensable echo  
that does not know why it flows and returns.  
  
I'm the custodian to the key of immediate warmth.
