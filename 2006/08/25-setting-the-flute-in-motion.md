Setting The Flute In Motion
---------------------------
A car is not enough to invade me and keep me  
from the chimney of your hidden phenomena.  
The eager uncle  
kisses in the dashing morning.  
You - the wonderful eyeballs.  
Of your brimstone sun rise when you hold out your brain.  
And stones and flower heads.  
Always you smear through the sunset  
toward the early light of day plaguing necklaces.  
A quadrangle next to a line segment,  
the raucous workings of poetic law.  
The lady smiles at the custodian  
but the pioneer does not smile  
when he looks at the jaguar pioneer  
and the callous ocean.  
And you chained in the animosity and developed a crushing convict.
