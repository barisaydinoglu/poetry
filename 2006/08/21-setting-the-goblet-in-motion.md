Setting The Goblet In Motion
----------------------------
Towards those perfumes of yours that wait for me. Carry me onto your car - the mango  
of my awe -  
closed off and pulled out like a stalks of cattail.  
Sunburst orange seperations of imperfect crystal,  
blue seams above a negligent affection.  
An odor has enchanted against the evening star,  
a mixture of parallel jugulars and body, a protecting  
forest that brings animosity.  
Animosity and forest - flints of fear.  
I was without doubt the woman iguana  
there in the furious moonlight evening.  
When it looked me with its promising shades of blue eyes  
it had neither leg nor  
breath  
but fused quartz mists on its sides.  
And in my hammock, during the midnight, I woke up naked  
and full of joy.  
Your flower is a planetarium filled with cold foliage.
