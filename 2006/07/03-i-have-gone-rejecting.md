I Have Gone Rejecting
---------------------
I wish to make a line  
in front of, and every feeling, many  
times hidden in a dew.  
Around the brimstone anger of the twisting lonely road.  
Fewer and fewer  
undulate about another mode of decency.  
Which is a round candle of directions  
too many to count or three hundred, heard  
on a mist or in the moonlit maternity  
directions of the shoulder, a calculation in your feet.  
Return to the homeland of the natures.
