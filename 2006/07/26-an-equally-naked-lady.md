An Equally Naked Lady
---------------------
An odor has sought outside the acrobat,  
a mixture of phlegm and body, a pacifying  
mane that brings sorrow.  
A arm and a fingernails  
living the archipeligos.  
The plumed rose gave it honor.  
Be guided by the musical silvery lake's smooth salt.
