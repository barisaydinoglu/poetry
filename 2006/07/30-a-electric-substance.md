A Electric Substance
--------------------
Once there was a fractious father who  
perched at parties, sitting in a square, among clusters.  
In my thicket at lunchtime you are like a necklace  
and your form and colour the way I attract them.  
But the fragrance of strawberry inherited the memory.  
I'm the man to the bridge of immediate femininity.  
There ought to be a heart of a homogeneous key lighting in a sea.  
The area in hers  
a tale we tell in passing,  
with notions of honor  
and a passion for  
jouranlism and oceanography  
As soon as the incoming wheatfields  
gives the minor indication.  
A loaf of bread baked with communist respect and salt.  
My heart moves from being motionless to being soft.  
The I in warmth a sunburst orange branch dedicates.
