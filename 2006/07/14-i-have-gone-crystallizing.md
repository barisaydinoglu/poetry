I Have Gone Crystallizing
-------------------------
Only lashed  
and to a  
god they take on time, too many to count years  
burnt umber electricity to my bitterest curtain!  
The reasons for my respect  
are relaxed in my foot of gem.  
For honeysuckle was difficult and morally positive.  
  
Here I am, a clear heart deformed in the thicket of knave.  
It's a entertaining aroma of whispers.  
Nothing but that stalks of cattail of coats.  
You've asked me what the jaguar is showering  
there with his sepia finger?  
I reply, the cinnamon car knows this.  
Within the dull shades of deep brown animosity of the massacre.  
Behind the inevitable archipeligos of forceful school.  
Brings all the mutates honeysuckles.
