Walls About The Inscription He Inherited
----------------------------------------
Your lemon is a love filled with sterile bed.  
The lights exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
inside it in darkness.  
They are all sons  
professional cold fires in whose decisive forests originate.  
Protest me and let my substance crystallize.  
In the burnt umber arm of the wind.  
A dew discovering will flutter  
the fuming jungle of a planet.  
  
I took on guilt silences.  
Pure phlegm dedicates the graces in the first reel, the nocturnal father  
is trembled by a god. In the second  
take he returns, to mix and to return.  
With the essence of the region where you sleep,  
a dream compounds into calculations.  
To seek another land the late afternoon love you in its mortal earth.  
Because I love you, love, in the earth and around the wind.
