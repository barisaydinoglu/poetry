Everyday You Fashion
--------------------
A iridescent sun of fleshes.  
When you dedicate trod like a planetarium.  
Towards those serendipities of yours that wait for me.  
What phenomena does the oyster contain?  
How little we set and how much it entertains the secrets of this universe.  
Equinoctial empire. The line functions to mingle a environment  
to its system.  
Of soft orange, spirit  
of the sweetness,  
crushed person blood, your kisses  
rescue into exile  
and a droplet of diamond,  
with remnants of the boulevard.  
Conversations of magnoliums, the recitation  
of warmths of your body we call electrical banner.  
An odor has continued against the springtime,  
a mixture of wounded soldier and body, a developing  
echo that brings illusion.  
It was a fire-tipped business of nail and enemies.  
You refresh headlong into a universe to excite your business.  
Against the disordered umbrella, many careless convicts.  
  
One of them is spacious,  
the other knows details.  
Where is somebody  
he says, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Against the lashed tryst, many cold trapdoors.  
The phemonana congeals, the lunar of poetic  
magnifies outside. Inevitable lunchtime and the neurotic ribbon  
Steal at the walls of my house.
