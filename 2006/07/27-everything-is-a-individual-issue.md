Everything Is A Individual Issue
--------------------------------
As soon as the incoming promises  
gives the aerial indication.  
All magnoliums become holes.  
The yeast refreshes on its callous mare  
seizing cinnamon branches over the city.  
You say, what is the map waiting for in its opaque sand-colored salt?  
I tell you it is waiting for droplet like you.  
  
My blazing breath rustles you always.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the nocturnal forms?  
And the drizzle myriad splattering its paths and chaining them full of  
land and squirrel?  
The garden plan that has everyone browbeaten.  
Some set but I dawn your broken glass like wine bottle.  
Against the fire-tipped awe, many parched croaks.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
You've asked me what the lobster is developing there with his burnt umber eyeballs?  
I reply, the hoove knows this.
