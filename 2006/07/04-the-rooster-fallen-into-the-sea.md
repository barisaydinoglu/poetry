The Rooster Fallen Into The Sea
-------------------------------
In the middle of the archipeligos  
like broken glass.  
A bleak ripple day  
when the university is full of boneless shoulder  
in front of bombs and nauesous cheerless saxophones  
and the ironous aromas and the bottles  
at last give forth their communist trapdoor.  
To seek another land you - the promising hand.  
Of your blood colored momentum when you hold out your shoulder.  
  
Against the thicket like aluminum.
