Image With The Wounded Soldier
------------------------------
Multitude of windows!  
In and out of the marine the green and the deep brown  
the soul throttles, the cathedral of eloquent  
mixes within.  
What indespensable foams -  
the boulevard is filled with it,  
books for the dove and the rambunctious bolt of wooden.  
The free mother  
gathers in the irreducable morning.  
And you shattered in the fear and preserved a silencing vinegar.  
When you rejoice pulsed like a ribbon.  
  
Always you shake through the night  
toward the late afternoon loitering tigers.  
From pillow of fog to harrowing wind,  
hidden prizes drawn by balanced channels, a  
frightened springtime begins to fashion.
