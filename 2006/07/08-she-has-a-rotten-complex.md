She Has A Rotten Complex
------------------------
Everything inaccessible with aromatic voices, the salt of the autumn  
and piles of hopeful bread amid afternoon.  
Multitude of spheres!  
In and out of the crimson the cinnamon and the deep brown  
if you were not the nectarine the charitable moon  
cooks, sprinkling its bread across the city.  
A production seizes,  
pities - it does not return.
