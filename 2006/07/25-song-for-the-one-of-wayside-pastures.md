Song For The One Of Wayside Pastures
------------------------------------
And flags and muscles.  
A current of wonderful cluster  
that does not know why it flows and forms.  
To the monastic naked lemon a boat is not enough to petrify me and keep me  
from the universe of your clear phenomena.  
The I in stars in the sky outside opaque  
green water and sunburst orange flags.
