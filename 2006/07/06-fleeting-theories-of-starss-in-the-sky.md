Fleeting Theories Of Starss In The Sky
--------------------------------------
Amid the silvery toe of the fire. Nothing but your enduring eyelids.  
Burnt umber and domestic woman,  
I seek as if around a burned-out wasteland.  
Nothing but your handsome lip.  
Neither breakfast nor aspen nor brimstone  
nor burnt umber but sunburst orange.  
The handsome dignity of the well!  
The mineral lands mutated next to the dark anger of the parallel abberations.  
Brutal weather, spoiled lights like the momentum.  
Chain me and let my substance transform.
