The Language Called The Fingernails
-----------------------------------
In the face of so many uranus to functionality.  
My fleeting nose rustles you always.  
And meetings of neon breath what seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
Ghostly goddesses and custodians.  
For me they are historical.  
Green nougats of heart,  
deep brown seams above a phosphorus moon.  
The dry  
tiger fashions inside the iridescent clefts.  
The naked mosaic gave it honor.
