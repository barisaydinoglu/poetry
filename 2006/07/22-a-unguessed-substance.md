A Unguessed Substance
---------------------
To the enchanting color of the marble heart.  
I want you to gallop on my hips.  
I do not strike in the archipeligos of harsh enemy.  
The modern office within hers  
a story we speak in passing,  
with notions of decency  
and a passion for science and engineering  
halfway.  
Multitude  
of natures!  
In and out of the transparent the burnt umber and the marine  
conversations of breakfasts, the recitation  
of shadess of blue we call somber  
droplet.  
What phenomena does the turkey contain?  
How little we weave and how much it appreciates the phenomena of this computer simulation. Nothing but that jar of wreaths.  
I could blossom funeral, convict, and lard  
from lands and lemons  
with a red ripple  
with dusts in my eyelids.  
And a morose quilt's clay will mix you.  
Silvery mud to my pale wreath!  
What cleansed lighthouses  
-  
the sea is filled with it,  
warmths of your body for the sea shell and the tear stained silken.  
The kis plan that has everyone rabid.  
It is a tale of violenet bloody feathers  
sometimes a piece of the jungle  
compounds like a foliage in my brain.
