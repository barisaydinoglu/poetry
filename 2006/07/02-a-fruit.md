A Fruit
-------
When the moonlight evening is full of dead eyeballs  
with corpses and furious skeleton salts  
And the dead affections and the hats  
at last give forth their negligent convict.  
I stayed stood and deep brown  
behind the thicket.  
In the smallest crystal telegraph everything skeleton with incredulous voices, the salt of the energy  
and piles of careful bread outside night.  
One of them is eager,  
the other knows metaphors.  
Where is noone  
he exclaims, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
You are the nauesous gentleman of a oyster,  
the troubled ness of the sun, the power of the earth.
