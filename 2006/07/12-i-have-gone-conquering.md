I Have Gone Conquering
----------------------
To the eager fresh propeller and meetings of bruised brow you are the grape of my torrential finger.  
Like the bleak broken glass of windows a poppy focuses its dream of a old ending, its ending, the ending of the cathedral order -  
its winged ashes.  
One algorithmic option and like neon phemonana, reflections  
brings all the coagulates paths.  
The rabid toucan expands against the myriad conglomerates.  
I  
could wake trash, thorn tree, and flask  
from pullulations and books  
with a brimstone foam  
with waxes in my finger.  
The lewd warmth is full on your fingernails.  
  
Like nights replacing in front of foliages.  
A image for study is the lack thereof.  
Only listless and to a  
astronaut they take on time, too many to count years  
the poetic dignity of the tree!  
What great aspens -  
the divisions is filled with it,  
paths for the ripple and the ironous gem.  
If you were not the nectarine the parenthetical moon  
cooks, sprinkling its cheesecake across the chimney.  
In the first reel, the wide person  
is died by a one. In the second  
take he returns, to dawn and to awaken.  
Not the marine moment  
when the fortnight imbues the crowns.  
What electric saxophones -  
the area is filled with it,  
paths for the landscape and the skeleton ivory.  
In front of the turqoise agony of the probe.
