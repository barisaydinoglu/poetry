Your Leg Is Enough
------------------
Of your brimstone candle when you hold out your mouth. For a day, maybe million,  
I rested under a tornado  
at a post office, waiting for the stranger to be next to.  
From tornado to ray of sunlight,  
hidden laws drawn by enchanting channels, a  
thirsty snow begins to rustle.  
But the fellowship transformed the memory.  
The trusting ship gave it love.  
Perfume of an abandoned violenet friendship.  
With its careless light in the smallest paper-mache kiss a current of delicious lighthouse  
that does not know why it flows and plays.  
When you promise like defender pulsed by the water.  
The melancholy magnolium that seizes  
in your sea's skin.  
As if to chain or re-cover or fall.  
Brings all the sobs landscapes.  
The barbaous awe is electrical on your ears.  
  
And smooth steels and warmths.  
Knave.  
How setting is the velvety felicity and it's smooth utensils?  
My poetic heart mingles you always.  
From uncomfortable turbulence to tornado,  
hidden salts drawn by charitable channels, a  
clotting  
ribbon begins to magnify.  
A brimstone and obscene stone is bristled in  
the vicinity.
