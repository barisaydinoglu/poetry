From Sky To Ice
---------------
The domestic forest gave it wonder.  
But I  
should be untrue to photography, deluding among its lethargic hooves  
so let us seek to divulge a story without technical redundancies.  
Filter me and let my  
substance drink.  
With its neon trust sea's skin was no longer right at the transmission threshold.  
The region among hers  
a history we speak in passing,  
with notions of purity  
and a passion for photography and photography  
among cashmire water and burnt umber coats.  
We open the halves of a secrets and the  
petrifying of uranus flies into the unguessed jungle.
