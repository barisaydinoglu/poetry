Here I Relinquish You
---------------------
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
carry of echoes and mists  
and the wonderful lights of his native land?  
Pockets of rusted nail converted into gem.  
A loaf of bread baked with callous pride and salt.  
A brutal writing day  
I'd do it for the pasture in which you build  
for the flints of cashmire you've blushed.  
To swim lost gardens and for trees.  
The one smiles at the one  
but the pioneer does not smile  
when he looks at the tiger custodian  
and the pale ocean.  
How performing is the monastic pigeon hole and it's starry trapdoors?  
The vagina imposes nessecity.  
Your landscape is a goblet filled with explosive momentum.  
  
Once there was a senile cousin who  
flowed at parties, sitting in a tetrahedron, among atoms.  
A sphere waking will build  
the melancholy lightning of a planet.
