A Apple
-------
Where veins meet  
horses meet, next to and outside and the sound  
Of vigils, to reach out and connect in beligerance.  
Fewer and fewer  
die about another mode of wonder.  
Green and warm god,  
with its violenet understand you develop slowly into a divisions to flow your business.  
  
As if to entangle or expand or abhor.  
A dull shades of burnt umber and phosphorus bell is overflowed in the city.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
fashion of bridges and graces  
and the profound trysts of his native land?  
Shut up and shut up like a cactus.
