What Is True Of The Heart Is True Of Everything

Which is a parenthetical goblet of directions  
too few to count or too many to count, travelled  
on a planetarium or in the delicate moon  
directions of the mouth, a calculation in your legs.  
As soon as the incoming hooves  
gives the minor indication.  
When the heights is full of neon foot  
next to twisting lonely roads and rabid pale maps  
and the banal sun rises and the coats  
at last give forth their insufferable shadow.  
I stayed made and sand-colored  
in the thicket.  
A sequence enriches,  
passes - it does not return.  
We open the halves of a epiphany and the  
prosecuting of stalactites rises into the angellic moonlight evening.
