I Have Gone Rejecting
---------------------
A current of wonderful perfume  
that does not know why it flows and divulges.  
Illusion and farm - wells of illusion.  
Nothing but your promising hand.  
On what torrential nougats heard with heat?  
When you live like book  
entertained by the earth.  
In the smallest cork wreath shall we go forward?
