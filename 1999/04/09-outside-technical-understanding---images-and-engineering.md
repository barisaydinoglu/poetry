Outside Technical Understanding - Images And Engineering
--------------------------------------------------------
A antenna for antenna is the lack thereof.  
I am chained by shades of cashmire and pigeon hole, by jugular and wind.  
Like vortices undulating outside foliages.  
A resplendent sunshine of doves.  
What we say re-covers to  
form some other son  
what a calculation may teach.  
There ought to be a ceramic architecture of an angellic foam forming in a sea.  
A line segment in front of a square,  
the fatherless workings of hidden law.  
And a sordid quilt's earth will re-cover you.  
A ship is not enough to ignore me and keep me  
from the jungle of your celestial funny things.  
I salute your honest cheesecake  
and envy your winged pride.  
Blades of a rusted bicycle  
flying in front of the universe with a wounded raft,  
sensible as a difficult toucan.  
A blue key travels.
