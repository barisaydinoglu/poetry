The Identity Called The Brain
-----------------------------
A fellowship -like beast  
and you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
create of reflections and tigers  
and the clear lights of his native land?  
What pampers the props of felicity?  
The I in stars in the sky you say, what is the dew waiting for in its marine bridge?  
I tell you it is waiting for soul like you.  
Everything listless with lovely voices, the salt of the sphere  
and piles of secure bread outside midnight.  
  
Amid the dark embarassement of the juice.  
For a day, maybe million,  
I rested under a ocean wave  
at a post office, waiting for the woman to be outside.  
You continue in the university as in a unguessed heights.
