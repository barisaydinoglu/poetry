Since The End
-------------
Of a ultraviolet woman that connects aspens.  
Sometimes a piece of the fire  
invades like an alcove in my nose.  
Awakening toward the goblet conversations of reflections, the recitation  
of cathedrals we call noble dew.  
Aunt of the depths of my nose  
- your blushing  
stills your moonlit regard as though it were water.  
  
A loaf of bread baked with fatherless pride and salt.
