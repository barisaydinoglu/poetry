From What Are Miracles Set
--------------------------
He is behind us at this moment of first kissing.  
Towards those keys of yours that wait for me.  
What nocturnal foams -  
the night is filled with it,  
poppies for the sun rise and the demonic wooden.  
The sweetnes mixing from my tail.  
There are many parallel beastss amid shaken events.  
Return to the homeland of the candles.  
Discovered and then responded in the archipeligos.  
From her heart and  
her curves divulge  
autumns of the earth.  
Went reflected in faucet created and then loved in the boulevard.  
As if to protest or preserve or throttle.  
I do not smear in the area of bruised nougat.  
  
Has the vicinity been wove with funny things?  
Domestic, silken hat!  
One of them is fluidic,  
the other knows computers.  
Where is somebody  
she says, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
If I could entertain the jugular and the field.  
I'd do it for the cluster in which you stand  
for the jars of crimson you've seized.  
The land among hers  
a history we speak in passing,  
with notions of sincerity  
and a passion for oceanography and mountaineering  
  
To the monastic free maternity the mosaic mixing from my eyelids.  
With the forest of the field where you sleep,  
a dream congeals into signals.
