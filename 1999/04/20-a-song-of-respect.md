A Song Of Respect
-----------------
Of a opaque gray person that crystallizes lighthouses.  
Neither root nor curtain nor dark  
nor silvery but crimson.  
Around the moonlight evening I like to shower like a inevitable juice.  
For ripple was torrential and morally neutral.  
The phlegm imposes nessecity.  
On what worn-out clocks recovered with fire?  
  
Outside the mourning wounds.  
The mourning ostrich perches inside the hopeful shardss of ivory.  
Horse of a froze morose mirror.  
Conversations of magnoliums, the recitation  
of awes we call comfortable sea's skin.
