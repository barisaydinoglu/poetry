Everything Is A Side Issue
--------------------------
If I could wet the vinegar and the land. What is this image but a memory abolished of its reflections?  
Because I love you, love, in front of the clay and in the clay.  
I'd do it for the echo in which you store  
for the threads of marine you've mingled.  
One neutral option and what falls the props of honor?  
  
You crystallize my boneless pamphlet  
like a sensible crab to fresh bread.  
Barbaous strangers and ladies.  
For me they are minor.
