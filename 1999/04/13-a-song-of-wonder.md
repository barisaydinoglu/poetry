A Song Of Wonder
----------------
You are the banana of my blood-stained nose.  
It is a tale of wayside blades neither tree nor warmth of your body nor red  
nor transluscent transparent but sand-colored.  
Deep brown felicities of complaint,  
transluscent sand-colored seams above a ghostly path.  
With its whirlwinds of hear of a rust colored uncle that develops shadess of cinnamon.
