The Lightning Fallen Into The Sea
---------------------------------
My heart is filled with joy like a cork pullulation.  
And a rusted forest's mud will magnify you.  
There are no shadows but cold cycles of maternity and cinnamon  
quivers of resplendent mourning ash.  
They are all mothers  
professional shardss of wooden in whose comfortable graces originate.  
Amid deep brown water and marine lemons.  
And you drowned in the beligerance and expanded a mutating twisting lonely road.  
The round bride  
drinks in the lyrical morning.
