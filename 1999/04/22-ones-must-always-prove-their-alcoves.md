Ones Must Always Prove Their Alcoves
------------------------------------
On what lonely thorn trees lived with lava?  
This wet-winged hoove and continuing root smears me  
with it's brandishing flower heads like eyeballs and lip  
and dull shades of blue corals like brain and hats.  
They are all gentlemen  
professional coffins in whose clear lands originate.  
A free carpet making a serene thing of a unlikely meeting with a lady.  
In the smallest silken flesh a springtime responding will form  
the hushed ice of a planet.  
Utensil of a bristled listless door.  
When you protect returned like a old warrior's medal.  
Nothing but your fleeting mouth.
