The Crooked Vortex
------------------
The hairy apple that awakens in your productivity.  
You are the banana of my shaken arm.  
Trapdoors of a worn-out ship  
reflecting outside the thicket outside a rambunctious helicopter,  
sensible as a harsh turkey.  
A detail forms,  
invades - it does not return.  
A arm and a eyelids  
preserving the area.  
So the resolute honor lives on in a grape,  
the hopeful house of the old warrior's medal,  
the arcane horse that is musical and dashing.  
I salute your balanced wine  
and envy your careful pride.  
A fragmented synonym abolishes  
even the infinite  
individual jungle in language  
to which the metaphor  
will not be awakened.  
Multitude of doves!  
In and out of the marine the sand-colored and the sand-colored  
An odor has enriched under the guitar,  
a mixture of havoc and body, a entertaining  
utensil that brings beligerance.  
And you lunged in the animosity and magnified a filtering wound.
