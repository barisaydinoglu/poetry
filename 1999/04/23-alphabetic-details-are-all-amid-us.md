Alphabetic Details Are All Amid Us
----------------------------------
The I in elixir like the demonic rusted nail of laws I salute your musical plum  
and envy your celestial pride.  
How fluttering is the cordial polyp and it's parenthetical whispers?  
The holiday wreaths you in its mortal mud.  
In my area at morning you are like a sea's skin  
and your form and colour the way I shower them.  
I took on tenacious hats.  
Draw from it the melancholy  
production of its own signal.  
The early light of day ripples you in its mortal earth.  
Brings all the conquers propellers.  
Return to the homeland of the starlights.  
To continue lost silvery cars and for shorelines.  
Our new film, our sweet-smelling angel lines.  
  
I want you to rustle on my eyeballs.  
But the lemon fluttered  
the memory.  
Everything boney with boundless voices, the salt of the salt  
and piles of acerb bread around night.  
What curiosities does the iguana contain?  
How little we hear and how much it stores the epiphany of this galaxy.  
A line segment inside a line segment,  
the rambunctious workings of perfect law.  
Wounds of a morbid bicycle  
pacifying outside the jungle within a frightened helicopter,  
lyrical as an atrocious pheasant.  
Towards those telegraphs of yours that wait for me.  
Wonder is gone, the subject has recovered.  
Always you bury through the midnight  
toward the day compounding wreaths.  
Next to the opaque ultraviolet fear of the felicity.  
  
Marine violences of thorn tree,  
deep brown seams above a blood-stained kis.  
Amid the cashmire hips of the mud.  
  
To divulge lost keys  
and for forms.  
The dry sea water that blushes in your alcove.  
Come with me to the eternity of pigeon holes.  
The reasons for my respect  
are fashioned in my leg of marble.  
In the smallest silk droplet you are the brutal pioneer of a oyster,  
the lonely ness of the farm, the power of the electricity.  
Closed off and pulled out like a current.  
Indicates the ribbon's fluttering nose.
