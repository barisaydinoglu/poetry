Ironous Garden
--------------
With its rotten breathe divulged and then wetted in the night.  
In your heart of wetting the divisions begins to dream of returning.  
The vortex inherits  
on its sterile mare  
treading marine defenders over the boulevard.  
If I could discover the lineage and the land.  
There are many vaginas among neon events.  
What we say connects to  
dedicate some other custodian  
what a technique may  
teach.  
  
I wish to make a triangle  
outside, and every sense, many  
times hidden in a knave.  
You create in the universe as in a cordial region.  
Halfway.  
And you rustle like a banner and the inaccessible pheasant performs behind the resplendent jugulars.
