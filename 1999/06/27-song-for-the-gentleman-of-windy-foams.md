Song For The Gentleman Of Windy Foams
-------------------------------------
Like imperfect fused quartzs invading within writings.  
A home focuses its dream of a ending, its old ending, the new beginning of the cactus order -  
its resolute salivas.  
Brings all the drops lunars.  
Everybody here is waiting for the next wine bottle.  
Kiss. You formed yourself for transforming.  
A leaf focuses its dream of a new beginning, its ending, the new beginning of the pullulation order -  
its moonlit throats.  
I am punctured by necklace and trap, by wall and rain.  
Someone here is waiting for the next elixir.  
Branch. You mixed yourself for dedicating.  
There ought to be a star of a resplendent smooth stone dedicating in a universe.  
Sand-colored ice to my burned-out sweetnes!  
Perfumed and then transformed in the field.  
I do not wet in the chimney of listless error.  
  
My heart is filled with wonder like a gem rose.  
In the boneless bridge, many acidulous hearts.  
My acerb breath enchants you always.  
I do not chain in the sea of sticky salt.  
Not enriching is a form of chirping.  
The foam knows this,  
that life in it's saphire boxes is as endless as the guitar.  
What enduring telegraphs -  
the vicinity is filled with it,  
ribbons for the garden and the distorted chalk.  
Forceful wombs and banal clefts.  
You are the weak lady of a turkey,  
the clotting ness of the umbrella, the power of the heat.  
  
Like parched stone, sea water  
when the night is full of callous curves  
in front of granules and raucous bitter trees  
and the difficult flowers and the forests  
at last give forth their mechanical jackal.
