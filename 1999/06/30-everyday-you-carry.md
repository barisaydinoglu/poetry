Everyday You Carry
------------------
Not developing is a form of crystallizing.  
You understand in the thicket as in a changeless moonlight evening.  
What we say treads to  
blossom some other mother  
what a computer may teach.  
Indicates the alcove's beginning foot.  
What bristles the props of love?  
The eager mosaics loathed of your brimstone soul when you hold out your foot.  
  
It hears like a mirror around the affection.  
The electric starry sky gave it pride.
