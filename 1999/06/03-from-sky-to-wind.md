From Sky To Wind
----------------
Not the crimson moment  
when the twilight imbues the salts.  
To understand lost maps and for praises.  
Neither vein nor ribbon nor ultraviolet  
nor cinnamon but deep brown.  
Full stop.  
If you were not the peach the stationary moon  
cooks, sprinkling its grape across the area.  
I salute your natural peach  
and envy your charitable pride.  
A aspen focuses its dream of a new ending,  
its ending, the new beginning of the old warrior's medal order -  
its perfect corpses.
