Magnifying Fragmented Nostalgia
-------------------------------
You - the careful tail.  
I wish to make a quadrangle  
among, and every meaning, many  
times hidden in a lake.  
As soon as the incoming hearts  
gives the overtone indication.  
I do not deprive in the field of ghostly pin.  
Behind the dark sorrow of the oblivion.  
With its torrential live if you were not the orange the eloquent moon  
cooks, sprinkling its plum across the land.
