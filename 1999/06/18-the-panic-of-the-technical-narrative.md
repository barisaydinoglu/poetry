The Panic Of The Technical Narrative
------------------------------------
It mixes like a trouser around the horse.  
Joy is gone, the subject has rose.  
I'd do it for the aspen in which you live  
for the coats of yellow you've reflected.  
Once there was an atrocious aunt who  
played at parties, sitting in a quadrangle, among quivers.  
We get the faith  
they must lots to stand  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but hounds.  
Perhaps  
they are not fainted.  
Rabid weather, oily lights like the thread.  
  
I could gallop belt, felicity, and imperfect crystal  
from promises and friendships  
with a black foam  
with errors in my arm.  
A quadrangle in front of a loop,  
the lonely workings of careful law.
