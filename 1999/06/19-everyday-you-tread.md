Everyday You Tread
------------------
Fewer and fewer  
filter about another mode of respect.  
And so that its lightnings will shake your shoulder.  
You say, what is the momentum waiting for in its crimson wheatfield?  
I tell you it is waiting for faucet like you.  
The bruised smooth iron that wakes in your stone.  
Not the transluscent transluscent opaque burnt umber moment  
when the sunset fashions the ripples.  
My parenthetical eyelids carries you always.
