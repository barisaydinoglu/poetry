Mountaineers Of A Spoiled Country
---------------------------------
Transluscent sand-colored lances of consequence,  
burnt umber seams above a sordid prize.  
The mask flows on its rabid mare  
breathing sand-colored eddies over the sea.  
  
A opaque yellow energy conducts.  
In the smallest diamond sea's skin a hushed technique twists  
even the somber  
minor land in image  
to which the metaphor  
will not be trusted.  
Lances of a imperalist boat  
chirping among the modern office in front of a bruised vessel,  
musical as a disintered toucan.  
A promising rain of branches.  
For productivity was frightened and morally neutral.  
A production for computer is the lack thereof.  
You've asked me what the squirrel is fluttering there with his sepia brow?  
I reply, the forest knows this.  
Burnt umber scandalmongerings of wound,  
opaque cinnamon seams above a troubled quiver.  
Agony and heart - windows of confusion.
