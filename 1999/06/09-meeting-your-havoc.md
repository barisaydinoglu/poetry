Meeting Your Havoc
------------------
For foliage was wayside and morally negative.  
What we say responds to  
rise some other lady  
what a inscription may teach.  
My stationary brain shines you always.  
Neither autumn nor knave nor dull shades of crimson  
nor cashmire but  
crimson.  
  
In your finger of devouring the universe begins to dream of fluttering.  
One of them is honest,  
the other knows projections.  
Where is someone  
he cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?
