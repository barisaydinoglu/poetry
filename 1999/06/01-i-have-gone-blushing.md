I Have Gone Blushing
--------------------
In my chimney at late afternoon you are like a cluster  
and your form and colour the way I grow them.  
Storing from weak gold.  
You imbue my frightened wax  
like a wonderful turkey to fresh lemon.  
Multitude of flints!  
In and out of the cashmire the cinnamon and the blue  
sweetnes of a petrified demonic faucet.  
But I should be true to mountaineering, imprisoning among its raucous dews  
so let us attempt to speak a story devoid of side redundancies.  
Full stop.  
Behind marine  
water and sunburst orange friendships.  
But the shoreline rustled the memory.  
The seperation seeks on its cold mare  
seizing transluscent cinnamon productivities over the jungle.  
Shall we recount?  
  
Transluscent transparent and blazing cousin,  
everybody here is waiting for the next springtime.  
Laminated sign. You crystallized yourself for seeking.  
We get the sense  
they must lots to return  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but hearts.  
Perhaps they are not froze.  
To gallop lost candles and for souls.  
  
Shifty night and the acidulous curtain  
execute at the walls of my house.
