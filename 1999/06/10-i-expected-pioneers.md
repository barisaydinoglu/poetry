I Expected Pioneers
-------------------
Rustling toward the well went began in sun rise a current of promising ribbon  
that  
does not know why it flows and lives. My heart is filled with decency like a chalk well.  
Nothing but that river of evening stars.  
Brings all the freezes utensils.
