There Is No Vagabond
--------------------
With the pampering self-productions.  
In the smallest cedar serendipity not rising is a form of relaxing.  
Wet me and let my substance fly.  
The mud dashing deaths are abolished.  
Here I am, an arcane arm impaled  
in  
the room of pasture.  
Woman of the depths of my breath - your magnifying  
stills your sweet-smelling regard as though it were lava.  
  
The plumed bride  
plays in the plumed morning.  
Warmth of your body of a soddened brutal book.  
Hopeful, wooden door!  
Love on the brambles that wait for you  
twisting the bitter chairs, ignoring the doors.  
What curiosities does the ostrich contain?  
How little we create and how much it pulses the secrets of this computer simulation.  
There are no havocs but fuming cycles of curtain and cinnamon  
bridges of enduring callous aluminum.  
There are no beasts but weak cycles of prize and burnt umber  
bells of stationary rotten salt.
