The Anger Of The Individual Narrative
-------------------------------------
I want you to kiss on my heart.  
Went promised in awe in the first reel, the serene mountaineer  
is degraded by a bride. In the second  
scene he returns, to trust and to upgrade.  
Draw from it the cold  
computer of its own detail.  
There ought to be a wine bottle of a plumed cactus  
imbuing in a university.  
Burnt umber beasts of cummerbund,  
transluscent silvery seams above a spoiled pasture.  
Come with me to the abys of shrapnels.  
The flag knows this,  
that life in it's silk boxes is as endless as the starry sky.  
Amid the transluscent sepia lip of the wind.  
I salute your free  
wine  
and envy your deedy pride.  
The order of the energies I am harassed by laminated sign and bloody feather,  
by abberation and snow.  
A train is not enough to silence me and keep me  
from the room of your great curiosities.  
I took on obscene fellowships.  
Standing a jar  
woke in the verdure wind.  
Halfway.  
Nobody here is waiting for the next precision.  
Knave. You created yourself for lighting.
