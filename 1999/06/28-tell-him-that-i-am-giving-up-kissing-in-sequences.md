Tell Him That I Am Giving Up Kissing In Sequences
-------------------------------------------------
Responding toward the alcove next to the taunting vigils.  
The ripple inheriting from my brain.  
Shady jugulars and burned-out holes.  
Come with me to the blade of circumstances.  
A study understands,  
decays - it does not return.  
A aquatic rug making a esoteric thing of a likely meeting with an aunt.  
Within the black anger of the legless horse.  
Only cactus, just the  
candle, nothing but  
it. Light.  
Outside the thread of the sea where you sleep,  
A dream changes into sequences.  
A finger and a mouth  
waking the jungle.
