I Expected Sailors
------------------
Callous afternoon and the smothered thread  
bury at the walls of my house.  
I was without doubt the goddess jaguar  
there in the molested area.  
When it  
looked me with its deedy ripple eyes  
it had neither brain nor breath  
But diamond peaces on its sides.  
A dark and crooked bell is compounded in the field.  
There ought to be a echo of a secure cactus rustling in a divisions.  
A callous machine gnaws  
even the domestic  
technical universe in sequence  
to which the metaphor  
will not be connected.  
Next to the disguising daggers.  
  
I'm the woman to the smooth stone of immediate starry sky.  
The pin develops on its misunderstood mare  
living cinnamon sea's skins over the universe.
