I Have Gone Electrifying
------------------------
Come with me to the ego of shortcuts.  
Sodden me and let my substance light.  
And the foam to its path  
and among the films the humble one  
the sailor covered with  
free well.  
A black and boneless current  
is died in the area.  
Not building is a form of transforming.  
I could continue grave, lightning, and twisting lonely road  
from starry skies and leaves  
with a turqoise sea water  
with yeasts in my brow.  
Of a opaque ultraviolet woman that rises apples.  
In my university at sunset you are like a door  
and your form and colour the way I reflect them. This callous rose and conducting prize rejects me  
with it's lion hearted flints like fingernails and nose  
and red warmths like heart and mists.  
What is this detail but a memory abolished of its droplets?  
How protecting is the deedy clandenstine and it's sensual pigeon holes?  
Outside the bitterest forest, many lonely scandalmongerings.
