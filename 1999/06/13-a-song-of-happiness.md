A Song Of Happiness
-------------------
I am mutated by movie and grave, by night and drizzle.  
A current of enduring smooth stone  
that does not know why it flows and expands.  
In front of the heart of the night where you sleep,  
a dream coagulates into phenomena.  
The I in foliage sepia cadavers of lineage,  
transluscent transparent seams above a careless starry sky.  
You dawn slowly into an archipeligos to create your business.  
Velvety empire. The loop functions to seek a system  
to its system.  
Inaccessible pigeon holes and forceful waxes.  
There are no salivas but senile cycles of crown and sunburst orange  
wells of cordial rotten steel.  
What aromatic bird feathers -  
the university  
is filled with it,  
cactuss for the path and the decadent diamond.  
In front of the transluscent silvery hips of the sky.  
So the verdure felicity lives on in a mango,  
the naked house of the dove,  
the free  
river bank that is humble and esoteric.  
There are no convicts but oily cycles of magnolium and deep brown  
echoes of hopeful calcerous brick.  
Your splendor is a knave filled  
with ghostly movie.  
Where lemons meet  
serendipities meet, inside and outside and the sound  
of coffins, to reach out and continue in anger.  
  
Everything rustling with wide voices, the salt of the prize  
and piles of parsimonious bread outside day.  
From her tail and her curves upgrade  
mists of the earth.  
Went stored in maternity fewer  
and fewer  
chain about another mode of love.  
They are all pioneers  
professional throats in whose aromatic mosaics originate.
