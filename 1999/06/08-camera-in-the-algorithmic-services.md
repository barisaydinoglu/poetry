Camera In The Algorithmic Services
----------------------------------
Nothing but that pullulation of poppies. When the vicinity is full of negligent arm  
with oxides and windy ironous bells  
and the frail veins and the phemonanas  
at last give forth their bruised lamprey.  
Violenet midnight and the banal snow  
undulate at the walls of my house.  
Amid cashmire water and sunburst orange souls.  
Bitter early light of day and the brutal branch  
brainwash at the walls of my house.  
  
We open the halves of a funny things and the  
abandoning of stalactites inherits into the celestial jungle.  
From pillow of fog to blade of grass,  
hidden curtains drawn by stationary channels, a  
dilute energy begins to wet.  
In my region at holiday you are like a sea's skin  
and your form and colour the way I connect them.  
The receptacle imposes nessecity.  
Nothing but your secure shoulder.  
Book of a changed sticky friendship.  
Not to travel or even meet  
the cathedral of one who imbues  
among me in a field or continuing to a pioneer.
