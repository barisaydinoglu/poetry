Tonight I Can Form
------------------
A home focuses its dream of a new ending, its new beginning, the beginning of the miracle order -  
its starry parallel lampreyss.  
I do not erupt in the universe of lashed invasion.  
Conversations of waves,  
the recitation  
of windows we call secure vein.  
Brutal coffins and senile shardss of silk.
