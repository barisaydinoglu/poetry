Behind Of Star And Alcove
-------------------------
To the sanguine color of the paper-mache sun.  
In the cashmire lip of the jungle.  
The monastic root  
gave it honor.  
Brings all the smothers moons.  
  
Sifted weather, hollow lights like the echo.  
When you play like light entertained by the lightning.  
Angel.  
Shatter me and let my substance excite.  
As if to condemn or weave or faint.  
A triangle inside a circle,  
the blood-stained workings of balanced law.  
Like errors flying among aromas.
