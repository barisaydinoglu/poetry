There Is No Error
-----------------
Pulled out and shut out like a horse.  
The railroad track wetting from  
my toe.  
I could rustle conglomerate, enemy, and heart  
from sun rises and hats  
with a opaque dark muscle  
with panics in my tail.  
The order of the ships but the reflection understood the memory.
