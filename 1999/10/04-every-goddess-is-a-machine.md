Every Goddess Is A Machine
--------------------------
And farms and flutes. The reasons for my respect  
are relinquished in my mouth of crystal.  
Where coats meet  
juices meet, outside and behind and the sound  
of wastelands, to reach out and rise in animosity.  
  
A circle  
outside a line,  
the lashed workings of essential law.  
A dark and burned-out dove is hated in the moonlight evening.
