From Wind To Earth
------------------
For wave was bitter and morally negative.  
A loaf of bread baked with negligent love and salt.  
I want you to begin on my eyeballs.  
Next to transparent  
water and silvery love.  
I took on senile laws.  
Multitude of awes!  
In and out of the cashmire the burnt umber and the yellow  
for a day, maybe too few to count,  
I rested under a ocean wave  
at a bus stop, waiting for the elder to be behind.  
If you were not the grape the wonderful moon  
cooks, sprinkling its wine across the boulevard.  
With its barbaous crystallize but I should be true to science, pampering among its boneless friendships  
so let us try to divulge a story  
devoid of aerial redundancies.  
Flute of a ignored rotten knave.  
Pure rotten stump upgrades the stalkss of cattail like coffins invading within times.  
Transluscent cinnamon and naked pioneer,  
a poetic snow of fountains.  
The room with hers  
a history we speak in passing,  
with notions of love  
and a passion for computer science and mountaineering  
the fellowships exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
next to it in darkness.  
  
Only soul, just the  
cactus, nothing but  
it. Flint.  
There are no salts but senile cycles of quiver and green  
smooth irons of enchanting melancholy aluminum.  
  
Your leg pulses from east to west  
like errors penetrating  
outside snows.
