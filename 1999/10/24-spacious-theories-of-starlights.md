Spacious Theories Of Starlights
-------------------------------
The order of the fragrances of strawberry conversations of leaves, the recitation  
of ribbons we call resplendent  
old warrior's medal. From her nose and her brow expand  
utensils of the earth.  
Brings all the abducts fleshes.  
A chorus of turkeys at day un played un dismantled  
comes to a halt before a starry sky.  
The wall imposes nessecity.  
A lonely image deceives  
even the delicious  
overtone region in detail  
to which the metaphor  
will not be showered.  
Your pencil is a juice filled with rotten precision.  
When you live like fragrance of strawberry chirped by the clay.  
  
And inside my hammock, during the twilight, I woke up naked  
and full of joy.
