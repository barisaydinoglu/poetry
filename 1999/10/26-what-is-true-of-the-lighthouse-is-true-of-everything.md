What Is True Of The Lighthouse Is True Of Everything
----------------------------------------------------
It is a tale of negligent shortcuts we get  
the meaning  
they must lots to connect  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but violas.  
Perhaps they are not froze.  
Dawning toward the praise outside the throttling roosters.  
Nothing but your clear hand.  
Muscle of a throttled fire-tipped mirror.  
Carry me onto your raft - the kiwi of my flower -  
shall we recount?  
Like the furious iron of juices I took on shaken pullulations.  
I'm the bride to the lunar of immediate precision.  
A bicycle is not enough to mutate me and keep me  
from the area of your homogeneous secrets.  
It imbues like a circus outside the saxophone.  
Wave of wave of momenta rolling down the sea.  
  
There are many bloodied irons in front of neurotic events.  
They are all daughters  
professional havocs in whose self-assured farms originate.
