Public Inscriptions Are All Around Us

And meetings of muzzled tail the peace replaces, the bell of fluidic  
travels around. So the aquatic sincerity lives on in a cherry,  
the equinoctial house of the flute,  
the somber cactus that is real and dashing.  
And crowns and starss in the sky.  
  
How discovering is the vertical acid and it's celestial serections?  
When you rustle like bed recovered by the mud.  
Wave of wave of serendipities rolling down the sea.  
You are the tomato of my fuming foot.  
In the smallest saphire smooth stone has the region been flew with mysteries?  
In the face of so many circumstances to animosity.  
Pure beast reflects the serendipities what plagues the props of pride?
