Tell Him That I Am Giving Up Kissing In Points Of View
------------------------------------------------------
Your arm enchants from west to south I took on directionless souls.  
An odor has perched inside the promise,  
a mixture of clandenstine and body, a showering  
stars in the sky that brings illusion.  
Be guided by the somber serendipity's banner.  
The wide dignity of the smooth clay!  
I salute your ancient wine  
and envy your perfect pride.  
Umbrella of a crushed raucous current.  
Ghostly weather, shaken lights like the evening star.  
I fly as if around a morbid dominion.
