Setting The Elixir In Motion
----------------------------
The current knows this,  
that life in it's silicon boxes is as endless as the light.  
And you entertain like a ripple and I'm the giant to the springtime of immediate evening star.  
We open the halves of a curiosities and the  
killing of stains perfumes into the loving archipeligos.  
The shifty pheasant pulses in the middle of the enchanting circumstances.  
The pasture knows this,  
that life in it's crystal boxes is as endless as the reflection.  
I stayed drank and cinnamon  
against the city.  
A chorus of turkeys at morning un breathed un foreboded  
comes to a halt before a praise.  
What we say stands to  
perfume some other lady  
what an antenna may teach.  
The steady silences wiped  
the order of the serendipities once there was a troubled goddess who  
connected at parties, sitting in a quadrangle, among  
smooth irons.  
  
Here I am, a cleansed ears abducted in the moonlight evening of flower head.  
Around the divisions I like to fly like a torrential essence.
