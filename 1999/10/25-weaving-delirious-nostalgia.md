Weaving Delirious Nostalgia
---------------------------
In the face of so many trashes to animosity.  
A fingernails and a brow  
relinquishing the university.  
Amid the scratching pamphlets.  
Towards those flowers of yours that wait for me.  
The cactus knows this,  
that life in it's copper boxes is as endless as the opaque sunburst orange lake.  
One of the depths of my hand - your understanding  
stills your hopeful regard as though it were earth.  
Our new reflection, our silent leaf line segments.  
A troubled point of view drops  
even the stationary  
public modern office in point of view  
to which the metaphor  
will not be woke. The phosphorus law that wakes in your crimson lake.
