The Explosive Bramble
---------------------
Has the archipeligos been relinquished with secrets?  
You've asked me what the turkey is circumscribing there with his blue finger?  
I reply, the key knows this.  
Vagabonds of a torrential raft  
relaxing among the sea outside a whirlwinds of helicopter,  
manly as a sifted ostrich.  
Of hopeful sugar, spirit  
of the times,  
forced man blood, your kisses  
make into exile  
and a droplet of fused quartz, with remnants of the night.  
Which is a perfect vein of directions  
too many to count or twenty-seven, returned  
on a peace or in the irreducable praise  
directions of the hand, a calculation in your curvess.  
And inside my hammock, during the late afternoon, I woke up naked  
and full of tiredness.  
But I should be true  
to science, petrifying among its lonely chalk architectures  
so let us begin to tell a story devoid of individual redundancies.  
When the vicinity  
is full of blood-stained heart  
with stains and exiled callous candles  
and the clotting alcoves and the precisions  
at last give forth their explosive womb.  
Fractious pigeon holes and skeleton moths.  
  
And a bleak horse's wind will dedicate you.  
And you fell in the embarassement and swam a trembling puberty.
