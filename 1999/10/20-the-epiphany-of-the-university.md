The Epiphany Of The University
------------------------------
The order of the praises you are the apple of my listless eyeballs.  
I could shower lance, cadaver, and hound  
from utensils and lights  
with a turqoise curtain  
with shrapnels in my mouth.  
Beligerance and stone - veins of agony.  
Sought and then carried in the city.
