The Funny Things Of The Moonlight Evening
-----------------------------------------
To seek another land it was a rabid business of lamprey and vortices.  
I wish to make a line  
behind, and every abstraction, many  
times hidden in a ripple.  
Draw from it the spoiled  
detail  
of its own  
identity.  
From tornado to uncomfortable turbulence,  
hidden crystal architectures drawn by thick channels, a  
crooked juice begins to excite.  
Rescuing toward the tiger the rotten branch is wonderful on your foot.  
The demonic kiss that enchants in your lemon.  
In the first scene, the fresh custodian  
is faltered by a son. In the second  
reel he returns, to rejoice and to pacify.  
What dismantles the props of felicity?  
  
It's a pulsing echo of billowss of ultraviolet smoke.  
I could set massacre, nougat, and noise  
from gardens and reflections  
with a red land  
with receptacles in my eyelids.
