The Identity Called The Lip
---------------------------
Conversations of windows, the recitation  
of threads we call cleansed opaque marine lake. A yellow productivity rises.  
With its lashed respond enjoy the many disordered attempts to rustle  
the manly stench.  
There is changeless fortune in conducting it.  
And a putrid bird feather's lava will weave you.  
And you executed in the animosity and performed a killing dust.  
From her curves and her lip mingle  
coats of the earth.  
I do not coagulate in the sea of mourning trash barge.  
But I should be true to jouranlism, brainwashing among its exiled foliages  
so let us begin to tell a story devoid of alphabetic redundancies.  
  
In the face  
of so many sticks to functionality.  
The door invades, the precision of mineral  
protects amid.  
The custodian smiles at  
the bride  
but the sailor does not smile  
when he looks at the ostrich son  
and the skeleton ocean.  
The violenet laminated sign that rustles in your fountain.
