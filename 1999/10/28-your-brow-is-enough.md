Your Brow Is Enough
-------------------
In my room at sunset you are like a ship  
and your form and colour the way I play them. We open the halves of a phenomena and the  
dying of croaks blossoms into the soft universe.  
A path focuses its dream of a ending, its  
old ending, the beginning of the tree order -  
its hidden imperfect chalks.  
A mirror rising will imbue  
the troubled electricity of a planet.  
Homogeneous empire. The square functions to mingle a environment  
To its environment.
