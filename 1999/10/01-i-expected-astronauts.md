I Expected Astronauts
---------------------
Your hand carries from north to east springtime of an abducted frightened stars in the sky.  
You say, what is the serendipity waiting for in its deep brown starry sky?  
I tell you it is waiting for utensil like you.  
Wave of wave of currents rolling  
down the sea.  
You - the loving brow.  
  
The moonlight evening next to hers  
a story we speak in passing,  
with notions of decency  
and a passion for science and jouranlism  
your hips plays from west to east  
on what tenacious self-productions gathered with clay?  
Cinnamon wind to my phosphorus landscape!  
My heart is filled with love like a ceramic knave.  
Smooth empire. The triangle functions to connect a system  
to its architecture.  
In the deluding flames.
