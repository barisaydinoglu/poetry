Hollow Miracle
--------------
I could build billow of brimstone smoke, granule, and bloody feather  
from perfumes and spheres  
with a rust colored hoove  
with depths in my leg. Carry me onto your airplane - the lemon of my well -  
the I in serenity what condemns the props of pride?  
Tiredness is gone, the subject has  
relaxed.  
Because I love you, love, in the fire and in front of the jungle.
