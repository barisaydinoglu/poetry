From Wind To Ice
----------------
Marine sky to my shifty silence! Some begin but I mix your metal like cluster.  
We get the faith  
they must lots to enchant  
to each other  
or perhaps  
nothing but felicities.  
Perhaps they are not crushed.  
Neither old warrior's medal nor splendor nor dull shades of green  
nor opaque burnt umber but crimson.
