The Frail One
-------------
If you were not the nectarine the moonlit moon  
cooks, sprinkling its bread across the room. The equinoctial bridge gave it purity. A chorus of jaguars at early light of day un mixed un smothered  
comes to a halt before a starlight.  
I wish to make a circle  
in front of, and every hearing, many  
times hidden in a goblet.  
I salute your resolute orange  
and envy your self-assured pride.  
The peace buries, the moon of aromatic  
blossoms amid.  
Not transforming is a form of blossoming.  
Within the blue tail of the heat.  
But I should be untrue to photography, erupting among its muzzled atoms  
so let us try to tell a story without algorithmic redundancies.
