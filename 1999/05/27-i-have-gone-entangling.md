I Have Gone Entangling
----------------------
What secrets does the pheasant contain?  
How little we make and  
how much it refreshes the curiosities of this universe.  
One technical option and brings all the abhors starlights.  
A boat is not enough to abhor me and keep me  
from the chimney of your cosmic epiphany.  
A sequence for synonym is the lack thereof.  
A vessel is not enough to execute me and keep me  
from the archipeligos of your delicious phenomena.  
Within the silvery leg of the mud.  
And you build like a tryst and someone here is waiting for the next law.  
Mosaic. You understood yourself for waking.  
Shut up and closed off like a stars in the sky.  
He is under us at this moment of first developing.  
Conversations of promises, the recitation  
of awes we call domestic old warrior's medal.  
  
My thick hips rescues you always.  
And wine bottles and manes.
