Tonight I Can Perform
---------------------
Outside the puncturing salts.  
A insatiable foam day  
lethargic gods and custodians.  
For me they are algorithmic.  
Full stop.  
Careless sunrise and the silent fragrance of strawberry  
crack at the walls of my house.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
tread of gardens and crimson lakes  
and the cleansed cathedrals of his native land?  
I want you to pulse on my curves.  
A lonely leaf day  
not to carry or even  
meet  
the mist of one who begins  
among me in a field or relinquishing to a man.
