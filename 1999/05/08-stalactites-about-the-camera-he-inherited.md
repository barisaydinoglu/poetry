Stalactites About The Camera He Inherited
-----------------------------------------
Enjoy the many boney attempts to attract  
the delicate vagabond.  
There is resolute fortune in pulsing it.  
I pacify as if next to a browbeaten stench.  
But the star built the memory.  
Carry me onto your vessel - the kiwi of my transparent lake -  
There ought to be a silence of a rosy sea water building in a heights.  
Where threads meet  
bird feathers meet, around and outside and the sound  
of traps, to reach out and re-cover in animosity.  
  
I wish to make a square  
in, and every color, many  
times hidden in an autumn.
