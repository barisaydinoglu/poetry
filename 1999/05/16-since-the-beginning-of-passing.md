Since The Beginning Of Passing
------------------------------
Because I love you, love, in the lightning and amid the ice.  
Shut out and pulled out like a tree.  
Like bloodied sand dropping outside landscapes.  
I took on atrocious mosaics.  
Rusted fortnight and the acidulous echo  
dismantle at the walls of my house.  
Only saxophone, just the  
angel, nothing but  
it. Ribbon.  
To seek another land once there was a senile woman who  
rose at parties, sitting in a circle, among hats.  
What is this projection but a memory flew of its knaves?  
I am prosecuted by love and howl, by imperfect wooden and sun.  
  
In your heart of ignoring the city  
begins to dream of creating.  
A foot and a hand  
enchanting the city.
