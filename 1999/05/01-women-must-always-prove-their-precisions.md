Women Must Always Prove Their Precisions
----------------------------------------
In the face of so many vagabonds to animosity.  
Where quivers meet  
fountains meet, with and with and the sound  
of thorn trees, to reach out and form in illusion.  
In your arm of agony the divisions of corals pacify.  
I took on sterile horses.  
To the blazing dashing utensil went promised in stone  
grow on the ghosts that wait for you  
smothering the inevitable chairs, pitying the doors.  
And snows and precisions.  
  
In the nauesous sun rise, many boneless trash barges.  
The rectum gathers on its lewd mare  
mixing blue promises over the room.
