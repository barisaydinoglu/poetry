Breeding Moonlit Affection
--------------------------
As if to plague or reflect or congeal.  
The tiger plan that has everyone imperalist.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
seize of silences and farms  
and the great rituals of his native land?  
A current of homogeneous landscape  
that does not  
know  
why it flows and builds.  
Shall we set forth? One of them is sensible,  
the other knows languages.  
Where is everybody  
he quips, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?
