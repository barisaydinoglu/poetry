Setting The Cashmire Lake In Motion
-----------------------------------
You - the soft mouth.  
A love trusting will wet  
the frightened lava of a planet.  
Wave of wave of lemons rolling down the sea.  
I saw how telegraphs are fluttered  
by the pure light.  
A irreducable rain of peaces.  
Outside the protesting gates.  
Tree of a shattered shady breakfast.
