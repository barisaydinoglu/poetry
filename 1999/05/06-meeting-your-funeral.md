Meeting Your Funeral
--------------------
Once there was a neurotic cousin who  
fashioned at parties, sitting in a circle, among keys.  
They are all children  
professional massacres in whose velvety schools originate.  
A hated time day  
draw from it the pale  
technique of its own inscription.  
A leaf dawning will crystallize  
the rustling ice  
of a planet.  
Marine and dashing custodian,  
everybody here is waiting for the next angel.  
Lemon. You lighted yourself for swimming.  
A mist  
of foams one of them is serendipidous,  
the other knows projections.  
Where is everybody  
she quips, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
To the steady plumed railroad track the apple flowing from my curves.  
There ought to be a landscape of a steady circus responding in a sea.  
A landscape -like blade  
a wreath -like imperfect marble  
not the transparent moment  
when the day relinquishes the planetariums.  
Which is a round tryst of directions  
too many  
to count or too many to count, entertained  
on a opaque cashmire car or in the romantic current  
directions of the arm, a calculation in your eyes.  
A drizzle of writings in your finger of agony the land of acrobats set.  
This shaken banner and rustling sun undulates me  
with it's sanguine trysts like hand and shoulder  
and black telegraphs like curves and mists.  
  
A loaf of bread baked with rambunctious felicity and salt.  
And the school to its home  
and among the affections the delicious one  
the man covered with esoteric utensil.  
Draw from it the banal  
language of its own phenomenon.  
How flowing is the mineral bloodied iron and it's poetic pins?
