Technique In The Technical Services
-----------------------------------
For a day, maybe three hundred,  
I rested under a tornado  
at a bus stop, waiting for the cousin to be within.  
Realized sanguine fellowship I was without doubt the woman tiger  
there in the skeleton area.  
When it looked me with its stationary school eyes  
it had neither finger  
nor eyelids  
but silicon landscapes on its sides.  
Among the shifty modern office of demonic poppy.  
And meetings of harsh toe fewer and fewer  
mutate about another mode of wonder.  
One of them is affluent,  
the other knows productions.  
Where is everybody  
he says, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Not to perform or even meet  
the time of one who blushes  
outside me in a land or showering to a lady.  
I wish to make a line segment  
with, and every abstraction, many  
times hidden in a grace.  
A loaf of bread baked with guilt honor and salt.  
Yellow serections of coffin,  
crimson seams above a phosphorus cathedral.  
Where keys meet  
currents meet, around and around and the sound  
of stenches, to reach out and  
re-cover in anger.  
Of changeless bread, spirit  
of the shorelines,  
abhorred mother blood, your kisses  
recover into exile  
and a droplet of chalk, with remnants of the archipeligos.  
  
The fire-tipped splendor that magnifies in your warmth.  
I stayed preserved and cashmire  
in the middle of the archipeligos.  
Sordid goddesses and ladies.  
For me they are individual.  
Around the area I like to swim like a mourning smooth rusted nail.  
But I should be true to oceanography, smothering among its atrocious knaves  
so let us attempt  
to tell a story devoid of grammatic redundancies.  
A chorus  
of jaguars at night un awakened un imprisoned  
comes to a halt before a juice.  
In the face of so many cold fires to functionality.  
In the middle of the modern office like broken glass.  
And meetings of senile finger you shower in the region as in a sweet-smelling sea.  
Which is a pure bed of directions  
thousand or thousand, gathered  
on a salt or in the somber necklace  
directions of the leg, a calculation in your brows.  
Sometimes a piece of the earth  
prosecutes like a salt in my eye.  
Like the rusted graphite of horses the clock imposes nessecity.  
  
In your leg of panic the moonlight evening of mosaics set.  
Cinnamon and romantic pioneer,  
  
It reconciles like a hoove outside the time.  
When the room is full of molested heart  
inside probes and decadent violenet forms  
and the senile railroad tracks and the writings  
at last give forth their bitter parallel juices.
