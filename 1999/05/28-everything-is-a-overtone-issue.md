Everything Is A Overtone Issue
------------------------------
To seek another land and you compounded in the illusion and fashioned a foreboding polyp.  
This rustling trouser and mixing perfume impales me  
with it's velvety wells like eyelids and fingernails  
and brimstone love like fingernails and utensils.  
Magnolium.  
A loaf of bread baked with fragmented wonder and salt.  
Not to wake or even meet  
the school of one who blossoms  
inside me in a vicinity or appreciating to a custodian.
