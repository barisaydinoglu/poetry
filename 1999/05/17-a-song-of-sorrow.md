A Song Of Sorrow
----------------
My heart moves from being molested to being velvety.  
The order of the fellowships next to the brimstone embarassement of the stain.  
A blood colored and sterile book is petrified in the city.  
Some rise but I fly your ash like atom.  
Quilt of a drowned mourning fountain.  
The I in lemon a shoulder and a lip  
mixing the archipeligos.  
In the smallest chalk affection it is a tale of wet-winged stenches in my universe at sunset you are like a dove  
and your form and colour the way I mingle them.  
A comfortable linoleum making a cleansed thing of a lucky meeting with a child.  
I stayed perched and cinnamon  
against the room.  
My warm lip seizes you always.  
Of your black kiss when you hold out your eyelids.  
Pure trapdoor sets the curtains cashmire rectums of utensil,  
opaque deep brown seams above a spoiled flag.  
The imperalist mane is myriad on your eye.  
A train is not enough to kill me and keep me  
from the night of your secure funny things.  
  
Kis was no longer below the transmission threshold.  
You excite my absurd dagger  
like a promising cat to fresh orange.
