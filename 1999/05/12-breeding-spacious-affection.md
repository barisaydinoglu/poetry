Breeding Spacious Affection
---------------------------
The I in law as if to pass or begin or ignore.  
The lady smiles at the sailor  
but the sailor does not smile  
when he looks at the crab one  
and the thirsty ocean.  
Because I love you, love, in front of the earth and with the fire.  
Not to respond or even meet  
the utensil of one who sets  
outside me in a region or creating to a father.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the secure praises?  
And the mist real  
splattering its cinnamon cars and rejecting them full of  
vicinity and toucan?  
We open the halves of a phenomena and the  
wiping of clocks showers into the hopeful moonlight evening.  
Astronaut of the depths of my heart - your recovering  
stills your ancient regard as though it were electricity.  
A blood-stained image disguises  
even the sanguine  
algorithmic archipeligos in calculation  
to which the metaphor  
will not be reflected.  
  
To the slender rosy apple what we say pulses to  
rustle some other stranger  
what a phenomenon may teach.  
Behind cashmire water and yellow maps.  
  
As if  
to loathe or build or petrify.
