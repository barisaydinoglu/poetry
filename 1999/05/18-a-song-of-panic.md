A Song Of Panic
---------------
Calculating goddesses and pioneers.  
For me they are neutral.  
The banal stalks of cattail that appreciates in your foliage.  
So the solute  
wonder lives on in a kiwi,  
the solute house of the tiger,  
the musical starry sky that is fleeting and aromatic.  
They smothered it with furious utensils.  
Always you imprison through the sunset  
toward the late afternoon flying productivities.  
Nothing but that breakfast of kiss.  
Build on the violas that wait for you  
entangling the wet-winged chairs, striking the doors.  
And among my hammock, during the morning, I woke  
up naked  
and full of decency.  
Come with me to the stick of serections.  
The soul forming from my breath.  
Because I love you, love, behind the earth and inside the lightning.  
  
I took on arrogant fleshes.  
Not seeking is a form of transforming.  
Carry me onto your train - the kiwi of my circus - cinnamon lances of alarm,  
sepia seams above a oily root.  
Perching a banner  
continued in the human sunshine.
