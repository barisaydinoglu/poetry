Since The End Of Shattering
---------------------------
The windy squirrel shines inside the round probes.  
Of eager sugar, spirit  
of the fellowships,  
executed sailor blood, your kisses  
relax into exile  
and a droplet of saphire, with remnants of the chimney.  
And  
meetings of sticky eyeballs you, who is like a hole squirrel among the divulging of many god.  
A tail and a eyelids  
beginning the city.
