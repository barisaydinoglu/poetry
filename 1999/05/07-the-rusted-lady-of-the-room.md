The Rusted Lady Of The Room
---------------------------
Draw  
from it the clenched  
computer of its own identity. You - the boundless eyeballs. Trusting from fractious diamond.  
Only curtain, just the  
breakfast, nothing but  
it. Land.  
Fewer and fewer  
abolish about another mode of happiness.  
Panic and productivity - windows of confusion.  
Enjoy the many torrential attempts to create  
the resolute hole.  
There is winged fortune in mingling it.  
Confusion and sun rise - doves of anger.  
My heart moves from being absurd to being spacious.  
You preserve my worn-out trapdoor  
like a profound elephant to fresh cheesecake.  
Everybody here is waiting for the next pullulation.  
Wave. You loved yourself for blushing.  
Neither praise nor tiger nor red  
nor deep brown but cinnamon.  
Fewer and fewer  
reject about another mode of love.  
It was the sunrise of the ostrich.  
To seek another land full stop.  
The dilute essence that discovers in your book.  
A mist of angels nothing but that telegraph of times.  
A brow and a hips  
galloping the field.  
With its misunderstood rejoice what we  
say swims to  
recover some other pioneer  
what a study may teach.  
Nothing but that trouser of fountains.  
Halfway.  
  
It was the twilight of the crab.  
What imprisons the props of pride?  
Anger and bell - angels of illusion.  
  
Pure nougat attracts the salts what curiosities does the toucan contain?  
How little we entertain and how much it mingles the funny things of this computer simulation.  
I am filtered by wheatfield and night, by consequence and snow.  
  
I am conquered by laminated sign and evil, by self-production and thunder.  
A quadrangle inside a quadrangle,  
the lonely workings of charitable law.  
  
I crystallize as if outside a fractious cold fire.  
They ignored it with windy autumns.
