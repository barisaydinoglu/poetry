The Bleak Sailor Of The Thicket
-------------------------------
I took  
on hated waves.  
My aromatic lip rescues you always.  
And quivers and eddies.  
The autumn dawns in performing your brain.  
And you perch like a honeysuckle and I saw how coats are built  
by the pure sun.  
Atrocious twilight and the dilute moon  
pity at the walls of my house.  
And outside my hammock, during the early light of day, I woke up naked  
and full of decency.  
With its barbaous reconcile the cleansed leaves invaded a reflection -like serection  
bruised weather, molested lights like the mane.  
As soon as the incoming muscles  
gives the slightest indication.
