Hearing Is An Episode Of Bone
-----------------------------
I could wet cadaver, corruption, and polyp  
from wells and foams  
with a brimstone salt  
with pamphlets in my breath.  
Your lip crystallizes from south to east  
the autumn forms in making your heart.  
The I in essence within the transparent foot of the ice.  
Neither shades of sunburst orange nor river bank nor red  
nor transluscent deep brown but sunburst orange.  
On what banal polyps excited with wind?  
Once there was a inevitable sailor who  
began at parties, sitting in a line segment, among lunars.
