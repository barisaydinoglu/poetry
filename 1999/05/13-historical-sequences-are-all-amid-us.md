Historical Sequences Are All Amid Us
------------------------------------
The electricity myriad vaginas are disguised.  
I was without doubt the lady jaguar  
there in the troubled divisions.  
When it looked me with its self-assured faucet eyes  
it had neither toe nor toe  
but wooden sea shells on its sides.  
A loaf of bread baked with wounded happiness and salt.  
A transluscent sand-colored eddy wets.  
As soon as the incoming springtimes  
gives the historical indication.  
What curiosities does the oyster contain?  
How little we attract and how much it magnifies the mysteries of this galaxy.  
Pockets of ash converted into glass.  
What curiosities does the tiger contain?  
How little we shower and how much it perfumes the funny things of this computer simulation.  
The tigers exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
in it in darkness.  
  
And you reflect like a heart and the resplendent aunt  
travels in the monastic morning.
