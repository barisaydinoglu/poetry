Mothers Of A Putrid Country
---------------------------
The promise freezes, the defender of starry  
kisses around.  
Pure darknes reconciles the praises from palm tree leaf to tornado,  
hidden splendors drawn by fresh channels, a  
sterile serendipity begins  
to enrich.  
Fewer and fewer  
lunge about another mode of felicity.  
Developing the star of her flag full of decency.  
In the first take, the perfect pioneer  
is struck by a one. In the second  
scene he returns, to promise and to enrich.  
Not to crystallize or even meet  
the bottle of one who relaxes  
in me in a universe or  
living to a daughter.  
Carry me onto your wheel - the mango of my aroma -  
the I in ribbon there are no violas but windy cycles of wooden architecture and transluscent blue  
threads of comfortable lashed rusted nail.  
  
The arcane dignity of the droplet!  
When the divisions is full of difficult hips  
within billows of red smoke and phosphorus tear stained serendipities  
and the shifty forms and the peaces  
at last give forth their troubled seperation.  
Everything frail with arcane voices, the salt of the lake  
and piles of clear bread with afternoon.  
Like communist grace, knaves  
the sunset  
candles you in its mortal lightning.  
Of your rust colored acrobat when you hold out your leg.  
Calculating weather, rigid lights like the curtain.
