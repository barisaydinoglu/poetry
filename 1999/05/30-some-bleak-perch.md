Some Bleak Perch
----------------
Somebody here is waiting for the next sun.  
Vein. You trod yourself for beginning. What secrets does the elephant contain?  
How little we perfume and how much it protects the funny things of this galaxy.  
What coddles the props of honor?  
  
A breath and a nose  
attracting the field.
