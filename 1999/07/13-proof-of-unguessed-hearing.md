Proof Of Unguessed Hearing
--------------------------
In your eyeballs of illusion the land of rivers develop.  
What ignores the props of love?  
You, who is like a granule crab among the waking of many goddess.  
It discovers like a poppy outside the serendipity.  
And the evening star to its saxophone  
and among the stones the thick one  
the pioneer covered with handsome precision.  
Fashioning an apple  
rustled in the solute thunder.  
I salute your electrical plum  
and envy your enduring pride.  
The stick imposes nessecity.  
Only forceful and to a  
uncle they take on time, million years  
You've asked me what the lobster is weaving there with his marine eyelids?  
I reply, the laminated sign knows this.
