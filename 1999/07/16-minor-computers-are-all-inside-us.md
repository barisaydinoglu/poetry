Joy is gone, the subject has wove.  
Nothing but your angellic arm.  
The stranger smiles at the sailor  
but the man does not smile  
when he looks at the iguana stranger  
and the inevitable ocean.

Here I am, a plumed heart plagued in the sea of school.  
Fleeting empire. The line segment functions to seize an architecture  
to its environment.  
  
Brings all the penetrates dews.
