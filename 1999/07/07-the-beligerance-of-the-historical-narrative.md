The Beligerance Of The Historical Narrative
-------------------------------------------
The one smiles at the pioneer  
but the child does not smile  
when he looks at the oyster daughter  
and the obscene ocean. In front of the blue heart of the earth.  
Performing a foam  
chirped in the original drizzle.  
  
Full stop.
