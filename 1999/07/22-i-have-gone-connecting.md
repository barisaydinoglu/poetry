I Have Gone Connecting
----------------------
A cordial fog of femininities.  
A opaque red and difficult book is replaced in the region.  
Only lewd and to a  
man they take on time, too few to count years  
pure salt inherits the stones my cosmic hand divulges you always.  
Not loving is a form of showering.  
I took on ironous wine bottles.  
There ought to be a poppy of a honest door relaxing in a night.  
Full stop.  
  
This tenacious dew and pulsing thread falls me  
with it's thick doors like finger and finger  
and black love like hand and moons.  
I am scratched by foam and gate, by torrent and drizzle.  
Among the cracking clefts.
