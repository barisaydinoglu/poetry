A Song Of Joy
-------------
In the first scene, the eager pioneer  
is pitied by a mother. In the second  
scene he returns, to stand and to hear.  
Halfway.  
Nocturnal empire. The line functions to make a system  
to its architecture.  
Once there was a mechanical god who  
made at parties, sitting in a line  
segment, among wheatfields.  
They are all custodians  
professional dominions in whose thick ripples originate.  
To discover lost banners and for farms.  
  
A loaf of bread baked with  
parched honor and salt.  
In the smallest paper-mache land has the land been fluttered with phenomena?
