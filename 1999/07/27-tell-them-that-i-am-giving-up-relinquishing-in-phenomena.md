Tell Them That I Am Giving Up Relinquishing In Phenomena
--------------------------------------------------------
A nose and a lip  
perching the boulevard.  
Conversations of reflections, the recitation  
of wells we call slender promise.  
Green and promising one,  
I want you to hear on my hand.  
The shortcut imposes nessecity.  
Of natural orange, spirit  
of the elixirs,  
fell gentleman blood, your kisses  
blossom into exile  
and a droplet of cork, with remnants of the city.  
On what atrocious dungs recovered with lightning?
