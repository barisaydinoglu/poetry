A Banana
--------
Making the banner of her promise full of felicity.  
You are the hairy mountaineer of a crab,  
the muzzled ness of the crown, the power of the electricity.  
Movie of a deprived muzzled muscle.  
I stayed dawned and silvery  
under the city.  
Realized aromatic snow mixed and then imbued in the vicinity.  
Of lovely apple, spirit  
of the faucets,  
passed woman blood, your kisses  
refresh into exile  
and a droplet of marble, with  
remnants of the universe.
