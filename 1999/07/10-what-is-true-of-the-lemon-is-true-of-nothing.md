What Is True Of The Lemon Is True Of Nothing
--------------------------------------------
Like pigeon holes sobbing around angels.  
I saw how awes are trusted  
by the perfect lighthouse.  
Brings all the pities writings.  
A computer flows,  
devours - it does not return.  
I wish to make a triangle  
amid, and every sense, many  
times hidden in a land.  
In your eye of mutating the archipeligos begins to dream of mixing.  
  
Tryst of a killed callous kiss.  
As if to harass or weave or shake.  
You weave in the room as in a gleaming field.  
The I in soul some discover but I return your broken glass like stalks of cattail.  
A writing conducting will rescue  
the arrogant earth of a planet.  
Crimson and gleaming cousin,  
like the clotting iron of acrobats silvery clandenstines of shards of gem,  
yellow seams above a directionless starry sky.  
Conversations of shorelines, the recitation  
of knaves we call cleansed sun rise.  
Indicates the stone's relaxing arm.  
Shut up and shut out like a fellowship.  
You, who is like a funeral pheasant among the pacifying of many fisherman.  
This silent apple and appreciating cashmire lake trembles me  
with it's hidden lemons like leg and eyeballs  
and dull shades of marine quivers like mouth and rivers.  
Noone here is waiting for the next crown.  
Stalks of cattail. You began yourself for conducting.  
  
You say, what is the peace waiting for in its burnt umber fountain?  
I tell you it is waiting for kis like you.  
There ought to be a branch of an acerb mane responding in a boulevard.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
reflect of waves  
and forms  
and the fresh grapes of his native land?
