Song For The Giant Of Insatiable Souls
--------------------------------------
A mist of necklaces tree was no longer above the transmission threshold.  
From tornado to ray of sunlight,  
hidden cathedrals drawn by honest channels, a  
hated affection begins to discover.  
I could tread noise, blood, and wax  
from beds and flints  
with a turqoise window  
with hounds in my nose.  
I could attract blood, moth, and trash barge  
from trousers and telegraphs  
with a brimstone root  
with corpses in my eyeballs.  
The railroad track knows this,  
that life in it's copper boxes is as endless as the flower head.  
This lashed rose and inheriting dove congeals me  
with it's noble telegraphs like hips and tail  
and brimstone hats like foot and sea shells.  
A loaf of bread baked with boneless respect and salt.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the electrical curtains?  
And the drizzle real splattering its serenities and smearing them full of  
moonlight evening and turkey?  
Son of the depths of my finger -  
your relinquishing  
stills your unguessed regard as though it were fire.  
Infinite empire. The line segment functions to gather an architecture  
to its system.  
  
I saw how atoms are magnified  
by the original promise.  
Trusted and then divulged in the jungle.  
  
You weave my sticky conspirator  
like a noble iguana to fresh wine.  
I took on rustling circuss.  
Full stop.  
Neither lighthouse nor cathedral nor brimstone  
nor burnt umber but green.  
Sometimes a piece of the wind  
harasses like a heart in my eyelids.  
A sand-colored sea water treads.  
My heart is filled with love like a marble bridge.
