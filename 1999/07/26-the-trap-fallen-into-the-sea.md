The Trap Fallen Into The Sea
----------------------------
I salute your stationary orange  
and envy your careful pride.  
A quilt chirping will divulge  
the wounded jungle of a planet.  
One aerial option and among the black animosity of the trapdoor.  
And next to my hammock, during the early light of day, I woke up naked  
and full of decency.
