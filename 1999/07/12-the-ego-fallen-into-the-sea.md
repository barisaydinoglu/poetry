The Ego Fallen Into The Sea
---------------------------
Only lunar, just the  
wreath, nothing but  
it. Ritual.  
The angel plan that has everyone thirsty.  
In your heart of prosecuting the area begins to dream of dawning.  
To respond lost breakfasts and for  
productivities.  
A projection wakes,  
abolishes - it does not return.
