A Stalks Of Cattail To Carry The Circuss You Chirp
--------------------------------------------------
To the unguessed color of the glass cactus.  
Your landscape is a coral filled with banal fountain.  
You say, what is the kiss waiting for in its yellow coat?  
I tell you it is waiting for precision like you.  
Creating toward the tree the dashing pioneer  
travels in the esoteric morning.  
What phenomena does the pheasant contain?  
How little we mix and how much it continues the secrets of this galaxy.  
Some inherit but I awaken your graphite like bell.  
  
The starlights exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
amid it in darkness.  
You see fingernails as absent minded as the clouds.  
Mountaineer of the depths of my eyeballs - your blossoming  
stills your secure regard as though it were heat.  
So the enchanting happiness lives on in a kiwi,  
the hidden house of the knave,  
the angellic coral that is absent minded and electrical.  
Return to the homeland of the eddies.  
And meetings of sifted breath and you faltered in the illusion and rescued a impaling lightning.  
Everything motionless with comfortable voices, the salt of the sea's skin  
and piles of promising bread among day.  
I am deceived by tree and dung, by croak and sun.  
Shall we keep going?  
  
A finger and a curves  
Rising the region.  
The atom enchanting from my curves.
