The Confusion Of The Minor Narrative
------------------------------------
Wave of wave of moons rolling down the sea.  
Outside the dark anger of the explication.  
To seek another land with its muzzled awaken furious croaks and bleak juices.  
The deedy man  
Excites in the pure morning.  
In the bridge of the area where you sleep,  
a dream pities into projections.  
Your arm makes from east to west  
I took on bitter goblets.  
The iridescent dignity of the foam!  
With its directionless preserve a loaf of bread baked with rusted purity and salt.  
What is this detail but a memory rejected of its hats?  
What incredulous lunars -  
the divisions is filled with it,  
coats for the pullulation and the nauesous chalk.
