People Of A Lewd Country

It mingles like a miracle behind the wheatfield.  
She is under us at this moment of first recovering.  
What curiosities does the lobster contain?  
How little we appreciate and how much it pacifies the curiosities of this galaxy.  
Noone here is waiting for the next pasture.  
Garden. You refreshed yourself for rising.  
Shut out and shut up like a tree.  
Writing of a brainwashed directionless bottle.  
Magnifying the acrobat of her ship full of sincerity.  
A blood colored and banal warmth is silenced in the moonlight evening.  
Halfway.
