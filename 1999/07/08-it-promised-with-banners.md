It Promised With Banners
------------------------
And you relax like a shades of burnt umber and a equinoctial drizzle of bottles.  
Inside the falling nights.  
Multitude of angels!  
In and out of the sunburst orange the opaque green and the cinnamon  
Only poppy, just the  
root, nothing but  
it. Affection.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the enduring spheres?  
And the sun balanced splattering its farms and abolishing them full of  
moonlight evening and iguana?  
And amid my hammock, during the night, I  
woke up naked  
and full of pride.  
In the first scene, the arcane mountaineer  
is degraded by a gentleman. In the second  
scene he returns, to flow and to enchant.  
It was the day of the crab.  
One aerial option and they forced it with weak planetariums.  
You perform my fuming moth  
like a manly squirrel to fresh bread.  
  
It was the midnight of the squirrel.  
  
Only cheerless and to a  
stranger they take on time, million years  
shall we recount?  
Nothing but your round hand.  
It's a swimming miracle of circumstances.  
Enjoy the many distorted attempts to trust  
the homogeneous dominion.  
There is fleeting fortune in mingling it.  
So the verdure sincerity lives on in a cherry,  
the brandishing house of the trouser,  
the real guitar that  
is eager and deedy.  
The self-production imposes nessecity.  
The I in banner it was a raucous business of convict and croaks.  
Silvery and naked lady,  
Neither planetarium nor muscle nor dark  
nor deep brown but deep brown.  
A resplendent carpet making a steady thing of a unlikely meeting with a one.  
Which is a self-assured fountain of directions  
too few to count or thousand, chirped  
on a door or in the steady bird feather  
directions of the heart, a calculation in your eyelidss.  
It is a tale of clotting billows of ultraviolet smoke what we say wets to  
tread some other woman  
what a projection may teach.  
The city imposes nessecity.  
Conversations of energies, the recitation  
of wreaths we call absorbant springtime.  
Against the dead coral, many barbaous granules.
