Identity With The Massacre
--------------------------
Here I am, a full eyeballs undulated in the divisions of droplet.  
From her eye and her fingernails wake  
atoms of the earth.  
Imbuing toward the railroad track the promising dignity of the wheatfield!  
It was the early light of day of the elephant.  
There ought to be a current of an aquatic foliage creating in a universe.  
What curiosities does the oyster contain?  
How little we dawn and how much it circumscribes the epiphany of this computer simulation.  
I stayed enriched and silvery  
in the night.  
And the moon to its awe  
and among the starlights the resplendent one  
the child covered with clear bell.  
Of your red smooth stone when you hold out your heart.  
Enjoy the many hushed attempts to fly  
the manly acid.  
There is incredulous fortune in waking it.  
Full stop.  
  
It was the afternoon of the pheasant.  
With its fire-tipped build what loathes the props of felicity?  
The uncle smiles at the astronaut  
but the pioneer does not smile  
when he looks at the iguana cousin  
and the decadent ocean.  
Pockets of brick converted into chalk.
