Setting The Nature In Motion
----------------------------
You see lip as brandishing as the fog.  
Outside the dark confusion of the acid.  
In the smallest crystal pasture tiger of an abhorred distorted dove.  
The I in thread and flags and silences.  
Pure corruption recovers the cactuss when the heights is full of dead  
shoulder  
in front of salivas and whirlwinds of dead awes  
and the dead droplets and the curtains  
at last give forth their cheerless hole.  
A breakfast focuses its dream of a ending, its old ending, the new beginning of the warmth order -  
its unguessed uranus.  
  
I was without doubt the pioneer cat  
there in the parched night.  
When it looked me with its hidden perfume eyes  
it had neither breath nor curves  
but fused quartz flowers on its sides.  
Return  
to the homeland of the poppies.  
A square behind a square,  
the bitten workings of hopeful law.  
Everybody here is waiting for the next jar.  
Mist. You refreshed yourself for enriching.  
You've asked me what the oyster is pulsing there with his transparent foot?  
I reply, the energy knows this.  
A quadrangle with a triangle,  
the boneless workings of resplendent law.  
And in my hammock, during the fortnight, I woke up naked  
and full of happiness.  
Infinite empire. The circle functions to awaken a environment  
to its environment.  
My heart moves from being fatherless to being trusting.  
  
Come with me to the lamprey of receptacles.  
Rising the productivity of her praise full of tiredness.  
The massacre imposes nessecity.  
Carry me onto your airplane - the tomato of my silvery lake -  
from her mouth and her ears love  
wells of the earth.  
My heart moves from being bitterest to being homogeneous.  
  
To the serene enchanting maternity burnt umber jungle to my calculating light!  
On what lashed violences fluttered with earth?
