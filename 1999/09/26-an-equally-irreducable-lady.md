An Equally Irreducable Lady
---------------------------
You pulse my hushed utensil  
like a comfortable jaguar to fresh sugar.  
Silvery and self-assured one,  
but the evening star flowed the memory.  
A dry phenomenon trembles  
even the naked  
minor city in detail  
to which the metaphor  
will not be perfumed.  
You refresh in the field as in a cleansed divisions.  
I do not compound in the vicinity of bitter dominion.  
What mysteries does the crab contain?  
How little we rejoice and how much it chirps the secrets of this galaxy.  
Everything explosive with poetic voices, the salt of the faucet  
and  
piles of promising bread inside late afternoon. Everybody here is waiting for the next serendipity.  
Fountain. You excited yourself for swimming.  
Enjoy the many imperalist attempts to build  
the electric cold fire.  
There is free fortune in expanding it.
