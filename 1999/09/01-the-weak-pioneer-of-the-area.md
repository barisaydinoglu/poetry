The Weak Pioneer Of The Area
----------------------------
Our new railroad track, our deedy marine car quadrangles.  
Nothing but your essential brow.  
Around the rust colored panic of the shrapnel.  
Sepia shadows of trash barge,  
sand-colored seams above a burned-out warmth of your body.  
Returning a snow  
trusted in the silent fog.
