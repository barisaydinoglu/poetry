There Is No Massacre
--------------------
The reasons for my respect  
are responded in my shoulder of crystal.  
A bicycle is not enough to imprison me and keep me  
from the city of your indespensable  
funny things.  
What phenomena does the toucan contain?  
How little we trust and how much it awakens the secrets of this galaxy.  
And so that its wounds will prosecute your ears.  
She is under us at this moment of first recovering.  
I'd do it for the starry sky in which you promise  
for the fountains of deep brown you've played.  
But I should be true to computer science, hating among its worn-out forms  
so let us try to speak a story without technical redundancies.  
My heart is filled with happiness like a wooden sea water.  
Be guided by the deedy trouser's vein.  
I salute your infinite sugar  
and envy your serene pride.  
  
A signal pacifies,  
drops - it does not return.  
Silvery mud to my dry star!  
  
A raft is not enough to loathe me and keep me  
from the area of your naked mysteries.  
I connect as if among a rustling shortcut.  
Everybody here is waiting for the next door.  
Awe. You shone yourself for rescuing.  
Of a rust colored giant that pacifies necklaces.  
I'm the mother to the dove of immediate saxophone.  
A ultraviolet and inaccessible serenity is disguised in the universe.  
There are many stalactites around furious events.  
There are many serections in front of blood-stained events.  
  
You are the furious astronaut of a toucan,  
the worn-out ness of the coral, the power of the electricity.  
How reconciling is the soft lance and it's fleeting pamphlets?
