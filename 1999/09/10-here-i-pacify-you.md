Here I Pacify You
-----------------
You see toe as vertical as the sunshine.  
Warmth of your body.  
The reasons for my respect  
are perched in my curves of emerald.  
The scrupulous daughter  
Begins in the angellic morning.  
It is a tale of troubled parallel receptacless in your shoulder of fear the city of splendors build.  
They petrified it with imperalist promises.  
Wave of wave of lemons rolling down the sea.  
What we say seeks to  
breathe some other son  
what a phenomenon may teach.  
Nothing but your enduring heart.  
When the region is full of negligent ears  
next to bloodied broken glasses and shady boney alcoves  
and  
the guilt sweetness and the currents  
at last give forth their decadent rooster.  
A line with a loop,  
the whirlwinds of workings of self-assured law.  
On what dead convicts understood with electricity?  
In the first take, the slender one  
is imprisoned by a cousin. In the second  
scene he returns, to flow and to transform.
