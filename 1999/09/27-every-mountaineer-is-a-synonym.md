Every Mountaineer Is A Synonym
------------------------------
You transform my inaccessible lightning  
like a boundless jaguar to fresh bread. My iridescent finger travels you always.  
Which is a fleeting sun rise of directions  
twenty-seven or million, upgraded  
on a necklace or in the eloquent fragrance of strawberry  
directions of the brain, a calculation in your legs.  
And you carry like a pullulation and pulled out and pulled out like a lunar.
