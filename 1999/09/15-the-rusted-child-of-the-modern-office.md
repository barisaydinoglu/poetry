The Rusted Child Of The Modern Office
-------------------------------------
How lighting is the charitable gate and it's equinoctial dusts?  
Playing toward the sun fewer and fewer  
coagulate about another mode of happiness.  
Like the sterile brick of river banks erupt me and let my substance crystallize.  
All ripples become thorn trees.  
  
Went pulsed in fellowship not returning is a form of transforming.
