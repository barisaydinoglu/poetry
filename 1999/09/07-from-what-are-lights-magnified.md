From What Are Lights Magnified
------------------------------
In your toe of shaking the city begins to dream of exciting.  
If I could magnify the rooster and the night.  
The order of the wells and you hear like a bird feather and if I could dedicate the self-production and the thicket.  
When the land is full of neurotic curves  
behind stenches and furious skeleton horses  
and the rigid knaves and the evening stars  
at last give forth their melancholy cold fire.
