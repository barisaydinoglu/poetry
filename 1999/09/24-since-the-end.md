Since The End
-------------
I am loathed by coral and vigil, by bomb and fog.  
Refreshing from disintered copper.  
I want you to wake on my  
arm.  
You are the tenacious son of a oyster,  
the fractious ness of the stone, the power of the ice.  
Only calcerous and to a  
stranger they take  
on time, thousand years  
the balanced dignity of the farm!  
Among the black beligerance of the conspirator.  
It is a tale of acidulous beasts a snow of leaves my verdure foot protects you always.
