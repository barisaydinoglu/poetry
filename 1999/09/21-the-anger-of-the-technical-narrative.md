The Anger Of The Technical Narrative
------------------------------------
In the smallest crystal coat the early light of day smooth stones you in its mortal earth.  
One neutral option and yellow and parsimonious aunt,  
like abberations cracking outside bottles.  
Within marine water and opaque burnt umber silences.  
The fleeting dignity  
of the root!  
Not the cinnamon moment  
when the fortnight returns the roots.  
What phenomena does the pheasant contain?  
How little we promise and how much it preserves the curiosities of this universe.
