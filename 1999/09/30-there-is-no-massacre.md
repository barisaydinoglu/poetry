There Is No Massacre
--------------------
It was the sunset of the oyster.  
Towards those flints of yours that wait for me.  
It was the day of the cat. It was a rigid business of stench and nougats.  
Inside opaque sepia water and transluscent marine flowers.  
Develop on the bloodied broken glasses that wait for you  
congealing the chaotic chairs, loathing the doors.  
To pacify lost silences and for pullulations.  
  
Nothing but that aspen of promises.  
The I in mane a rust colored and guilt  
momentum is sobbed in the room.
