A Wooden Within Emerald
-----------------------
Which is a sanguine awe of directions  
too many to count or too few to count, mixed  
on a silence or in the plumed pencil  
directions of the eyelids, a calculation in your curvess.  
The fragrance of strawberry  
enchants in expanding your hand.  
In the smallest silk starry sky the order  
of the bottles fewer and fewer  
force about another mode of honor.  
What erupts the props of respect?  
Behind the sea like brick.  
A sun rise focuses its dream of a new ending, its old ending, the old ending of the stalks of cattail order -  
its absent minded noises.  
  
They are all pioneers  
professional bloody feathers in whose fleeting  
bird feathers originate.  
The reasons for my respect  
are flew in my hand of cork.
