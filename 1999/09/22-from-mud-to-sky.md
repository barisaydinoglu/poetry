From Mud To Sky
---------------
Outside the rigid phemonana,  
many bitterest lonely roads.  
To seek another land they are all pioneers  
professional billowss of opaque dull shades of yellow smoke in whose mineral cathedrals originate.  
The pioneer smiles at the elder  
but the pioneer does not smile  
when he looks at the turkey daughter  
and the inevitable ocean.  
A crimson love excites.
