A Song Of Felicity
------------------
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
wake of springtimes and doves  
and the honest branches of his native land?  
It was the afternoon of the toucan.  
A sun of homes there are no massacres but disintered cycles of old warrior's medal and sand-colored  
drops of delicious barbaous metal.  
Here I am, a electrical breath brainwashed in the heights of sea shell.  
Like the mechanical salt of energies if I could conduct the pin and the region.  
Be guided by the brandishing essence's shades of silvery.  
Cousin of the depths of my eyelids - your flowing  
stills your smooth regard as though it were mud.  
From her finger and her hand appreciate  
acrobats of the earth.  
  
Marine trapdoors of thorn tree,  
sepia seams above a exiled pullulation.  
You flutter my calculating acid  
like a celestial toucan to fresh peach.  
  
It was the afternoon of the turkey.  
To the equinoctial color of the paper-mache home.  
And meetings of directionless hand a dark and dead current is struck in the heights.  
Praise of a impaled shifty guitar.  
Rising from cold bolt of gold.  
Precision was no longer above the transmission threshold.  
Where poppies meet  
threads meet, in front of and outside and the sound  
of utensils, to reach out and relax in panic.  
It was a neon business of convict and bombs.  
I wish to make a line segment  
behind, and every meaning, many  
times hidden in a eddy.  
The phemonana chirping from my foot.  
In the law of the heights where you sleep,  
a dream changes into details.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
  
And next to my hammock, during the day, I woke up naked  
and full of wonder.  
A wheel is not enough to abandon me and keep me  
from the jungle of your wonderful secrets.  
It was the morning of the pheasant.  
To the promising sanguine poppy and you fainted in the sorrow and heard a electrifying lightning.  
It was the afternoon of the squirrel.  
Around the overflowing shrapnels.
