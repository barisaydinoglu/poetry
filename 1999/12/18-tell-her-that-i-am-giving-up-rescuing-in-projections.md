Tell Her That I Am Giving Up Rescuing In Projections
----------------------------------------------------
A curves and a hand  
loving the sea.  
You've asked me what the jaguar is seeking there with his cashmire eyeballs?  
I reply, the salt knows this.  
I'd do it for the necklace in which you weave  
for the foams of transluscent sunburst orange you've shone.  
But the faucet transformed the memory.  
On what lewd yeasts rescued with ice?
