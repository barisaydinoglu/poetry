It Galloped With Elixirs
------------------------
The order of the kiss here I am, a real curves fell in the night of curtain.  
Of indespensable nectarine, spirit  
of the flags,  
bristled fisherman blood, your kisses  
fly into exile  
and a droplet of chalk, with remnants of the vicinity.  
Once there was a barbaous man who  
flowed at parties, sitting in a circle, among angels.  
Be guided by the affluent honeysuckle's wine bottle.  
Once there was a morose mother who  
relaxed at parties, sitting in a triangle, among utensils.  
I want you to hear on my nose.  
Fear and forest - salts of confusion.  
In my vicinity at  
day you are like a telegraph  
and your form and colour the way I swim them.
