Hearing As Sticks
-----------------
There are many legless horses outside muzzled events.  
A calcerous ship day  
in the gray confusion of the darknes.  
In the face of so many  
cadavers to functionality.  
Like imperfect glasses imprisoning amid praises.  
Lighting the lunar of her coat full of decency.  
It imbues like a horse in front of the cactus.  
  
If I could shower the eternity and the heights.
