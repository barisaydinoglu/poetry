A Fruit
-------
Always you abandon through the morning  
toward the sunrise deceiving planetariums. And outside my hammock, during the morning, I woke up naked  
and full of decency. A antenna for study is the lack thereof.  
In the face of so many convicts to animosity.  
Rigid afternoon and the shifty branch  
loiter at the walls of my house.  
Be guided by the thick splendor's cluster.
