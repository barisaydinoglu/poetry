Here I Begin You
----------------
To shine lost sand-colored cars and for laws.  
The room in front of hers  
a story we divulge in passing,  
with notions of pride  
and a passion for oceanography and computer science  
behind the imprisoning lampreys.  
Multitude of ripples!  
In and out of the sand-colored the marine and the blue  
Be guided by the secure candle's tryst.  
Around the chimney I like to rise like a muzzled bridge.  
Towards those ships of yours that wait for me.  
To the serendipidous cordial root the I in mane angel was no longer right at the recording threshold.  
You are the banana of my rabid nose.  
Draw from it the listless  
production of its own signal.
