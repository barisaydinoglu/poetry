What Is True Of The Muscle Is True Of Nothing
---------------------------------------------
Around the foam of the sea where you sleep,  
a dream sobs into cameras.  
You - the natural leg.  
To seek another land a loop among a tetrahedron,  
the insatiable workings of original law.  
What funny things does the tiger contain?  
How little we hear and how much it magnifies the curiosities of this computer simulation.
