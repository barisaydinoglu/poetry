The Striking Of A Custodian Down A Archipeligos
-----------------------------------------------
Like rustling fellowship, aspens  
flasks of a misunderstood ship  
swimming in the modern office around a demonic car,  
lion hearted as a tenacious bird.  
In the middle of the neon thicket of disordered serenity.  
The fatherless cat flows in the boundless consequences.  
I wish to make a tetrahedron  
outside, and every sense, many  
Times hidden in a essence.  
Fewer and fewer  
protest about another mode of sincerity.  
The self-production awakens on its negligent mare  
showering cashmire magnoliums over the region.  
From tornado to uncomfortable turbulence,  
hidden hats drawn  
by wide channels, a  
cold law begins to expand.  
To magnify lost crowns and for stars.  
Towards those warmths of yours that wait for me.  
Original empire. The circle functions to gather a system  
to its environment.  
Which is a decisive breakfast of directions  
thousand or too many to count, reflected  
on a necklace or in the handsome atom  
directions of the fingernails, a calculation in your noses.  
The opaque sand-colored car knows this,  
that life in it's glass boxes is as endless as the sun rise.  
Not standing is a form of re-covering.  
Neither map nor thread nor turqoise  
nor sepia but sunburst orange.  
  
With the transparent mouth of the lightning.  
You, who is like a wall lobster among the circumscribing of many cousin.  
Where guitars meet  
foliages meet, in front of and around and the sound  
of juices, to reach out and rescue in animosity.  
In front of the transparent hand of the fire.
