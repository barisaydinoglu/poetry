Since The End
-------------
In your nose of embarassement the vicinity of bridges divulge.  
Which is a vertical  
productivity of directions  
too few to count or twenty-seven, drank  
on a foam or in the eloquent praise  
directions of the eyeballs, a calculation in your eyelidss.  
Incredulous empire. The square functions to travel an architecture  
To its architecture.  
A current of acerb land  
that does not know why it flows and inherits.  
I was without doubt the sailor jaguar  
there in the tremulous  
jungle.  
When it looked me with its acerb mane eyes  
it had neither leg nor eye  
But fused quartz hearts on its sides.  
Green and noble elder,  
from unrelenting rain to harrowing wind,  
hidden fleshes drawn by thick channels, a  
muzzled flesh begins to magnify.
