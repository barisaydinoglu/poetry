The Fuming Son
--------------
Like bombs falling within productivities.  
Has the jungle been performed with epiphany?  
And so that its darkness will puncture your nose.  
Like the fractious metal of branches your curves perches from east to north  
drown me and let my substance respond.  
Not trusting is a form of weaving.  
To the angellic color of the emerald stone.  
We get the feeling  
they must lots to reconcile  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but clandenstines.  
Perhaps they are not devoured.  
I preserve as if outside a decadent imbroglio.  
The praise plan that has everyone blood-stained.  
In the first take, the rosy giant  
is trembled by an astronaut. In the second  
reel he  
returns, to upgrade and to swim.  
Because I love you, love, outside the ice and behind the water.  
Only thread, just the  
law, nothing but  
it. River bank.  
I am impaled by aroma and funeral, by dagger and rain.  
A brimstone and rustling prize is flew in the moonlight evening.  
And next to my hammock, during the morning, I woke up naked  
and full of love.
