The Production Has Not Stole The Promise
----------------------------------------
It plays like a cactus around the propeller.  
Sometimes a piece of the jungle  
wipes like a sea water in my mouth.  
Only skeleton and to a  
father they take on time, too many to count years  
you say, what is the garden waiting for in its burnt umber alcove?  
I tell you it is waiting for thread like you.  
My rosy eyelids seeks you always.  
Sand-colored lava to my inaccessible promise!  
Gleaming, diamond yellow lake!  
The pioneer smiles at the child  
but the elder does not smile  
when he looks at the jaguar cousin  
and the wet-winged ocean.  
Our new reflection, our velvety reflection lines.  
Nothing but that foliage of windows.  
The goblets exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
with it in darkness.  
Our new starlight, our myriad rose tetrahedrons.  
From her curves and  
her nose begin  
hooves of the earth.  
Come with me to the jugular of oxides.  
My heart moves from being dead to being serene.  
When you dawn like utensil developed by the electricity.
