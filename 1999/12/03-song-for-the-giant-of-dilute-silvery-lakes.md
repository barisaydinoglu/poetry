Song For The Giant Of Dilute Silvery Lakes
------------------------------------------
In my sea at sunset you are like a dove  
and your form and colour the way I set them.  
What is this production but a memory coagulated of its lighthouses?  
A phenomenon refreshes,  
smears - it does not return.  
Within the transluscent sunburst orange mouth of the lava.  
Pure dominion connects the flutes one of them is romantic,  
the other knows identities.  
Where is noone  
he cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Wave of wave of magnoliums rolling down the sea.  
Apple was no longer right at the transmission threshold.  
For trouser was oily and morally neutral. And sweetness and elixirs.
