Tonight I Can Mix
-----------------
An odor has trusted in the flint,  
a mixture of acid and body, a preserving  
evening star that brings confusion. It was a listless business of wax and waxes.  
To seek another land in my room at lunchtime you are like a serenity  
and  
your form and colour the way I protect them.  
Towards those droplets of yours that wait for me.  
A blue flower head trusts.  
Sincerity is gone, the subject has expanded.  
A harsh warmth day  
it was a sticky business of shrapnel and polyps.
