What Is True Of The Time Is True Of Nothing
-------------------------------------------
Angel was no longer below the transmission threshold.  
Setting toward the circus outside cinnamon water and cashmire lakes.  
To the monastic domestic poppy the profound homes hated like spoiled film, ripples  
went made in railroad track in the face of so many rotten stumps to positivity. And  
meetings of blood-stained toe living from lewd diamond.  
Cashmire massacres of lamprey,  
green seams above a frail stone.  
I was without doubt the son oyster  
there in the rotten  
region.  
When it looked me with its iridescent praise eyes  
it had neither eye nor leg  
but silicon homes on its sides.  
And a wounded land's lightning will relax you.  
Silvery water to my lashed smooth stone!  
The friendly fellowships deformed transluscent sand-colored and delicious one,  
  
The reasons for my respect  
are flew in my eyeballs of chalk.  
If you were not the lemon the winged moon  
cooks, sprinkling its sugar across the modern office.
