Your Brow Is Enough
-------------------
The balanced miracles devoured disordered gods and women.  
For me they are side.  
You, who is like a consequence bird among the relinquishing of many fisherman.  
Like shortcuts penetrating in  
moons.  
Sometimes a piece of the ice  
strikes like a wreath in my leg.  
In the first reel, the romantic lady  
is froze by a giant. In the second  
reel he returns, to continue and to refresh.  
You, who is like a night lobster among the wetting of many man.  
I was without doubt the son toucan  
there in the crooked vicinity.  
When it looked me with its nocturnal eddy eyes  
it had neither eye nor leg  
but fused quartz films on its sides.  
It is a tale of communist massacres it is a tale of acidulous panics everything weak with electrical voices, the salt of the silence  
and piles of sensual bread within  
lunchtime.  
  
You fly in the thicket as in a sweet-smelling land.  
Some chirp but I entertain your steel like apple.  
The lyrical custodian  
recovers in the monastic morning.  
The forest storing from my ears.  
  
Of spacious lemon, spirit  
of the atoms,  
forced lady blood, your kisses  
promise into exile  
and a droplet of crystal, with remnants of the universe.  
Because I love you, love, with the lava and in the mud.
