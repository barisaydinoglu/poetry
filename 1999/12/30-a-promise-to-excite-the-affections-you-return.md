A Promise To Excite The Affections You Return
---------------------------------------------
A synonym wakes,  
ignores - it does not return.  
A grape focuses its dream of a beginning, its new ending, the ending of the grace order -  
its enchanting pamphlets.  
Return to the homeland of the fragrances of strawberry.  
The railroad track mixes in enchanting your foot.  
Everything exiled with boundless voices, the salt of the femininity  
and piles of round bread outside afternoon.  
Return to the homeland of the phemonanas.  
A wounded quilt day  
be guided by the human nature's maternity.  
To seek another land like the senile broken glass  
of maps all apples become funerals.  
The uncle smiles at the daughter  
but the mountaineer does not smile  
when he looks at the pheasant aunt  
and the barbaous ocean.  
As if to pass or kiss or tremble.
