Antenna In The Minor Services
-----------------------------
Has the moonlight evening been wove with mysteries?  
Draw from it the frail  
antenna of its own antenna.  
The free moon gave it felicity.  
Entertaining the mist of her wine bottle full of honor.  
The browbeaten ritual that reflects in your mane.  
The delicate dignity of the fellowship!
