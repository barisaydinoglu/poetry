The Calculation Called The Eyeballs
-----------------------------------
Exiled lineages and lewd cubicles.  
And you flow like a tryst and  
grow on the billowss of brimstone smoke that wait for you  
loathing the atrocious chairs, striking the doors.  
Come with me to the death of invasions.  
Multitude of schools!  
In and out of the marine the marine and the green  
A blood colored and clenched drop is  
flew in the jungle.  
To rescue lost kisses and for peaces.  
He is outside us at this moment of first hearing.  
One grammatic option and return to the homeland of the homes.  
I fashion as if next to a careless wall.  
You are the fruit of my silent heart.  
And you ignored in the panic and inherited a trembling serection.  
You see fingernails as stationary as the wind.  
Polyps of a frightened raft  
forming behind the heights next to a hollow ship,  
hidden as a muzzled oyster.  
The natural pullulations replaced you continue slowly into a room to imbue your business.  
Be guided by the scrupulous eddy's peace.
