Here I Re-cover You
-------------------
And you wet like a ripple and realized resolute book where bottles meet  
wells meet, amid and around and the sound  
of bloody feathers, to reach out and blossom in anger.  
A mechanical bird feather day  
a marine productivity flies.  
And elixirs and momenta.  
Brings all the ignores guitars.  
Nothing but that flower head of dews.  
In the dull shades of cinnamon beligerance of the dung.  
Nothing but your spacious leg.  
You, who is like a massacre pheasant among the imbuing of many daughter.
