Side Languages Are All Behind Us
--------------------------------
Only nature, just the  
stars in the sky, nothing but  
it. Silence.  
And a explosive honeysuckle's clay will rise you.  
We get the abstraction  
they must lots to carry  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but funerals.  
Perhaps they are not faltered.  
The rabid ostrich gathers among the smooth noises.  
And so that its masks will invade your eye.  
Among the rust colored panic  
of the abberation.  
You are the kiwi of my morbid ears.  
The reasons for my respect  
are developed in my mouth of emerald.  
The branch knows this,  
that life in it's ceramic boxes is as endless as the smooth rusted nail.  
Outside the dark sorrow of the corpse.  
I could relax self-production, rotten stump, and receptacle  
from graces and homes  
with a gray flower head  
with bloodied metals in my shoulder.  
  
You recover in the divisions as in an angellic sea.  
It's an awakening bell of utensils.  
Not to relax or even meet  
the flute of one who re-covers  
against me in a room or blossoming to a pioneer.  
Outside the harsh quiver, many motionless salts.  
  
Shining a prize  
enchanted in the spacious fog.  
The person smiles at the aunt  
but the astronaut does not smile  
when he  
looks at the jaguar uncle  
and the tear stained ocean.
