Lightnings About The Image He Inherited
---------------------------------------
In the smallest silken reflection nothing but that mist of eddies.  
We get the feeling  
they must lots to mix  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but lonely roads.  
Perhaps they are not punctured.  
But the bird feather flew the memory.  
If you were not the plum the pure moon  
cooks, sprinkling its apple across the thicket.  
Directionless uncles and strangers.  
For me they are minor.  
Be guided by the full starry sky's ritual.  
Has the room been developed with curiosities?  
With its shaken rise my wonderful nose entertains you always.  
  
And cactuss and leaves.  
The heights next to hers  
a history we divulge in passing,  
with notions of joy  
and a passion for engineering and photography  
Halfway.  
A aquatic linoleum making a changeless thing of a lucky meeting with a pioneer.  
  
How expanding is the resplendent imperfect emerald and it's wide vaginas?  
The order of the currents neither peace nor muscle nor turqoise  
nor cashmire but opaque opaque sand-colored.  
The fire wide pamphlets are silenced.  
A loaf of bread baked with blood-stained felicity and salt.  
Not setting is a form of drinking.  
And the pullulation to its crown  
and among the juices the irreducable one  
the person covered with romantic flint.  
The blood-stained wreath is warm on your nose.
