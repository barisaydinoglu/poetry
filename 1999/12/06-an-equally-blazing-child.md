An Equally Blazing Child
------------------------
Crooked receptacles and dead bones.  
Living the serendipity of her flower head full of decency.  
She is in us at this moment of first making.  
Pulled out and closed off like a warmth.  
Only inevitable and to a  
god  
they take on time,  
million years  
I saw how splendors are connected  
by the absorbant droplet.
