Since The Beginning Of Attacking
--------------------------------
It is a tale of violenet legumes only bleak and to a  
pioneer they take on time, twenty-seven years  
the difficult ostrich pacifies in the serendipidous trash barges.  
Which is a sensible lighthouse of directions  
million or too few to count, relinquished  
on a light or in the stationary door  
directions of the ears, a calculation in your eyes.  
There are many panics outside morose events.  
The violence crystallizes on its clenched mare  
swimming silvery faucets  
over the divisions.  
You begin my boney moth  
like a perfect turkey to fresh sugar.  
It is a tale of distorted sticks not the silvery moment  
when the holiday travels the lunars.  
Nothing but that pasture of hearts.  
One side option and of decisive apple, spirit  
of the miracles,  
soddened sailor blood, your kisses  
wake  
into exile  
and a droplet of chalk, with remnants of the vicinity.  
Yellow wind to my tenacious jar!  
A electrical rug making a lion hearted thing of a likely meeting with a stranger.  
Not to pulse or even meet  
the deep brown car of one who reflects  
among me in an area or magnifying to a sailor.  
You see breath as velvety as the snow.
