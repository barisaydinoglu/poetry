An Equally Sweet-smelling Gentleman
-----------------------------------
The crooked crab connects under the eloquent nights.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
What we say flies to  
divulge  
some other uncle  
what a machine may teach.  
Like seperations loathing next to burnt umber lakes.  
I could seek hound, night, and hole  
from necklaces and wreaths  
with a red lighthouse  
with juices in my tail.  
Mingle on the shortcuts that wait for you  
smothering the brutal chairs, coagulating the doors.  
  
Neither shades of burnt umber nor starry sky nor red  
nor silvery but deep brown.  
Like insufferable awe, acrobats  
one historical option and I'm the lady to the quiver of immediate poppy.
