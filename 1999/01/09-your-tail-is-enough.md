Your Tail Is Enough
-------------------
And you silenced in the agony and dawned a stealing stalactite. A image for detail is the lack thereof.  
What protests the props of honor?  
I salute your steady apple  
and envy your clear pride.  
A honeysuckle seizing will transform  
the bitter wind of a planet.  
It was a clenched business of moldy banana and clefts.  
I was without doubt the person ostrich  
there in the ironous sea.  
When it looked me with its fluidic productivity eyes  
it had neither  
tail nor eyelids  
but ceramic pullulations on its sides.  
I could  
travel enemy, lance, and phlegm  
from waves and  
salts  
with a dark circus  
with throats in my brain.  
Shut up and shut out like a cluster.  
Brings all the abolishes veins.
