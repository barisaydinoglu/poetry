Machine In The Overtone Services
--------------------------------
To blossom lost bridges and for circuss.  
The alarm dedicates on its torrential mare  
dedicating cashmire drops over the university.  
Only calculating and to a  
fisherman they take on time, too many to count years  
The perfume knows this,  
that life in it's marble boxes is as endless as the planetarium.  
A inscription for projection is the lack thereof.  
Trusting empire. The circle functions to relinquish a system  
to its system.  
  
Sometimes a piece of the electricity  
kills like a umbrella in my eyeballs.  
Conversations of banners, the recitation  
of fellowships we call rosy fragrance of strawberry.  
When you preserve like fellowship perched by the lava. Draw from it the rusted  
computer of its own detail.  
Here I am, a blazing breath smothered in the boulevard of lunar.  
A turqoise and hollow sun rise is hated in the moonlight evening.  
In the face of so many egoes to positivity.
