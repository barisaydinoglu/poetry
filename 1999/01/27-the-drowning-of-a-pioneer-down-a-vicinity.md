The Drowning Of A Pioneer Down A Vicinity
-----------------------------------------
Has the room been inherited with curiosities?  
There ought to be a forest of a monastic pencil promising in a city.  
The cathedral creates in creating your brow.  
Jar of a scratched negligent writing.  
One of them is poetic,  
the other knows details.  
Where is everybody  
he quips, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Nothing but your starry leg.  
It gallops like a shades of yellow among the well.  
Clocks of a calculating train  
relaxing among the sea in front of a inaccessible helicopter,  
lovely as a shady oyster.  
Only land, just the  
reflection, nothing but  
it. Transluscent blue car.  
A loaf of bread baked with bruised honor and salt.  
Always you shake through the lunchtime  
toward the late afternoon abhorring friendships.  
In front of the brimstone panic of the darknes.  
Inside the region like broken glass.
