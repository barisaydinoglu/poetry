The Beligerance Of The Alphabetic Narrative
-------------------------------------------
I am prosecuted by lunar and stench, by circumstance and clouds.  
A lashed point of view pampers  
even the cleansed  
aerial thicket in study  
to which the metaphor  
will not be appreciated.  
Magnify on the oblivions that wait for you  
conquering the decadent chairs, devouring the doors.  
To respond lost angels and for lights.  
A loaf of bread baked with nauesous tiredness and salt.  
If I could blush the darknes and the jungle.  
Green and lyrical astronaut,
