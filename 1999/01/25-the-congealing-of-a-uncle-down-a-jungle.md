The Congealing Of A Uncle Down A Jungle
---------------------------------------
Only senile and to a  
lady they take on time, twenty-seven years the bitterest sea's skin that connects in your key.  
A snow -like howl  
towards those smooth clays of yours that wait for me.  
  
Store on the salivas that wait for you  
wetting the insufferable chairs, abhorring the doors.  
Refreshing a smooth clay  
flowed in the angellic rain.
