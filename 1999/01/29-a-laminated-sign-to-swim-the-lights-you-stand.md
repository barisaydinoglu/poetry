A Laminated Sign To Swim The Lights You Stand
---------------------------------------------
Enjoy the many absurd attempts to rejoice  
the acerb nougat.  
There is sensible fortune in seizing it. A fire-tipped mist day  
wave of wave of springtimes rolling down the sea.  
With the throttling cummerbunds.  
  
To grow lost banners and for maternities.  
Wave of wave of stalkss of cattail rolling down the sea.  
You are the rotten stranger of a cat,  
the clenched ness of the guitar, the power of the mud.  
The incredulous stalks of cattail gave it tiredness.
