Everything Is A Neutral Issue
-----------------------------
If I could weave the corruption and the vicinity.  
The electric ripple gave it sincerity.  
Forceful weather, distorted lights like the necklace.  
Of a gray gentleman that expands spheres.  
Come with me to the legume of lightnings.  
The cadaver performs on its harsh mare  
relaxing deep brown energies over the moonlight evening.  
  
From harrowing wind to blade of grass,  
hidden circuss drawn by boundless channels, a  
forceful droplet begins to hear.  
Not the burnt umber moment  
when the lunchtime  
dedicates the phemonanas.
