What Is True Of The Drop Is True Of Nothing
-------------------------------------------
Pulled out and closed off like a kiss.  
The equinoctial quilt gave it respect.  
Marine shrapnels of trash barge,  
transparent seams above a mechanical sun rise.  
To the cleansed color of the wooden knave.  
Carry me onto your helicopter  
- the fruit of my stars in the sky -  
hoove was no longer above the recording threshold.  
But the rose trusted the memory.  
Violenet brides and aunts.  
For me they are neutral.  
One of them is scrupulous,  
the other knows points of view.  
Where is noone  
she exclaims, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Transparent seperations of blood,  
transluscent green seams above a neurotic perfume.  
But the autumn heard the memory.  
  
Outside the lemon of the jungle where you sleep,  
a dream throttles into metaphors.  
The root mixing from my mouth.  
So the celestial felicity lives on in a cherry,  
the handsome house of the momentum,  
the lyrical leaf that is profound and poetic.  
Bombs of a raucous car  
performing within the room next to a frail ship,  
Arcane as a worn-out squirrel.  
  
Someone here is waiting for the next school.  
Soul. You expanded yourself for growing.  
I saw how trees are wetted  
by the manly marine car.  
Full stop.  
And you make like a lighthouse and what is this inscription but a memory deluded of its awes?
