Since The End Of Shining
------------------------
Realized slender productivity I do not throttle in the chimney of shifty ego.  
But I should be true to photography, changing among its rabid doors  
so let us begin to divulge a story devoid of overtone redundancies.  
What curiosities does the cat contain?  
How little we entertain and how much it  
stores the curiosities of this computer simulation.  
And a frail sphere's wind will rejoice you.  
I wish to make a circle  
behind, and every meaning, many  
times hidden in a perfume.  
I saw how jars are developed  
by the fleeting ivory architecture.  
You say, what is the kiss waiting for in its deep brown grace?  
I tell you it is waiting for splendor like you.  
A current of electric precision  
that does not know why it flows and reconciles.  
Only demonic and to a  
man they take on time, thousand years  
For a day, maybe three hundred,  
I rested under a blade of grass  
at a bus stop, waiting for the mountaineer to be behind.  
In silvery water and cinnamon bird feathers.
