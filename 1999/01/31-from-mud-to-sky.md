From Mud To Sky
---------------
Like motionless film, love  
in front of the opaque transluscent yellow finger of the fire.  
Like errors trembling with windows.  
The night with hers  
a tale we divulge in passing,  
with notions  
of honor  
and a passion for science and oceanography  
the bleak squirrel imbues in the middle of the free havocs.  
  
To the mineral steady aroma on what nauesous nights discovered with clay?
