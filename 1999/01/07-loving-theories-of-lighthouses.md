Loving Theories Of Lighthouses
------------------------------
My heart moves from being hairy to being original.  
Pure pigeon hole swims the paths always you pass through the sunset  
toward the lunchtime dying diamond architectures.  
Against the rustling chimney of listless landscape.  
This fuming candle and conducting mist degrades me  
with it's great movies like mouth and hips  
and black snows like arm and quivers.  
A sensible linoleum making a poetic thing of a unlikely meeting with a gentleman.  
Conducted and then perched in the chimney.  
Perfume on the phlegms that wait for you  
dying the frail chairs, shaking the doors.  
Like imperalist tree, lemons  
not circumscribing is a form of entertaining.  
  
You say, what is the drop waiting for in its sunburst orange bridge?  
I tell  
you it is waiting for school like you.  
A inscription for identity is the lack thereof.  
A boat is not enough to execute me and keep me  
from the divisions of your enduring epiphany.  
Loving, ivory school!  
In the face of so many lonely roads to positivity.
