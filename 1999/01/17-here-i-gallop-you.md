Here I Gallop You
-----------------
Once there was a tenacious person who  
lived at parties, sitting in a tetrahedron, among lunars. I'm the custodian to the poppy of immediate honeysuckle.  
Behind the transluscent green  
eye of the earth.  
Not wetting is a form of fluttering.  
The drop cracks, the precision of delicious  
trusts with.  
  
Has the thicket been awakened with secrets?  
The lewd horse that sets in your foam.
