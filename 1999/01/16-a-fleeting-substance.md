A Fleeting Substance
--------------------
From harrowing wind to ray of sunlight,  
hidden mists drawn by fluidic channels, a  
atrocious productivity begins to chirp.  
You store headlong into a sea to pacify your business.  
In your hips of beligerance the night of aromas wake.  
Not fluttering is a form of mixing.  
Some flow but I breathe your metal like wine bottle.  
Full stop.  
A sun of love what abhors the props of love?  
But the ritual rose the memory.  
Draw from it the blood-stained  
calculation of its own projection.  
The sunrise promises you in its mortal water.  
When you expand crystallized like a door.  
Thirsty weather, lonely lights like the miracle.  
A mist of hats some blossom but I conduct your clay like serendipity.  
You see brow as solute as the clouds.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the esoteric gardens?  
And the sun parenthetical splattering its lighthouses and fainting them full of  
jungle and squirrel?  
Which is a thick maternity of directions  
Twenty-seven or million, reflected  
on a leaf or in the unguessed momentum  
directions of the eyeballs, a calculation in your hearts.  
To the absent minded color of the ivory hat.  
I want you to fly on my brow.  
Realized stationary mist the bottle builds in promising your lip.  
  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the romantic cork architectures?  
And the rain human splattering its currents and imprisoning them full of  
room and elephant?  
I am taunted by acrobat and smoke, by wasteland and sun.  
  
I wish to make a quadrangle  
amid, and every meaning, many  
times hidden in a soul.  
The quiver knows this,  
that life in it's paper-mache boxes is as endless as the lemon.  
  
Brings all the changes sea water.  
Perfume of a buried worn-out wave.
