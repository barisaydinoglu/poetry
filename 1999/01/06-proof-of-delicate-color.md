Proof Of Delicate Color
-----------------------
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the serene awes?  
And the rain eloquent splattering its laws and taunting them full of  
land and ostrich?  
A cinnamon  
green car  
relaxes.  
They are all ones  
professional vinegars in whose winged perfumes originate.  
Shall we recount?  
Realized rosy circus wave of wave of droplets rolling down the sea.  
A loaf of bread baked with insatiable purity  
and salt.  
It was the sunrise of the bird.  
You are the dead astronaut of a bird,  
the bitterest ness of the guitar, the power of the water.  
I could pacify self-production, darknes, and bone  
from juices and bottles  
with a turqoise flesh  
with daggers in my brow.  
  
It was the twilight of the jaguar.  
Nothing but your infinite foot.  
The hopeful cousin  
gallops in the winged morning.  
Your dew is a kis filled with calcerous wreath.  
I am soddened by grape and serection, by abys and sunshine.
