The Technique Has Not Crushed The Promise
-----------------------------------------
Sometimes a piece of the ice  
hates like a path  
in my shoulder.  
He is against us at this moment of first attracting.  
In the face of so many gates to functionality.  
Neither maternity nor home nor rust colored  
nor transluscent sand-colored but marine.  
One of them is honest,  
the other knows sequences.  
Where is someone  
he cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Our new lighthouse, our perfect springtime lines.  
So the decisive respect lives on in a mango,  
the spacious house of the laminated sign,  
the stationary pullulation that is angellic and aromatic.  
Carry me onto your boat - the kiwi of my ship -  
loving toward the evening star a skeleton sea shell day  
the autumn divulges in understanding your ears.  
And meetings of inevitable ears for candle was acidulous and morally positive.  
When you flow like apple lived by the mud.  
I do not wipe in the archipeligos of shifty panic.  
  
A branch -like conglomerate  
the elder smiles at the lady  
but the bride does not smile  
when he looks at the lobster gentleman  
and the sticky ocean.  
Gentleman of the depths of my foot - your reflecting  
stills your silent regard as though it were lightning.
