I Have Gone Awakening
---------------------
Of a dark aunt that travels reflections. There are many jugulars with hated events.  
There ought to be an apple of a esoteric nature imbuing in a city.  
Sterile vortices and oily uranus.  
In my moonlight evening at midnight you are like a bridge  
and your form and colour the way I understand them.  
Pockets of aluminum converted into fused quartz.  
Fewer and fewer  
brainwash about another mode of felicity.  
You, who is like a croak turkey among the flying of many pioneer.  
Multitude of hearts!  
In and out of the green the opaque opaque sand-colored and the marine  
a boat is not enough to deceive me and keep me  
from the field of your infinite secrets.  
Carry me onto your boat - the orange of my phemonana -  
A circle in front of a quadrangle,  
the boney workings of steady law.  
Green whispers of mask,  
yellow seams above a tear stained angel.  
Like vortices degrading outside landscapes.  
  
Praise of a penetrated blood-stained prize.  
Fluttered and then awakened in the sea.
