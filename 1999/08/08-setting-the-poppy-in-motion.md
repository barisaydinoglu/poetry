Setting The Poppy In Motion
---------------------------
Sometimes a piece of the lightning  
gnaws like an angel in my brow.  
The flag dawning from my foot.  
The lands exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
behind it in darkness.  
An odor has flowed inside the window,  
a mixture of polyp and body, a blushing  
shades of sepia that brings sorrow.  
The city next to hers  
a story we speak in passing,  
with notions of wonder  
and a passion for mountaineering and  
science  
some travel but I grow your salt like wine bottle.  
Once there  
was a fire-tipped one who  
blossomed at parties, sitting in a triangle, among lighthouses.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
wet of lights and promises  
and the incredulous mists of his native land?  
Kissing the poppy of her mane full of joy.  
I want you to begin on my brain.  
You inherit in the field as in a lion hearted chimney.  
  
Outside opaque silvery water and transparent necklaces.  
The great tryst gave it decency.
