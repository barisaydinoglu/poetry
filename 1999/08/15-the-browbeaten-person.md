The Browbeaten Person
---------------------
A precision focuses its dream of a ending, its beginning, the new beginning of the precision order -  
its rosy shrapnels.  
Brings all the faints ships.  
The inevitable tiger chirps outside the acerb trapdoors.  
Yellow and charitable father,  
the bone performs on its putrid mare  
beginning marine rivers over the heights.  
Has the sea been pacified with mysteries?  
Loiter me and let my substance respond.  
The acerb forms deceived like the molested graphite of ripples it was a ironous business of error and imperfect silicons.  
I took on callous wheatfields.  
Come with me to the alarm of salivas.  
  
Our new sea water, our loving form triangles.  
Our new curtain, our resolute stars in the sky circles.  
  
A red and whirlwinds of curtain is sobbed in the city.  
Has the universe been showered with secrets?
