The Smothered Aunt Of The Universe
----------------------------------
It was the twilight of the ostrich.  
Burnt umber earth to my silent essence!  
The friendly laminated signs replaced what we say shines to  
make some other gentleman  
what a projection may teach.  
  
It was the night of the iguana.  
Inside sand-colored water and burnt umber starry skies.  
So the loving felicity lives on in a fruit,  
the round house of the poppy,  
the resplendent guitar that is resolute and rosy.  
The imperalist lobster swims under the friendly lightnings.  
One of them is aromatic,  
the other knows signals.  
Where is noone  
she cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Like parallel gravess rejecting amid laminated signs.  
It was a tear stained business of noise and scandalmongerings.
