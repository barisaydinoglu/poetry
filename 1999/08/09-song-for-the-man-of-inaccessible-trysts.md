Song For The Man Of Inaccessible Trysts
---------------------------------------
You are the fruit of my disordered arm.  
Only curtain, just the  
coral, nothing but  
it. Breakfast.  
Here I am, a indespensable nose electrified in the chimney of grace.  
The order of the smooth stones when you travel drank like a femininity.  
The rustling jaguar develops inside the handsome complaints.  
Shall we recount?  
Shut out and pulled out like a muscle.
