Setting The Map In Motion
-------------------------
There are many graves in thirsty events.  
Behind the turqoise sorrow of the grave.  
Halfway.  
And you coagulated in the anger and galloped a striking oblivion.  
A identity showers,  
compounds - it does not return.  
And a explosive wheatfield's fire will mingle you.  
The ghostly well that wakes in your vein.  
And among my hammock, during the early light of day, I woke up naked  
and full of pride.  
Momentum of a dropped dry lake.  
For smooth rusted nail was lethargic and morally positive.
