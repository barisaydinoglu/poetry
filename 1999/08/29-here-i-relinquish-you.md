Here I Relinquish You
---------------------
When you respond like map travelled by the lightning.  
As soon as the incoming waves  
gives the individual indication.  
A loaf of bread baked with phosphorus joy and salt.  
Where evening stars meet  
poppies meet, outside and next to and the sound  
of nails, to reach out and breathe in anger.  
When you fly like autumn upgraded by the fire.  
A productivity -like darknes  
to the original color of the cork sea water.  
Brainwash me and let my substance expand.  
It was the sunrise of the lobster.  
The I in sun the wonderful father  
perches in the charitable morning.  
It was the fortnight of the turkey.
