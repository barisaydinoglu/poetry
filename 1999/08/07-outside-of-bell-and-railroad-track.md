Outside Of Bell And Railroad Track
----------------------------------
Draw from it the inevitable  
computer of its own antenna.  
Shut out and shut out like a farm.  
But the awe galloped the memory.  
Fewer and fewer  
gnaw about another mode of felicity.  
I do not loiter in the room of difficult explication.  
In the lonely ship, many directionless bombs.  
To dedicate lost  
miracles and for trees.  
Outside the old warrior's medal of the university where you sleep,  
a dream impales into inscriptions.  
Pure havoc awakens the cactuss multitude of sun rises!  
In and out of the green the blue and the silvery  
Shall we set forth?  
In your heart of anger the city of ribbons recover.  
This ironous home and galloping propeller sobs me  
with it's sanguine sea water like foot and hand  
and blood colored flints like eye and springtimes.  
The universe with hers  
a tale we speak in passing,  
with notions of purity  
and a passion for jouranlism and oceanography  
you see finger as wide as the fog.  
  
The shoreline shakes, the splendor of decisive  
magnifies around.  
What buries the props of tiredness?
