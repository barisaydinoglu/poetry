Re-covering Wet-winged Nostalgia
--------------------------------
There are no croaks but careless cycles of peace and yellow  
echoes of cosmic bleak clay.  
In the smallest chalk lake in the city like aluminum.  
They degraded it with wet-winged foliages.  
A snow focuses its dream of a new beginning, its new ending, the new beginning of the well order -  
its natural shardss of silk.  
Only drop, just the  
echo, nothing but  
it. Snow.  
In my boulevard at midnight you are like a stalks of cattail  
and your form and colour the way I carry them.  
What twists the props of love?  
The order of the flints this phosphorus shoreline and perfuming sweetnes imprisons me  
with it's cordial silences like eyeballs and eyeballs  
and black hooves like foot and necklaces.  
Where paths meet  
breakfasts meet, outside and in front of and the sound  
of cold fires, to reach out and inherit in anger.  
I'd do it for the writing in which you build  
for the saxophones of transluscent transparent you've heard.  
Conversations of landscapes, the recitation  
of souls we call celestial  
guitar.  
The sailor smiles at the cousin  
but the mother does not smile  
when he looks at the jaguar father  
and the frail ocean.  
Of spacious plum, spirit  
of the writings,  
undulated cousin blood, your kisses  
tread into exile  
and a droplet of cedar, with remnants of the divisions.  
A loaf of bread baked with rabid felicity and salt.  
  
Not promising is a form of shining.  
Behind the rust colored fear of the shadow.
