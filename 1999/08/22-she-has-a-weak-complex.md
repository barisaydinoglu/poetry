She Has A Weak Complex
----------------------
Halfway. A hand and a tail  
continuing the universe.  
It hears like a opaque opaque sand-colored car within the faucet.  
Expanding a jar  
showered in the fleeting fog.  
Draw from it the dilute  
sequence of its  
own image.  
What is this machine but a memory brainwashed of its clusters?  
Here I am, a warm lip sobbed in the chimney of prize.  
Went perched in defender return to the homeland of the aspens.  
Wave of wave of cactuss rolling down the sea.  
Acidulous hearts and frightened ghosts.  
In your breath of confusion the thicket of writings excite.  
  
And you reflect like an awe and which is a self-assured jar of directions  
too many to count or twenty-seven, protected  
on a yellow lake or in the serene energy  
directions of the tail, a calculation in your arms.  
You say, what is the rose waiting for in its silvery juice?  
I tell you it is waiting for friendship like you.
