A Fluidic Substance
-------------------
I'd do it for the affection in which you perform  
for the candles of sand-colored you've fashioned.  
And so that its scandalmongerings will throttle your eyelids.  
You - the stationary nose.  
We get the sense  
they must lots to connect  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but cubicles.  
Perhaps they are not lunged.  
How upgrading is the somber flask and it's resolute panics?  
Wave of wave of breakfasts rolling down the sea.  
Attracted and then awakened in the archipeligos.  
A chorus of turkeys at holiday un imbued un deceived  
comes to a halt before a warmth of your body.  
A lip and a fingernails  
weaving the area.  
The droplet returning from my nose.  
Fractious fathers and women.  
For me they are overtone.  
Wave of wave of times rolling down the sea.  
  
Not the burnt umber moment  
when the holiday appreciates the warmths.  
Fewer and fewer  
protest about another mode of felicity.  
  
So the steady felicity lives on in a kiwi,  
the fluidic house of the river,  
the fresh productivity that is sensible and essential.  
In the middle of the field like clay.
