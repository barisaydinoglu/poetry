Dawning Phosphorus Nostalgia
----------------------------
In the imperalist silence, many fragmented self-productions. They killed it with careless miracles.  
Multitude of natures!  
In and out of the marine the burnt umber and the yellow  
In the middle of the smothered sea of oily sweetnes.
