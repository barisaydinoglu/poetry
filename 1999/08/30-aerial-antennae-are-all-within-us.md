Aerial Antennae Are All Within Us
---------------------------------
But the drop mixed the memory.  
There are many clefts in front of barbaous events.  
Cashmire clay to my tenacious mane!  
A root mixing will blush  
the fire-tipped fire of a planet.  
It discovers like a trouser amid  
the hoove.  
Bitten sunrise and the rustling love  
invade at  
the walls of my house.  
A metaphor for projection is the lack thereof.  
The lyrical homes deformed the river bank imbuing from my shoulder.  
  
Which is a balanced wine bottle of directions  
million or too many to count, magnified  
on an autumn or in the wide propeller  
directions of the hips, a calculation in your fingers.  
Multitude of manes!  
In and out of the cinnamon the transparent and the deep brown  
I'd do it for the defender in which you understand  
for the fountains of cashmire you've stood.  
A car is not enough to devour me and keep me  
from the field of your delicate phenomena.  
Like lances degrading within kisses.  
Of your dull shades of crimson echo when you hold out your brow.  
What epiphany does the ostrich contain?  
How little we tread and how much it divulges the phenomena of this galaxy.  
The reasons for my respect  
are crystallized in my fingernails of gold.  
All momenta become egoes.  
  
I stayed circumscribed and green  
inside the city.  
The iridescent hooves prosecuted the cosmic pullulation gave it joy.  
Imprison me and let my substance transform.  
The saliva understands on its disordered mare  
trusting cinnamon farms over the city.  
All precisions become lineages.  
Opaque cinnamon ice to my molested branch!  
Neither bell nor pencil nor opaque blood colored  
nor cinnamon but deep brown.
