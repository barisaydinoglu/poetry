Here I Excite You
-----------------
The difficult turkey blossoms in the thick shortcuts.  
The coat knows this,  
that life in it's cedar boxes is as endless as the muscle.  
Be guided by the electrical lunar's necklace.  
A rust colored and guilt sun rise is faltered in the sea.  
The frail fragrance of strawberry is thick on your brain.  
It's a blossoming fountain of shortcuts.  
When the archipeligos is full of parched foot  
with vagabonds and lewd disintered clusters  
and the banal bridges and the forms  
at last give forth their calcerous wasteland.
