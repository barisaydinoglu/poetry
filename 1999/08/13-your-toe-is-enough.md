Your Toe Is Enough
------------------
And a tremulous umbrella's sky will dedicate you.  
And a fractious sun's jungle will appreciate you.  
Amid the disguising hounds.  
I salute your resolute bread  
and envy your wide pride.  
Of your dark flute when you hold out your hand.  
And you rise like a bell and to drink lost wheatfields and for apples.  
You say, what is the drop waiting for in its yellow mane?  
I tell you it is waiting for current like you.  
Of homogeneous lemon, spirit  
of the pullulations,  
protested gentleman blood, your kisses  
excite into exile  
and a droplet of marble, with remnants of the chimney.  
Like the clenched graphite of sun rises of your opaque turqoise nature when you hold out your brain.  
And you faltered in the animosity and created a silencing oblivion.  
A vessel is not enough to hate me and keep me  
from the land of your real mysteries.
