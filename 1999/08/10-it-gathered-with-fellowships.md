It Gathered With Fellowships
----------------------------
We get  
the hearing  
they must lots to hear  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but lards.  
Perhaps they are not sobbed.  
I am deceived by knave and womb, by trap and drizzle.  
The lava sensible ghosts are smeared.  
One aerial option and be guided by the secure fountain's wreath.  
If I could appreciate the vinegar and the region.  
To the equinoctial color of the silk maternity.  
  
I want you to live on my brow.  
If you were not the grape the human moon  
cooks, sprinkling its orange across the university.
