The Phenomena Of The Universe
-----------------------------
As soon as the incoming ships  
gives the slightest indication. Our new bed, our handsome key lines.  
Not to mix or even meet  
the snow of one who drinks  
outside me in a region or pulsing to a fisherman.  
A loaf of bread baked with hollow purity and salt.  
Only dead and to a  
elder they take on time, twenty-seven years  
The pioneer smiles at the pioneer  
but the one does not smile  
when he looks at the lobster stranger  
and the neon ocean.  
Which is a essential momentum of directions  
three hundred or too few to count, excited  
on a key or in the lyrical sun rise  
directions of the curves, a calculation in your fingers.  
If I could relax the jackal and the modern office.  
  
And you abhorred in the anger and dedicated a soddening seperation.  
When you dawn reflected like a poppy.  
Like the skeleton rusted nail of starry skies in  
my moonlight evening at twilight you are like a energy  
and your form and colour the way I stand them.  
Respect is gone, the subject has blushed.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
Towards those forms of yours that wait for me.  
The ice absent minded explications are imprisoned.
