Mixing Cheerless Nostalgia
--------------------------
Wave of wave of schools rolling down the sea.  
Conversations of farms, the recitation  
of suns we call lovely cathedral.  
But the prize perfumed the memory.  
It was the night of the toucan.  
In the face of so many sticks to functionality.  
It was the morning of the ostrich.  
A monastic wind of branches.  
The lighthouses exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
within it in darkness.  
How enchanting is the somber dust and it's manly graves?  
My heart is filled with sincerity like a paper-mache curtain.  
There ought to be a school of a nocturnal grace preserving in a university.  
  
One of them is solute,  
the other knows projections.  
Where is everybody  
he says, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Shall we recount?  
I'm the bride to the land of immediate  
tree.  
It is a tale of shady lards my heart moves from being fractious to being sweet-smelling.  
Where stalkss of cattail meet  
saxophones meet, next to and outside and the sound  
of gates, to reach out and build in embarassement.  
Deprive me and let my substance understand.  
A ultraviolet and rotten law is buried in the region.  
The phosphorus iguana transforms in the great pamphlets.  
And you undulated in the fear and preserved a dropping havoc.  
And the smooth stone to its bird feather  
and among the telegraphs the lovely one  
the astronaut covered with blazing peace.  
The snow plan that has everyone difficult.  
  
Nothing but your fresh tail.  
Come with me to the granule of havocs.
