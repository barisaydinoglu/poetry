Here I Discover You
-------------------
Of essential peach, spirit  
of the old  
warrior's medals,  
deformed father blood, your kisses  
respond into exile  
and a droplet of cedar, with remnants of the field.  
And a parched pasture's mud will chirp you.  
The I in door and meetings of neurotic hips an antenna divulges,  
drops - it does not return.  
A opaque blue faucet expands.
