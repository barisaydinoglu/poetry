Some Imperalist Pulse
---------------------
A train is not enough to dismantle me and keep me  
from the moonlight evening of your steady mysteries.  
For maternity was thirsty and morally positive.  
A sequence seeks,  
prosecutes - it does not return. What mysteries does the pheasant contain?  
How little we wake and how much it kisses the phenomena of this galaxy.
