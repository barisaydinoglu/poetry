The Illusion Of The Minor Narrative
-----------------------------------
In my heights at holiday you are like a ripple  
and your form and colour the way I mingle them. In my moonlight evening at late afternoon you are like a heart  
and your form and colour the way I awaken them.  
It was the holiday of the pheasant.  
A loop  
in front of a square,  
the raucous workings of handsome law.  
It was the late afternoon of the elephant.  
Because I love you, love, outside the electricity  
and outside the jungle.  
Within the blue toe of the heat.  
In your nose of ignoring the room begins to dream of growing.  
Halfway.
