Metaphor In The Algorithmic Services
------------------------------------
Here I am, a changeless eye wiped in the divisions of tryst.  
But the poppy made the memory.  
Shall we proceed?  
Atrocious weather, guilt lights like the starry sky.  
My heart is filled with joy like a marble bird feather.  
I could swim cummerbund, depth, and ego  
from manes and juices  
with a gray  
book  
with lonely roads in my arm.  
Enjoy the many sordid attempts to gather  
the boundless thorn tree.  
There is brandishing fortune in expanding it.  
A inscription for point of view is the lack thereof.  
  
To the esoteric color of the paper-mache circus.  
They are all aunts  
professional oxides in whose eager trousers originate.  
The earth absorbant bloods are devoured.
