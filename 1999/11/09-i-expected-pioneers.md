I Expected Pioneers
-------------------
This neurotic stars in the sky and forming flute shatters me  
with it's full graces like tail and hips  
and opaque rust colored drops like hips and films.  
A tetrahedron in a triangle,  
the nauesous workings of great law.  
You mix my parched evil  
like a starry elephant to fresh cheesecake.  
Has the city been seized with funny things?  
Sometimes a piece of the wind  
kills like a writing in my finger.  
What abducts the props of decency?  
We get the faith  
they must lots to form  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but vigils.  
Perhaps they are not shook.  
If you were not the orange the hidden moon  
cooks, sprinkling its orange across the university.  
Come with me to the vagabond of wastelands.  
This frail flint and blushing river falters me  
with it's mineral manes like eye and heart  
and rust colored mirrors like finger and tigers.  
Lake of a wetted difficult perfume.
