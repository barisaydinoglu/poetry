An Equally Resolute Stranger
----------------------------
As soon as the incoming bridges  
gives the public indication.  
As if to chain or rescue or loiter.  
There ought to be a serenity of a lovely shades of yellow hearing in a moonlight evening.  
Of verdure  
orange, spirit  
of the guitars,  
froze custodian blood, your kisses  
discover into exile  
and a droplet of chalk, with remnants of the modern office.  
The rotten toucan expands under the self-assured lards.  
When you love reconciled like a cashmire car.  
The barbaous iguana pulses in the middle of the perfect billowss of red smoke.  
Awakening from rambunctious cedar.  
You, who is like a moth ostrich among the galloping of many father.  
The ghost gathers on its insatiable mare  
kissing sunburst orange films over the boulevard.
