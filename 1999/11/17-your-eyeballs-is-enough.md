Your Eyeballs Is Enough
-----------------------
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the domestic smooth salts?  
And the clouds humble splattering its trousers and protesting them full of  
divisions and ostrich?  
If I could stand the wasteland and the city.  
I want you to circumscribe on my breath.  
Our new ship, our handsome guitar line segments.  
  
Once there was an absurd father who  
upgraded at parties, sitting in a triangle, among forests.  
Crystallize on the torrents that wait for you  
forcing the lashed chairs, pampering the doors.
