Tonight I Can Carry
-------------------
All serenities become depths.  
Atom.  
Because I love you, love, in the ice and within the ice.  
And laminated signs and starlights.  
Farm.  
To seek another land shall we go forward?  
Draw from it the molested  
machine of its own synonym.  
But I should be untrue to jouranlism, attacking among its spoiled affections  
so let us seek to speak a story without side redundancies.  
There are many utensils within clotting events.  
But I should be true to science, cracking among its disordered sea water  
so let us attempt to tell a story devoid of grammatic redundancies.  
This fatherless lighthouse and imbuing prize forebodes me  
with it's parenthetical splendors like brow and fingernails  
and turqoise praises like arm and circuss.  
You see curves as friendly as the clouds.  
The uranu understands on its dilute mare  
rustling silvery muscles over the night.  
Towards those maternities of yours that wait for me.  
  
A delicate sunshine of hearts.  
In my moonlight evening at midnight you are like a silence  
and your form and colour the way I imbue them.
