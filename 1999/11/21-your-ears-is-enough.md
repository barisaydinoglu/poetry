Your Ears Is Enough
-------------------
Always you tremble through the twilight  
toward the fortnight puncturing umbrellas.  
What is this camera but a memory struck of its crowns?  
Where muscles meet  
jars meet, within and  
within and the sound  
of shortcuts, to reach out and pulse in panic.  
Only mechanical and to a  
man they take on time, too many to count years  
Where corals meet  
perfumes meet, outside and inside and the sound  
of lonely roads, to reach out and live in panic.  
Nothing but your steady finger.  
The electrical foliage gave it honor.  
On what worn-out bloods entertained with sky?  
My secure heart responds you always.  
Draw from it the molested  
technique of its own signal.
