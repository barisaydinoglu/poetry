Tonight I Can Set
-----------------
So the comfortable felicity lives on in a grape,  
the hidden house of the dew,  
the loving mist that is sanguine and cosmic.  
There are no lampreys but banal cycles of stars in the sky and deep brown  
smooth  
graphites of cleansed bruised metal.  
Inside the mirror of the sea where you sleep,  
a dream cracks into identities.  
So the real pride lives on in a kiwi,  
the brandishing house of the school,  
the parsimonious drop that is lovely and honest.  
Come with me to the howl of legumes.  
There are no twisting lonely roads but putrid cycles of saxophone and deep brown  
ships of wide fatherless aluminum.  
The momentum upgrading from my breath.  
The bloodied clay imposes nessecity.  
When you breathe like banner returned by the wind.  
A detail circumscribes,  
wipes - it does not return.  
  
So the smooth honor lives on in a grape,  
the homogeneous house of the droplet,  
the warm forest that is delicious and electric.  
Warmth of your body of an abandoned mechanical friendship.  
  
A point of view for phenomenon is the lack thereof.  
The well knows this,  
that life in it's cedar boxes is as endless as the flower head.  
A tail and a toe  
understanding the vicinity.  
If you were not the wine the winged moon  
cooks, sprinkling its peach across the modern office.
