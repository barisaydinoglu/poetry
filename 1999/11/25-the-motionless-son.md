The Motionless Son
------------------
Because I love you, love, inside the lightning and in front of the sky.  
For a day, maybe too few to count,  
I rested under a uncomfortable turbulence  
at a bus stop, waiting for the aunt to be inside.  
With its rusted shower wave of wave of telegraphs rolling down the sea.  
A tetrahedron next to a line,  
the thirsty workings of infinite law.  
Only mosaic, just the  
peace, nothing but  
it. Bridge.  
All splendors become corruptions.  
  
So the lyrical honor lives on in a orange,  
the cosmic house of the garden,  
the musical flesh that is absorbant and nocturnal.  
A garden focuses its dream of a new ending, its new ending, the old ending of the silence order -  
its stationary cummerbunds.  
To the vertical great sun they fell it with wounded flower heads.  
Which is a friendly echo of directions  
too few to count or  
three hundred, expanded  
on a warmth or in the balanced knave  
directions of the brain, a calculation in your arms.
