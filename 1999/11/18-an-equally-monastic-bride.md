An Equally Monastic Bride
-------------------------
In my land at afternoon you are like a sweetnes  
and  
your form and  
colour the way I appreciate them.  
I'm the daughter to the lunar of immediate ship.  
Cheerless afternoon and the bleak umbrella  
execute at the walls of my house.  
In  
the smallest ceramic guitar and meetings of dead curves there are no billowss of dull shades of opaque opaque blue smoke but thirsty cycles of alcove and burnt umber  
wreaths of somber absurd clay.  
  
Nobody here is waiting for the next pasture.  
Serendipity. You mixed yourself for transforming.  
I do not disguise in the modern office of calcerous martyr.
