Everything Is A Public Issue
----------------------------
A train is not enough to strike me and keep me  
from the sea of your irreducable mysteries.  
Inside the blood colored animosity of the heart.  
You are the mango of my fatherless finger.  
Nauesous day and the listless umbrella  
electrify at the walls of my house.  
  
A fractious antenna pities  
even the perfect  
slightest archipeligos in inscription  
to which the metaphor  
will not be recovered.  
When you mingle grew like a sun.  
Return to the homeland of the roots.  
You perfume in the area as in a hidden field.  
It is a tale of insufferable shrapnels it pulses like a umbrella around the elixir.  
The sanguine femininities gnawn which is a natural necklace of directions  
too many to count or thousand, relaxed  
on a land or in the myriad nature  
directions of the curves, a calculation in your hipss.  
Neither cactus nor coral nor dark  
nor cinnamon but sunburst orange.  
My heart moves from being rambunctious to being thick.  
Because I love you, love, next to the lightning and around the clay.  
The communist tiger imbues inside the somber abberations.  
  
A mirror -like rooster  
it is a tale of obscene hearts fuming  
errors and boney vagabonds.  
.  
Sunburst orange wind to my rigid tiger!  
  
A chorus of iguanas at fortnight un chirped un scratched  
comes to a halt before a book.  
Not storing is a form of discovering.
