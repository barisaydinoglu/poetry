The Stain Fallen Into The Sea
-----------------------------
The peace sets in shining your curves. The goddess smiles at the lady  
but the child does not smile  
when he looks at the squirrel gentleman  
and the sticky ocean.  
Once there was a frightened aunt who  
trod at parties, sitting in a quadrangle, among trousers.  
Pure  
oblivion discovers the natures divulging the quiver of her perfume full of decency.
