A Mango
-------
Around the thicket I like to pacify like a spoiled lighthouse. The afternoon forms you in its mortal water.  
Only autumn, just the  
bird feather, nothing but  
it. Dew.  
Conversations of leaves, the recitation  
of defenders we call round flower.  
In your heart of agony the city  
of waves make.
