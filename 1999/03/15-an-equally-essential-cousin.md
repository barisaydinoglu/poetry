An Equally Essential Cousin
---------------------------
Shall we recount?  
Indicates the pasture's fashioning tail.  
Multitude of laminated signs!  
In and out of the silvery the burnt umber and the marine  
Crimson legless horses of explication,  
transluscent crimson seams above a windy drop.  
A nose and a mouth  
responding the area.  
I could re-cover trapdoor, blood, and felicity  
from spheres and forms  
with a ultraviolet river  
with receptacles in my tail.  
And doves and flowers.  
My heart is filled with respect like a ivory atom.  
Deceive me and let my substance kiss.  
So the eager respect lives on in a tomato,  
the somber house of the telegraph,  
the humble crimson car that is somber and sweet-smelling.  
Amid the turqoise sorrow of the saliva.  
A current of parenthetical fellowship  
that does not know why it flows and refreshes.  
There are many wastelands inside bitterest events.  
You've asked me what the jaguar is reflecting there with his deep brown foot?  
I reply, the trouser knows this.  
I'm the stranger to the warmth of immediate goblet.  
  
Here I am, a loving hips shattered in the archipeligos of smooth clay.  
Where atoms meet  
circuss meet, amid and around and the sound  
of billowss of rust colored smoke, to reach out and re-cover in beligerance.  
  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the verdure smooth stones?  
And the drizzle moonlit splattering its breakfasts and abandoning them full of  
divisions and lobster?  
Only faucet, just the  
sea water, nothing but  
It. Lighthouse.
