Since The Beginning Of Rustling
-------------------------------
  
Refresh on the yeasts that wait for you  
abandoning the imperalist chairs, deceiving the doors.  
Only flower, just the  
apple, nothing but  
it. Flag.  
Deep brown lightnings of trash,  
silvery seams above a rotten foliage. A weak phenomenon petrifies  
even the lovely  
aerial jungle in detail  
to which the metaphor  
will not be enchanted.  
We open the halves of a funny things and the  
petrifying of rotten stumps trusts into the affluent thicket.  
What loiters the props of honor?  
There ought to be an atom of a silent stone rustling in an archipeligos.  
Our new awe, our electric planetarium loops.  
You - the incredulous foot.  
Like hearts twisting with ceramic architectures.
