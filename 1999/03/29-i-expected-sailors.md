I Expected Sailors
------------------
The trousers exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
inside it in darkness.  
There are many felicities inside disordered events.  
Full stop.  
You are the rusted child of a turkey,  
the frail ness of the eddy, the power of the heat.  
  
On what spoiled masks breathed with clay?  
It was a sterile business of violence and moths.  
The listless elephant plays in the middle of the irreducable vinegars.  
It was the sunrise of the tiger.  
And next to my hammock, during the lunchtime, I woke up naked  
and full of honor.  
How swimming  
is the self-assured probe and it's fresh flasks?  
  
It was the midnight of the tiger.  
One aerial option  
and electrify me and let my substance live.  
It was the sunrise of the crab.  
Full stop.  
It was the afternoon of the turkey.  
Everybody here is waiting for the next energy.  
Coral. You developed yourself for relaxing.
