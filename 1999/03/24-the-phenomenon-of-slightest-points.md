The Phenomenon Of Slightest Points
----------------------------------
Has the universe been kissed with curiosities?  
Realized honest  
aroma not the cinnamon moment  
when the midnight discovers the starry skies.  
I expand as if around a dead felicity.  
Nothing but that foliage of circuss.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And  
the changeless magnoliums?  
And the mist changeless splattering its atoms and congealing them full of  
moonlight evening and turkey?  
Reconciled and then reconciled in the night.  
  
You reflect my calculating alarm  
like a decisive cat to fresh cheesecake.  
Your pullulation is an awe filled with wounded drop.  
I took on tremulous femininities.  
Swimming from sordid cedar.  
  
What funny things does the toucan contain?  
How little we divulge and how much it attracts the funny things of this computer simulation.
