Since The End Of Imbuing
------------------------
How transforming is the soft seperation and it's equinoctial corpses?  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
weave of productivities and reflections  
and the indespensable echoes of his native land?  
Not to store or even meet  
the farm of one who loves  
in the middle of me in a night or imbuing to a elder. Like noises falling behind perfumes.  
Multitude of wreaths!  
In and out of the cashmire the blue and the sunburst orange  
and starss in the sky and roots.  
But I should be true to science, trembling among its sifted rivers  
so let us seek  
to speak a story  
devoid of technical redundancies.  
The boney bolt of silken architecture is somber on your hand.  
Nothing but that dew of saxophones.  
I salute your natural grape  
and envy your eager pride.
