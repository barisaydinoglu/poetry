Here I Dedicate You
-------------------
Inside the brimstone illusion of the lonely road.  
You are the lonely child of a toucan,  
the dilute ness of the bottle, the power of the wind.  
You - the honest toe.  
What epiphany does the bird contain?  
How little we love and how much it responds the mysteries of this galaxy.
