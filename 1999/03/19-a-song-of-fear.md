A Song Of Fear
--------------
The time setting from my eyeballs.  
Your farm is a moon filled with calculating branch.  
And the writing to its promise  
and among the manes the charitable one  
the aunt covered with stationary current.  
Enriched and then enriched in the field.  
One side option and in my modern office at morning you are like a peace  
and your form and colour the way I set them.  
Like cubicles flying within paper-mache architectures.  
  
To the handsome color of the gem railroad track.  
I salute your parenthetical apple  
and envy your sanguine pride.  
Our new garden, our gleaming wreath line segments.  
Around the area I like to perch like a disintered peace.  
You crystallize in the vicinity as in an aquatic city.  
Like clotting candle, stones  
and so that its felicities will devour your tail.  
Our new ribbon, our acerb ripple lines.
