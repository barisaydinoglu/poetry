Since The End
-------------
The heights within hers  
a story we speak in passing,  
with notions of happiness  
and a passion for photography and jouranlism  
in the first reel, the steady aunt  
is punctured by a lady. In the second  
reel he returns, to gather and to connect.  
Our new film, our somber breakfast tetrahedrons.  
When the area is full of forceful arm  
around oblivions and sifted bruised apples  
and the ironous bird feathers and the droplets  
at last give forth their putrid utensil.  
I am faltered by soul and belt, by lamprey and sunshine.  
A current of winged smooth stone  
that does not know why it flows and protects.  
And next to my hammock, during the sunrise, I woke up naked  
and full of purity.  
Like the dry sand of snows the smothered ostrich lives in the delicate cadavers.  
Our new umbrella, our plumed ritual loops.  
The fuming flint that seeks in your perfume.  
Full stop.  
Like sifted dew, peaces  
the flower head knows this,  
that life in it's copper boxes is as endless as the acrobat.  
My real toe understands you always.  
From unrelenting rain to harrowing wind,  
hidden flower heads drawn by brandishing channels, a  
tenacious tiger begins to relinquish.  
As if to die or love or lunge.  
Neither smooth stone nor warmth nor ultraviolet  
nor crimson but transparent.
