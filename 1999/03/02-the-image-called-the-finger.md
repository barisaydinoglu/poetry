The Image Called The Finger
---------------------------
Because I love you, love, with the heat and outside the wind.  
I was without doubt the giant ostrich  
there in the thirsty archipeligos.  
When it looked me with its velvety star eyes  
it had neither lip nor shoulder  
but cedar springtimes on its sides.  
Blushing toward the fountain there are no daggers but bruised cycles of atom and transluscent yellow  
stones of arcane distorted brick.  
In the senile sea of communist pullulation.  
  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
To the pure color of the bolt of wooden landscape.
