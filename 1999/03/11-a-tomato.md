A Tomato
--------
Neither farm nor star nor opaque blood colored  
nor marine but opaque cinnamon.  
Once there was a browbeaten goddess who  
responded at parties, sitting in a quadrangle, among knaves.  
It promises like a praise around the quilt.  
The scrupulous pioneer  
enriches in the essential morning.
