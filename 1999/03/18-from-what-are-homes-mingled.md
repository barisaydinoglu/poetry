From What Are Homes Mingled
---------------------------
Full stop. The paths exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
in front of it in  
darkness.  
A triangle among a square,  
the careless workings of smooth law.  
A sequence for point of view is the lack thereof.  
Sometimes a piece of the fire  
disguises like a bed in my shoulder.  
Shall we recount?  
In your eyeballs of foreboding the vicinity begins to dream of reconciling.  
Went drank in mane the gentleman smiles at the fisherman  
but the mother does not smile  
when he looks at the toucan pioneer  
and the cold ocean.  
  
Not reconciling is a form of protecting.  
Not weaving is a form of mixing.  
You transform headlong into a boulevard to inherit your business.  
Dawn on the shrapnels that wait for you  
shaking the furious chairs, dying the doors.  
Carry me onto your boat - the cherry of my law -  
the charitable pioneer  
refreshes in the honest morning.  
A chorus of oysters at sunrise un gathered un degraded  
comes to a halt before a flower head.
