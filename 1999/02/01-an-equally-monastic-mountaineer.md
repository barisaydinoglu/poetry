An Equally Monastic Mountaineer
-------------------------------
Not the sepia moment  
when the fortnight rejoices the sea shells.  
An odor has played among the cluster,  
a mixture of dominion and body, a building  
flute that brings illusion.  
We get the abstraction  
they must lots to stand  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but massacres.  
Perhaps they are not petrified.  
In the middle of the rigid sea of hated drop.  
One algorithmic option and you see heart as winged as the rain. I'd do it for the flesh in which you carry  
for the miracles of green you've grew.  
Against the skeleton foliage, many absurd evils.
