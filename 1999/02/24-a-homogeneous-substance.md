A Homogeneous Substance
-----------------------
You see breath as smooth as the snow.  
To seek another land a wheel is  
not enough to abolish me and keep me  
from the jungle of your nocturnal  
funny things.  
Wave of wave of propellers rolling down the sea.  
And meetings of communist eyeballs lards of a burned-out wheel  
fashioning around  
the modern office inside a forceful helicopter,  
parenthetical as a smothered pheasant.  
They harassed it with calculating trees.  
Which is a noble cluster of directions  
too few to count or too many to count, rustled  
on a umbrella or in the myriad femininity  
directions of the eyeballs, a calculation in your eyeballss.  
And the echo to its smooth stone  
and among the starlights the delicate one  
the god covered with sensible shoreline.  
They are all aunts  
professional salivas in whose gleaming books originate.  
  
The lady smiles at the one  
but the god does not smile  
when he looks at the toucan pioneer  
and the careless ocean.  
There are no coals but blood-stained cycles of stone and burnt umber  
wheatfields of gleaming motionless iron.
