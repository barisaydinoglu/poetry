There Is No Conspirator
-----------------------
Everything careless with lion hearted voices, the salt of the sweetnes  
and piles of natural bread within night.  
Only oily and to a  
goddess they take on time, thousand years  
Wave of wave of pullulations rolling down the sea.  
Agony and circus - farms of illusion.  
  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
drink of dews and femininities  
and the verdure  
hats of his native land?
