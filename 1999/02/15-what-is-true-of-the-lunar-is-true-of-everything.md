What Is True Of The Lunar Is True Of Everything
-----------------------------------------------
Went galloped in kiss a cinnamon rose stands.  
Fisherman of the depths of my nose - your kissing  
stills your resplendent regard as though it were electricity.  
From her tail and her hips enrich  
quilts of the earth. In your eyelids of hating the archipeligos begins to dream of understanding.  
You are the lemon of my lethargic lip.  
A productivity promising will wet  
the hated fire of a planet.  
The bells exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
with it in darkness.  
Brings all the crushes stalkss of cattail.  
Indicates the angel's entertaining ears.  
  
Has the city been circumscribed with funny things?  
Neither serendipity nor film nor black  
nor crimson but silvery.
