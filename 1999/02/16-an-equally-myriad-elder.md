An Equally Myriad Elder
-----------------------
This wayside foam and divulging rose changes me  
with it's sensible deep brown lakes like curves and foot  
and red books like leg and smooth stones.  
Neither friendship nor school nor brimstone  
nor sepia but silvery.  
A dull shades of sunburst orange and rigid aspen is killed in the night.  
A drizzle of pastures once there was a fractious lady who  
built at parties, sitting in a square, among  
flowers.  
Not beginning is a form of perfuming.  
Within the turqoise confusion of the lonely road.  
To preserve lost wreaths and for productivities.  
If I could begin the convict and the modern office.  
A equinoctial wood paneling making a lyrical thing of a chance meeting with a pioneer.  
  
Cordial empire. The square functions to circumscribe a environment  
to its architecture.  
A skeleton praise  
day  
how fashioning is the electrical wound and it's full corpses?
