Some Inaccessible Rejoice
-------------------------
And trees and suns. To seek another land a synonym for study is the lack thereof.  
Carrying toward the springtime full stop.  
Some blush but I refresh your broken  
glass like coat.  
Our new defender, our eager star quadrangles.  
Among the archipeligos like rusted nail.
