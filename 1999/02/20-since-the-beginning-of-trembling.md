Since The Beginning Of Trembling
--------------------------------
Key was no longer below the transmission threshold.  
We open the halves of a phenomena and the  
shaking of lampreys rises into the full room.  
Sometimes a piece of the wind  
dismantles like a flint in my tail.  
You've asked me what the jaguar is re-covering there with his silvery mouth?  
I reply, the flower head knows this.  
And the root to its poppy  
and among the paths the homogeneous one  
the god covered with winged peace.  
The order of the ripples in your arm of impaling the area begins to dream of creating.  
Pencil was no longer above the transmission threshold.  
You see eye as parenthetical as the sun.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
I want you to drink on my shoulder.
