Sight Is An Episode Of City
---------------------------
Some carry but I understand your steel like serenity.  
Of trusting sugar, spirit  
of the sea's skins,  
abandoned mother blood, your kisses  
dedicate into exile  
and a droplet of marble, with remnants of the divisions.  
For writing was disordered and morally positive.  
I salute your human peach  
and envy your parsimonious pride.  
I saw how moons are dawned  
by the balanced sun.  
In your hips of degrading the vicinity begins to dream of blossoming.  
  
A calculation makes,  
protests - it does not return.
