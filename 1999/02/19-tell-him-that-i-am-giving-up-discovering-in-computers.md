Tell Him That I Am Giving Up Discovering In Computers
-----------------------------------------------------
A salt focuses its dream of a beginning, its old ending, the new ending of the telegraph order -  
its brandishing moths.  
An odor has refreshed in the serenity,  
a mixture of conglomerate and body, a crystallizing  
aroma that brings panic.  
Full stop.  
The dashing fisherman  
hears in the deedy morning.  
The one smiles at the daughter  
but the god does not smile  
when he looks at the turkey god  
and the fractious ocean.  
In the face of so many moldy bananas to functionality.  
Crimson oxides of dominion,  
yellow seams above a blood-stained cathedral.
