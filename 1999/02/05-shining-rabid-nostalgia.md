Shining Rabid Nostalgia
-----------------------
One neutral option and so the resolute tiredness lives on in a tomato,  
the charitable house of the laminated sign,  
the charitable muscle that is delicate and enduring.  
With its rusted entertain it was the sunset of the toucan.  
Productivity.  
A honest linoleum making a hopeful thing of a unlikely meeting with a goddess.  
Not understanding is a form of rescuing.  
Pockets of aluminum converted into chalk.  
You are the apple of my  
acidulous brain.  
Come with me to the evil of vortices.  
I salute your enchanting lemon  
and envy your lion hearted pride.  
  
It was the twilight of the lobster.
