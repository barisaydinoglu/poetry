She Has A Ghostly Complex
-------------------------
I salute your dashing  
bread  
and envy your affluent pride.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
dawn of schools and keys  
and the warm trysts of his native land?  
Winged, wooden atom!  
He is in the middle of us at this moment of first shining.  
And you swim like a light and a chorus of lobsters at early light of day un performed un faltered  
comes to a halt before a praise.  
What we say conducts to  
light some other one  
what a point of view may teach.  
  
A banner -like cadaver  
but I should be untrue to oceanography, loitering among its bleak lunars  
so let us begin to speak a story devoid of individual redundancies.
