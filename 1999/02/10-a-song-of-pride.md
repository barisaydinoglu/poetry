A Song Of Pride
---------------
All schools become violences.  
Uncle of the depths of my brain - your reconciling  
stills your comfortable regard as though it were earth.  
In the first reel, the velvety giant  
is hated by an astronaut. In the second  
reel he returns, to fly and to chirp.  
And a sifted smooth stone's jungle  
will understand you.  
A loaf of bread baked with callous honor and salt.  
When you grow like serenity inherited by the wind.
