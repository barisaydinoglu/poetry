Abstraction Is An Episode Of Vortex
-----------------------------------
Inside the moon of the city where you sleep,  
a dream taunts into images.  
We open the halves of a mysteries and the  
deceiving of shadows performs into the incredulous divisions.  
The elder smiles at the stranger  
but the fisherman does not smile  
when he looks at the oyster astronaut  
and the cold ocean.  
The order of the praises pass me and let my substance build.  
I stayed relinquished and blue  
in the middle of the area.  
You flow slowly into a thicket to mingle your business.  
I'm the pioneer to the pullulation of immediate flower.  
My heart is filled with pride like a gold springtime.
