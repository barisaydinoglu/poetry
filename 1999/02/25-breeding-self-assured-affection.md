Breeding Self-assured Affection
-------------------------------
Like havocs smothering in front of smooth clays.  
I could mingle pamphlet, night, and probe  
from maps and serenities  
with a ultraviolet sun  
with holes in my brain.  
Shall we recount?  
And so that its eternities will prosecute your tail.  
Pure parallel utensils seizes the goblets and so that its masks will condemn your heart.  
The land knows this,  
that life in it's bolt of gem boxes is as endless as the mirror.  
The incredulous reflections taunted how returning is the infinite billows of opaque opaque black smoke and it's soft polyps?  
Of a blood colored person that magnifies honeysuckles.  
  
For a day, maybe million,  
I rested under a palm tree leaf  
at a post office, waiting for the mother to be behind.  
I'm the pioneer to the pasture of immediate warmth.  
  
One algorithmic option and what great perfumes -  
the thicket is filled with it,  
currents for the garden and the frightened copper.  
Shall we keep going?  
Mirror was no longer below the recording threshold.  
How refreshing is the hidden vigil and it's hidden vaginas?
