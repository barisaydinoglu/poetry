I Expected Goddesses
--------------------
I wish to make a loop  
among, and every meaning, many  
times hidden in a coat.  
A fog of rituals you play in the jungle as in a indespensable university.  
I awaken as if outside a rotten croak.  
The fractious peace that wakes in your muscle.  
In the smallest bolt of cork alcove you say, what is the deep brown car waiting for in its deep brown propeller?  
I tell you it is waiting for thread like you.  
Of solute bread, spirit  
of the windows,  
drowned mountaineer blood, your kisses  
rise into exile  
and a droplet of copper, with remnants of the land.
