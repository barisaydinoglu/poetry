I Have Gone Decaying
--------------------
All yellow cars become egoes.  
My heart is filled with honor like a copper shades of sunburst orange.  
Not creating is a form of responding.  
You say, what is the snow waiting for in its sand-colored mist?  
I tell you it is waiting for umbrella like you.  
The parched defender is fresh on your nose.  
So the irreducable joy lives on in a fruit,  
the sensible house of the stars in the sky,  
the real angel that is perfect and steady.  
An odor has returned in the writing,  
a mixture of abys and body, a inheriting  
home that brings fear.  
Not the deep brown moment  
when the sunrise wets the threads.
