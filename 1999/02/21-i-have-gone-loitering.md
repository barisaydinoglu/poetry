I Have Gone Loitering
---------------------
Nothing but that window of banners. Everything lashed with naked voices, the salt of the writing  
and piles of noble bread outside twilight. The trusting lady  
develops in the changeless morning.  
From tornado to palm tree leaf,  
hidden silvery cars drawn by angellic channels, a  
communist foam begins  
to live.
