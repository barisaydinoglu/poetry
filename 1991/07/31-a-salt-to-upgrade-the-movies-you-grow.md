A Salt To Upgrade The Movies You Grow
-------------------------------------
For leaf was parched and morally negative. A chorus of lobsters at sunset un kissed un lunged  
comes to a halt before a promise.  
When you blossom lighted like a sea shell.  
You say, what is the sea shell waiting for in  
its marine drop?  
I tell you it is waiting for promise like you.  
Like lonely roads fainting among angels.
