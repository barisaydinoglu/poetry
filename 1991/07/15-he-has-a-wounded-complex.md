He Has A Wounded Complex
------------------------
Purity is gone, the subject has wove.  
Rabid sunset and the smothered stars in the sky  
brainwash at the walls of my house.  
This rustling stone and inheriting mirror petrifies me  
with it's clear peaces like finger and finger  
and rust colored stalkss of cattail like eye and fragrances of strawberry.  
In your eyeballs of loitering the moonlight evening begins to dream of preserving.  
  
Mingling toward the bed once there was a senile fisherman who  
enchanted at parties, sitting in a square, among rivers.  
The stranger smiles at the person  
but  
the pioneer does not smile  
when he looks at the turkey pioneer  
and the harsh ocean.  
A domestic linoleum making a parsimonious thing of a likely meeting with a mountaineer.  
Nothing but your cosmic eye.
