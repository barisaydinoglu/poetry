A Song Of Happiness
-------------------
Someone here is waiting for the next wheatfield.  
Quilt. You began yourself for carrying.  
If I could fashion the enemy and the field.  
Multitude of elixirs!  
In and out of the marine the blue and the sepia  
the I in moon the angellic leaf gave it sincerity.  
You are the kiwi of my cold nose.  
You see fingernails as smooth as the clouds.  
You are the grape of my bitten ears.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
conduct of wreaths and coats  
and the careful guitars of his native land?  
Pride is gone, the subject has dawned.  
How relaxing is the eloquent utensil and it's esoteric vagabonds?  
The holiday railroad tracks you in its mortal earth.
