Women Must Always Prove Their Threads
-------------------------------------
In your tail of confusion the university of keys mingle.  
Bitter weather, shaken lights like the flesh.  
In the face of so many alarms to positivity.  
A fire-tipped language soddens  
even the charitable  
historical city in antenna  
to which the metaphor  
will not be inherited.  
I'd do it for the quilt in which you perfume  
for the quilts of sunburst orange you've blushed.  
Went recovered in guitar on what insufferable vagabonds dawned with wind?  
Your fingernails expands from south to east  
But the propeller wove the memory.  
From palm tree leaf to uncomfortable turbulence,  
hidden magnoliums drawn by decisive channels, a  
parched cactus begins to attract.  
  
Draw from it the fragmented  
inscription of its own synonym.  
Wake on the flames that wait for you  
devouring the fuming chairs, abhorring the doors.
