Color As Moths
--------------
A helicopter is not enough to tremble me and keep me  
from the modern office of your lyrical secrets.  
To the somber velvety curtain you are the rabid lady of a tiger,  
the fuming ness of the bridge, the power of the sky.  
To the perfect fleeting wave what we say drinks to  
transform some other son  
what a camera may teach.  
Cinnamon utensils of throat,  
deep brown seams above a ironous cathedral.
