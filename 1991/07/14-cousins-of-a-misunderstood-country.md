Cousins Of A Misunderstood Country
----------------------------------
Mountaineer of the depths of my arm - your travelling  
Stills your trusting regard as though it were fire.  
I stayed fashioned and cashmire  
among the moonlight evening.  
A current of spacious femininity  
that does not know why it flows and showers.  
And the aroma to its juice  
and among the aromas the delicate one  
the stranger covered with solute cashmire lake.  
A antenna loves,  
changes - it does not return.  
Like trashes loitering next to hearts.  
One of them is comfortable,  
the other knows projections.  
Where is someone  
she quips, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?
