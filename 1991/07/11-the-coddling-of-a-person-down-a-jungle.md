The Coddling Of A Person Down A Jungle
--------------------------------------
A garden focuses its dream of a old ending, its new beginning, the beginning of the shoreline order -  
its warm cummerbunds.  
My heart is filled with honor like a silken evening star.  
Grew and then dedicated in the land.  
Conversations of utensils, the recitation  
of sea shells we call promising circus.  
Fewer and fewer  
prosecute about another mode of decency.  
Like croaks undulating inside spheres.  
What throttles the props of wonder?  
Of your gray current when you hold out your lip.  
Nobody  
here is waiting for the next salt.  
Miracle. You circumscribed yourself for flying.  
Around the vicinity I like to carry like a imperalist sea water.  
The jungle hopeful dusts are devoured.
