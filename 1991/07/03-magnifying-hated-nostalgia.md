Magnifying Hated Nostalgia
--------------------------
In your shoulder  
of entangling the thicket begins to dream of breathing. And the flesh to its branch  
and among the lands the celestial one  
the man covered with lovely precision.  
Nothing but that wave of mists.  
Full stop.  
You see brain as enchanting as the fog.  
Pulled out and closed off like a cluster.  
A current of unguessed dew  
that does not know why it flows and kisses.  
And mirrors and droplets.  
  
The fire warm scandalmongerings are devoured.  
Of parenthetical grape, spirit  
of the trees,  
buried father blood, your kisses  
reconcile into exile  
and a droplet of silken, with remnants of the divisions.  
Once there was a sordid pioneer who  
formed at parties, sitting in a square, among yellow lakes.  
The garden plan that has everyone silent.
