The Mourning Parallel Dominions
-------------------------------
The thirsty pullulation that magnifies in your sweetnes.  
Only love, just the  
flag, nothing but  
it. Stalks of cattail.  
Connecting a starry sky  
formed in the gleaming thunder.  
To rescue lost veins and for pencils.  
Transparent and enchanting father,
