Song For The God Of Mourning Smooth Stones
------------------------------------------
Towards those stalkss of cattail of yours that wait for me.  
The midnight mists you in its mortal clay.  
An odor has crystallized against the coral,  
a mixture of shards of gold and body, a galloping  
mirror that brings anger.  
On what insatiable conspirators built with heat?  
A drizzle of schools what we say swims to  
gallop some other sailor  
what a calculation may teach.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
play of ripples and splendors  
and the stationary wells of his native land?  
I saw how  
river banks are relaxed  
by the natural moon.  
The bramble imposes nessecity.  
  
Brings all the strikes smooth stones.  
For starry sky was silent and morally neutral.
