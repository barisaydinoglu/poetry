A Jar To Begin The Pastures You Gather
--------------------------------------
We get the sense  
they must lots to seek  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but corruptions.  
Perhaps they are not taunted.  
Serenity of a brainwashed bitten door.  
You are the molested gentleman of a oyster,  
the burned-out ness of the key, the power of the ice.  
And corals and lighthouses.  
A ultraviolet and weak ripple is gnawn in the modern office.  
A electric sunshine of acrobats.  
Difficult astronauts and ones.  
For me they are neutral.  
In your fingernails of foreboding the archipeligos begins to dream of rising.  
You magnify in the modern office as in a fleeting vicinity.  
Precision of a disguised spoiled school.  
A inscription for language is the lack thereof.  
The day flowers you in its mortal water.  
Awaken on the stalactites that wait for you  
twisting the rambunctious chairs, abandoning the doors.  
A hushed synonym pities  
even the cleansed  
aerial archipeligos in point of view  
to which the metaphor  
will not be conducted.  
In the first reel, the secure woman  
is scratched by a mountaineer. In the second  
scene he returns, to travel and to expand.  
It excites like a root outside the root.
