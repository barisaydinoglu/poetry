Giants Must Always Prove Their Opaque Transparent Cars
------------------------------------------------------
A transluscent transparent movie stores.  
From ocean wave to tornado,  
hidden forms drawn by smooth channels, a  
dry friendship begins to connect.  
To the infinite color of the silk garden. Not carrying is a form of treading.  
Wave of wave of prizes rolling down the sea.
