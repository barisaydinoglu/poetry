Language With The Howl
----------------------
A chorus of ostriches at afternoon un relaxed un rejected  
comes to a halt before a tryst.  
Fewer and fewer  
brainwash about another mode of decency.  
Fewer and fewer  
lunge about another mode of respect.  
In the first reel, the serene stranger  
is plagued by a pioneer. In the second  
reel he returns, to dawn and to store.  
Of vertical peach, spirit  
of the homes,  
wiped daughter blood, your kisses  
crystallize into exile  
and a droplet of chalk, with remnants of the room.  
Atom.  
The custodian smiles at the god  
but the mother does not smile  
when he looks at the pheasant mountaineer  
and the sterile ocean.
