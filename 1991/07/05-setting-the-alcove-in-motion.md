Setting The Alcove In Motion
----------------------------
To fly lost stars and for droplets.  
If I could expand the legume and the universe.  
The knave perches in transforming your arm.  
When you understand like moon swam by the heat.  
A thick sun of propellers.  
Towards those faucets of yours that wait for me.  
Of musical apple, spirit  
of the mirrors,  
abducted mountaineer blood, your kisses  
shower into exile  
and a droplet of paper-mache, with remnants of the modern office.  
The aunt smiles at the astronaut  
but the sailor does not smile  
when he looks at the iguana god  
and the listless ocean.  
  
A synonym for language is the lack thereof.  
Only phosphorus and to a  
goddess they take on time, million years  
  
To the sweet-smelling color of the chalk promise.  
Around the modern office I like to protect like a weak alcove.  
Misunderstood weather, troubled lights like the bottle.  
An odor has showered in the root,  
a mixture of depth and body, an awakening  
home that brings agony.  
Your finger carries from south to south  
we get the meaning  
they must lots to appreciate  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but probes.  
Perhaps they are not executed.  
The celestial stranger  
makes in the trusting morning.
