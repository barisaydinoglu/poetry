Everyday You Enchant
--------------------
For a day, maybe three hundred,  
I rested under a pillow of fog  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the person to be with.  
With its banal respond troubled abyss and raucous gates.  
I took on ghostly sea shells.  
There are no explications but dilute cycles of wheatfield and sand-colored  
paths of clear fuming brick.  
The reasons for my respect  
are rustled in my curves of emerald.  
Pockets of brick converted into cedar.  
  
To the hopeful color of the copper window.  
Shall we move on?  
You are the grape of my crooked hand.  
Acrobat of a replaced fire-tipped bell.  
The free warmth of your body gave it joy.  
Like bones replacing within graces.  
  
Hat.  
My silent eyelids discovers you always.  
There are many howls among cheerless events.  
All gardens become abberations.  
A putrid crown day  
a rust colored and molested sea water is decayed in the jungle.  
The fluidic lighthouses bristled of your opaque brimstone farm when you hold out your shoulder.  
Making the pullulation of her pasture full of sincerity.
