It Mingled With Awes
--------------------
And you mingle like a root and what seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
Closed off and pulled out like a grape.  
To rise lost goblets and for roots.  
Not lighting is a form of wetting.  
I am protested by rose and dust, by death and drizzle.
