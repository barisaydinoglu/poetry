Since The End Of Fluttering
---------------------------
And a difficult defender's jungle will discover you. The spoiled rose is pure on your shoulder.  
Pure stench wakes the circuss the boulevard amid hers  
a history we tell in passing,  
with notions of purity  
and a passion for engineering and engineering  
with transluscent opaque burnt umber water and sunburst orange paths.  
With the root of the boulevard where you sleep,  
a dream forebodes into projections.  
Not mixing is a form of recovering.  
The I in smooth graphite nothing but your resolute arm.  
The goddess smiles at the person  
but the astronaut does not  
smile  
when he looks at the turkey uncle  
and the frightened ocean.  
Your tiger is a friendship filled with wet-winged saxophone.  
Warm empire.  
The loop functions to store a environment  
to its architecture.
