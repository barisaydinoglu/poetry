Mothers Of A Disintered Country
-------------------------------
The I in starry sky I dawn as if inside a phosphorus evil.  
Return to the homeland of the branches.  
To the warm eloquent soul the astronaut smiles at the daughter  
but the uncle does not smile  
when he looks at the crab pioneer  
and the tenacious ocean.  
In your hips of animosity the region of hooves pacify.
