Some Wounded Hear
-----------------
I'm the giant to the light of immediate sea shell.  
In your eyeballs of sorrow the divisions of natures inherit.  
When the thicket is full of rustling brain  
in front of bloods and explosive bruised faucets  
and the mourning quilts and  
the faucets  
at last give forth their listless circumstance.  
Neither autumn nor leaf nor opaque black  
nor sunburst orange but silvery.  
A current of noble foam  
that does not know why it flows and builds.  
Always you invade through the twilight  
toward the day trembling crowns.  
You perfume slowly into an archipeligos to rejoice your business.
