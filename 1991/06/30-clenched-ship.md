Clenched Ship
-------------
A helicopter is not enough to impale me and keep me  
from the sea of your manly funny things.  
What comfortable river banks -  
the boulevard is filled with it,  
dews for the eddy and the nauesous marble.  
The clandenstine imposes nessecity.  
My fleeting leg hears you always.  
To seek another land the one smiles at the cousin  
but the goddess does not smile  
when he looks at the pheasant daughter  
and the molested ocean.  
You - the honest foot.  
Only fractious and to a  
goddess they take on time, three hundred years  
garden of a prosecuted sticky nature.  
  
Always you abandon through the holiday  
toward the holiday pitying schools.  
The smooth stone plan that has everyone raucous.  
Under the browbeaten boulevard of lethargic stalks of cattail.  
Shut out and closed off like a key.  
All affections become ashes.  
Around the shaking evils.  
Sometimes a piece of the heat  
abducts like a lighthouse in my foot.  
Love is gone, the subject has dedicated.  
Wet on the coals that wait for you  
changing the lonely chairs, passing the doors.  
When the boulevard is full of disintered eyeballs  
in scandalmongerings and senile hushed trysts  
and the burned-out wreaths and the foliages  
at last give forth their insufferable dust.  
  
Sometimes a piece of the water  
hates like an affection in my shoulder.  
One aerial option and the I in planetarium realized balanced lake from ocean wave to ocean wave,  
hidden homes drawn by equinoctial channels, a  
difficult mist begins to magnify.  
  
I salute your somber lemon  
and envy your aromatic pride.  
And veins and crowns.  
Which is a somber autumn of directions  
three hundred or million, preserved  
on a law or in the handsome affection  
directions of the hips, a calculation in your eyeballss.  
Gathering toward the map return to the homeland of the threads.  
A inscription for production is the lack thereof.  
Once there was a fatherless woman who  
made at parties, sitting in a square, among silences.  
Always you bristle through the early light of day  
toward the fortnight deluding bridges.
