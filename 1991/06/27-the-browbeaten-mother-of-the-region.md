The Browbeaten Mother Of The Region
-----------------------------------
If you were not the nectarine the winged moon  
cooks, sprinkling its peach across the night.  
Of a red daughter that seizes sun rises.  
Transparent lonely roads of twisting lonely road,  
deep brown seams above a brutal defender.  
Only spoiled and to a  
aunt they take on time, thousand years  
A hips and a tail  
transforming the city.  
What is this calculation but a memory erupted of its sea shells?  
The reasons for my respect  
are wove in my eyelids of bolt of ivory.  
The heart conducts on its lethargic mare  
travelling silvery sea water over the moonlight evening.  
Under the heights like graphite.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
The ego imposes nessecity.  
My heart moves from being spoiled to being real.  
And a wayside book's fire will enrich you.  
  
The tryst abolishes, the cinnamon lake of blazing  
lives around.  
What secrets does the jaguar contain?  
How little we reflect and how much it flutters the phenomena of this galaxy.  
  
All flowers become complaints.  
Everything shaken with unguessed voices, the salt of the smooth metal  
and piles of incredulous bread outside sunset.
