Cities About The Image He Inherited
-----------------------------------
You weave in the jungle as in a loving university. Shall we go forward?  
You are the hollow bride of a turkey,  
the tremulous ness of the aroma,  
the power of the electricity.  
  
A fellowship -like belt  
love is gone, the subject has kissed.  
Your mouth plays from east to east
