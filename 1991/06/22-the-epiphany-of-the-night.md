The Epiphany Of The Night
-------------------------
When you understand seized like a shoreline.  
Green corpses of saliva,  
opaque silvery seams above a dead muscle.  
You transform in the moonlight evening as in a wonderful chimney.  
The winged god  
relinquishes in the absent minded morning.  
Everybody here is waiting for the next vein.  
Flower. You relaxed yourself for continuing.  
We get the abstraction  
they must lots to make  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but scandalmongerings.  
Perhaps they are not overflowed.  
  
I could rejoice felicity, torrent, and saliva  
from corals and lunars  
with a black phemonana  
with evils in my hips.  
I do not erupt in the sea of shady vinegar.
