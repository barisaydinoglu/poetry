How To Execute Uncle Eyeballss
------------------------------
A brimstone and muzzled sphere is prosecuted in the land.  
Around the divisions I like to mingle like a frightened nature.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the rosy bird feathers?  
And the sunshine musical splattering its dews and loitering them full of  
archipeligos and pheasant?  
But I should be untrue to jouranlism, filtering among its fire-tipped leaves  
so let us try to speak a story without minor redundancies.  
Candle.  
Went began in foliage it was the day of the lobster.  
Martyrs of a ironous wheel  
mixing with the jungle within a putrid boat,  
soft as a hated elephant.  
It was the sunset of the jaguar.  
A chorus of squirrels at night un stored un mourned  
comes to a halt before a lake.  
Our new friendship, our musical curtain quadrangles.  
A marine peace perches.  
If you were not the nectarine the soft moon  
cooks, sprinkling its orange across the night.  
A dull shades of yellow and neon bed is deformed in the divisions.  
Indicates the bird feather's perching foot.  
What secrets does the elephant contain?  
How little we protect and how much it enchants the curiosities of this galaxy.
