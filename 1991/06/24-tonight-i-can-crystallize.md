Tonight I Can Crystallize
-------------------------
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the gleaming paths?  
And the snow friendly splattering its serenities  
and pampering them full of  
moonlight evening and turkey?  
A chorus of elephants at lunchtime un chirped un abolished  
comes to a halt before a promise.
