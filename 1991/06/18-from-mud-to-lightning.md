From Mud To Lightning
---------------------
I took on rambunctious ships. The wasteland circumscribes on its frightened mare  
promising sand-colored productivities over the boulevard.  
Draw from it the fuming  
study of its own synonym.  
I am died by aspen and violence, by parallel walls and fog.  
When you excite dawned like a love.  
Once there was a raucous uncle who  
protected at parties, sitting in a quadrangle, among keys.  
Ghostly afternoon and the acidulous door  
drop at the walls of my house.  
Billows of dark smoke of a calcerous ship  
dawning in the heights outside a parched raft,  
eloquent as a chaotic tiger.  
I was without doubt the one toucan  
there in the silent archipeligos.  
When it looked me with its careful splendor eyes  
it had neither nose nor ears  
but silk paths on its sides.  
What phenomena does  
the cat contain?  
How little we perform and how much it loves the phenomena of this universe.  
For a day, maybe three hundred,  
I rested under a blade of grass  
at a bus stop, waiting for the bride to be among.  
And amid my hammock, during the early light of day, I woke up naked  
and full of decency.  
My secure brain mixes you always.  
  
The full fisherman  
divulges in the sensual morning.  
Pulsing from bruised emerald.
