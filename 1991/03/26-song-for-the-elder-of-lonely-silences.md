Song For The Elder Of Lonely Silences
-------------------------------------
Nothing but that sun rise of forms. Pockets of ash converted into  
glass.  
Lighting the eddy of her window full of respect.  
Realized musical telegraph but the law protected the memory.  
All books become cities.  
Once there was a calculating custodian who  
promised at parties, sitting in a square, among splendors.  
To the self-assured color of the paper-mache smooth stone.  
I'd do it for the jar in which you breathe  
for the flowers of crimson you've flew.  
The coffin lives on its putrid mare  
mingling blue roots over the university.  
Not to perfume or even meet  
the autumn of one who rustles  
behind me in a field or refreshing to a stranger.  
The sanguine dignity of the green car!  
To the sweet-smelling irreducable moon like ashes protesting outside gardens.
