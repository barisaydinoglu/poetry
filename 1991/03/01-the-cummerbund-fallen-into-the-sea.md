The Cummerbund Fallen Into The Sea
----------------------------------
You - the original brain.  
Which is a cosmic essence of directions  
thousand or three hundred, relinquished  
on a fountain or in the hopeful breakfast  
directions of the mouth, a calculation in your eyes.  
The moldy banana crystallizes on its smothered mare  
relaxing transluscent sunburst orange miracles over the chimney.  
Callous weather, insufferable lights like the ritual.  
Not making is a form of mingling.  
One alphabetic option and person of the depths of my lip - your perching  
stills your profound regard as though it were mud.  
And you develop like a mist and a crooked language pampers  
even the fleeting  
technical region in signal  
to which the metaphor  
will not be galloped.  
The affections exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
in front  
of it in darkness.  
  
The city in front of hers  
a tale we tell in passing,  
with notions of love  
and a passion for computer science and mountaineering  
a breath and a eye  
making the sea.
