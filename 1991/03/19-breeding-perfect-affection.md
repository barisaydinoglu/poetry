Breeding Perfect Affection

From her arm and her eyeballs kiss  
precisions of the earth. Woman of the depths of my leg - your blushing  
stills your fleeting regard as though it were heat.

its incredulous convicts.  
In the first reel, the dashing cousin  
is ignored by a goddess. In the second  
take he returns, to rise and to tread.
