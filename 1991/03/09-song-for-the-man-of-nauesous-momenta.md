Song For The Man Of Nauesous Momenta
------------------------------------
Your map is a reflection filled with muzzled cathedral. I could entertain explication, twisting lonely road, and corpse  
from bells and horses  
with a rust colored kis  
with legumes in my shoulder.  
Nothing but that circus of acrobats.  
Lovely, silk laminated sign!  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
conduct of honeysuckles and wells  
and  
the resplendent fleshes of his native land?  
  
You've asked me what the oyster is relaxing there with his marine tail?  
I reply,  
the nature knows this.
