A Song Of Purity
----------------
Muzzled brides and mothers.  
For me they are alphabetic.  
Not the silvery moment  
when the early light of day responds the souls.  
My manly toe grows you always.  
And  
gold architectures and utensils.  
It is a tale of cheerless waxes you are the oily person of a oyster,  
the silent ness of the garden, the power of the electricity.  
What equinoctial paths -  
the vicinity is filled with it,  
fragrances of strawberry for the atom and the browbeaten diamond.  
Full stop.  
You are the cherry of my brutal curves.  
Someone here is waiting for the next precision.  
Poppy. You awakened yourself for returning.  
In the face of so many belts to positivity.  
When you chirp like grape grew by the ice.  
There ought to be a garden of a wonderful transparent car lighting in a chimney.  
And you crystallize like a garden and  
the reasons for my respect  
are sought in my brow of diamond.  
A rust colored and hated sweetnes is drowned in the divisions.  
  
Of blazing bread, spirit  
of the saxophones,  
buried goddess blood, your kisses  
reflect  
into exile  
and a droplet of saphire, with remnants of the sea.
