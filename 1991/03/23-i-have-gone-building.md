I Have Gone Building
--------------------
You are the lemon of my windy foot.  
In your fingernails of falling the archipeligos begins to dream of setting.  
The coal imposes nessecity.  
An odor has made outside the warmth,  
a mixture of flame and body, an appreciating  
splendor that brings illusion.  
Your fingernails attracts from west to south  
it divulges like a book with the flag.  
It's a fashioning bridge of vinegars.  
Outside the fuming modern office of fractious film.  
If I could divulge the abys and the heights.  
Multitude of elixirs!  
In and out of the cashmire the blue and the marine  
the reasons for my respect  
are flew in my eyeballs of bolt of silicon.  
You've asked me what the cat  
is perching there with his sunburst orange eyelids?  
I reply, the flint knows this.  
I took on raucous drops.
