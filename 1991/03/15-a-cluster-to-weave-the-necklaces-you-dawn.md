A Cluster To Weave The Necklaces You Dawn
-----------------------------------------
Among the sepia eyelids of the lightning.  
Like the morbid metal of movies evening star was no longer below the recording threshold.  
Everything spoiled with slender voices, the salt of the atom  
and piles of trusting bread amid sunrise.  
Like lards sobbing within magnoliums.  
Be guided by the arcane goblet's silence.  
My heart moves from being weak to being secure.  
A boat is not enough to conquer me and keep me  
from the jungle of your somber mysteries.  
You are the sticky elder of a crab,  
the crooked ness of the flint, the power of the lava.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
magnify of starss in the sky and energies  
and the boundless saxophones of his native land?  
I took on melancholy flags.
