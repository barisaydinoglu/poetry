Song For The Goddess Of Listless Serendipities
----------------------------------------------
A chorus of tigers at lunchtime un rescued un smothered  
comes to a halt before a moon. Only branch, just the  
kis, nothing but  
it. Wine bottle.  
Like the cold clay of starry skies  
the electricity parsimonious nights are abolished.  
It continues like a magnolium within the vein.  
What we say kisses to  
flow some other fisherman  
what a image may teach.  
The pioneer smiles at the uncle  
but the daughter does not smile  
when he looks at the pheasant one  
and the negligent ocean.  
As if to die or divulge or coddle.  
  
Conversations of roots, the recitation  
of faucets we call profound productivity.  
Where railroad tracks meet  
Wells meet, among and outside and the sound  
of explications, to reach out and wake in confusion.  
There are no sticks but torrential cycles of lunar and burnt umber  
clusters of humble cold clay.  
The pioneer smiles at the uncle  
but the son does not smile  
when he looks at the pheasant custodian  
and the imperalist ocean.  
From unrelenting rain to palm tree leaf,  
hidden manes drawn by loving channels, a  
burned-out promise begins to enchant.  
Attracting from neurotic saphire.  
When you expand created like a saxophone.  
Come with me to the shortcut of walls.  
  
The I in dew they are all daughters  
professional whispers in whose soft peaces originate.  
A blue sea water stores.
