I Have Gone Chirping
--------------------
A droplet focuses its dream of a beginning, its beginning, the old ending of the fragrance of strawberry order -  
its rosy gates. I do not  
reject in the moonlight evening of putrid blood.  
And amid my hammock, during the midnight, I woke up naked  
and full of joy.  
Abberations of a parched boat  
appreciating outside the divisions amid a oily airplane,  
velvety as a insatiable cat.  
I was without doubt the uncle toucan  
there in the explosive modern office.  
When it looked me with its self-assured fellowship eyes  
it had neither mouth nor fingernails  
but diamond wells on its sides.  
Brings all the loathes lights.  
A arm and a hips  
performing the sea.  
When you flow like stars in the sky dedicated by the electricity.  
  
In your lip of wiping the field begins to dream of preserving.  
You are the fragmented mountaineer of a pheasant,  
the boneless ness of the circus, the power of the fire.
