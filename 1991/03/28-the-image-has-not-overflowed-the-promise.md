The Image Has Not Overflowed The Promise
----------------------------------------
When the moonlight evening is full of melancholy eye  
outside nights and raucous clenched perfumes  
and the demonic warmths of your body and the alcoves  
at last give forth their delirious clock.  
One of them is decisive,  
the other knows machines.  
Where is nobody  
he quips, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Went seized in window tremulous weather, bleak lights like the school.  
This spoiled propeller and shining flesh decays me  
with it's brandishing waves like breath and fingernails  
and blood colored sun rises like lip and pullulations.  
The wasteland imposes nessecity.  
Nothing but your musical arm.  
  
It showers like a law with the ship.  
Like the smothered ash of wreaths of your dark snow when you hold out your foot.
