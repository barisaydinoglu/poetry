Setting The Springtime In Motion
--------------------------------
The circuss exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
inside it in darkness. A shades of sunburst orange -like trap  
the vertical dignity of the door!  
The reasons for my respect  
are carried in my curves of saphire.
