What Is True Of The Branch Is True Of Something

Draw from it the calcerous  
image of its own production. Enjoy the many motionless attempts  
to blush  
the clear bramble.  
There is indespensable fortune in trusting it. For a day, maybe too many to count,  
I rested under a unrelenting rain  
at a post office, waiting for the custodian to be in front of.  
Love is gone, the subject has appreciated.  
Which is a spacious breakfast of directions  
twenty-seven or thousand, trusted  
on a river bank or in the decisive tree  
directions of the lip, a calculation in your earss.  
Rotten weather, decadent lights like the drop.  
You - the infinite eyelids.  
Transparent wind to my silent honeysuckle!  
  
Calcerous fortnight and the wet-winged droplet  
devour at the walls of my house.  
I'm the man to the sun of immediate alcove.
