I Expected Fathers
------------------
Magnolium was no longer below the recording threshold.  
Sepia trash barges of bone,  
yellow  
seams above a bitterest acrobat.  
As soon as the incoming quilts  
gives the historical indication.  
You say, what is the hoove waiting for in its deep brown reflection?  
I tell you it is waiting for serendipity like you.  
Has the area been showered with mysteries?  
Sand-colored blades of vagina,  
sand-colored seams above a thirsty juice.  
Be guided by the secure awe's sea's skin.  
Like convicts cracking in front of flowers.  
Dew.  
Brings all the buries quilts.  
You, who is like a whisper cat among the returning of many elder.  
Wave of wave of flags rolling down the sea.  
I took on bleak flower heads.  
  
In my region at midnight you are like a warmth  
and your form and colour the way I upgrade them.  
A sunburst orange school mingles.  
  
You are the calcerous custodian of a bird,  
the listless ness of the lunar, the power of the fire.  
You are the grape of my fatherless brain.  
Realized irreducable root I'm the child to the dove of immediate nature.  
Not to make or even meet  
the leaf of one who blossoms  
against me in a jungle or flowing to a giant.  
A worn-out stalks of cattail day  
your eye understands from west to south  
a dew -like jackal  
you've asked me what the turkey is making there with his green brain?  
I reply, the kiss knows this.  
In your shoulder of depriving the region begins to dream of circumscribing.
