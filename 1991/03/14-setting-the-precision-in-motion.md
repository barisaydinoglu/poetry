Setting The Precision In Motion
-------------------------------
Here I am, a vertical hips congealed in the vicinity of reflection.  
When the moonlight evening is full of dilute heart  
around noises and phosphorus mourning autumns  
And the negligent reflections and the flower heads  
at last give forth their delirious cold fire.  
A line among a triangle,  
the bruised workings of secure law. What phenomena does the turkey contain?  
How little we seek and how much it flutters the epiphany of this computer simulation.
