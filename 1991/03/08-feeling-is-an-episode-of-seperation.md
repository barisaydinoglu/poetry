Feeling Is An Episode Of Seperation
-----------------------------------
When you flutter imbued like a ripple.  
Shifty lunchtime and the clenched pasture  
wet at the walls of my house.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
In the middle of the lonely aroma, many clenched lances.  
The starry uncle  
expands in the lion hearted morning.  
A loaf of bread baked with mechanical tiredness and salt.  
A rust colored and violenet angel is hated in the land.
