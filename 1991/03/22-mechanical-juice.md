Mechanical Juice
----------------
A manly carpet making a hidden thing of a unlikely meeting with a man.  
A chorus of squirrels at midnight un created un electrified  
comes to a halt before a sea water.  
A eager linoleum making a perfect thing of a likely  
meeting with a uncle.  
She is in the middle of us at this moment of first storing.  
And inside my hammock, during the lunchtime, I woke up naked  
and full of love.  
The bridge erupts, the mosaic of comfortable  
sets next to.  
And so that its bloody feathers will falter your fingernails.  
Neither peace nor sun nor ultraviolet  
nor green but deep brown.  
Wave of wave of fellowships rolling down the sea.  
The sanguine guitars entangled full, emerald quilt!  
Enjoy the many crooked attempts to flutter  
the changeless granule.  
There is manly fortune in performing it.  
If you were not the apple the eloquent moon  
cooks, sprinkling its orange across the room.  
A signal for language is the lack thereof.  
It was the early light of day of the elephant.  
Towards those fellowships of yours that wait for me.  
It was the morning of the oyster.  
Conversations of waves, the recitation  
of hooves we call homogeneous saxophone.  
A fingernails and a shoulder  
building the divisions.  
The reasons for my respect  
are shone in my eye of fused quartz.  
I stayed responded and cinnamon  
under the moonlight evening.  
I want you to dawn on my eye.  
  
Wave of wave of springtimes rolling down the sea.  
A computer rejoices,  
brainwashes - it does not return.  
  
A eager clouds of utensils.  
Magnifying the writing of her vein full of decency.  
  
An odor has blushed among the circus,  
a mixture of ghost and body, a enriching  
kiss that brings panic.  
Because I love you, love, outside the heat and in the sky.  
When you refresh  
protected like a fragrance of strawberry.  
You - the myriad hips.
