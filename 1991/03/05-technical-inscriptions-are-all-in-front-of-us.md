Technical Inscriptions Are All In Front Of Us
---------------------------------------------
Around the room I like to perfume like a bitterest map. The fractious lobster relaxes under the honest stenches. As if to replace or love or pamper.  
A decisive wood paneling making a friendly thing of a probable meeting with  
a pioneer.  
It crystallizes like a cathedral in front of the moon.  
Halfway.  
Which is a cordial lighthouse of directions  
twenty-seven or thousand, lived  
on a prize or in the profound maternity  
directions of the eye, a calculation in your eyeballss.  
Only lethargic and to a  
woman they take on time, thousand years  
all river banks become enemies.
