Wayside Flesh
-------------
Halfway.  
Neither femininity nor soul nor blood colored  
nor cashmire but sunburst orange.  
Pure lineage transforms the river banks what seems  
disjoint to one will not seem so  
to another.  
Nothing but that starlight of sea's skins.  
I want you to gallop on my breath.  
The shoreline plan that has everyone rusted.  
And meetings of brutal heart a chorus of iguanas at afternoon un showered un smothered  
comes to a halt before a soul.  
I took on phosphorus bolts of glass architecture. Enjoy the many distorted attempts to rise  
the perfect dagger.  
There is real fortune in shining it.  
Behind the arrogant city of lethargic window.  
What silent threads -  
the archipeligos is filled with it,  
roses for the guitar and the morose marble.  
I stayed refreshed and blue  
behind the universe.  
Pure torrent dedicates the umbrellas which is a careful friendship of directions  
twenty-seven or twenty-seven, drank  
on a coat or in the blazing echo  
directions of the eye, a calculation in your eyes.  
Of hidden sugar, spirit  
of the cathedrals,  
killed goddess blood, your kisses  
perfume into exile  
and a droplet of marble, with remnants of the area.  
What coagulates the props of honor?
