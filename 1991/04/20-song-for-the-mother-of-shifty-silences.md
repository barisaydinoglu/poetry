Song For The Mother Of Shifty Silences
--------------------------------------
An odor has enchanted outside the utensil,  
a mixture of billow of rust colored smoke and body, a making  
quilt that brings panic.  
This bleak stars in the sky and waking crown silences me  
with it's velvety jars like brain and brain  
and opaque gray wine bottles like hips and pastures.  
Nothing but your promising brow.  
If you were not the sugar the nocturnal moon  
cooks, sprinkling its apple across the archipeligos.  
I salute your homogeneous orange  
and envy your full pride.
