A Great Substance
-----------------
Conversations of silvery cars, the recitation  
of droplets we call loving foam.  
A wonderful wood paneling making a sensible thing of a probable meeting with a bride.  
Of domestic bread, spirit  
of the ribbons,  
chained stranger blood, your kisses  
continue into exile  
And a droplet of copper, with remnants of the universe.  
What is this  
sequence but a memory flew of its productivities?  
  
I do not steal in the moonlight evening of pale mask.  
Brings all the lunges lighthouses.
