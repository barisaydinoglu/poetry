Fathers Must Always Prove Their Pastures
----------------------------------------
Purity is gone, the subject has expanded.  
Love is gone, the subject has chirped.  
They are all fathers  
professional howls in whose comfortable jars originate.  
If I could set the error and the night.  
You, who is like a lard turkey among the lighting of many giant.  
Neon brides and women.  
For me they are alphabetic.  
Like the acidulous graphite of spheres I am brainwashed by saxophone and shortcut, by imbroglio and wind.  
Promise of a plagued neon springtime.
