Protecting Fragmented Nostalgia
-------------------------------
Shifty weather, blood-stained lights like the coral. Autumn was no longer right at the recording threshold.  
And rivers and lighthouses.  
Sepia and decisive man,  
I want you to return on my finger.  
  
Connecting from rambunctious paper-mache.  
Some entertain but I respond your sand like faucet.  
If I could flutter the wound and the vicinity.  
Smear me and let my substance transform.  
For a day, maybe too many to count,  
I rested under a palm tree leaf  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the pioneer to be outside.  
One slightest option and for juice was fragmented and morally  
neutral.  
Sometimes a piece of the lightning  
sobs like a evening star in my finger.
