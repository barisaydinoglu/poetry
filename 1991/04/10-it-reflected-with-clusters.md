It Reflected With Clusters
--------------------------
And so that its holes will force your lip.  
I wish to make a quadrangle  
in front of, and every sense, many  
times hidden in a sea water.  
I breathe as if with a burned-out belt.  
And clusters and juices.  
Not recovering is a form of kissing.  
Full stop.  
Neither dove nor miracle nor dark  
nor silvery but transparent.
