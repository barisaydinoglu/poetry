Since The Beginning Of Wetting
------------------------------
Nothing but that law of atoms.  
On what mechanical flames stored with electricity?  
I play as if inside a fractious thorn tree.  
From unrelenting rain to harrowing wind,  
hidden flower heads drawn by sensual channels,  
a  
shifty phemonana begins to promise.  
The granule imposes nessecity.  
But I should be untrue to computer science, mourning among its wet-winged awes  
so let us attempt to tell a story without historical redundancies.
