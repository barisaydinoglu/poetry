Since The End Of Setting
------------------------
The juice imposes nessecity.  
Neither bell  
nor silence nor rust colored  
nor opaque green but green.  
For a day, maybe three hundred,  
I rested under a tornado  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the son to be next to.  
But the bridge developed the memory.  
The essential bride  
entertains in the nocturnal morning.  
Boundless empire. The quadrangle functions to promise a environment  
to its environment.  
Everything putrid with decisive voices, the salt of the ritual  
and piles of noble bread around morning.  
I was without doubt the mountaineer cat  
there in the hushed land.  
When it looked me  
with its careful old warrior's medal eyes  
it had neither hand nor eye  
but paper-mache windows on its sides. Among the quiver of the university where you sleep,  
a dream petrifies into sequences.
