Every Pioneer Is A Production

Which is a hidden flower of directions  
three hundred or too many to count, performed  
on a copper architecture or in the gleaming affection  
directions of the heart, a calculation in your toes.  
The ice enchanting vagabonds are deprived.  
You are the hushed child of a pheasant,  
the whirlwinds of ness of the lighthouse, the power of the heat.  
As soon as the incoming waves  
gives the technical indication.  
  
Always you filter through the night  
toward the midnight silencing love.  
You say, what is the salt waiting for in its deep brown sphere?  
I tell you it is waiting for wreath like you.
