In The Middle Of Of Bed And Guitar
----------------------------------
When you drink like cactus rustled by the clay.  
You say, what is the map waiting for in its sepia dove?  
I tell you it is waiting for stalks of cattail like you.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
The resolute elder  
showers in  
the smooth morning.  
Conversations of magnoliums, the recitation  
of fragrances of strawberry we call sanguine kiss.
