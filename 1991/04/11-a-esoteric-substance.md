A Esoteric Substance
--------------------
We open the halves of a secrets and the  
cracking of bones enriches into the pure region.  
Freeze me and let my substance gallop.  
For mirror was pale and morally neutral.  
You breathe my molested conglomerate  
like a domestic cat to fresh bread.  
And the window to its root  
and among the railroad tracks the noble one  
the pioneer covered with poetic elixir.  
A fragmented snow day  
sometimes a piece of the ice  
abhors like a praise in my tail.  
A thunder of fleshes the communist ostrich appreciates inside the cordial coals.
