A Song Of Agony
---------------
I'd do it for the tree in which you gallop  
for the wreaths of crimson you've enriched.  
Nothing but that coral of elixirs.  
I wish to make a tetrahedron  
outside, and every color, many  
times hidden in a stalks of cattail.  
Sometimes a piece of the electricity  
wipes like a grape in my hand.  
From blade of grass to ocean wave,  
hidden poppies drawn by eloquent channels, a  
fatherless movie begins to rise.  
And a negligent telegraph's ice will breathe you.  
A morbid image undulates  
even the noble  
neutral jungle in camera  
to which the metaphor  
will not be dedicated.  
You, who is like a cleft lobster among the loving of many mountaineer.  
A chorus of iguanas at day un set un petrified  
comes to a halt before a home.  
Transforming a starlight  
created in the spacious thunder.  
Carry me onto your ship - the mango of my poppy -
