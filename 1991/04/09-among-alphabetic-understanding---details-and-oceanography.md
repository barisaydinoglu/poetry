Among Alphabetic Understanding - Details And Oceanography
---------------------------------------------------------
Woman of the depths of my breath - your carrying  
stills your great regard as though it were electricity.  
I stayed showered and cashmire  
in the land.  
The school knows this,  
that life in it's gem boxes is as endless as the echo.  
A apple living will excite  
the raucous ice of a planet.  
Shall we set forth?  
The thorn tree treads on its directionless mare  
conducting green keys over the vicinity.  
Nothing but that branch of trousers.  
Lewd aunts and sailors.  
For me they are grammatic.  
In your fingernails of embarassement the jungle of trousers tread.  
The reasons for my respect  
are enriched in my eyelids of silken.  
  
And meetings of dead heart a computer creates,  
sobs - it does not return.  
To expand lost landscapes and for quivers.  
  
What epiphany does the lobster contain?  
How little we rise and how much it blossoms the funny things of this computer simulation.  
Nobody here is waiting for the next curtain.  
Landscape. You rustled yourself for drinking.  
Has the region been dawned with mysteries?  
Divulge on the lineages that wait for you  
passing the cold chairs, pampering the doors.  
  
Among cinnamon water and sunburst orange crimson cars.  
Our new acrobat, our clear foliage triangles.
