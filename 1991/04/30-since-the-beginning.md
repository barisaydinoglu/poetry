Since The Beginning
-------------------
If you were not the bread the absorbant moon  
cooks, sprinkling its apple across the room. Of your blood colored sea's skin when you hold out your tail.  
If I could transform the shrapnel and the room.  
  
She is outside us at this moment of first blossoming.  
They are all sailors  
professional torrents in whose iridescent sun rises originate.  
What we say attracts to  
re-cover some other sailor  
what a sequence may teach.  
  
Return to the homeland of the quilts.  
And meetings of rustling heart of your dull shades of deep brown ribbon when you hold out your eyelids.  
Shut out and pulled out like a prize.  
  
Not  
the cinnamon moment  
when the early light of day rejoices the muscles.  
Planetarium was no longer right at the transmission threshold.
