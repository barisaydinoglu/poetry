A Cherry
--------
The ship plan that has everyone whirlwinds of.  
Only pullulation, just the  
mist, nothing but  
it. Pasture.  
Protecting from wet-winged diamond.  
Behind the tree of the boulevard  
where you sleep,  
a dream undulates into synonyms.  
What we say reconciles to  
protect some other daughter  
what a study may teach.  
A chorus of elephants at lunchtime un lighted un coddled  
comes to a halt before a crown.  
  
A ritual rustling will dawn  
the boneless earth of a planet.  
So the incredulous wonder lives on in a fruit,  
the naked house of the miracle,  
the enchanting reflection that is stationary and myriad.
