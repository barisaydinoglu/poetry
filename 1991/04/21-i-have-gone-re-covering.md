I Have Gone Re-covering
-----------------------
Yellow sky to my cold rose! When the field is full of blood-stained curves  
outside brambles and cold imperalist veins  
and the hollow smooth stones and the bells  
at last give forth their frail shrapnel. Croaks of a dilute vessel  
perfuming within the divisions outside a troubled helicopter,  
plumed as a furious oyster.
