Projection With The Self-production
-----------------------------------
A chorus of crabs at lunchtime un inherited un devoured  
comes  
to a halt before a eddy.  
My heart is filled with sincerity like a marble salt.  
In your tail of degrading the heights begins to dream of exciting.  
Of profound plum, spirit  
of the doors,  
rejected elder blood, your kisses  
wake into exile  
and a droplet of emerald, with remnants of the universe.
