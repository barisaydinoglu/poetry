A Gem Within Gem
----------------
A sequence transforms,  
wets - it does not return.  
Your eyelids hears from north to north  
Your heart plays from south to west  
silent panics and dead invasions.  
  
The bird feathers exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
around it in darkness.
