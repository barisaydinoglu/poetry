The Image Has Not Faltered The Promise
--------------------------------------
Not to reflect or even meet  
the propeller of one who responds  
in the middle of me in a land or dedicating to a one. Delicious empire. The loop functions to fly an architecture  
to its system.  
How relinquishing is the stationary wounded soldier and it's velvety violences?  
The land outside hers  
a story we tell in passing,  
with notions of purity  
and a passion for photography and oceanography  
our new praise, our naked defender triangles.  
An odor has dawned among the path,  
a mixture of gate and body,  
a carrying  
quiver that brings sorrow.  
Carry me onto your train - the fruit of my hat -  
callous twilight and the hushed evening star  
undulate at the walls of my house.  
  
Not the yellow moment  
when the lunchtime travels the productivities.
