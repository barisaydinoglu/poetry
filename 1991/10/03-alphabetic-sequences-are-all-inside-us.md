Alphabetic Sequences Are All Inside Us
--------------------------------------
For candle was shaken and morally negative.  
I want you to expand on my leg.  
Of a blood colored custodian that blushes guitars.  
Return to the homeland of the drops.  
A triangle among a triangle,  
the sticky workings of aquatic law.  
To gather lost flutes and for lighthouses.  
All friendships become shadows.  
There ought to be a movie of a loving sunburst orange car returning in a room.  
Wave of wave of essences rolling down the sea.  
To the irreducable color of the diamond bed.  
You begin my motionless panic  
like a stationary toucan to fresh wine.  
  
What penetrates the props of joy?  
Draw from it the barbaous  
sequence of its own technique.
