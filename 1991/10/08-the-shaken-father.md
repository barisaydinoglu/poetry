The Shaken Father
-----------------
And an arrogant curtain  
's lightning will enchant you.  
When the thicket is full of chaotic breath  
among vaginas and muzzled disintered pullulations  
and the sordid leaves and the starry skies  
at last give forth their calculating trapdoor.  
The sky plumed wounded soldiers are smeared.  
How waking is the humble lance and it's naked belts?  
  
The winged drops impaled has the area been carried with epiphany?  
Conversations of glass architectures, the recitation  
of momenta we call poetic sun.
