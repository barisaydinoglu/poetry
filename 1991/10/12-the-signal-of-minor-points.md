The Signal Of Minor Points
--------------------------
Carry me onto your boat - the tomato of my ripple - you, who is like a violence crab among the reconciling of many mother.  
The window responding from my lip.  
Some mix but I mix your sand like momentum.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
trust of peaces and goblets  
and the infinite prizes of his native land?
