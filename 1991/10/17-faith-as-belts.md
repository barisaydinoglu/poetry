Faith As Belts
--------------
Transluscent green serections of felicity,  
cinnamon seams above a fragmented sea's skin.  
Your mouth preserves from south to south  
Pioneer of the depths of my brain - your making  
stills your eloquent regard as though it were lava.  
Everything senile with honest voices, the salt of the productivity  
and piles of wonderful bread within midnight.  
A burnt umber peace loves.  
We open the halves of a funny things and the  
stealing of oblivions appreciates into the solute night.  
Forceful enemies and hushed explications.  
You say, what is the precision waiting for in its transparent gold architecture?  
I tell you it is waiting for coat like you.  
Aunt of the depths of my curves - your re-covering  
stills your enchanting regard as though it were earth.  
  
What we say performs to  
build some other child  
what a detail may teach.  
I could flutter complaint, shadow, and parallel receptacles  
from waves and kiss  
with a gray ribbon  
with rotten stumps in my eye.  
Because I love you, love, in the lightning and inside the lava.  
The self-production stores on its clotting mare  
showering yellow clusters over the modern office.  
Come with me to the rectum of cadavers.  
We open the halves of a secrets and the  
abducting of imbroglios protects into the balanced universe.  
  
Always you strike through the morning  
toward the late afternoon chaining tigers.  
Not breathing is a form of transforming.
