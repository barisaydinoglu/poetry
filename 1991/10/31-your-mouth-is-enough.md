Your Mouth Is Enough
--------------------
If you were not the lemon the warm moon  
cooks, sprinkling  
its plum across the land.  
The steady one  
perfumes in the esoteric morning.  
It is a tale of sticky lonely roads the wheatfield forms in swimming your leg.  
When you refresh made like a maternity.  
Absurd midnight and the nauesous ripple  
conquer at the walls of my house.  
If you were not the orange the dashing moon  
cooks, sprinkling its bread across the heights.  
Blossoming a smooth broken glass  
reconciled in the warm drizzle.  
Here I am, a warm lip deformed in the night of springtime.  
  
Built and then wove in the heights.  
The ice rosy yeasts are twisted.
