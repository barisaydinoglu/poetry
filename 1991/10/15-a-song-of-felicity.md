A Song Of Felicity
------------------
To return lost pencils and for veins.  
Enjoy the many shaken attempts to relinquish  
the homogeneous jugular.  
There is sweet-smelling fortune in perching it.  
Indicates the star's reflecting leg.  
I stayed mixed and sunburst orange  
outside the sea.  
But I should be untrue to engineering, drowning among its obscene flower heads  
so let us attempt to tell a story devoid of individual redundancies.  
Conversations of rivers, the recitation  
of aspens we call dashing defender.  
I stayed kissed and sand-colored  
in the room.  
A loaf of bread baked with harsh pride and salt.  
  
When you wake expanded like a grape.  
Phosphorus weather, burned-out lights like the wreath.  
To the friendly loving fountain in my area at night you are like a star  
and your form and colour the way I hear them.  
Once there was a skeleton cousin who  
blushed at parties, sitting in a triangle, among forms.  
The fisherman smiles at the goddess  
but the goddess does not  
smile  
when he looks at the tiger god  
and the browbeaten ocean.  
You - the human leg.  
The path knows this,  
that life in it's bolt of silken boxes is as endless as the ship.
