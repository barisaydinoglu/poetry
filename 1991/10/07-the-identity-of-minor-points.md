The Identity Of Minor Points
----------------------------
In the first scene, the soft astronaut  
is forced by a woman. In the second  
scene he returns, to conduct and to return.  
I am crushed by old warrior's medal and abberation, by dung and mist.  
Not entertaining is a form of attracting.  
Of a red pioneer that chirps prizes.  
A ship is not enough to silence me and keep me  
from the moonlight evening of your electric curiosities.  
Some weave but I carry your ash like diamond architecture.  
  
In the face of so many twisting lonely roads to functionality.  
Everything misunderstood with decisive voices, the salt of the sun  
and piles of original bread inside day.  
Enjoy the many calcerous attempts to store  
the cordial depth.  
There is solute fortune in crystallizing  
it.  
What is this computer but a memory cracked of its goblets?
