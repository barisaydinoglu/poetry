The Nauesous Woman
------------------
Sunburst  
orange seperations of lamprey,  
transparent seams above a oily bed.  
Here I am, a blazing breath dropped in the night of moon.  
  
Flutter on the trapdoors that wait for you  
loitering the senile chairs, devouring the doors.  
A stationary  
rug making a electric thing of a probable meeting with a sailor.  
A nose and an arm  
standing the thicket.  
Outside the bitterest thicket of mourning time.  
Some perfume but I divulge your broken glass like perfume.  
It's a fluttering root of utensils.  
Forest of a killed insatiable peace.  
  
Our new grace, our esoteric shoreline line segments.  
What brandishing wine bottles -  
the region is filled with it,  
schools for the wine bottle and the ironous wooden.
