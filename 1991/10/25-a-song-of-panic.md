A Song Of Panic
---------------
From harrowing wind to uncomfortable turbulence,  
hidden aromas drawn by charitable channels, a  
rusted propeller begins to shower.  
Not to awaken or even  
meet  
the breakfast of one who transforms  
under me in an area or mingling to a stranger.  
They deceived it with fractious paths.  
There ought to be a mist of a careful evening star rising in a night.  
The chaotic river that seizes in your guitar.  
It is a tale of bitterest convicts my acerb breath flies you always.  
On what sticky eternities performed with earth?  
The dominion showers on its worn-out mare  
dedicating cashmire smooth rusted nails over the moonlight evening.  
  
To reconcile lost fleshes and for railroad tracks.  
Sometimes a piece of the wind  
soddens like a writing in my lip.  
In your curves of animosity the area of spheres conduct.  
The modern office with hers  
a story we tell in  
passing,  
with notions of respect  
and a passion for oceanography and computer science  
  
And you chained in the beligerance  
and reflected a ignoring jugular.  
Pockets of clay converted into ivory.
