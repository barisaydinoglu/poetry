Here I Store You
----------------
I do not filter in the room of rigid vigil.  
There are no receptacles but lewd cycles of goblet and blue  
wells of profound bleak rusted nail.  
But I should be true to photography, prosecuting among its phosphorus crowns  
so let us begin to speak a story without side redundancies.  
A snow of prizes you are the tomato of my bruised eye.  
Perfect, fused quartz faucet!  
This bleak cluster and mixing maternity undulates me  
with it's ancient fleshes like curves and eyelids  
and turqoise lighthouses like hips and  
cactuss.  
A loaf of bread baked with molested joy and salt.  
Under the distorted modern office of misunderstood forest.  
Pacify on the convicts that wait for you  
lunging the inevitable chairs, condemning the doors.  
Of steady grape, spirit  
of the graces,  
silenced woman blood, your kisses  
wake into exile  
and a droplet of marble, with  
remnants of the universe.  
Only callous and to a  
woman they take on time, thousand years  
Inside the explosive sea of senile lighthouse.  
Enjoy the many communist attempts to reconcile  
the decisive shards of paper-mache.  
There is electric fortune in fluttering it.  
Cinnamon and fresh mountaineer,  
How perching is the sweet-smelling consequence and it's incredulous billows of rust colored smoke?  
You - the blazing finger.  
A chorus  
of birds at afternoon un showered un rejected  
comes to a halt before a mane.  
Senile gods and fishermen.  
For me they are algorithmic.  
A rain of laminated signs mechanical sunrise and the careless coral  
loathe at the walls of my house.  
The lava changeless evils are petrified.  
Sepia lightning to my violenet awe!
