Sight As Wounded Soldiers
-------------------------
From her toe and her tail stand  
writings of the earth. Draw from it the ghostly  
camera of its own inscription.  
A fog of hooves your drop is a map filled with chaotic ribbon.  
Connected and then reflected in the thicket.  
Like billowss of brimstone smoke loitering behind peaces.  
You say, what is the flesh waiting for in its sepia land?  
I tell you it is waiting for acrobat like you.  
Brutal day and the wet-winged school  
coagulate at the walls of my house.  
If I could chirp the wall and the heights.  
From palm tree leaf to uncomfortable turbulence,  
hidden aspens drawn by iridescent channels, a  
lethargic salt begins to divulge.
