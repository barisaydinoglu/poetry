Breeding Changeless Affection
-----------------------------
Everything phosphorus with stationary voices, the salt of the mirror  
And piles of aromatic bread within night.  
Within the abducting martyrs.  
A sun of awes I'm the daughter to the quilt of immediate vein.  
In the first take, the gleaming goddess  
is erupted by a pioneer. In the second  
scene he returns, to store and to create.  
A current of infinite momentum  
that does not know why it flows and dedicates.  
I was without doubt the lady squirrel  
there in the oily sea.  
When it looked me with its sensual river bank eyes  
it had neither shoulder nor hand  
but silk atoms on its sides.
