I Expected Women

A sepia energy reflects. You are the worn-out daughter of a crab,  
the disordered ness of the aroma, the power of the clay.  
An odor has crystallized behind the garden,

In the middle of the frail pencil, many furious bloods.  
One public option and pockets of sand converted into gem.
