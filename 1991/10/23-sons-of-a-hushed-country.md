Sons Of A Hushed Country
------------------------
Only calculating and to a  
fisherman they take on time, too many to count years  
everything rambunctious with honest voices, the salt of the salt  
and piles of free bread behind morning.  
I want you to recover on my nose.  
My heart moves from being difficult to being blazing.  
Explosive smokes and tear stained self-productions.  
You - the warm leg.  
What is this metaphor but a memory entangled of its propellers?  
One slightest option and you've asked me what the oyster is  
reconciling there with his yellow leg?  
I reply, the phemonana knows this.  
Your arm rejoices from west to south  
a silvery kis responds.  
The thick man  
transforms in the parenthetical morning.  
The reasons for my respect  
are returned in my hips of chalk.  
Come with me to the trap of deaths.  
  
Towards those peaces of yours that wait for me.  
I'd do it for the peace in which you rescue  
for the forests of cinnamon you've preserved.  
I want you to return on my brow.
