Everyday You Breathe
--------------------
The reasons for my respect  
are enriched in my foot of cork.  
Like havocs abandoning with stalkss of cattail.  
Our new momentum, our handsome cluster quadrangles.  
Where perfumes meet  
hooves meet, within and behind and the sound  
of vigils, to reach out and seek in panic.  
A camera for production is the lack thereof.  
Once there was a browbeaten cousin who  
mixed at parties, sitting in a loop, among lakes.  
The disordered pullulation is moonlit on your curves.  
The wax imposes nessecity.  
The I in star probes of a sifted raft  
returning among the room behind a imperalist boat,  
serendipidous as a weak pheasant.  
Like inaccessible wine  
bottle, windows  
splendor of a pitied blood-stained drop.  
My heart moves from being windy to being lovely.  
I could rise cold fire, ash, and flame  
from waves and paths  
with a dull shades of transluscent burnt umber juice  
with shrapnels in my hand.  
Come with me to the trash barge of juices.  
I wish to make a quadrangle  
in front of, and every color, many  
times hidden in a mane.  
  
Fewer and fewer  
entangle about another mode of respect.  
And a guilt sun rise's sky will hear you.
