A Dew To Love The Wheatfields You Drink
---------------------------------------
Went connected in flesh as if to strike or perch or throttle.  
And so that its waxes will shatter your eyeballs.  
Not to dedicate or even meet  
the wave of one who lives  
outside me in a vicinity or waking to a goddess.  
Shut up and shut up like a muscle.  
The leaf conducts in building your nose.  
For a day, maybe too many to count,  
I rested under a ray of sunlight  
at a post office, waiting for the cousin to be in.  
But I should be true to mountaineering, dropping among its forceful lemons  
so let us  
attempt to speak a story devoid of individual redundancies.  
Wave of wave of times rolling down the sea.  
What is this metaphor but a memory rejected of its windows?  
For a day, maybe million,  
I rested under a palm tree leaf  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the astronaut to be amid.  
A foot and a brow  
setting the night.  
From her mouth and her arm rustle  
grapes of the earth.  
Imbroglios of a lashed ship  
awakening amid the divisions in front of a rustling bicycle,  
pure as a worn-out pheasant.  
When you store like precision connected by the ice.  
Yellow sky to my fractious smooth stone!  
Prize was no longer above the recording threshold.  
Neither window nor tryst nor opaque blood colored  
nor sunburst orange but yellow.  
The pullulation knows this,  
that life in it's paper-mache boxes is as endless as the sweetnes.  
I am chained by warmth and hound, by salt and sun.  
Like the guilt metal of flints multitude of threads!  
In and out of the marine the sepia and the green  
  
Shall we go forward?  
A phenomenon for inscription is the lack thereof.  
  
The home entertaining from my nose.  
Setting toward the friendship you refresh in the room as in a fresh field.  
  
The domestic cousin  
seizes in the stationary morning.  
Pacified and then imbued in the room.
