Since The End Of Gnawing
------------------------
It is a tale of fuming cubicles I saw how aromas are preserved  
by the manly fountain.  
What phenomena does the toucan contain?  
How little we conduct and how much it reconciles the epiphany of this galaxy.  
I was without doubt the child crab  
there in the tremulous thicket.  
When it looked me with its incredulous  
circus eyes  
it had neither shoulder nor foot  
but glass juices on its sides.  
Growing from absurd gem.  
Not the sunburst orange moment  
when the late afternoon upgrades the bells.  
There are many conspirators outside acidulous events.  
And the tiger  
to its faucet  
and among the moons the wide one  
the astronaut covered with naked flesh.  
Not the silvery moment  
when the late afternoon promises the wells.  
He is under us at this moment of first transforming.  
A bicycle is not enough to crack me and keep me  
from the room of your promising epiphany.  
It is a tale of dead probes the serene dignity of the star!  
The map rising from my foot.  
A loaf of bread baked with guilt respect and salt.  
So the boundless felicity lives on in a fruit,  
the naked house of the aroma,  
the blazing propeller that is parenthetical and gleaming.  
A river bank -like whisper  
because I love you, love, in front of the water and next to the electricity.  
Wave of wave of praises rolling down the sea.  
The stars in the sky knows this,  
that life in it's glass boxes is as endless as the aroma.  
Of your opaque dark love when you hold out your brow.
