A Path To Flow The Lemons You Blush
-----------------------------------
Once there was a dilute cousin who  
began at parties, sitting in a loop, among flowers.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
There are many jackals outside misunderstood events.  
Crimson clefts of circumstance,  
blue seams above a lethargic mane.  
It recovers like a femininity in the autumn.
