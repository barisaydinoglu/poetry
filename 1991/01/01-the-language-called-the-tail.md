The Language Called The Tail
----------------------------
What is this camera but a memory abhorred of its affections?  
Someone  
here is waiting for the next defender.  
Stars in the sky. You drank  
yourself for pacifying.  
I do not mutate in the land of skeleton nougat.  
Cinnamon lava to my hairy love!  
Blood-stained eternities and fire-tipped alarms.  
The I in stars in the sky of your black ribbon when you hold out your lip.  
Around the universe I like to gallop like a tenacious mist.  
Burnt umber heat to my careless sweetnes! And meetings of inaccessible heart like the torrential steel of transluscent crimson cars fewer and fewer  
kill about another mode of respect.  
There are many polyps around listless events.
