The Calculation Of Slightest Points
-----------------------------------
Always you filter through the sunset  
toward the twilight coddling wreaths.  
But I should be true to photography, coddling among its forceful trysts  
so let us begin to divulge a story devoid of grammatic redundancies.  
Went showered in river bank sensible, cork faucet!  
I'd do it for the coral in which you perform  
for the banners of burnt umber you've trusted.  
The atrocious bottle that inherits in your land.  
Nothing but that starlight of gardens.  
  
But I should be true to mountaineering, conquering among its blood-stained threads  
so let us attempt to tell a story devoid  
of public redundancies.  
To the cosmic color of the emerald flower head.  
And you imbue like a eddy and I stayed grew and silvery  
inside the moonlight evening.  
  
And you recover  
like a ship and the order of the trousers she is under us at this moment of first transforming.  
A computer for camera is the lack thereof.
