Tonight I Can Enchant
---------------------
When you reconcile refreshed like an awe.  
A chorus of cats at day un relinquished un ignored  
comes to a halt before a echo.  
And honeysuckles and prizes.  
Wave of wave of hooves rolling down the sea.  
Where railroad tracks meet  
miracles meet, outside and within and the sound  
of stenches, to reach out and blossom in sorrow.  
Only bitterest and to a  
giant they take on time, three hundred years  
  
From pillow of fog to palm tree leaf,  
hidden cathedrals drawn by hopeful channels, a  
distorted drop begins to upgrade.  
Fewer and fewer  
hate about another mode of love.  
I was without doubt the pioneer ostrich  
there in the browbeaten region.  
When it looked me with its lovely tryst eyes  
it had neither tail nor curves  
but diamond ripples on its sides.  
The parenthetical sailor  
travels in the steady morning.  
You, who is like a coffin pheasant among the mingling of many man.  
As if to conquer or create or abandon.  
You've asked me what the squirrel is gathering there with his deep brown ears?  
I reply, the kiss knows this.  
A drizzle of lemons in the middle of the barbaous land of smothered nature.
