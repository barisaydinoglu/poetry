The Motionless Astronaut
------------------------
So the brandishing wonder lives on in a tomato,  
the aromatic house of the essence,  
the romantic flesh that is essential and lion hearted.  
When you rustle like angel fashioned by the water.  
Return to the homeland of the rivers.  
Draw from it the fire-tipped  
image of its own signal.  
  
From her breath and her eyelids set  
hats of the earth.  
Wave of wave of shorelines rolling down the sea.
