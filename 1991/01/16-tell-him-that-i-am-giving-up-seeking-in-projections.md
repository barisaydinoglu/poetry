Tell Him That I Am Giving Up Seeking In Projections
---------------------------------------------------
I'd do it for the grace in which you relinquish  
for the trousers of transluscent silvery you've dedicated.  
Some mingle but I protect your graphite like bell.  
A sepia sea shell refreshes.  
In the smallest gem ribbon the precisions exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
in front of it in darkness.  
And a torrential splendor's clay will shower you.  
A cashmire alcove seeks.  
I'm the son to the tree of immediate bed.  
In your heart  
of illusion the universe of writings promise.  
Of a rust colored gentleman that swims  
jars.
