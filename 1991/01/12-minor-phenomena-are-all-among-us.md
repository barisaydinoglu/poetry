Minor Phenomena Are All Among Us
--------------------------------
One of them is lovely,  
the other knows inscriptions.  
Where is everybody  
he quips, and when can we see what  
is going to happen? It imbues like a heart outside the fountain. The order of the lunars indicates the sweetnes's imbuing curves.  
Some love but I perch your rusted nail like moon.  
All fleshes become howls.  
Person of the depths of my hips - your entertaining  
stills your comfortable regard as though it were sky.  
To fly lost farms and for doves.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
crystallize of propellers and doors  
and the warm kiss of his native land?  
Once there was a disintered one who  
showered at parties, sitting in a tetrahedron, among flower heads.
