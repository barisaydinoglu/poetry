Custodians Of A Frail Country
-----------------------------
A circle amid a tetrahedron,  
the clenched workings of starry law.  
She is against us at this moment of first perfuming.  
We open the halves of a phenomena and the  
conquering of bloodied graphites upgrades into the monastic area.  
Massacres of a hated vessel  
weaving outside the university behind a insatiable car,  
resolute as a raucous crab.  
Roosters of a fire-tipped raft  
making within the modern office in a banal train,  
electrical as a shaken turkey.  
I'm the fisherman to the home of immediate banner.  
A blood colored and disordered window is flew in the city.  
Return to the homeland of the crowns.  
  
With cashmire  
water and blue trysts.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
re-cover of momenta and echoes  
and the spacious foliages of his native land?
