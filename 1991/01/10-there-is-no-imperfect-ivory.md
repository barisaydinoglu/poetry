There Is No Imperfect Ivory
---------------------------
Carry me onto your airplane -  
the banana of my elixir -  
towards those starss in the sky of yours that wait for me.  
In my divisions at day you are like a current  
and your form and colour the way I fashion them.  
Fear and momentum - cathedrals of embarassement.  
Multitude of smooth salts!  
In and out of the deep brown the cinnamon and the cinnamon  
to the iridescent great stone spoiled morning and the furious angel  
crush at the walls of my house.  
It transforms like a landscape with the droplet.  
It was a crooked business of error and corruptions.
