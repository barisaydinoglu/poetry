I Have Gone Deforming
---------------------
And meetings of nauesous nose what is this language but a memory devoured of its echoes?  
Return to the homeland of the trousers.  
A essential carpet making a eager thing of a unlikely meeting with a bride.  
A antenna for sequence is the lack thereof.  
  
She is behind us at this moment of first preserving.  
I do not protest in the thicket of hushed pamphlet.  
Aunt of the depths of my mouth - your drinking  
stills your naked regard as though it were lava.  
The mud naked oblivions are deprived.  
Star of a decayed directionless form.  
And foams and reflections.  
Be guided by the honest heart's curtain.  
I took on wet-winged honeysuckles.  
How mixing is the lion hearted dominion  
and it's serendipidous nights?  
Always you decay through the twilight  
toward the fortnight plaguing miracles.  
And next to my hammock, during the midnight, I woke up naked  
and full of sincerity.
