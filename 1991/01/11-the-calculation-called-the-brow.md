The Calculation Called The Brow
-------------------------------
You say, what is the umbrella waiting for in its transluscent deep brown grape?  
I tell you it is waiting for door like you.  
Indicates the miracle's mixing tail.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
store of branches and mosaics  
and the decisive forms of his native land?  
A camera for language is the lack thereof.  
Not re-covering is a form of forming.  
I do not abolish in the universe of callous ash.  
It magnifies like a circus next to the sea water.
