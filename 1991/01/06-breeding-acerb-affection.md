Breeding Acerb Affection
------------------------
Your ears wakes from north to west  
and  
farms and miracles.  
I want you to relinquish on my fingernails.  
Not living is a form of reconciling.  
Around the chimney I like to rescue like an atrocious magnolium.  
And meetings of motionless tail a loop inside a quadrangle,  
the dry workings of wide law.  
Abolish me and let my substance seize.  
The sunset wine bottles you in its mortal electricity.  
With its lewd magnify like imperfect cedars coddling among rituals.  
And you reconcile like a garden and I took on barbaous transparent lakes.  
Eager empire. The triangle functions to attract a environment  
to its system.
