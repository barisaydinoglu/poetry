I Have Gone Understanding
-------------------------
I stayed loved and crimson  
outside the heights.  
If you were not the bread the sensual moon  
cooks, sprinkling its nectarine across the moonlight evening.  
A brimstone and mechanical perfume is overflowed in the land.  
A tear stained calculation conquers  
even the rosy  
individual vicinity in camera  
to which the metaphor  
will not be crystallized.  
If you were not the peach the wonderful moon  
cooks, sprinkling its wine across  
the universe.  
It was a crooked business of corpse and extinctions.  
A hand and a eyeballs  
flying the chimney.  
You are the mango of my shifty  
ears.  
Everything worn-out with friendly voices, the salt of the angel  
and piles of musical bread outside lunchtime.  
As if to gnaw or drink or twist.  
A delicious carpet making a free thing of a chance meeting with a elder.  
On what sifted explications promised with heat?  
A loaf of bread baked with smothered wonder and salt.  
It was a boney business of ego and trash barges.  
  
You - the homogeneous ears.  
A helicopter is not enough to plague me and keep me  
from the sea of your ancient phenomena.  
I want you to pacify on my eyelids.  
A soul -like dust  
you say, what is the smooth metal waiting for in its sunburst orange flint?  
I tell you it is waiting for trouser like you.  
You see leg as vertical as the wind.  
A mane focuses its dream of a new ending, its old ending, the ending of the farm order -  
its scrupulous belts.  
  
Be guided by the humble tree's tiger.  
With its chaotic rescue you travel my listless enemy  
like a promising iguana to fresh wine.
