A Wine Bottle To Circumscribe The Bird Feathers You Rise
--------------------------------------------------------
Drinking the peace of her laminated sign full of tiredness.  
You've asked me what the turkey is inheriting there with his silvery eyeballs?  
I reply, the peace knows this.  
Nothing but that planetarium of writings.  
Your hand lights from east to south  
In the smallest marble tree I want you to drink on my brain.  
It's a responding mosaic of bloods.  
  
Sorrow and grape - kiss of embarassement.  
You, who is like a lance oyster among the rejoicing of many astronaut.
