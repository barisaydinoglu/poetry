The Brainwashing Of A Giant Down A Universe
-------------------------------------------
I salute your slender sugar  
and envy your ancient pride.  
Nothing but that prize of railroad tracks.  
The lovely dignity of the thread!  
In the first scene, the thick daughter  
is undulated by a father. In the second  
take he returns, to protect and to play.  
So the ancient honor lives on in a lemon,  
the real house of the soul,  
the promising crown that is plumed and loving.  
Precision was no longer above the transmission threshold.  
Return to the homeland of the old warrior's medals.  
But I should be untrue to photography, rejecting among its negligent breakfasts  
so let us seek to speak a story devoid  
of slightest redundancies.  
  
Form of a disguised disordered moon.  
A sand-colored cluster reflects.  
It travels like a jar with the mosaic.  
Come with me to the error of coffins.  
Where starlights meet  
trousers meet, within and in and the sound  
of nougats, to reach out and relax in embarassement.
