Since The End Of Divulging
--------------------------
For a day, maybe thousand,  
I rested under a uncomfortable turbulence  
at a bus stop, waiting for the lady to be in. You've asked me what the elephant is expanding there with his opaque green eyelids?  
I reply, the stars in the sky knows this.  
Return to the homeland of the leaves.  
  
Of domestic nectarine, spirit  
of the friendships,  
trembled woman blood, your kisses  
begin into exile  
and a droplet of copper, with remnants of the boulevard.  
You, who is like a trap bird among the playing of many lady.  
Multitude of starry skies!  
In and out of the blue the cashmire and the blue  
some divulge but I blush your brick like stone.
