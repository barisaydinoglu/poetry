Camera Without The Lineage
--------------------------
I could enchant vinegar, ghost, and womb  
from bird feathers and circuss  
with a rust colored friendship  
with deaths in my hand.  
Receptacles of a bitter airplane  
attracting among the university next to a distorted wheel,  
round as a bitter bird.  
A signal dedicates,  
loathes - it does not return.  
Our new starry sky, our hopeful cathedral loops.  
There ought to be a love of a indespensable lemon playing in a night.  
An odor has mixed among the momentum,  
a mixture of panic and body, a lighting  
necklace that brings sorrow.  
The order of the waves you are the explosive fisherman of a jaguar,  
the muzzled ness of the lemon, the power of the mud.  
Like crooked springtime, prizes  
we get the feeling  
they must lots to swim  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but uranus.  
Perhaps they are not electrified.  
One of them is noble,  
the other knows details.  
Where is somebody  
she cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Closed off and shut up like a lemon.  
In the face of so many acids to animosity.  
Be guided by the angellic evening star's foam.  
What incredulous coats -  
the sea is filled with it,  
laminated signs for the kis and the absurd silk.
