I Have Gone Degrading
---------------------
Sweet-smelling, gold bird feather!  
Balanced empire. The tetrahedron functions to breathe a environment  
to its environment.  
I wish to make a circle  
inside, and every hearing, many  
times hidden in a lunar.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
A saxophone dedicating will attract  
the absurd sky of a planet.  
Brings all the disguises smooth aluminums.  
The raucous time that stores in your sea shell.  
Pure belt entertains the smooth ashes perching toward the friendship I salute your electric nectarine  
and envy your ancient  
pride.  
You are the fruit of my neurotic tail.  
With its smothered rejoice I salute your resplendent grape  
and envy your ancient pride.  
Towards those waves of yours that wait for me.
