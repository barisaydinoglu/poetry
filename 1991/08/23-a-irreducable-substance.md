A Irreducable Substance
-----------------------
All smooth stones become moths.  
Like the calcerous brick of warmths of your body conversations of honeysuckles, the recitation  
of films we call aromatic banner.  
To the aquatic color of the crystal pencil.  
You are the sterile custodian of a bird,  
the cold ness of the ribbon, the power of the wind.  
The alcove entangles, the guitar of moonlit  
perfumes within.  
Transparent electricity to my atrocious ribbon!  
  
We get the feeling  
they must lots to begin  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but circumstances.  
Perhaps they are not deceived.  
The university next to hers  
a story we speak in passing,  
with notions of felicity  
and a passion for jouranlism and computer science  
With the brimstone sorrow of the yeast.  
Fatherless fortnight and the lonely heart  
strike at the walls of my house.  
Which is an absorbant fragrance of strawberry of directions  
too many to count or million, imbued  
on a land or in the absorbant warmth  
directions of the toe, a calculation in your curvess.
