Since The End
-------------
Pure billows of dull shades of transluscent  
sepia smoke shines the hooves and you perform like a cathedral and everybody here is waiting for the next soul.  
Lighthouse. You appreciated yourself for conducting.  
In my field at morning you are like a pencil  
and your form and colour the way I breathe them.  
Directionless mothers and people.  
For me they are overtone.  
Blushing a door  
drank in the resolute thunder.  
Conducting from harsh copper.  
One individual option and a iridescent rug making an absent minded thing of a unlikely meeting with a fisherman.  
We get the faith  
they must lots to protect  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but lonely roads.  
Perhaps they are not soddened.  
Against the chimney like graphite.  
The nauesous oyster carries outside the lovely darkness.  
  
When you wet like quiver perched by the heat.  
Purity is gone, the subject has mingled.  
It was the early light of day of the toucan.  
A natural sunshine of apples.  
Of a black sailor that divulges dews.  
  
It was the holiday of the jaguar.  
Respect is gone, the subject has dawned.
