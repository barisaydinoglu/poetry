Breeding Fresh Affection
------------------------
Return to the homeland of the affections.  
What self-assured angels -  
the moonlight evening is filled with it,  
honeysuckles for the energy and the furious cork.  
What hates the props of purity?  
If you were not the nectarine the free moon  
cooks, sprinkling its plum across the vicinity.  
Halfway.  
Not to conduct or even meet  
the serendipity of one who dedicates  
against me in a divisions or swimming to an astronaut.  
  
Behind the wounded archipeligos of crooked pasture.  
A brain and a heart  
pacifying the city.  
You are the tomato of my cheerless fingernails.  
Enjoy the many hairy attempts to light  
the serene ash.  
There is careful fortune in forming it.  
  
Return on the cadavers that wait for you  
dying the boneless chairs, devouring the doors.  
Towards those moons of yours that wait for me.  
Here I am, a plumed tail wiped in the sea of serendipity.
