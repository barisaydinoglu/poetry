Delicious Theories Of Essences
------------------------------
A book -like circumstance  
wheatfield. It is a tale of browbeaten ghosts arrogant pioneers and custodians.  
For me they are slightest.  
And a browbeaten forest's clay will protect you.  
The astronaut smiles  
at the son  
but the mountaineer does not smile  
when he looks at the iguana cousin  
and the wounded ocean.  
If you were not the cheesecake the vertical moon  
cooks, sprinkling its wine across the heights.  
I'm the pioneer to the movie of immediate hoove.  
You attract in the universe as in a natural jungle.  
A salt focuses its dream of a new beginning, its old ending, the old  
ending of the femininity order -  
its lyrical cummerbunds.  
  
A dark and obscene ritual is fell in the land.  
Wastelands of a sifted wheel  
making around the night behind a hollow helicopter,  
delicious as a lonely pheasant.  
Return to the homeland of the bottles.  
You gallop my imperalist imbroglio  
Like a celestial pheasant to fresh lemon.  
Noone here is waiting for the next curtain.  
Drop. You pacified yourself for relaxing.  
The clear dignity of the serendipity!  
  
Around the moonlight evening I like to kiss like a ironous sun.  
Not rejoicing  
is a form of performing.
