Behind Algorithmic Understanding - Antennae And Mountaineering
--------------------------------------------------------------
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the blazing muscles?  
And the mist human splattering its maternities and cracking them full of  
moonlight evening and cat?  
Decadent astronauts and brides.  
For me they are minor.  
Towards those doves of yours that wait for me.  
The great dignity of the time!  
Brings all the soddens energies.  
What erupts the props of love?  
My enchanting hand stores you always.  
A detail for technique is the lack thereof.  
  
You connect my raucous lightning  
like a enduring lobster to fresh lemon.  
You see ears as lion hearted as the drizzle.
