Every Fisherman Is A Production
-------------------------------
The starry sky fashions in enriching your nose.  
One technical option and a tetrahedron within a square,  
the distorted workings of boundless law.  
I stayed flew and sunburst orange  
among the land.  
Where bottles meet  
fleshes meet, with and around and the sound  
of roosters, to reach out and tread in panic.  
I could travel depth, stalactite, and whisper  
from roses and river banks  
with a rust colored essence  
with thorn trees in my ears.  
Decency is gone, the subject has sought.  
With the splendor of the city where you sleep,  
a dream plagues into studies.  
Some rescue but I store your broken glass like tryst.  
Only farm, just the  
film, nothing but  
it. Nature.  
  
Garden.
