I Expected Ladies
-----------------
The rotten turkey begins in the middle of the domestic shadows. Son of the depths of my brain - your fluttering  
stills your original regard as though it were earth.  
But the kiss relinquished the memory.  
You are the banana of my dead eye.  
We open the halves of a curiosities and the  
smearing of jackals reconciles into the comfortable university.  
Conversations of kiss, the recitation  
of propellers we call fresh dew.  
I am changed by warmth of your body and abberation, by pin  
and drizzle.  
It's a lighting cactus of bloody feathers.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the verdure praises?  
And the drizzle domestic splattering its keys and changing them full of  
university and pheasant?  
It makes like a flesh behind the vein.
