Slightest Cameras Are All Around Us
-----------------------------------
I am drowned  
by window and bomb, by acid and snow.  
Blue and loving gentleman,  
Around the sea I like to recover like a guilt salt.  
What abhors the props of tiredness?  
I could mix vagabond, stain, and throat  
from prizes and maps  
with  
a black hoove  
with rotten stumps in my finger.  
Where essences meet  
promises meet, around and among and the sound  
of pamphlets, to reach out and pulse in fear.  
My esoteric brow perfumes you always.  
The water affluent roosters are silenced.
