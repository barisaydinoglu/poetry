Meaning Is An Episode Of Nougat
-------------------------------
Among cashmire water and yellow magnoliums.  
A clotting language replaces  
even the arcane  
public room in technique  
to which the metaphor  
will not be  
appreciated.  
If you were not the plum the celestial moon  
cooks, sprinkling its grape across the region.  
Your sea shell is a laminated sign filled with arrogant current.  
The root lighting from my eyelids.  
The sphere gallops in perfuming your arm.  
  
What loathes the props of felicity?  
To the indespensable color of the bolt of glass yellow lake.  
Shut up and pulled out like a flower.  
Fewer and fewer  
undulate about another mode of happiness.  
For a day, maybe too many to count,  
I rested under a harrowing wind  
at a bus stop, waiting for the bride to be among.  
The movie plan that has everyone furious.  
Around deep brown water and cinnamon flutes.
