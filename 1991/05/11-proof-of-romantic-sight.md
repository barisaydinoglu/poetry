Proof Of Romantic Sight
-----------------------
Our new echo, our decisive forest line segments.  
A silence -like vagina  
realized delicious apple as soon as the incoming times  
gives the neutral indication.  
A dark and hushed dew is entangled in the thicket.  
Pockets of clay converted into ivory.  
  
Neither drop nor energy nor turqoise  
nor blue but sepia.  
Realized serene reflection shut up and pulled out like a cactus.  
A awe awakening will stand  
the rotten sky of a planet.  
Brings all the disguises lights.  
You've asked me what the turkey is understanding there with his marine hand?  
I reply, the rose knows this.  
Next to the changing howls.  
A chorus of tigers at midnight un wetted un dismantled  
comes to a halt before a wave.
