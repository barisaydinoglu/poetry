Since The Beginning
-------------------
The I in tree the free dignity of the love!  
A ship is not enough to faint me and keep me  
from the vicinity of your vertical phenomena.  
I'd do it for the candle in which you weave  
for the snows of cinnamon you've began.  
  
Brings all the hates snows.  
Hearing from barbaous silken.  
To connect lost defenders and for atoms.  
  
Only pale and to a  
uncle they take on time, million years  
but I should be true to mountaineering, protesting among its hollow ribbons  
so let us seek to tell a story devoid of historical redundancies.  
Indicates the perfume's returning heart. Discovered and then created in the heights.  
A transparent productivity imbues.  
If you were not the sugar the humble moon  
cooks, sprinkling its cheesecake across the thicket.  
The order of the alcoves of serendipidous grape, spirit  
of the railroad tracks,  
devoured fisherman blood, your kisses  
reconcile into exile  
and a droplet of gold, with remnants of the city.  
Nothing but your steady breath.  
To respond lost mirrors and for telegraphs.  
Towards those springtimes of yours that wait for me.  
The fresh dignity of the droplet!  
  
There are many gates among skeleton events.  
Foliage was no longer right at the transmission threshold.
