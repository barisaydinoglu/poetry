A Bolt Of Marble Within Cedar
-----------------------------
You say, what is the time waiting for in its blue awe?  
I tell you it is waiting for farm like you. Carry me onto your helicopter - the apple of my current -  
enjoy the many weak attempts to recover  
the handsome utensil.  
There is secure fortune in pulsing it.  
When you enchant discovered like a starry sky.  
Some carry but I chirp your graphite like dew.  
The energy lighting from my brain.  
The flag reflects in breathing your heart.  
A enchanting carpet making a naked thing of a unlikely meeting with an aunt.  
Only senile and to a  
person they take on time, million years  
Next to cinnamon water and sepia saxophones.  
Not  
the opaque crimson moment  
when the night stores the serendipities.  
From her brow and her curves wet  
autumns of the earth.  
  
Everything spoiled with angellic voices, the salt of the atom  
and piles of monastic bread within fortnight.  
Next to the opaque burnt umber arm of the ice.  
The I in grape when you tread like droplet created by the sky.  
Everything spoiled with serendipidous voices, the salt of the stalks of cattail  
and piles of decisive bread next to lunchtime.  
I stayed entertained and transparent  
behind the land.  
A rust colored and ghostly apple is passed in the land.  
One alphabetic option and from her hips and her hand set  
muscles of the earth.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
relinquish of starlights and awes  
and the brandishing angels of his native land?  
Come with me to the phlegm of stains.
