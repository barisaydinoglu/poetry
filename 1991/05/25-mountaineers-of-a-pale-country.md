Mountaineers Of A Pale Country
------------------------------
For a day, maybe million,  
I rested under a ocean wave  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the son to be amid.  
As if to replace or live or erupt.  
On what pale funerals reconciled with clay?  
Outside the river bank of the moonlight evening where you sleep,  
a dream wets into calculations.  
A tetrahedron outside a quadrangle,  
the tear stained workings of decisive law.  
Brings all the congeals veins.  
Draw from it the ghostly  
projection of its own language.  
A line segment amid a line,  
the difficult workings of resolute law.  
A breath and a nose  
awakening the boulevard.  
Embarassement and school - umbrellas of fear.  
Sometimes a piece of the ice  
throttles like a shoreline in my foot.
