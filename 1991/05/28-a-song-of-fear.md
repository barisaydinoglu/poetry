A Song Of Fear
--------------
An odor has gathered in the middle of the book,  
a mixture of cold fire and body, a continuing  
jar that brings anger. The chimney  
around hers  
a history we divulge in passing,  
with  
notions of love  
and a passion for engineering and mountaineering  
it's a shining starry sky of puberties.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the eager old warrior's medals?  
And the mist fluidic splattering its sea's skins and plaguing them full of  
night and jaguar?  
A thick thunder of horses.  
  
In my heights at fortnight you are like a rose  
and your form and colour the way I seize them.  
On what lonely puberties excited with water?  
Soul.  
Not to transform or even meet  
the current of one who reflects  
under me in a modern office or standing to a goddess.
