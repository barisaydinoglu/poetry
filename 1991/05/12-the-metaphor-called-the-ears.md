The Metaphor Called The Ears
----------------------------
The elixir abolishes, the wine bottle of trusting  
creates inside.  
The noise imposes nessecity.  
In the smallest diamond wave and meetings of violenet leg decency is gone, the subject has pacified.  
I'd do it for the heart in which you promise  
for the femininities of green you've upgraded.  
It gathers like a bed outside the lighthouse.  
Mountaineer of the depths of my nose - your entertaining  
stills your slender regard as though it were jungle.  
  
A image seeks,  
sobs - it does not return.
