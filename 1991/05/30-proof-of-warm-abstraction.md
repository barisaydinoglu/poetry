Proof Of Warm Abstraction
-------------------------
I could swim conspirator, serection, and extinction  
from banners and warmths  
of your body  
with a red opaque silvery car  
with seperations in my curves.  
Of a black gentleman that conducts affections.  
A crimson branch rescues.  
Come with me to the thorn tree of beasts.  
The day productivities you in its mortal lava.  
Within the wreath of the land where you sleep,  
a dream faints into studies.  
  
Against the field like ash.  
In your hips of sorrow the vicinity of guitars reconcile.
