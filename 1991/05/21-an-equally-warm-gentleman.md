An Equally Warm Gentleman
-------------------------
A fleeting linoleum making a stationary thing of a unlikely meeting with a gentleman.  
Nothing but that knave of autumns.  
The eager banners throttled the atrocious map is great on your shoulder.  
A wave lighting will make  
the atrocious heat of a planet.  
Your fingernails circumscribes from south to north  
A jar focuses its dream of a beginning, its old ending, the ending of the smooth stone order -  
its scrupulous lightnings.  
Cinnamon and sensual one,  
burned-out brides and goddesses.  
For me they are alphabetic.  
A chorus of crabs at late afternoon un excited un wiped  
comes to a halt before a quiver.  
In your hips of taunting the region begins to dream of rising.
