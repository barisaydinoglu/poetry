Since The Beginning
-------------------
The flower head forces, the thread of esoteric  
pacifies in.  
Deceive me and let my substance magnify.  
Your lip perfumes from east to west  
Wave of wave of hats rolling down the sea.  
Yellow wind to my inaccessible guitar!  
The jungle cosmic shrapnels are devoured.  
A mist of sea's skins a circle with a line segment,  
the morose workings  
of verdure law.  
I am flew by film and night, by trash and clouds.  
A metaphor for camera is the lack thereof.  
A harsh phenomenon wets  
even the sensible  
minor thicket in camera  
to which the metaphor  
will not be relinquished.
