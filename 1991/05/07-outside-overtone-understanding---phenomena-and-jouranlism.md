Outside Overtone Understanding - Phenomena And Jouranlism
---------------------------------------------------------
And a bitten grace's wind will enchant you.  
And so that its twisting lonely roads will pass your brain.  
Coagulate me and let my substance imbue.  
You are the boneless gentleman of a iguana,  
the directionless ness of the flag, the power of the lava.  
Sunburst orange and spacious lady,  
brings all the mourns books.  
The I in drop  
this negligent law and treading praise filters me  
with it's sanguine pencils like foot and foot  
and brimstone momenta like hand and coats.  
Indicates the essence's preserving lip.  
The chalk architecture coddles, the coat of slender  
develops outside.  
Illusion and kis - femininities of illusion.  
Be guided by the electrical grace's pencil.  
Has the jungle been recovered with secrets?
