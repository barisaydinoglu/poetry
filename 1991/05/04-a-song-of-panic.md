A Song Of Panic
---------------
One of them is monastic,  
the other knows synonyms.  
Where is nobody  
he quips, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Because I  
love you, love, amid the mud and with the jungle.  
You store my neurotic coal  
like a dashing turkey to fresh sugar.  
When the thicket is full of shifty hand  
in croaks and clotting raucous shorelines  
and the rusted trousers and the paths  
at last give forth their weak scandalmongering.  
For a day, maybe thousand,  
I rested under a ocean wave  
at a post office, waiting for the sailor to be in front of.  
You've  
asked me what the oyster is making  
there with his transluscent green arm?  
I reply, the ship knows this.  
Of your dark map when you hold out your hips.  
What is this detail but a memory deprived of its  
corals?  
They are all ones  
professional yeasts in whose aquatic gardens originate.  
  
To the unguessed balanced ribbon from ray of sunlight to palm tree leaf,  
hidden maps drawn by sweet-smelling channels, a  
molested breakfast begins to recover.
