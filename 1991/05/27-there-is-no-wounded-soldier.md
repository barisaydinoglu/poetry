There Is No Wounded Soldier
---------------------------
And so that its  
uranus will imprison your toe.  
Because I love you, love, amid the jungle and inside the fire.  
You've asked me what the pheasant  
is gathering there with his transparent eye?  
I reply, the evening star knows this.  
What secrets does the jaguar  
contain?  
How little we play and how much it loves the mysteries of this galaxy.  
Happiness is gone, the subject has connected.  
Shut out and shut up like a ripple.  
My heart moves from being torrential to being fleeting.
