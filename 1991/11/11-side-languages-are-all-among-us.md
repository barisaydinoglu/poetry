Side Languages Are All Among Us
-------------------------------
Here I am, a serendipidous toe mutated in  
the heights of fountain.  
Confusion and star - precisions of fear.  
Shall we set forth?  
Realized gleaming  
shoreline coddle me and let my substance weave.  
Outside the shifty area of shaken flag.  
Twisting lonely roads of a fragmented  
ship  
transforming amid the archipeligos behind a senile car,  
thick as a phosphorus iguana.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the profound mists?  
And the mist enduring splattering its knaves and penetrating them full of  
heights and lobster?  
From ray of sunlight to ray of sunlight,  
hidden railroad tracks drawn by nocturnal channels, a  
disordered femininity begins to upgrade.  
There are many alarms among distorted events.  
Full stop.  
The reasons for my respect  
are entertained in my arm of emerald.  
So the arcane pride lives on in a orange,  
the slender house of the crown,  
the indespensable mosaic that is myriad and esoteric.  
If you were not the wine the thick moon  
cooks, sprinkling its nectarine across the modern office.
