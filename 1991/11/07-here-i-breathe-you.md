Here I Breathe You
------------------
Custodian of the depths  
of my mouth - your kissing  
stills your sanguine regard as though it were electricity.  
I'd do it for the old warrior's medal in which you crystallize  
for the precisions of opaque burnt umber you've upgraded.  
Pockets of salt converted into cork.  
Wave of wave of reflections rolling down the sea.  
A sea shell dedicating will connect  
the neurotic water of a planet.  
The delicious dignity of the star!  
Because I love you, love, inside the lava and within the water.  
A star -like stalactite  
in my universe at midnight you are like a map  
and your form and colour  
the way I rejoice them.  
You see eye as natural as the snow.  
You, who is like a shortcut lobster among the performing of many person.  
The romantic essence gave it felicity.  
Shall we go forward?  
The absorbant man  
flies in the aquatic morning.
