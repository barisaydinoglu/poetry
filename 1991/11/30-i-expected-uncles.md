I Expected Uncles
-----------------
A umbrella -like hound  
but I should be true to jouranlism, soddening among its negligent saxophones  
so let us seek to divulge a story devoid of slightest redundancies.  
To reconcile lost bird feathers and for graces.  
Not to excite or even meet  
the river bank of one who wets  
under me in a vicinity or swimming to a god.  
I'm the god to the salt of immediate grape.  
Like the forceful iron of hats to the wonderful color of the copper railroad track.  
She is under us at this moment of first transforming.  
I saw how hooves are trusted  
by the scrupulous alcove.  
Somebody here is waiting for the next banner.  
Honeysuckle. You continued yourself for fashioning.  
  
Inside the turqoise animosity of the mask.  
Like the arrogant iron of trysts you say, what is the foliage waiting for in its sunburst orange old warrior's medal?  
I tell you it is waiting for muscle like you.
