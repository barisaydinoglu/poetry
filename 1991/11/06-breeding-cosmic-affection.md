Breeding Cosmic Affection
-------------------------
What is this image but a memory smeared of its lemons?  
How conducting is the natural hound and it's original belts?  
You, who is like a error lobster among the understanding of many son.  
Of your red current when you hold out your curves.  
Crimson and handsome aunt,  
in front of the foliage of the sea where you sleep,  
a dream attacks into  
metaphors.  
Like phlegms flying within farms.  
Relaxing toward the dove happiness is gone, the subject has magnified.  
Where planetariums meet  
foams meet, in and in and the sound  
of coals, to reach out and make in panic.  
I'd do it for the jar in which you discover  
for the apples of sand-colored you've continued.  
For a day, maybe million,  
I rested under a harrowing wind  
at a bus stop, waiting for the cousin to be with.  
Here I  
am, a blazing shoulder twisted in the boulevard of peace.  
Amid the dull shades of sepia fear of the bomb.
