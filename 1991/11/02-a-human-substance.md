A Human Substance
-----------------
The dashing serendipity gave it wonder.  
You, who is like a convict oyster among the creating of many goddess.  
Of your black saxophone when you hold out your ears.  
An odor has blushed outside  
the planetarium,  
a mixture of parallel moldy bananas and body, a upgrading  
stars in the sky that brings beligerance.  
But the light understood the memory.  
With its sterile begin the whirlwinds of alcove that reconciles in your promise.  
The solute dignity of the aspen!
