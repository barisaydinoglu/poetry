The Technique Called The Eyeballs
---------------------------------
There are no lightnings but lethargic cycles of mist and yellow  
defenders of deedy guilt salt. The callous tiger performs among the self-assured jugulars.  
And you penetrated in the animosity and wove a dropping bramble.  
She is among us at this moment of first making.  
Behind the city like iron.  
For a day, maybe too many to count,  
I rested under a tornado  
at a bus stop, waiting for the god to be in.  
From her eyeballs and her brain dedicate  
hearts of the earth.  
A ship is not enough to compound me and keep me  
from the jungle of your absent minded funny things.  
If you were not the nectarine the self-assured moon  
cooks, sprinkling its bread across the university.
