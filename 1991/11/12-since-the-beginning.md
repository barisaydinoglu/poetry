Since The Beginning
-------------------
I took on rustling trousers. The I in map the wind nocturnal  
vigils are attacked. In my chimney at early light of day you are like a writing  
and your form and colour the way I make them.  
Snow.  
Shady violences and molested wombs.  
Sometimes a piece  
of the mud  
bristles like a home in my hand.  
How living is the incredulous trap and it's unguessed belts?  
You - the noble heart.  
Travelling a coral  
reconciled in the hidden rain.
