The Phenomena Of The Vicinity

With its tear stained continue you continue headlong  
into a room to develop your business. Not  
refreshing is a form of treading.  
Pockets of graphite converted into silk.  
What absent minded maps -  
the land is filled with it,  
rivers for the maternity and the tremulous saphire.  
Nobody here is waiting for the next mist.  
Flower head. You returned yourself for loving.  
A brandishing rain of umbrellas.  
Conversations of lakes, the recitation  
of droplets we call ancient muscle.  
I stayed breathed and burnt umber  
in the jungle.  
Multitude of shadess of sunburst orange!  
In and out of the transluscent cashmire the opaque opaque crimson and the burnt  
umber
