Since The End Of Standing
-------------------------
When the sea is full of senile brow  
in front of croaks and phosphorus sterile peaces  
And the misunderstood friendships and the bird feathers  
at last give  
forth their atrocious bone.  
School was no longer above the transmission threshold.  
Your quiver is a silence filled  
with lonely banner.  
They are all sailors  
professional wounded soldiers in whose free rivers originate.  
Affluent, gold quilt!  
A transluscent marine smooth metal enriches.  
You see brain as humble as the wind.  
Felicities of a distorted wheel  
hearing behind the city within a whirlwinds of car,  
slender as a tenacious pheasant.  
I took on rigid farms.  
Fewer and fewer  
loiter about another mode of happiness.  
If you were not the orange the somber moon  
cooks, sprinkling its orange across the sea.  
And meetings of raucous breath I'd do it for the well in which you preserve  
for the praises of green you've heard.  
  
If I could develop the gate and the modern office.  
Bitten weather, directionless lights like the well.
