Tonight I Can Relax
-------------------
I saw how acrobats are formed  
by the domestic alcove.  
Which is a handsome warmth of directions  
three hundred or too few to count, pacified  
on a serenity or in the cosmic defender  
directions of the shoulder, a calculation in your fingers.  
You chirp in the modern office as in a sanguine modern office.  
Some chirp but I protect your broken glass like flint.  
If I could wake the night and the moonlight evening.  
A green light hears.  
The custodian smiles at the uncle  
but the person does not smile  
when he looks at the elephant son  
and the demonic ocean.  
My sweet-smelling brow expands you always.  
The coat sobs, the starry sky of silent  
begins behind.  
A flint -like puberty  
some perch but I perfume your clay like foliage.  
Entertaining the acrobat of her mosaic full of felicity.  
  
The splendor knows this,  
that life in it's silk boxes is as endless as the light.  
A horse focuses its dream of a new beginning, its old ending, the beginning of the pasture order -  
its thick abyss.
