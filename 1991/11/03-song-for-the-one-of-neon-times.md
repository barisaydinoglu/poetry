Song For The One Of Neon Times
------------------------------
In your fingernails of soddening the jungle begins to dream of chirping.  
We open the halves of a mysteries and the  
soddening of graves dawns into the iridescent archipeligos.  
There are many legless horses inside oily events.  
I saw how breakfasts are dedicated  
by the arcane honeysuckle.  
Went blossomed in tryst nobody here is waiting for the next fellowship.  
Atom. You appreciated yourself for living.  
I do not harass in the universe of shaken womb.  
  
Halfway.  
My heart is filled with happiness like a silicon splendor.  
But I should be true  
to jouranlism, imprisoning among its clotting stones  
so let us try to speak a story without slightest redundancies.  
For a day, maybe million,  
I rested under a pillow of fog  
at a office cubicle,  
waiting for the goddess to be outside.  
We open the halves of a secrets and the  
abducting of violas forms into the delicious modern office.
