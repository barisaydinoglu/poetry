Meeting Your Bloodied Salt
--------------------------
Aromatic empire. The triangle functions to perform a system  
to its environment. Where acrobats meet  
flower heads meet, among and among and the sound  
of lampreys, to reach out and divulge in illusion.  
Within  
the cashmire eyelids of the water.  
  
The legume imposes nessecity.  
A opaque red and bruised vein is froze in the room.  
Where eddies meet  
poppies meet, behind and outside and the sound  
of pins, to reach out and relinquish in anger.  
In your nose of beligerance the sea of alcoves  
pulse.  
Full empire. The quadrangle functions to divulge an architecture  
to its environment.  
Come with me to the corruption of hounds.  
Here I am, a natural hand dropped in the field of alcove.
