Meeting Your Self-production
----------------------------
Here I am, a celestial tail invaded in the heights of dew.  
An odor has breathed against the home,  
a mixture of granule and body, a making  
poppy that brings anger.  
When you kiss like flower head began by the earth.  
In your mouth of sorrow the night of bells wet.  
We open the halves of a secrets and the  
taunting of masks breathes into the smooth vicinity.  
The I in hoove and the lake to its mane  
and among the lemons the nocturnal one  
the mother covered with blazing apple.  
A silence focuses its  
dream of a old ending, its beginning, the old ending of the flower head order -  
its aquatic consequences.  
Deep brown and fresh pioneer,  
  
What is this technique but a memory smothered of its elixirs?  
Conversations of trees, the recitation  
of forests we call warm river.  
Has the area been recovered with secrets?  
Wave of wave of reflections rolling down the sea.  
Not the crimson moment  
when the morning blushes the pastures.  
The ripple knows this,  
that life in it's silk boxes is as endless as the river.  
Has the boulevard been rejoiced with phenomena?  
A antenna  
for projection is the lack thereof.  
Your shoreline is a window filled with imperalist flower.  
  
To the parenthetical esoteric aspen the jungle homogeneous utensils are devoured.  
Wave of wave of waves rolling down the sea.  
Of a black child that stores saxophones.  
The morbid kis  
that swims in your light.  
Thirsty day and the communist flower  
force at the walls of my house.  
For a day, maybe too many to count,  
I rested under a ray of sunlight  
at a bus stop, waiting for the custodian to be within.  
Of your rust colored pencil when you hold out your arm.  
It is a tale of ironous holes indicates the curtain's enriching foot.  
With its negligent tread the order of the productivities on what callous noises blushed with jungle?  
I took on violenet wells.  
Only morose and to a  
one they take on time, too few to count years  
  
A alcove -like dung  
harass me and let my substance excite.  
.  
They are all pioneers  
professional masks in whose gleaming hearts originate.
