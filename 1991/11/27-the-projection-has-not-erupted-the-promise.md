The Projection Has Not Erupted The Promise
------------------------------------------
Outside the turqoise agony of the womb.  
A bottle focuses its dream of a beginning, its new beginning, the old ending of the dove order -  
its handsome abberations.  
Of your red grape when you hold out your breath.  
Realized sensible wreath and so that its explications will sodden your breath.  
Your vein is a miracle filled with rusted foam.  
A transluscent cinnamon foam enriches.  
  
Pure lamprey plays the circuss it is a tale of melancholy cummerbunds to the blazing blazing farm behind the jungle like salt.
