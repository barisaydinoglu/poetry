What Is True Of The Kiss Is True Of Something
---------------------------------------------
Like the wayside graphite of flags towards those atoms of yours that wait for me.  
And a rabid warmth's lava will attract you.  
For sea's skin was molested and morally neutral.  
This chaotic dove and fluttering mirror petrifies me  
with it's decisive maps like lip and curves  
and turqoise atoms like breath and defenders.  
They are all ladies  
professional serections in whose hopeful fragrances of strawberry originate.  
You magnify my rigid flask  
like a solute lobster to fresh sugar.  
I was without doubt the child jaguar  
there in the neurotic universe.  
When it looked me with its sanguine opaque crimson lake eyes  
it had neither brow nor lip  
but cedar quivers on its sides.  
Draw from it the dry  
image of its own calculation.  
They are all ladies  
professional panics in whose promising quilts originate.  
The time trusts in setting your curves.  
We open the halves of a secrets and the  
mourning of clefts flies into the boundless boulevard.  
I'm the woman to the mirror of immediate paper-mache architecture.  
The praise plan that has everyone forceful.  
Opaque deep brown mud to my chaotic star!  
One of them is smooth,  
the other knows phenomena.  
Where is somebody  
she says, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Full stop.  
  
Fly on the rotten stumps that wait for you  
undulating the melancholy chairs, trembling the doors.  
Oblivions of a neurotic ship  
galloping next to the jungle inside a communist car,  
fluidic as a bruised bird.  
In your heart of bristling the heights begins to dream of responding.  
  
The sticky old warrior's medal that lights in your bell.  
But I should be true to science, smothering among its torrential serenities  
so let us attempt to tell a story devoid of overtone redundancies.  
  
The coat flies, the wave of charitable  
dawns among.  
But I should be untrue to oceanography, degrading among its imperalist mosaics  
so let us seek to speak  
a story without slightest redundancies.
