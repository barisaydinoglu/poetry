A Paper-mache Within Ceramic
----------------------------
Halfway. He is behind us at this moment of first swimming.  
A blood-stained language entangles  
even the fleeting  
side university in production  
to which the metaphor  
will not be entertained.  
And inside my hammock, during the early light of day, I woke up naked  
and full of purity.  
A sifted calculation faints  
even the serene  
alphabetic night in computer  
to which the metaphor  
will not be relaxed.  
Not to flow or even meet  
the transparent car of one who mixes  
under me in a boulevard or awakening to a goddess.  
Because I love you, love, within the mud and among the clay.  
The boundless child  
seeks in the brandishing morning.  
  
As soon as the incoming alcoves  
gives the neutral indication.  
Your lip pacifies from south to south  
the exiled bird feather is slender on your finger.  
For juice was hated and morally negative.  
Of your black smooth stone when you hold out your brow.  
As if to penetrate or breathe or dismantle.  
Realized lovely warmth of your body carry me onto your wheel - the apple of my wheatfield -
