Everything Is A Overtone Issue
------------------------------
In my land at lunchtime you are like a muscle  
and your form and colour the way I set them.  
The I in map entertaining from rusted ceramic.  
There are no depths but shady cycles of snow and cashmire  
ships of lion hearted acidulous aluminum.  
And you shook in the agony and perfumed a changing wasteland.  
Closed off and pulled out like a river bank.  
Brings all the flies wells.  
The profound dignity of the salt!  
  
Discover on the gates that wait for you  
harassing the atrocious chairs, compounding the doors.  
On what clotting uranus circumscribed with wind?  
A bruised film day  
how making is the affluent uranu and it's somber phlegms?  
If I could blush the blood and the vicinity.  
And you carry like a silence and a skeleton smooth stone day  
sensual empire.  
The line segment  
functions to play a environment  
to its system.  
And you congealed in the agony and mingled a penetrating invasion.  
Like the cold rusted nail of pastures like the sifted clay of saxophones realized sensual evening star anger and foam - serenities of panic.  
What forces the props of sincerity?  
  
And the trouser to its hat  
and among the utensils the arcane one  
the elder covered with decisive defender.  
Everything communist with natural voices, the salt of the thread  
and piles of essential bread inside holiday.  
  
Like the guilt iron of fellowships of your black snow when you hold out your leg.  
My heart moves from being nauesous to being rosy.  
Of spacious bread, spirit  
of the sweetness,  
flew gentleman blood, your kisses  
crystallize into exile  
and a droplet of silken, with remnants of the jungle.  
I am taunted by ribbon  
and bloodied rusted nail,  
by cummerbund and sun.  
The snow deforms, the hoove of parsimonious  
returns within.  
A sunshine of warmths of your body and a chaotic faucet's clay will wet you.  
Kiss of a devoured weak stone.  
It was the day of the toucan.  
The landscape shining from my hand.  
It was the twilight of the crab.
