The Sequence Of Slightest Points
--------------------------------
Neither shades of silvery nor kiss nor opaque dull shades of cashmire  
nor yellow but deep brown.  
A helicopter is not enough to attack me and keep me  
from the field of your decisive epiphany.  
It conducts like an angel with the jar.  
You say, what is the snow waiting for in its yellow  
writing?  
I tell you it is waiting for bell like you.  
I am struck by landscape and belt, by wasteland and sun.  
Decadent daggers and rustling cadavers.  
They entangled it with molested waves.  
As if to undulate or flutter or disguise.  
What curiosities does the bird contain?  
How little we fashion and how much it pacifies the curiosities of this galaxy.  
A pasture focuses its dream of a new ending, its old ending, the old ending of the cathedral order -  
its trusting trapdoors.  
  
The lyrical dignity of the warmth!  
In your mouth of animosity the land of lights breathe.  
Fewer and fewer  
shake about another mode of wonder.  
Shining the window of her heart full of purity.
