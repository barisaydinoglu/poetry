The Tear Stained Bloodied Steel
-------------------------------
The magnolium chirps in dawning your mouth.  
There are no acids but sterile cycles of map and cashmire  
pencils of balanced insatiable graphite.  
If you were not the sugar the scrupulous moon  
cooks, sprinkling its grape across the land.  
Of a red custodian that dedicates fleshes.  
Because I love you, love, in front of the electricity and behind the wind.  
I want you to perch on my tail.  
Breathing the forest of her apple full of sincerity.  
The city inside hers  
a history we tell in passing,  
with notions  
of joy  
and a passion for jouranlism and photography  
I saw how goblets are flew  
by the handsome ripple.  
  
And amid my hammock, during the early light of day, I woke up naked  
and full of sincerity.  
A thunder of currents I wish to make a triangle  
around, and every color, many  
times hidden in a landscape.
