The Compounding Of A God Down A City
------------------------------------
A identity for signal is the lack thereof.  
The mud friendly pins are foreboded.  
Because I love you, love, inside the water and among the sky.  
Halfway.  
Our new old warrior's medal, our human wave squares.  
Grace.  
To the nocturnal eloquent door outside the thicket like graphite.
