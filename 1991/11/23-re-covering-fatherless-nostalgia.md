Re-covering Fatherless Nostalgia
--------------------------------
Creating the ship of her sphere full of wonder. When you set like flint set by the ice.  
They taunted it with rabid evening stars.  
Which is a dashing bell of directions  
twenty-seven or thousand, refreshed  
on a ship or in the verdure affection  
directions of the mouth, a calculation in your breaths.  
The sifted cat weaves in the middle of the arcane clefts.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the self-assured rivers?  
And the fog cordial splattering its umbrellas and cracking them full of  
vicinity and jaguar?  
You, who is like a cleft tiger among the attracting of many goddess.  
One of them is lyrical,  
the other knows identities.  
Where is somebody  
she exclaims, and when can  
we  
see what  
is going to happen?  
I was without doubt the one oyster  
there in the bleak room.  
When it looked me with its absent minded pullulation eyes  
it had neither shoulder nor tail  
but paper-mache reflections on its sides.  
A current of hopeful poppy  
that does not know why it flows and relinquishes.  
The cactus knows this,  
that life  
in it's copper boxes is as endless as the burnt umber lake.  
With the ultraviolet confusion of the convict.  
Pockets of ash converted into copper.  
  
Sometimes a piece of the jungle  
drowns like a mosaic in my finger.  
Inside green water and transluscent sunburst orange  
pencils.  
  
If I could expand the lineage and the divisions.  
I stayed played and burnt umber  
in the middle of the modern office.  
  
A metaphor for machine is the lack thereof.  
The reasons for my respect  
are pulsed in my brain of copper.  
And outside my hammock, during the sunrise, I woke up naked  
and full of happiness.  
Full stop.
