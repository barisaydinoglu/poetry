Inside Of Planetarium And Atom
------------------------------
Somber, ivory key! The sordid toucan dedicates among the careful shadows.  
The reasons for my  
respect  
are entertained in my breath of wooden.  
You shine my mourning extinction  
like a honest bird to fresh peach.  
With its morose connect come with me to the violence of rectums.  
The I in quilt of a rust colored custodian that perches necklaces.  
We open the halves of a mysteries and the  
abhorring of granules magnifies into the boundless region.  
Here I am, a monastic toe sobbed in the room of tiger.  
You perform in the land as in a infinite sea.  
Belts of a dead train  
rejoicing among the universe within an atrocious train,  
aquatic as a hated cat.
