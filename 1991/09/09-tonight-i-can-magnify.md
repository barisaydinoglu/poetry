Tonight I Can Magnify
---------------------
One technical option and where manes meet  
hats meet, behind and amid and the sound  
of stalactites, to reach out and connect in embarassement.  
Crimson and changeless pioneer,  
A cinnamon fellowship imbues.  
Nothing but that tiger of grapes.  
The field inside hers  
a tale we speak in passing,  
with notions of honor  
and a passion for mountaineering and computer science
