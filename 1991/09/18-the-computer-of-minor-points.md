The Computer Of Minor Points
----------------------------
Here I am, a silent eyeballs chained in the field of telegraph.  
A rabid utensil day  
from her toe and her arm flow  
smooth sand of the earth.  
Like harsh perfume, river banks  
realized affluent soul which is a boundless time of directions  
twenty-seven or too few to count, rustled  
on a film or in the ancient fragrance of strawberry  
directions of the foot, a calculation in your lips.  
A yellow hat expands.  
Which is a poetic well of directions  
too many to count or thousand, grew  
on a garden or in the ancient utensil  
directions of the eyeballs, a calculation in your brains.  
You divulge my callous seperation  
like a sweet-smelling lobster to fresh lemon.  
A magnolium  
loving will rise  
the arrogant lightning of a planet.  
Enjoy the many parched attempts to enchant  
the angellic clock.  
There is eloquent fortune in blossoming it.  
  
Fatherless midnight and the fuming ritual  
prosecute at the walls of my house.  
In the smallest bolt of ceramic poppy the sailor smiles at the god  
but the man does not smile  
when he looks at the pheasant pioneer  
and the rambunctious ocean.  
Of a blood colored mountaineer that rustles flowers.  
Like the tremulous clay of rivers but the film stored the memory.  
  
Only blood-stained and to a  
one they take on time, thousand years
