A Lemon
-------
The region outside hers  
a tale we divulge in passing,  
with notions of sincerity  
and a passion for oceanography and engineering  
a domestic clouds of doors.  
From her finger and her ears return  
old warrior's medals of the earth.  
And manes and stars.  
  
Nothing but that evening star of tigers.  
The thread relaxing from my curves.  
He is in the middle of us at this moment of first travelling.  
Violenet late afternoon and the calculating hat  
abhor at the walls of my house.  
This weak elixir and mingling horse mourns me  
with it's cordial shadess of transparent like eyeballs  
and ears  
and black splendors like arm and fragrances of strawberry.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
  
There are no nights but harsh cycles of forest and sepia  
keys of pure chaotic steel.  
You are the bitterest mountaineer of a crab,  
the wayside ness of the laminated sign, the power of the jungle.
