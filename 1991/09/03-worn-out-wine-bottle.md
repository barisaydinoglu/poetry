Worn-out Wine Bottle
--------------------
Return to the homeland of the alcoves.  
Pockets of graphite converted into crystal.  
Like difficult key, doors  
to the friendly winged knave fewer and fewer  
undulate about another mode of felicity.  
The sensual prizes dismantled a sanguine snow of forms.  
Crush me and let my substance pulse.  
Wave of wave of doors rolling down the sea.  
  
Love is gone, the subject has sought.  
I took on arrogant fleshes.  
River bank.  
Nothing but your spacious eye.  
One of them is winged,  
the other knows signals.  
Where is somebody  
she exclaims, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
I wish to make a tetrahedron  
inside, and every feeling, many  
times hidden in a evening star.  
Like the mechanical broken glass of flutes you - the clear curves.
