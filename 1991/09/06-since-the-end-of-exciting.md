Since The End Of Exciting
-------------------------
All lakes become probes.  
Multitude of juices!  
In and out of the deep brown the deep brown and the sand-colored  
sometimes a piece of the heat  
replaces like a form in my breath.  
In the university like brick.  
Plumed, ivory smooth stone!  
If I could re-cover the lineage and the city.  
  
What we say blushes to  
inherit some other son  
what a metaphor may teach.  
A black and weak maternity is deformed in the modern office.
