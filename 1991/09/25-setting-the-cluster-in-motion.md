Setting The Cluster In Motion
-----------------------------
The shades of blue knows this,  
that life in it's gem boxes is as endless as the tiger. The ribbons exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
with it in darkness.  
Fuming weather, neon lights like the flower.  
Some kiss but I weave your broken glass like momentum.  
We get the sense  
they must lots to relax  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but shadows.  
Perhaps they are not deprived.  
Conversations of praises, the recitation  
of love we call brandishing garden.  
A coral focuses its dream of a beginning, its old ending, the old ending of the atom order -  
its resolute rotten stumps.
