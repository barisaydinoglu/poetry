The Projection Of Side Points
-----------------------------
The whirlwinds of friendship is decisive on your ears.  
As if to reject or tread or shatter.  
To seek another land I was without doubt the elder iguana  
there in the insufferable region.  
When it looked me with its original aspen eyes  
it had neither brow nor eye  
but diamond snows on its sides.  
Lonely utensils and bitten uranus.  
It is a tale of calculating flasks and you relinquish like a coat and he is under us at this moment of first carrying.  
Pencil.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And  
the warm saxophones?  
And the clouds velvety splattering its lands and smothering them full of  
thicket and iguana?  
In the smallest cork sun I am deprived by pullulation and blade, by puberty and sun.  
She is in us at this moment of first forming.  
  
And you twisted in the illusion and attracted a rejecting extinction.  
I was without doubt the sailor toucan  
there in the torrential night.  
When it looked me with its comfortable hat eyes  
it had neither mouth nor eyelids  
but diamond springtimes on its sides.  
A free linoleum making a decisive thing of a lucky meeting with a bride.  
I am plagued by saxophone and bloody feather, by bramble and sunshine.  
Nothing but your boundless nose.  
Indicates the movie's flowing eye.  
And the warmth to its window  
and among the mists the winged one  
the woman covered with comfortable flesh.
