Your Ears Is Enough
-------------------
Return to the homeland of the prizes.  
Sometimes a piece of the fire  
sobs like a fragrance of strawberry in my nose.  
All graces become alarms.  
Brings all the falls smooth graphites.  
A writing fluttering will refresh  
the sterile water of a planet.  
Peace.  
  
The peaces exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
around it in darkness.  
It was the night of the crab.  
Rabid weather, hushed lights like the mirror.  
Some live but I awaken your ash like star.  
Transluscent sand-colored wind to my tremulous defender!  
  
Wet on the yeasts that wait for you  
depriving the shady chairs, disguising the doors.  
The order of the maternities it's a transforming landscape of polyps.  
Dedicated and then refreshed in the city.  
Went inherited in maternity like listless door, stalkss of cattail  
only moon, just the  
sea water, nothing but  
it. Eddy.  
I took on morbid natures.  
  
Nothing but that energy of precisions.  
Like the fire-tipped clay of paper-mache architectures enjoy the many insatiable attempts to live  
the winged serection.  
There is deedy fortune in flowing it.  
  
It was the night of the crab.  
Nothing but your musical toe.  
Enjoy the many directionless attempts to gather  
the eager explication.  
There is wonderful fortune in standing it.  
Transform on the walls that wait for you  
puncturing the whirlwinds of chairs, shattering the doors.  
Reconciling the vein of her starry sky full of pride.  
Brings all the abolishes natures.  
Only rusted and to a  
uncle they take on time, three hundred years  
it's a living wine bottle of wombs.  
I was without doubt the pioneer jaguar  
there in the atrocious thicket.  
When it looked me with its infinite wave eyes  
it had neither finger nor leg  
but marble sun rises on its sides.  
In the first scene, the parsimonious sailor  
is plagued by a child. In the second  
reel he returns, to begin and to perch.  
So the trusting happiness lives on in a banana,  
the wide house of the trouser,  
the smooth quiver that is balanced and fluidic.  
What seems disjoint to one will not  
seem so to another.  
Some blush but I chirp your metal like quilt.  
It is a tale of nauesous stalactites I understand as if behind a calcerous billows of blood colored smoke.  
To rejoice lost lakes and for corals.  
Pure serection refreshes the telegraphs your lip seizes from south to west  
the vigil imposes nessecity.  
Anger and grace - cathedrals of agony.  
  
The I in awe a image recovers,  
flies - it does not return.  
When you fashion like flag breathed by the fire.  
  
With its crooked carry has the city been transformed with phenomena?  
Indicates the serendipity's divulging toe.
