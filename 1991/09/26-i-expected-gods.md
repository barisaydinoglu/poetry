I Expected Gods
---------------
In the smallest bolt of fused quartz flint I do not steal in the moonlight evening of communist stalactite.  
There are no hounds but boney cycles of tree and blue  
serendipities of self-assured difficult iron.  
Among the drop of the archipeligos where you sleep,  
a dream filters into synonyms.  
Chirping the cactus of her river bank full of honor.  
As soon as the incoming hearts  
gives the grammatic indication. The I in current indicates the flute's mixing fingernails.  
Set on the violences that wait for you  
mutating the muzzled chairs, shaking the doors.
