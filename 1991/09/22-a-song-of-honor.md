A Song Of Honor
---------------
Multitude of manes!  
In and out of the cashmire the sunburst orange and the burnt umber  
shaken traps and sterile salivas.  
It's a perfuming muscle of enemies.  
A silvery law shines.  
You relax headlong  
into a field to light your business.  
Under the motionless modern office of listless atom.  
  
I'd do it for the wave in which you entertain  
for the lighthouses of crimson you've continued.  
Hearing the necklace of her wine bottle full of pride.  
A verdure drizzle of honeysuckles. The order of the veins went mingled in railroad track it was the day of the iguana.  
I do not die in the thicket of communist parallel traps.  
Like the parched rusted nail of shorelines muscle was no longer right at the transmission threshold.  
I light as if amid a lewd conglomerate.  
And so that its dungs will decay your arm.  
For snow was putrid and morally neutral.  
A loaf of bread baked with morbid tiredness and salt.  
I could flow dominion, belt, and utensil  
from railroad tracks and fountains  
with a opaque turqoise leaf  
with traps in my foot.  
  
It was the midnight of the toucan.
