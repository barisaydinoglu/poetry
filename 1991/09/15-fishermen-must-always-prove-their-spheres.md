Fishermen Must Always Prove Their Spheres
-----------------------------------------
I do not taunt in the sea of hairy belt.  
My cleansed ears connects you always.  
Of irreducable apple, spirit  
of the saxophones,  
filtered god blood, your kisses  
re-cover into exile  
and a droplet of saphire, with remnants of the vicinity.  
Sometimes a piece of the fire  
silences like a smooth iron in my foot.
