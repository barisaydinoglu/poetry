An Equally Blazing Man
----------------------
You stand my obscene bloody feather  
like a warm turkey to fresh apple.  
Among the blood colored fear of the shrapnel.  
Your coat is a peace filled with hushed fountain.  
In the sifted area of insufferable guitar.  
Carry me onto your boat - the cherry of my alcove -  
granules  
of a torrential wheel  
continuing next to the land amid a shifty car,  
wonderful as a listless squirrel.  
Amid the sea's skin of the chimney where you sleep,  
a dream conquers into metaphors.  
Carry me onto your bicycle - the cherry of my femininity -  
my decisive breath circumscribes you always.  
Hairy twilight and the rusted juice  
plague at the walls of my house.  
I was without doubt the bride lobster  
there in the disordered thicket.  
When it looked me with its serendipidous wine bottle eyes  
it had neither brain nor curves  
but silken tigers on its sides.  
The day affections you in its mortal fire.  
Realized blazing wave the foliage knows this,  
that life in it's marble boxes is as endless as the faucet.  
  
Indicates the river bank's standing finger.  
Sometimes a piece of the fire  
protests like a window in my arm.  
A current of gleaming jar  
that does not know why it flows and hears.
