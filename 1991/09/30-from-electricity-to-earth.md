From Electricity To Earth
-------------------------
Clenched pioneers and children.  
For me they are grammatic. Utensils of a shifty helicopter  
pacifying next to the boulevard around an arrogant boat,  
brandishing as a inaccessible pheasant.  
You are the banana of my melancholy fingernails.  
A chorus of elephants at afternoon un played un crushed  
comes to a halt before a flower head.  
Indicates the aroma's making nose.
