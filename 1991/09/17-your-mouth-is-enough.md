Your Mouth Is Enough
--------------------
I recover as if outside a dead cold fire.  
Some hear  
but I flutter your graphite like star.  
And you kiss like an acrobat and I salute your acerb grape  
and envy your round pride.  
In your nose of compounding the divisions begins to dream of re-covering.  
A pale production entangles  
Even the solute  
public region in point of view  
to which the metaphor  
will not be transformed.  
Multitude of femininities!  
In and out of the marine the yellow and the green  
it was the sunrise of the toucan.  
The difficult ritual is fleeting on your lip.  
Inside deep brown water and deep brown forms.  
  
It was the sunset of the ostrich.  
A raft is not enough to loathe me and keep me  
from the thicket of your original epiphany.  
He is inside us at this moment of first setting.  
My heart is filled with pride like a wooden warmth of your body.  
The I in pullulation a foliage transforming will crystallize  
the senile clay of a planet.  
  
The reasons for my respect  
are excited in my foot of ivory.  
Dry giants and fathers.  
For me they are algorithmic.
