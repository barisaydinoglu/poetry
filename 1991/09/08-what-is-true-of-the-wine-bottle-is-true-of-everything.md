What Is True Of The Wine Bottle Is True Of Everything
-----------------------------------------------------
What careful drops -  
the field is filled with it,  
serenities for the horse and the inevitable fused quartz. Be guided by the resolute bed's lemon.  
I was without doubt the giant iguana  
there in the wet-winged university.  
When it looked me with its natural guitar eyes  
it had neither breath nor nose  
but silicon maps on its sides.  
You are the fruit of my barbaous shoulder.  
For a day, maybe too many to count,  
I rested under a palm tree leaf  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the stranger to be outside.  
The area outside hers  
a tale we tell in passing,  
with notions of honor  
and a passion for engineering and jouranlism  
The light sets in reconciling your eyeballs.  
And so that its ghosts will reject your nose.  
I stayed magnified and burnt umber  
outside the room.
