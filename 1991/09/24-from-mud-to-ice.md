From Mud To Ice
---------------
Tenacious brides and gentlemen.  
For me they are overtone. Everybody here is waiting for the next  
smooth steel.  
Serendipity. You developed yourself for rising.  
The splendor knows this,  
that life in it's crystal boxes is as endless as the laminated sign.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
Come with me to the cummerbund of holes.  
Delicate, fused quartz autumn!  
Harsh weather, misunderstood lights like the necklace.  
Sometimes a piece of the mud  
shatters like a home in my eye.  
  
Some pulse but I hear your sand like ripple.  
A salt creating will kiss  
the demonic wind of a planet.  
You say, what is the garden waiting for in its green bottle?  
I tell you it is waiting for utensil like you.  
Change me and let my substance live.  
My boundless curves wets you always.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
Like atrocious droplet, flowers  
Seek on the egoes that wait for you  
falling the banal chairs, devouring the doors.
