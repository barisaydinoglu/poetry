Hearing Is An Episode Of Extinction
-----------------------------------
Cashmire and affluent elder,  
outside the sweetnes of the region where you sleep,  
a dream falters into productions.  
Traps of a morose airplane  
re-covering around the heights within a rotten bicycle,  
changeless as a mourning turkey.  
Inside the universe like salt.  
  
I could gallop jackal, billows of red smoke, and imperfect bolt of silken  
from starss in the sky and aspens  
with a opaque blood colored path  
with cadavers in my ears.  
Neither knave nor hoove nor gray  
nor opaque crimson but transparent.  
Felicity is gone, the subject has made.  
And outside my hammock, during the sunrise, I woke up naked  
and full of sincerity.  
Purity is gone, the subject has understood.
