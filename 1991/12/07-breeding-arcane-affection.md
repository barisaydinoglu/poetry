Breeding Arcane Affection
-------------------------
If you were not the cheesecake the careful moon  
cooks, sprinkling its wine across the sea.  
They wiped it with disintered wells.  
In the first scene, the sensible one  
Is sobbed by a cousin. In the second  
take he returns, to appreciate and to flow.  
You flutter my troubled ash  
like a lion hearted squirrel to fresh wine.  
The earth trusting billows of ultraviolet smoke are deceived.  
In my archipeligos at sunrise you are like a flower head  
and your form and colour the way I mingle them.  
It was a fire-tipped business of explication and extinctions.  
Angel of a deceived fragmented old warrior's medal. I was without doubt the fisherman cat  
there in the fuming land.  
When it looked me with its fresh sphere eyes  
it had neither foot nor shoulder  
but silken roots on its sides.  
A decisive rug making a fleeting  
thing of a chance meeting with a cousin.
