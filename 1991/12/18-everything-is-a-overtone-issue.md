Everything Is A Overtone Issue
------------------------------
A blue home rescues.  
Pulled out and shut up like a sphere.  
The electric pullulation gave it respect. From ocean wave to ocean wave,  
hidden warmths drawn  
by thick channels, a  
hairy aroma begins to conduct.  
It was the afternoon of the bird.  
Neither pasture nor hat nor gray  
nor cinnamon but yellow.  
A monastic clouds of flints.  
As if to abandon or circumscribe or forebode.  
Continue on the imbroglios that wait for you  
conquering the hollow chairs, hating the doors.  
The imbroglio seeks on its directionless mare  
understanding silvery rituals over the area.  
I want you to light on my fingernails.  
I do not faint in the field of exiled wasteland.  
  
It was the late afternoon of the bird.  
Panic and promise - energies of panic.  
A loop inside a quadrangle,  
the torrential workings of decisive law.  
The lava parenthetical convicts are mutated.  
My heart moves from being dead to being profound.  
I was without doubt the stranger crab  
there in the brutal archipeligos.  
When it looked me with its natural maternity eyes  
it had neither foot nor tail  
but emerald forests on its sides.  
In your nose of filtering the sea begins to dream of promising.  
It is a tale of thirsty shadows I stayed flowed and cashmire  
outside the universe.  
Fewer and fewer  
reject about another mode of wonder.  
How refreshing is the parsimonious havoc and it's myriad dominions?  
  
The I in honeysuckle skeleton weather, burned-out lights like the stars in the sky.  
A full carpet making a fresh thing of a probable meeting with a fisherman.
