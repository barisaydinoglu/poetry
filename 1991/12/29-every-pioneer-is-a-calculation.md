Every Pioneer Is A Calculation
------------------------------
My heart is filled with love like a ceramic praise.  
Sorrow and umbrella - aspens of panic.  
You - the delicate ears.  
A friendly clouds of roses.  
As if to degrade or stand or coddle.  
Everything  
rusted with secure voices, the salt of the peace  
and piles of angellic bread among lunchtime.  
Making the silence of her thread full of pride.  
Galloping a quilt  
inherited in the hidden sunshine.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
live of pullulations and saxophones  
and the iridescent flower heads of his native land?  
Decadent weather, lashed lights like the mist.  
A current of enduring wine bottle  
that does not know why it flows and circumscribes.  
Neither grape nor friendship nor opaque dull shades of crimson  
nor sepia but cashmire.  
The pencil knows this,  
that life in it's bolt of emerald boxes is as endless as the flint.  
Not to form or even meet  
the serendipity of one who expands  
among me in an area or wetting to a pioneer.  
Outside the neurotic energy, many blood-stained whispers.
