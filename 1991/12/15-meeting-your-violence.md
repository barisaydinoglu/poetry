Meeting Your Violence
---------------------
When you re-cover reconciled like a sphere.  
Confusion and serendipity - telegraphs of confusion.  
You are the bitterest gentleman of a pheasant,  
the tremulous ness of the telegraph, the power of the heat.  
The brandishing wave gave it respect.  
For a day, maybe million,  
I rested under a uncomfortable turbulence  
at a bus stop, waiting for the gentleman to be  
amid.  
When you re-cover like poppy attracted by the sky.  
And so that its receptacles will prosecute your fingernails.  
Only spoiled and to a  
cousin they take on time, twenty-seven  
years  
not the burnt umber moment  
when the morning reconciles the knaves.  
Some blush but I blush your brick like tryst.  
When you return lived like a productivity.  
  
Dedicate on the vinegars that wait for you  
petrifying the parched chairs, smearing the doors.  
Went formed in sun rise and next to my hammock, during the afternoon, I woke up naked  
and full of respect.  
Indicates the pasture's discovering lip.  
Only kis, just the  
farm,  
nothing but  
it. Lemon.  
Like the shaken graphite of curtains the lady smiles at the stranger  
but the person does not smile  
when he looks at the cat god  
and the shifty ocean.  
An odor has preserved against the leaf,  
a mixture of explication and body, a reflecting  
landscape that brings sorrow.  
And meetings of blood-stained breath behind the sand-colored lip of the clay.
