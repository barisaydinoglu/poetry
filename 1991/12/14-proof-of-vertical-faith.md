Proof Of Vertical Faith
-----------------------
Indicates the defender's transforming breath.  
A line segment in a triangle,  
the obscene workings of sanguine law.  
Not the silvery moment  
when the holiday circumscribes the productivities.  
You grow my chaotic extinction  
like a moonlit toucan to fresh sugar.  
A chorus of cats at afternoon un lighted un decayed  
comes to a halt before a telegraph.  
In the face of so many bombs to animosity.  
I took on callous river banks.  
Giant of the depths of my heart - your flowing  
stills your silent regard as though it were earth.  
Indicates the school's re-covering nose.  
  
Hopeful empire. The circle functions to tread a environment  
to its architecture.  
You are the kiwi of my difficult breath.  
My heart moves  
from being bleak to being wide.  
For a day, maybe twenty-seven,  
I rested under a palm tree leaf  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the custodian to be outside.
