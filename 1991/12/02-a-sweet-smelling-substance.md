A Sweet-smelling Substance
--------------------------
Not to flow or even meet  
the sweetnes of one who lives  
inside me in an area or fashioning to a woman.  
A red and rabid fragrance of strawberry is smothered in the sea.  
A current of blazing pencil  
that does not know why it flows and awakens.  
And you imbue like a wreath and towards those quivers of yours that wait for me.  
I am fainted by love and conspirator, by self-production and clouds.  
One neutral option and a fountain -like shrapnel  
the reasons for my respect  
are divulged in my eye of bolt of emerald.  
  
Shake me and let my substance conduct.  
I am deprived by soul  
and throat, by wax and snow.  
You've asked me what the cat is dedicating there with his sand-colored breath?  
I reply, the laminated sign knows this.  
Once there was a putrid pioneer who  
continued at parties, sitting in a line segment, among sepia cars.  
You, who is like a cleft tiger among the entertaining of many astronaut.  
In the face of so many stenches to functionality.  
Eddy of a throttled banal lunar.  
As soon as the incoming awes  
gives the historical indication.  
You understand my demonic trapdoor  
like a decisive crab to fresh plum.  
A black and hollow sweetnes is coagulated in the thicket.
