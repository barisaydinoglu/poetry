Proof Of Perfect Faith
----------------------
Not living is a form of loving.  
What curiosities does the tiger contain?  
How little we entertain and how much it carries the curiosities of this computer simulation.  
The heights inside hers  
a history we tell in passing,  
with notions of happiness  
and a passion for mountaineering and engineering  
mineral empire. The square functions to expand an architecture  
to its environment.
