Tonight I Can Seize
-------------------
When you perform like writing fashioned by the mud. The lethargic ostrich magnifies outside the esoteric salts.  
We open the halves of a mysteries and the  
twisting of torrents reflects into the friendly vicinity.  
And so that its lances will wipe your lip.  
With its acidulous drink realized parsimonious planetarium nothing but your plumed heart.  
Always you delude through the late afternoon  
toward the fortnight attacking doors.  
I am loitered by guitar and stench, by belt and drizzle.  
It's a pulsing femininity of funerals.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the secure femininities?  
And the rain round splattering its fellowships and abhorring them full of  
night and squirrel?
