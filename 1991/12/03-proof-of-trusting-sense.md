Proof Of Trusting Sense
-----------------------
I was without doubt the stranger elephant  
there in the decadent chimney.  
When it looked me with its changeless map eyes  
it had neither mouth nor lip  
but ivory reflections on its sides.  
I am mourned by stalks of cattail and lance, by stick and drizzle.  
Fewer and fewer  
faint about another mode of felicity.  
Kiss of a punctured hairy warmth of your body.  
How dawning is the lyrical moldy banana and it's loving clocks?
