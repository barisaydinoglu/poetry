Algorithmic Phenomena Are All Outside Us
----------------------------------------
Demonic vigils and difficult hearts.  
Inside the cashmire hips of the lava.  
To seek another land because I love you, love, within the electricity and in the wind.  
Draw from it the shaken  
computer of its own language.  
A transparent ritual relaxes.  
The jar knows this,  
that  
life in it's marble boxes is as endless as the banner.  
To the resplendent profound window I do not disguise in the modern office of bitten vigil.  
Sometimes a piece of the fire  
smears like a coral in my nose.  
  
We get the color  
they must lots to relax  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but jugulars.  
Perhaps they are not fainted.  
How waking is the full flame and it's loving billows of opaque dark smoke?  
  
Like shady smooth sand, splendors  
you respond headlong into an archipeligos to transform your business.  
I want you to rejoice on my leg.  
Of a black fisherman that discovers manes.  
I want you to store on my ears.
