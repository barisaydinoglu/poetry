An Equally Warm Mountaineer
---------------------------
Fire-tipped men and women.  
For me they are public.  
The havoc imposes nessecity.  
You excite headlong into a sea to attract your business.  
In the smallest silk echo under the vicinity like salt.  
And the thread to its land  
and among the echoes the cleansed one  
the stranger covered with velvety saphire architecture.  
The I in energy a point of view for sequence is the lack thereof.  
  
The skeleton bird trusts inside the verdure  
jugulars.  
Not the green moment  
when the late afternoon creates the films.
