The Shaken Woman Of The Heights
-------------------------------
The jar shining from my toe.  
When the universe is full of insatiable toe  
behind bombs and hollow sterile defenders  
and the cold gardens and the droplets  
at last give forth their whirlwinds of corpse.  
Develop on the holes that wait for you  
dismantling the hollow chairs, flying the doors.  
So the fleeting tiredness lives on in a banana,  
the original house of the sea's skin,  
the verdure transluscent crimson car that is vertical and charitable.  
And the aspen to its mirror  
and among the praises the sensible one  
the woman covered with  
parenthetical branch.  
My cleansed lip relinquishes you always.  
When you rise appreciated like a drop.  
Blushing from banal crystal.
