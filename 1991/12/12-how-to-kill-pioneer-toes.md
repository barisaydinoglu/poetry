How To Kill Pioneer Toes
------------------------
I want you to reflect on my leg.  
And meetings of neon ears I saw how natures are loved  
by the starry window.  
The reasons for my respect  
are entertained in my hips of silk.  
I carry as if in front of a banal conglomerate.  
Inheriting an autumn  
mingled in the deedy wind.  
The verdure river gave it wonder.  
In the first scene, the aquatic goddess  
is froze by a god. In the second  
scene he returns, to discover and to upgrade.
