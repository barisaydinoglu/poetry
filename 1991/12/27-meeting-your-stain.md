Meeting Your Stain
------------------
A current of affluent book  
that does not know why it flows and loves.  
They faltered it with whirlwinds of drops.  
Indicates the film's blossoming fingernails.  
To the clear angellic breakfast the bitten dove that transforms in your lake.  
They prosecuted it with insufferable starry skies.  
What prosecutes the props of joy?  
All ribbons become roosters.  
Where stones meet  
clusters meet, within and behind and the sound  
of depths, to reach out and fashion in confusion.  
I could perch wound, legume, and legless horse  
from bird feathers and necklaces  
with a turqoise phemonana  
with lineages in my nose.  
My fleeting nose wakes you always.  
When you stand like warmth grew by the sky.
