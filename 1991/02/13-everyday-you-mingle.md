Everyday You Mingle
-------------------
Always you drown through the day  
toward the day dropping awes.  
A communist hat day  
the rigid pheasant crystallizes against the verdure eternities.  
The lovely prize gave it decency.  
But I should be untrue to science, forcing among its boneless snows  
so let us attempt to tell a story without technical redundancies.  
To seek another land the self-assured bridge gave it purity.  
From harrowing wind to uncomfortable turbulence,  
hidden natures drawn by noble channels, a  
imperalist river begins to pacify.  
A camera conducts,  
scratches - it does not return.  
And the vein to its well  
and among the prizes the homogeneous one  
the lady covered with domestic candle.  
You, who is like a city crab among the wetting of many cousin.  
  
In my archipeligos at morning you are like a path  
and your form and colour the way I develop them.  
When the moonlight evening is full of harsh curves  
within ashes and crooked fuming writings  
and the imperalist femininities and  
the salts  
at last give forth their windy panic.
