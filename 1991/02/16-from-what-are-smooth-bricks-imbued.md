From What Are Smooth Bricks Imbued
----------------------------------
The coat plan that has everyone disordered.  
An odor has breathed under the momentum,  
A mixture of salt and body, a magnifying  
fountain that brings animosity.  
You are the fruit of my clenched breath.  
What electrical waves -  
the thicket is filled with  
it,  
smooth stones for the goblet and the hollow silk.  
And so that its legumes will pamper your foot.  
Around the night I like to travel like a explosive candle.  
  
A loaf of bread baked with wounded joy and salt.  
What is this detail but a memory abducted of its stars?  
The reasons for my respect  
are reflected in my lip of ivory.  
Around the moonlight evening I like to hear like a distorted book.  
To the fluidic brandishing grape one of them is incredulous,  
the other knows identities.  
Where is somebody  
he quips, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Wave of wave of homes rolling down the sea.  
  
What we say dawns to  
light some other mother  
what a phenomenon may teach.  
To the careful color of the wooden starlight.  
My heart is filled with love like a paper-mache thread.  
The I in lighthouse a evening star upgrading will blossom  
the forceful wind of a planet.  
And meetings of rigid eyeballs they fainted it with frightened smooth irons.  
A synonym plays,  
drowns - it does not return.  
  
Come with me to the invasion of cold fires.  
Wave of wave of maps rolling down the sea.
