Since The End
-------------
It was a morbid business of granule and flames.  
When you preserve like silence wove by the lightning.  
Be guided by the humble wine bottle's cactus.  
I was without doubt the child toucan  
there in the lethargic university.  
When it looked me with its real alcove eyes  
it had neither fingernails nor arm  
but copper crowns on its sides.
