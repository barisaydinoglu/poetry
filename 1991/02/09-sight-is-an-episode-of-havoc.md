Sight Is An Episode Of Havoc
----------------------------
Of your brimstone starlight when you hold out your nose.  
To the hopeful color of the gold bed.  
I stayed wetted and cashmire  
in the night.  
And a rabid wave's fire will  
wet you.  
For evening star was fuming and morally positive.  
Profound, cedar lemon!  
It is a tale of lethargic enemies when you recover enchanted like a river bank.
