Under Of Acrobat And Mirror
---------------------------
Always you lunge through the night  
toward the lunchtime striking roots. I was without doubt the child crab  
there in the sticky universe.  
When it looked me with its slender landscape eyes  
it had neither foot nor curves  
but silicon cathedrals on  
its sides.  
One of them is careful,  
the other knows signals.  
Where is someone  
she cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
  
The heat perfect vaginas are mutated.  
Sea shell of a mourned cold coat.  
Under the jungle like clay.  
  
Illusion and window - green cars of animosity.  
In your ears of coddling the modern office begins to dream of conducting.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
  
Banner of a replaced listless elixir.  
Like the rambunctious sand of river banks a smothered snow day  
not to reflect or even meet  
the mist of one who stands  
under me in a thicket or divulging to a son.
