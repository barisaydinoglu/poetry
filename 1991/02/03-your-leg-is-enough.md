Your Leg Is Enough
------------------
In your curves of sorrow the area of smooth metals continue.  
From her heart and her curves enrich  
laminated signs of the earth.  
A hand and a hips  
appreciating the boulevard.  
Of secure nectarine, spirit  
of the quilts,  
congealed custodian blood, your kisses  
discover into exile  
and a droplet of paper-mache, with remnants of the room.  
The university around hers  
a tale we tell in passing,  
with notions of honor  
and a passion for photography and jouranlism  
your foam is a fragrance of strawberry filled with insufferable mosaic.  
Only landscape, just the  
apple, nothing but  
it. Apple.  
Pulsed and then blossomed in the land.  
  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the romantic evening stars?  
And the thunder charitable splattering its goblets and protesting them full of  
divisions and bird?  
Always you dismantle through the late afternoon  
toward the morning crushing sea's skins.
