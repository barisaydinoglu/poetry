A Silken Within Chalk
---------------------
Sifted late afternoon and the dead laminated sign  
force at the walls of my house.  
Which is a warm ritual of directions  
three hundred or thousand, mixed  
on a railroad track or in the unguessed necklace  
directions of the heart, a calculation in your brows.  
Around the loathing noises.  
Be guided by the esoteric miracle's echo.
