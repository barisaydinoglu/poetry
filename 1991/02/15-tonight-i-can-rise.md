But the foliage enchanted the memory. And so that its abyss will erupt your brow.  
I stayed expanded and sand-colored

I stayed lighted and cinnamon  
under the region.  
One slightest option and they killed it with silent wreaths.  
The tiger conducting from my eyeballs.  
Transluscent transparent and lovely mountaineer,
