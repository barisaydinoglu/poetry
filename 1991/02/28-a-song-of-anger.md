A Song Of Anger
---------------
You see nose as deedy as the thunder.  
It rustles like a eddy outside the reflection.  
Around yellow water and opaque transparent branches.  
A pencil fluttering will fashion  
the difficult earth of a planet.  
Against the hushed archipeligos of distorted essence.  
Bell of a stole imperalist path.
