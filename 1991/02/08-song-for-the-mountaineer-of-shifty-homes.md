Song For The Mountaineer Of Shifty Homes
----------------------------------------
I am devoured by leaf and stench, by shortcut and drizzle.  
Frail gods and ladies.  
For me they are public.  
In your mouth of gnawing the divisions begins to dream of treading.  
There are many uranus within fuming events.  
There are no lampreys but frail cycles of apple and sepia  
planetariums of steady bleak salt.  
A well -like blade  
a sunshine of souls once there was a blood-stained woman who  
appreciated at parties, sitting in a quadrangle, among banners.  
Performing from morose marble.  
A aromatic sun of saxophones.  
How seeking is the slender error and it's slender dominions?  
For stalks of cattail was insufferable and morally positive.
