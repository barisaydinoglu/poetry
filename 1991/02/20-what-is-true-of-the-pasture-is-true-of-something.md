What Is True Of The Pasture Is True Of Something
------------------------------------------------
Relinquishing from bruised copper.  
Always you force through the twilight  
toward the sunrise petrifying eddies.  
Dew.  
Around the area I like to wet like a cheerless magnolium.  
The reasons for my respect  
are understood in my eyelids of copper.  
Irreducable empire. The tetrahedron functions to build an architecture  
to its system.  
My heart is filled with respect like a marble essence.  
How breathing is the wonderful polyp and it's essential brambles?  
Not the silvery moment  
When the sunrise relinquishes the love.  
  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
The holiday elixirs you in its mortal jungle.
