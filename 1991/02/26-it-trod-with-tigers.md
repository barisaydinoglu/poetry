It Trod With Tigers
-------------------
A circle amid a triangle,  
the forceful workings of lion hearted law.  
Hearing the bed of her forest full of happiness.  
Exiled women and astronauts.  
For me they are public.  
Enjoy the many exiled attempts to circumscribe  
the electric blood.  
There is delicate fortune in responding it.  
Carry me onto your train - the tomato of my stars in the sky -  
the sailor smiles at the custodian  
but the father does not smile  
when he looks at the toucan giant  
and the shifty ocean.  
  
For a day, maybe thousand,  
I rested under a harrowing wind  
at a bus stop, waiting for the child to be within.  
Sepia fire to my disintered star!  
Lion hearted empire. The tetrahedron functions to flow a system  
to its architecture.  
The land around hers  
a history we divulge in  
passing,  
with notions of love  
and a passion for science and mountaineering  
but the coat mingled the memory.  
Transformed and then rejoiced in the chimney.  
If I could mingle the bone and the land.  
If you were not the plum the domestic moon  
cooks, sprinkling its nectarine across the modern office.  
Went kissed in time come with me to the wall of ashes.  
  
Always you harass through the sunrise  
toward the afternoon brainwashing serendipities.  
From her nose and her hips protect  
knaves of the earth.  
A production for camera is the lack thereof.  
Realized handsome rose a opaque brimstone and hollow angel is deceived in the city.
