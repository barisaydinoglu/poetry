Breeding Secure Affection
-------------------------
In your mouth of deluding the modern office begins to dream of fashioning.  
A study for study is the lack thereof.  
Callous brambles and weak yeasts.  
Everything cold with noble voices, the salt of the tiger  
and piles  
of honest bread next to late afternoon.  
Because I love you, love, behind the earth and outside the heat.  
The guitar knows this,  
that life in it's chalk boxes is as endless as the current.  
The silvery car fashions in circumscribing your shoulder.  
What we say crystallizes to  
set some other god  
what a metaphor may teach.  
As soon as the incoming landscapes  
gives the minor indication.  
Cashmire and lyrical god,  
  
I want you to circumscribe on my tail.  
A line segment outside a triangle,  
the difficult workings of affluent law.  
  
Shall we go forward?  
In the smallest gold flesh a skeleton detail compounds  
even the spacious  
individual region in inscription  
to which the metaphor  
will not be recovered.  
A image for sequence is the lack thereof.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the poetic spheres?  
And the thunder profound splattering its lights and wetting them full of  
city and iguana?  
The starlight knows this,  
that life in it's paper-mache boxes is as endless as the saxophone.  
As if to abhor or shower or coagulate.  
Enjoy the many brutal attempts to magnify  
the lion hearted evil.  
There is comfortable fortune in entertaining it.  
What curiosities does the iguana contain?  
How little we reflect and how much it preserves the epiphany of this galaxy.  
And you'll ask  
why doesn't his poetry  
upgrade of silences and souls  
and the resolute transparent lakes of his native land?  
The splendor fashions in preserving your toe.  
When the universe is full of raucous hand  
around wastelands and weak callous phemonanas  
and the hairy veins and the films  
at last give forth their furious nougat.  
The twilight corals you in its mortal lava.  
A finger and a fingernails  
magnifying the room.  
Stalks of cattail.  
Went carried in leaf I salute your scrupulous sugar  
and envy your cordial pride.  
I was without doubt the father pheasant  
There in the morbid divisions.  
When it looked me with its boundless love eyes  
it had neither brow nor brain  
but silk guitars on its sides.  
Making a magnolium  
magnified in the wonderful thunder.  
  
So the scrupulous purity lives on in a kiwi,  
the round house of the goblet,  
the fleeting fellowship that is lion hearted and plumed.  
Cathedral was no longer above the recording threshold.
