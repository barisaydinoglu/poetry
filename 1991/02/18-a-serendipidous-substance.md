A Serendipidous Substance
-------------------------
Not building is a form of transforming.  
How swimming is the soft imperfect cork and it's starry consequences?  
The sweetnes enriches in circumscribing  
your mouth.  
Return to the homeland of the natures.  
Conquer me and let my substance magnify.  
Magnifying a crown  
rustled in the absent minded rain.  
What we say appreciates to  
reflect some  
other gentleman  
what a detail may teach.
