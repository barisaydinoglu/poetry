From Earth To Sky
-----------------
Come with me to the eternity of blades.  
Your nose builds from east to north  
you are the disordered bride of a oyster,  
the bitterest ness of the juice, the power of the electricity.  
In my thicket at early light of day you are like a productivity  
and your form and colour the way I chirp them.  
The bitter toucan showers among the blazing vagabonds.  
In your shoulder of confusion the archipeligos of fragrances of strawberry light.  
Realized blazing  
book like funerals imprisoning among flowers.
