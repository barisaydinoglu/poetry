There Is No Dust
----------------
You say, what is the pullulation waiting for in its cashmire honeysuckle?  
I tell you it is waiting for lighthouse like you.  
You are the apple of my misunderstood shoulder.  
Always you wet through the day  
toward the late afternoon conquering farms.  
Nothing but your steady foot.
