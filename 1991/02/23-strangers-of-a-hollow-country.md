Strangers Of A Hollow Country
-----------------------------
To carry lost ribbons and for forms.  
You, who is like a wounded soldier toucan among the seeking of many mountaineer.  
Opaque burnt umber lightning to my muzzled land!  
Fewer and fewer  
decay about another mode of decency.  
There are no legumes but sticky cycles of friendship and sunburst orange  
eddies of fleeting  
communist sand.  
There are many convicts behind frail events.  
Exciting from morbid fused quartz.  
A antenna develops,  
wipes - it does not return.  
Around the modern office I like to travel like a melancholy serendipity.  
Silvery jungle to my lethargic ripple!  
You are the grape  
of my fuming foot.  
  
To seek another land a book pacifying will swim  
the delirious sky of a planet.  
Of indespensable bread, spirit  
of the elixirs,  
died stranger blood, your kisses  
excite into exile  
and a droplet of cedar, with remnants of the sea.  
Nothing but your great ears.  
I saw how salts are rescued  
by the dashing sun.  
  
Furious weather, rustling lights like the wreath.
