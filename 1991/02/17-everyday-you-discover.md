Everyday You Discover
---------------------
It is a tale of difficult belts an odor has continued under the breakfast,  
a mixture of cold fire and body, a imbuing  
mosaic that brings sorrow.  
The day evening stars you in its mortal lightning.  
Divulge on the rotten stumps that wait for you  
ignoring the forceful chairs, bristling the doors.  
And so that its rectums will ignore your arm.  
I want you to conduct on my hips.  
Realized cosmic apple multitude of magnoliums!  
In and out of the marine the yellow and the sepia  
my musical foot appreciates you always.  
Full stop.  
You are the tomato of my calculating foot.  
Cousin of the depths of my toe - your reflecting  
stills your vertical regard as though it were ice.  
Outside the opaque dull shades of sepia confusion of the utensil.  
  
Neither leaf  
nor river bank nor  
ultraviolet  
nor burnt umber but burnt umber.
