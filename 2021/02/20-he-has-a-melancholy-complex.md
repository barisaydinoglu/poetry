He Has A Melancholy Complex
---------------------------
I mingle as if amid a inaccessible convict.  
It is a tale of morbid deaths conversations of defenders, the recitation  
of femininities we call naked splendor.  
With cashmire water and sand-colored utensils. Insufferable sunrise and the tear stained precision  
falter at the walls of my house.  
The wheatfield buries, the mosaic of unguessed  
upgrades inside.
