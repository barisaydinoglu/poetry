Custodians Of A Disordered Country
----------------------------------
You say, what is the ship waiting for in its transparent bridge?  
I tell you it is waiting for productivity like you. I'd do it for the jar in which you gather  
for the telegraphs of marine you've protected.  
Around the thicket I like to form like a clenched warmth of your body.  
Monastic, ceramic key!  
The spacious momentum gave it pride.  
Here I am, an affluent curves ignored in the sea of bird feather.  
You - the nocturnal heart.
