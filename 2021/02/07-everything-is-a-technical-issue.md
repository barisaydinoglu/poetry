Everything Is A Technical Issue
-------------------------------
Like jugulars crushing around awes.  
My heart moves from being ironous to being charitable.  
Abolish me and let my substance set.  
Full stop.  
A projection grows,  
mourns - it does not return.  
When you crystallize enriched like a hoove.  
  
It's a circumscribing landscape of extinctions.  
Sepia  
and unguessed bride,  
A nature -like noise  
you are the parched sailor of a turkey,  
the negligent ness of the snow, the power of the heat.  
Indicates the writing's reconciling arm.  
  
Pockets of clay converted into cork.  
Draw  
from it the fractious  
point of view of its own study.
