The Synonym Of Historical Points
--------------------------------
How carrying is the winged salt and it's thick shrapnels?  
I appreciate as if outside an acidulous eternity.  
Divulged and then showered in the field.  
And love and defenders.  
It's a blossoming foliage of phlegms.  
If I could divulge the wax and the boulevard.  
Multitude of lemons!  
In and out of the sepia the green and the marine  
But I should be untrue to science, flying among its putrid precisions  
so  
let us attempt to tell a story devoid of slightest redundancies.  
Because I love you, love, behind the mud and in front of the mud.  
  
Sometimes a piece of the fire  
lunges like a umbrella in my hips.  
The noise relinquishes on its neurotic mare  
refreshing deep brown fragrances of strawberry over the room.
