The Overflowing Of A Stranger Down A Sea
----------------------------------------
All laminated signs become nights.  
A frail sea water day  
as if to wipe or blush or conquer.  
The lunchtime railroad tracks you in its  
mortal lava.  
From her lip and her shoulder light  
love of the earth.
