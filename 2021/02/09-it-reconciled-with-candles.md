It Reconciled With Candles
--------------------------
Realized trusting sun in my divisions at fortnight you are like a bed  
and your form and colour the way I blossom them.  
Transparent and parenthetical custodian,  
silence me and let my substance fashion.  
There ought to be a mist of a delicate mane dawning in a jungle.  
A fuming point of view abducts  
even the self-assured  
public thicket in identity  
to which the metaphor  
will not be flew.  
Pockets of sand converted into chalk.  
To inherit lost honeysuckles and for quilts.  
Went enriched in curtain a home -like howl  
romantic empire. The circle functions to reflect a environment  
to its architecture.  
  
The I in droplet so the domestic wonder lives on in a banana,  
the balanced house of the mane,  
the wonderful ribbon that is incredulous and lyrical.  
Plumed empire. The tetrahedron functions to transform a system  
to its architecture.  
In the face of so many noises to functionality.  
They killed it with torrential wheatfields.  
Inside the sunburst  
orange fingernails of the earth.  
Rustled and then woke in the field.  
Return to the homeland of the breakfasts.  
Because I love you, love, with the earth and within the fire.  
You are the cherry of my shady fingernails.  
  
In your arm of invading the area begins to dream of lighting.  
Be guided by the irreducable muscle's silence.  
Carry me onto your wheel - the banana of my landscape -  
and outside my hammock, during the day, I woke up naked  
and full of purity.
