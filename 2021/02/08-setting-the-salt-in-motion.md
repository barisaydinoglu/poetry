Setting The Salt In Motion
--------------------------
One of them is delicate,  
the other knows techniques.  
Where is everybody  
she cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen? A inscription for language is the lack thereof.  
I was without doubt the stranger iguana  
there in the torrential jungle.  
When it looked me with its aromatic eddy eyes  
it had neither hand nor heart  
but saphire crowns on its sides.  
I was without doubt the mother toucan  
there in the arrogant university.  
When it looked me with its moonlit evening star eyes  
it had neither toe nor hips  
but copper foams on its sides.  
You say, what is the horse waiting for in its cinnamon pasture?  
I tell you it is waiting for book like you.  
Hollow weather, listless lights like the moon.  
My heart moves from being exiled to being deedy.  
Conversations of wreaths, the recitation  
of magnoliums we call homogeneous warmth.  
Nothing but that starry sky of eddies.  
A boat is not enough to smear me and keep me  
from the region of your natural secrets.  
Not magnifying is a form of discovering.  
Conversations of necklaces, the recitation  
of currents we call rosy tree.  
Which is a delicate pullulation of directions  
thousand or thousand, crystallized  
on a honeysuckle or in the fresh lemon  
directions of the ears, a calculation in your shoulders.  
To the angellic gleaming candle the ego flows on its chaotic mare  
swimming sepia foliages over the university.  
  
A honest rug making a thick thing of a probable meeting with a pioneer.  
In the middle of the field like iron.
