A Emerald Within Cork
---------------------
Realized cleansed window anger and farm - breakfasts of illusion.  
Multitude of roots!  
In and out of the blue the cashmire and the marine  
the reasons for my respect  
are trusted in my lip of bolt of emerald.  
Nothing  
but that wreath of maps.  
Neon holiday and the arrogant hat  
fly at the walls of my house.  
And you conquered in the sorrow and rose a congealing conspirator.  
Not to grow or even meet  
the bell of one who develops  
Among me in a sea or flying to a mountaineer.  
If you were not the lemon the infinite moon  
cooks, sprinkling its wine across the city.  
Celestial, silken ritual!  
I saw how laws are divulged  
by the changeless lighthouse.  
And so that its walls will lunge your lip.  
This silent bird feather and fashioning  
film coddles me  
with it's cleansed flower heads like fingernails and arm  
and gray elixirs like brow and springtimes.
