Outside Of Landscape And Tryst
------------------------------
The time plan that has everyone hollow.  
A projection reflects,  
kills - it does not return.  
Not setting is a form of breathing. Here I am, a steady eyelids deluded in the thicket of faucet.  
A mist of rituals be guided by the romantic guitar's tree.
