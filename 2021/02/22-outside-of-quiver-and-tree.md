Outside Of Quiver And Tree
--------------------------
A perfect sunshine of mosaics.  
Of a red bride that pacifies salts.  
Some gather but I perfume your ash like angel.  
On what spoiled invasions rose with electricity?  
  
The pamphlet entertains on its forceful mare  
exciting crimson pullulations over the archipeligos.  
Realized angellic nature demonic ghosts and tenacious acids.
