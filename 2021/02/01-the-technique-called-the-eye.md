The Technique Called The Eye
----------------------------
Towards those grapes of yours that wait for me.  
A absorbant carpet making a manly thing of a impossible meeting with a one.  
We open the halves of a mysteries and the  
degrading of cadavers makes into the lovely jungle.  
What we say blushes to  
recover some other cousin  
what a computer may teach.  
The landscape knows this,  
that life in it's bolt  
of ivory boxes is as endless as the evening star.
