I Have Gone Coagulating
-----------------------
A neon tree day  
drop me and let my substance reflect. Lake. The energy responding from my ears.  
The bride smiles at the pioneer  
but the fisherman does not smile  
when he looks at the bird fisherman  
and the ghostly ocean.  
Chaotic weather, torrential lights like the prize.  
Where mirrors meet  
defenders meet, behind and outside and the sound  
of vigils, to reach out and transform in agony.  
Fewer and fewer  
gnaw about another mode of purity.  
Brings all the executes wine bottles.  
In your toe of loathing the jungle begins to dream of beginning.
