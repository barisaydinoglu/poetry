The Bitten Child Of The Chimney
-------------------------------
Moon was no longer above the recording threshold.  
Of sanguine sugar, spirit  
of the river banks,  
erupted bride blood, your kisses  
protect into exile  
and a droplet of glass, with remnants of the vicinity.  
When you love like warmth reflected by the lava.  
I was without doubt the mountaineer bird  
there in the sterile night.  
When it looked me with its absorbant dew eyes  
it had neither tail nor heart  
but silicon lunars on its sides.  
  
I wish to make a line  
amid, and every sense, many  
times hidden in a kiss.  
Only movie, just the  
echo, nothing but  
it. Pencil.
