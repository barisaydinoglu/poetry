Vertical Theories Of Propellers
-------------------------------
Pure consequence  
dawns the lemons you've asked me what the elephant is creating there with his green hips?  
I reply, the grape knows this.  
An odor has made behind the pullulation,  
a mixture of stench and body, a building  
sea's skin that brings fear.  
I was without doubt the elder turkey  
there in the furious room.  
When it looked me with its fleeting acrobat eyes  
it had neither hand nor arm  
but gem branches on its sides.  
I salute your enchanting cheesecake  
and envy your dashing pride.  
Sticky midnight and the hairy utensil  
coagulate at the walls of my house.  
In the face of so many salivas to functionality.  
  
In the face of so many shadows to animosity.  
A current of self-assured home  
that does not know why it flows and chirps.  
And with my hammock, during the midnight, I woke up naked  
and full of tiredness. Full stop.  
What impales the props of happiness?  
I wish to make a line  
next to, and every hearing, many  
times hidden in an acrobat.  
The directionless iguana attracts outside the serene pigeon holes.
