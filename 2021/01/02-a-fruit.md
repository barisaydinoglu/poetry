A Fruit
-------
For lunar was disordered and morally positive.  
To the wide delicious muscle pockets of rusted nail converted into emerald.  
Not the crimson moment  
when the afternoon enriches the leaves.  
I could recover moth, lonely road, and seperation  
from aspens and horses  
with a dark flint  
with shrapnels in my shoulder.
