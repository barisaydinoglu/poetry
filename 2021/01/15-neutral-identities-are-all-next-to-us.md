Neutral Identities Are All Next To Us
-------------------------------------
Always you gnaw through the holiday  
toward the holiday trembling curtains.  
Went stored in window a heart and an arm  
making  
the vicinity.  
Around the area I like to rescue like a pale bridge.  
And with my hammock, during the day, I woke up naked  
and  
full of sincerity.  
The night transforms on its shifty mare  
mixing burnt umber warmths over the city.  
You say, what is the essence waiting for in its crimson path?  
I tell you it is waiting for cathedral like you.  
Fewer and fewer  
loiter about another mode of pride.  
There are no howls but distorted cycles of soul and silvery  
quilts of thick motionless steel.  
In the middle of the insatiable drop, many decadent shadows.  
What dismantles the props of wonder?
