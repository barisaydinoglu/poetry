A Gold Within Saphire
---------------------
It is a tale of senile bombs cashmire oxides of conglomerate,  
sand-colored seams above a violenet flower head. What gnaws the props of decency?  
He is behind us at this moment of first rescuing.  
  
Our new flesh, our self-assured poppy circles.
