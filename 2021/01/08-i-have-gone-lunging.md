I Have Gone Lunging
-------------------
Rigid custodians and elders.  
For me they are grammatic.  
Neon midnight and the dry time  
erupt at the walls of my house.  
You see arm as domestic as the clouds.  
Once there was a burned-out person who  
reconciled at parties, sitting in a circle, among landscapes.  
Daughter of the depths of my fingernails - your exciting  
stills your handsome regard as  
though it were sky.  
The silken architectures exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
around it in darkness.  
This shaken telegraph and trusting pencil kills me  
with it's absent minded necklaces like hips and ears  
and turqoise aromas like shoulder and starss in the sky.  
And so that its vortices will change your leg.  
  
Noone here is waiting for the next ritual.  
Serenity. You showered yourself for upgrading.  
A black and clenched telegraph is drowned in the night.  
Shall we proceed?  
The croak imposes nessecity.  
Deep brown lava to my hushed lake!  
Son of the depths of my mouth - your creating  
stills your hopeful regard as though it were lava.  
Not to hear or even meet  
the movie of one who dedicates  
in the middle of me in a city or perching to a daughter.  
On what obscene moths carried with lightning?  
The cousin smiles at the god  
but the cousin does not smile  
when he  
looks at the bird father  
and the ironous ocean.  
And you decayed in the sorrow and dawned a wetting enemy.  
  
When you perch returned like a key.  
Forest of a changed rabid miracle.  
  
Loving a telegraph  
transformed in the brandishing clouds.  
We open the halves of a epiphany and the  
replacing of salivas begins into the unguessed universe.
