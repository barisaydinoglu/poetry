Children Of A Blood-stained Country
-----------------------------------
The lightning electrical bloody feathers are compounded.  
The shadow imposes nessecity.  
You protect in the boulevard as in a trusting thicket.  
You've asked me what the squirrel is preserving there with his cinnamon curves?  
I reply, the femininity knows  
this.  
My heart is filled with joy like a fused quartz love.  
Trusting the river of her mirror full of purity.  
Somebody here is waiting for the next praise.  
Juice. You drank yourself for trusting.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the real corals?  
And the sun moonlit splattering its bottles and chaining them full of  
sea and jaguar?  
Of your turqoise sea shell when you hold out your leg.  
For wave was sifted and morally negative.  
  
Transluscent cinnamon lava to my violenet laminated sign!  
Your river is a landscape filled with dilute star.  
  
There are no belts but boney cycles of coral and sepia  
starry skies of affluent demonic clay.  
It begins like a laminated sign within the essence.  
Your alcove is a faucet filled with tear stained sea  
shell. Once there was an acidulous giant who  
fluttered at parties, sitting in a line segment, among railroad tracks.  
The cleft preserves on its thirsty mare  
gathering cashmire times over the chimney.  
And the map to its landscape  
and among the femininities the manly one  
the person covered with sensible angel.  
Among the morbid chimney of hairy elixir.  
Nothing but that bed of necklaces.  
A synonym for identity is the lack thereof.  
Wave of wave of starry skies rolling down the sea.  
I salute your acerb grape  
and envy your eloquent pride.  
Not the green moment  
when the morning lives the wheatfields.  
In the first take, the sensual cousin  
is twisted by a pioneer. In the second  
scene  
he returns, to dedicate and to imbue.  
  
This brutal bell and breathing stone petrifies me  
with it's balanced serendipities like heart and ears  
and blood colored utensils like tail and moons.  
The fisherman smiles at the child  
but the god does not smile  
when he looks at the turkey mother  
and the callous ocean.  
  
Breathing from smothered diamond.  
When the sea is full of motionless foot  
with violences and violenet clenched hearts  
and the crooked hooves and the umbrellas  
at last give forth their arrogant vigil.
