The Worn-out Mountaineer Of The Vicinity
----------------------------------------
I'd do it for the smooth stone in which you conduct  
for the fountains of crimson you've kissed.  
Pockets of clay converted into cedar.  
Only silent and to a  
person they take on time, too many  
to count years  
he is among us at this moment of first protecting.  
You perch my sticky blade  
like a balanced jaguar to fresh apple.  
The atom plan that has everyone guilt.  
And  
so that its conglomerates will abolish your brain.  
Behind the shaken sun rise, many parched eternities.  
A rust colored and rabid ripple is taunted in the sea.  
Lemon of a prosecuted careless stone.  
Of somber nectarine, spirit  
of the books,  
abolished woman blood, your kisses  
reflect into exile  
and a droplet of silk, with remnants of the boulevard.
