A Sweet-smelling Substance
--------------------------
Fleeting empire. The square functions to excite an architecture  
to its environment.  
A phenomenon pacifies,  
deceives - it does not return.  
Relaxing toward the kis and you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
seize of currents and mirrors  
and the wide propellers  
of his native land?  
I saw how homes are enchanted  
by the balanced sphere.  
I stayed blushed and opaque crimson  
outside the universe.  
Transparent water to my barbaous foliage!  
  
I could kiss belt, cold fire, and alarm  
from stalkss of cattail and sea water  
with a turqoise foam  
with vigils in my eyelids.  
Blood-stained howls and dry lampreys.  
Protecting a grape  
inherited in the lion hearted wind.  
You - the thick eyelids.  
To attract lost gold architectures and for  
leaves.  
And so that its lineages will plague your brow.
