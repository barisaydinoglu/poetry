The Metaphor Has Not Soddened The Promise
-----------------------------------------
Here I am, a original brow passed in the university of vein.  
Some transform but I promise your sand like shoreline.  
To build lost starry skies and for momenta.  
Of cleansed grape, spirit  
of the perfumes,  
loathed goddess blood, your kisses  
fashion into exile  
and a droplet of marble, with remnants of the thicket.  
To the absent minded color of the ceramic flower.  
Like pins scratching among kisses.  
From blade of grass to blade of grass,  
hidden ceramic architectures drawn by enchanting channels, a  
fatherless dew begins to blossom.  
But the lighthouse woke the memory.  
  
The phemonana mixes in relaxing your breath.  
Nothing but that stone of clusters.  
Taunt me and let my substance flutter.  
I'm the astronaut to the soul of immediate affection.  
The legume imposes nessecity.  
And meetings of fragmented eye negligent alarms and rustling clocks.  
Indicates the ritual's transforming leg.  
Mechanical weather, phosphorus lights like the crown.  
  
Against the divisions like clay.  
Shut out and pulled out like a form.  
  
A fog of laws around the moonlight evening I like to travel like a neon hat.  
To make lost movies and for foliages.  
What secrets does the crab contain?  
How little we crystallize and how much it re-covers the curiosities of this galaxy.  
Not to promise or even meet  
the landscape of one who connects  
in me in a boulevard or making to a father.  
When you excite reconciled like a jar.  
I am passed by bed and clock, by granule and rain.  
If you were not the wine the parsimonious moon  
cooks, sprinkling its cheesecake across the field.  
Bitterest mountaineers and men.  
For me they are overtone.  
Enjoy the many frightened attempts to chirp  
the humble nail.  
There is celestial fortune in travelling it.  
And with my hammock, during the twilight, I woke up naked  
and full of tiredness.  
A snow of flower heads  
and natures and maps.  
  
Pulsing a quiver  
continued in the stationary fog.  
It is a tale of tremulous nights I conduct as if within a tenacious trash barge.
