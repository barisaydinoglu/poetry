Breeding Steady Affection
-------------------------
Refreshing from exiled cork.  
To relinquish lost trysts and for shorelines.  
Some store but I hear your clay like springtime.  
The sanguine dignity of the mirror!  
When you transform kissed like a key.  
Our new trouser, our mineral productivity line segments.  
With its morose blossom within transparent water and cinnamon guitars.  
The apple knows this,  
that life in it's emerald boxes is as endless as the ship.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the human tigers?  
And the sunshine honest splattering its snows and wetting them full of  
night and turkey?  
Return to the homeland of the stones.  
Nothing but that garden of miracles.  
  
Of full lemon, spirit  
of the umbrellas,  
decayed giant blood, your kisses  
rise into exile  
and a droplet of copper, with remnants of the university.  
Here I am, a wide lip ignored in the field of flower head.
