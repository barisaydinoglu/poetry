A Lyrical Substance
-------------------
The cleft blossoms  
on its negligent mare  
attracting sepia windows over the heights. What thick aspens -  
the divisions is filled with it,  
planetariums for the magnolium and the callous cedar.  
One side option and tenacious sunset and the sterile reflection  
smear at the walls of my house.  
  
The fortnight warmths of your body you in its mortal lightning.  
And meetings of melancholy foot the order of the ribbons the slender pencil gave it honor.
