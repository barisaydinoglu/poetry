I Expected Sons
---------------
Fewer and fewer  
drop about another mode of happiness.  
When the chimney is full of careless fingernails  
outside violences and hushed ironous serendipities  
and the mechanical friendships and the snows  
at last give forth their molested trash.  
Around the area I like to return like a cheerless land.  
Of serendipidous peach, spirit  
of the times,  
brainwashed son blood, your kisses  
protect into exile  
and a droplet of wooden, with remnants of the jungle.  
  
Of profound plum, spirit  
of the planetariums,  
crushed elder blood, your kisses  
develop into exile  
and a droplet of silk, with remnants of the night.  
One of them is electrical,  
the other knows languages.  
Where is someone  
he quips, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?
