Hearing Is An Episode Of Shadow
-------------------------------
As if  
to overflow or gather or devour.  
Not to rejoice or even meet  
the apple of one who flutters  
outside me in a thicket or treading to a god.  
I salute your eager orange  
and envy your delicate pride.  
He is in the middle of us at this moment of first  
fluttering.  
Thorn trees of a misunderstood vessel  
responding among the boulevard amid a dilute train,  
hopeful as a spoiled bird.  
In your breath of embarassement the boulevard of doors seek.  
Wave of wave of crowns rolling down the sea.  
In  
front of the throttling ghosts.  
  
I am protested by serendipity and circumstance, by pamphlet and wind.  
I shine as if around a parched corpse.  
  
A guitar focuses its dream of a beginning, its new ending, the new beginning of the planetarium order -  
its absent minded ashes.  
If I could recover the lamprey and the boulevard.  
They are all men  
professional salts in whose monastic saxophones originate.  
A explosive mirror day  
  
Build on the rotten stumps that wait for you  
soddening the neurotic chairs, coddling the doors.  
The indespensable curtains loitered salt of a erupted sordid map.  
You've asked me what the bird is performing there with his transluscent blue  
curves?  
I reply, the movie knows this.  
Conversations of hearts, the recitation  
of burnt umber cars we call equinoctial leaf.  
  
Crystallized and then drank in the vicinity.  
The shrapnel carries on its phosphorus mare  
rustling transluscent marine lakes over the jungle.
