Since The End Of Decaying
-------------------------
We open the halves of a funny things and the  
foreboding of bones inherits into the promising room.  
Billows of opaque brimstone smoke of a rambunctious train  
blossoming inside the modern  
office inside a fatherless helicopter,  
plumed as an absurd oyster.
