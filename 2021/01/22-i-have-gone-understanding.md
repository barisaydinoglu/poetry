I Have Gone Understanding
-------------------------
Has the divisions been played with curiosities?  
Nothing but that writing of fleshes.  
My heart moves  
from being lethargic to being changeless.  
The jungle around hers  
a tale we speak in passing,  
with notions of sincerity  
and a passion for  
computer science and science  
Halfway.  
Around the region  
I like to discover like a disordered path.  
I was without doubt the god lobster  
there in the inaccessible university.  
When it looked me with its original hat eyes  
it had neither eye nor hips  
but cork farms on its sides.  
Always you electrify through the afternoon  
toward the day compounding wreaths.  
Essential empire. The loop functions to wake a environment  
to its architecture.  
The kis plagues, the propeller of profound  
trusts inside.  
Because I love you, love, in front of the lava and inside the water.  
To reconcile lost farms and for ribbons.  
I wish to make a triangle  
among, and every feeling, many  
times hidden in a honeysuckle.
