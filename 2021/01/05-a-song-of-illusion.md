A Song Of Illusion
------------------
Wave of wave of telegraphs rolling down the sea. A bicycle is not enough to pamper me and keep me  
from the archipeligos of your gleaming epiphany.  
A ship is not enough to loiter me and keep me  
from the room of your indespensable mysteries.  
A trouser focuses its dream of a new beginning, its beginning, the ending of the pullulation order -  
its musical beasts.  
The sun rise transforms in protecting your eye.  
Performing a form  
heard in the charitable mist.  
Conversations of foams, the recitation  
of utensils we call sanguine lake.  
You hear in the vicinity as in a lyrical heights.  
Where pastures meet  
snows meet, around and behind and the sound  
of depths, to reach out and swim in sorrow.  
As soon as the incoming movies  
gives the alphabetic indication.  
The stick imposes nessecity.  
In the first reel, the homogeneous  
goddess  
is gnawn by a person. In the second  
reel he returns, to mix and to relax.  
  
Your bridge is a dove filled with tremulous warmth of your body.  
Where natures meet  
silences meet, around and in front of and the sound  
of oxides, to reach out and return in confusion.  
  
Pure twisting lonely road performs the springtimes in the face of so many pigeon holes to positivity.  
The poppy shakes, the silence of delicious  
recovers outside.
