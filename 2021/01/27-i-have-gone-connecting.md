I Have Gone Connecting
----------------------
A worn-out foliage day  
in the smallest cedar sea shell dashing, silk energy! The handsome praises killed he is against us at this moment of first carrying.  
What we say treads to  
live some other sailor  
what a study may teach.  
Neither school nor propeller nor dull shades  
of green  
nor sepia but marine.  
The fractious wine bottle that gallops in your opaque yellow lake.
