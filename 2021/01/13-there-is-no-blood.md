There Is No Blood
-----------------
I dedicate as if inside a phosphorus bloody feather.  
Like hearts overflowing around trysts.  
Fewer and fewer  
undulate about another mode of respect.  
A current of fluidic light  
that does not know why it flows and awakens.  
  
My heart is filled with sincerity like a gold rose.  
So the silent pride lives on in a banana,  
the round house of the bed,  
the full curtain that is manly and vertical.
