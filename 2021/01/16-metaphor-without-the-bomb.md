Metaphor Without The Bomb
-------------------------
You see hips as sweet-smelling as the fog.  
Outside the black anger of the juice.  
Return to the homeland of the movies.  
It's a crystallizing rose of shardss of chalk.  
  
I'd do it for the shades of cashmire in which you imbue  
for the lights of green you've refreshed.  
What we say begins to  
light some other stranger  
what a detail may teach.
