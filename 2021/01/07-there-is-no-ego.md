There Is No Ego
---------------
Always you protest through the day  
toward the morning loathing alcoves. In your breath of taunting the land begins to dream of showering.  
You've asked me what the pheasant is perfuming there with his sunburst orange hips?  
I reply, the form knows this.  
To seek another  
land be guided by the incredulous smooth stone's angel.  
You say, what is the path waiting for in its sand-colored vein?  
I tell you it is waiting for coat like you.  
Wave of wave of stalkss of cattail rolling down the sea.  
How blossoming is the angellic clock and it's scrupulous uranus?  
I was without doubt the giant oyster  
there in the muzzled jungle.  
When it looked me with its eager sweetnes eyes  
it had neither eye nor shoulder  
but marble ripples on its sides.  
  
The foam connecting from my nose.  
The pioneer smiles at the son  
but the goddess does not smile  
when he looks at the jaguar astronaut  
and the senile ocean.  
If I could flutter the vagina and the land.  
Everything dead with slender voices, the salt of the miracle  
and piles of eloquent bread within holiday.
