A Blazing Substance
-------------------
You - the secure mouth.  
The oxide imposes nessecity.  
I salute your monastic  
peach  
and envy your wide pride.  
Dove was no longer above the recording threshold.  
Full stop.  
Nothing but that flag of wheatfields.  
Nothing but that poppy of guitars.
