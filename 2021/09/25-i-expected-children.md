I Expected Children
-------------------
Current.  
For  
a day, maybe thousand,  
I rested under a uncomfortable turbulence  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the woman to be next to.  
A chorus of squirrels at sunset un set un struck  
Comes to a halt before a candle.  
Strike me and let my substance understand.  
  
They drowned it with forceful precisions.  
The soul plagues, the kiss of gleaming  
pacifies inside.  
Sepia lava to my spoiled stars in the sky!  
Brings all the steals gardens.
