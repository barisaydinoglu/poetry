Color As Ghosts
---------------
My heart moves from being hairy to being steady. What mysteries does the elephant contain?  
How little we perfume and how much it refreshes the mysteries of this universe.  
A wet-winged mist day  
the lonely nature that responds in your elixir.  
  
Beginning the candle of her land full of happiness.  
It mingles like a foliage in front of the bridge.
