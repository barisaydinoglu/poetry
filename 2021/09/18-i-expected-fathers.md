I Expected Fathers
------------------
When the boulevard is full of mechanical brow  
next to imbroglios and demonic weak railroad tracks  
and the fire-tipped productivities and the faucets  
at last give forth their motionless rectum. Pure serection dedicates the curtains on what muzzled corpses showered with lightning?  
You promise in the night as in a manly room.  
  
Halfway.
