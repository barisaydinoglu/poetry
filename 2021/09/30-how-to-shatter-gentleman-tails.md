How To Shatter Gentleman Tails
------------------------------
What is this metaphor but a memory deluded of its starss in the sky? Like rabid crimson car, elixirs  
like misunderstood ritual, wine bottles  
to swim lost acrobats and for starss in the sky.  
And the flute to its jar  
and among the leaves the sweet-smelling one  
the custodian covered with plumed school.  
To dawn lost apples and for juices.  
One of them is verdure,  
the other knows cameras.  
Where is somebody  
he cries, and when can we see what  
is going  
to happen?
