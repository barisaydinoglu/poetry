How To Overflow Goddess Mouths
------------------------------
Outside the brimstone agony of the stalactite.  
Here I am, a real brain fell in the moonlight evening of ritual.  
Under the sticky pasture, many shady eternities.  
Only inevitable and to a  
sailor they take on  
time, twenty-seven years  
A vessel is not enough to shatter me and keep me  
from the boulevard of your sensible phenomena.  
You see eyelids as lovely as the wind.
