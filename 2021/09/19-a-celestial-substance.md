A Celestial Substance
---------------------
Pockets of broken glass converted into fused quartz.  
My heart moves from being boney to being vertical.  
What phenomena does the turkey contain?  
How little we enchant and how much it begins the mysteries of this galaxy.  
Fear and drop - necklaces of illusion.  
To excite lost lemons and for flints.  
I took on phosphorus doors.  
In the smallest diamond bird feather silvery sky to my imperalist evening star!  
The monastic dignity of the goblet!  
The moon knows this,  
that life in it's silk boxes is as endless as the perfume.  
And banners and starss in the sky.
