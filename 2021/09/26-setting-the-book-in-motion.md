Setting The Book In Motion
--------------------------
What phenomena does the cat contain?  
How little we reflect and how much it builds the funny things of this computer simulation.  
Realized somber fragrance of strawberry deep brown clay to my bitterest cedar architecture!  
The femininity promises in promising your lip.  
Drop me and let my substance rescue.  
A loaf of bread baked with smothered joy and salt.  
There are no graves but morose cycles of fragrance of strawberry and burnt umber  
ceramic architectures of domestic frail broken glass.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
appreciate of shorelines and rivers  
and the monastic stalkss of cattail of his native land?  
  
A ripple  
-like panic  
and magnoliums and railroad tracks.  
The shoreline swims in chirping your hips.  
The wind iridescent havocs are bristled.  
One of them is parenthetical,  
the other knows signals.  
Where is everybody  
he quips, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Around the moonlight evening I like to inherit like an acidulous movie.
