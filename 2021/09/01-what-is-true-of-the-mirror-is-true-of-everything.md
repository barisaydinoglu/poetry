What Is True Of The Mirror Is True Of Everything
------------------------------------------------
I stayed galloped and marine  
in the divisions.  
A chorus of turkeys at twilight un excited un throttled  
comes to a halt before an aroma.  
Nothing but your parsimonious breath. The eternity imposes nessecity.  
If I could gallop the coal and the universe.
