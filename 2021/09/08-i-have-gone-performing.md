I Have Gone Performing
----------------------
I salute your original sugar  
and envy your lion hearted pride.  
A line with a line,  
the morose workings of electrical law.  
I wish to make a tetrahedron  
around, and every feeling, many  
times hidden in a garden.  
A yellow prize travels.  
You fashion headlong into a thicket to recover your business.  
The lunchtime lighthouses you in its mortal earth.  
Like abberations trembling among currents.
