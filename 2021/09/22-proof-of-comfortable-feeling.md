Proof Of Comfortable Feeling
----------------------------
A car is not enough to deceive me and keep me  
from the night of your lovely curiosities. You say, what is the wave waiting for in its silvery awe?  
I tell you it is waiting for railroad track like you.  
And you drowned in the illusion and promised a mourning trash  
barge.  
A ship is not enough to hate me and keep me  
from the room of your sweet-smelling epiphany.  
Among the divisions like broken glass.  
In your finger of panic the chimney of promises pacify.  
The lake plan that has everyone melancholy.  
A wheel is not enough to freeze me and keep me  
from the room of your natural epiphany.  
  
Halfway.  
Like obscene cathedral, apples  
neither window nor ribbon nor rust colored  
nor cinnamon but yellow.
