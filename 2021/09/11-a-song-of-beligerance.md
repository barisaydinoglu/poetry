A Song Of Beligerance
---------------------
And meetings of distorted fingernails in my thicket at early light of day you are like a tree  
and your form and colour the way I rescue them.  
Everything absurd  
with equinoctial voices, the salt of the fountain  
and piles of fluidic bread next to sunrise.  
I salute your vertical sugar  
and envy your humble pride.  
And meetings of hushed eye what replaces the props of decency?  
Only perfume, just the  
root, nothing but  
it. Pullulation.  
A square in a tetrahedron,  
the delirious workings of angellic law.
