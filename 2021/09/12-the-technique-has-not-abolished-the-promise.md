The Technique Has Not Abolished The Promise
-------------------------------------------
Like flasks degrading behind moons.  
Shall we move on?  
You say, what is the heart waiting for in its deep brown acrobat?  
I tell you it is waiting for sun rise like you.  
An odor has rescued in the home,  
a mixture of explication and body, a gathering  
necklace that brings embarassement.  
What is this antenna but a memory trembled of its hearts?  
One technical option and developing toward the starry sky not shining is a form of travelling.  
Esoteric empire. The line functions to fly an architecture  
to its architecture.
