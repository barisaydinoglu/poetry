Here I Circumscribe You
-----------------------
My heart is filled with love like a saphire droplet.  
The coat throttles, the serendipity of secure  
flows outside.  
Everything forceful with round voices, the salt of the leaf  
and piles of boundless bread behind midnight.  
What is this projection but a memory deprived of its springtimes?  
You fashion my sordid scandalmongering  
like a electric jaguar to fresh orange.  
Halfway.  
  
The lightning changeless invasions are abhorred.  
And you respond like a knave and our new smooth sand, our stationary law lines.
