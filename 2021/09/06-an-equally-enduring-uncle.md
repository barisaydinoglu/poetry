An Equally Enduring Uncle
-------------------------
A starry sky living will trust  
The cheerless clay of a planet.  
Some build but I  
wet your rusted nail like praise.  
I salute your deedy peach  
and envy your poetic pride.  
Shall we recount?  
I could relinquish gate, vinegar, and night  
from roses and trees  
with a ultraviolet river bank  
with cities in my shoulder.  
Draw from it the rusted  
technique of its own point of view.  
Because I love you, love, around the water and inside the ice.  
In your arm of embarassement the area of salts excite.  
Perform on the ghosts that  
wait for you  
mutating the dead chairs, chaining the doors.  
You mix in the land as in a incredulous jungle.  
I took on wounded ribbons.
