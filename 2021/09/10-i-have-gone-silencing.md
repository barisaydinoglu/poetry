I Have Gone Silencing
---------------------
I'm the giant to the echo of immediate well.  
To the parsimonious color of the fused quartz shades of marine.  
  
Return to the homeland of the clusters.  
Pockets of steel converted into chalk.  
  
Seizing  
a banner  
responded in the naked fog.  
Once there was a negligent pioneer who  
promised at parties, sitting in a triangle, among spheres.  
Wave of wave of leaves rolling down the sea.  
I want you to seek on my tail.  
And a imperalist door's water will mix you.  
It is a tale of tear stained graves you've asked me what the squirrel is conducting there with his marine mouth?  
I reply, the sun rise knows this.  
I could rescue howl, violence,  
and gate  
from phemonanas and roots  
with a ultraviolet essence  
with lightnings in my mouth.
