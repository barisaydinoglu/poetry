A Song Of Agony
---------------
So the verdure wonder lives on in a fruit,  
the electric house of the sun,  
the thick shoreline that is lyrical and warm.  
Against the tear stained miracle, many rusted walls.  
Like panics abandoning with laws.  
You form my bitter receptacle  
like a warm bird to fresh peach.  
Door was no longer below the recording threshold.  
What poetic quilts -  
the night is filled with it,  
flints for the planetarium and the fragmented gem.  
The tree plan that has everyone spoiled.
