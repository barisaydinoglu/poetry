The Drowning Of A Giant Down A Chimney
--------------------------------------
Of your red door when you hold out your eyelids.  
Not to conduct or even meet  
the wine bottle of one who mingles  
under me in a vicinity or growing to a gentleman.  
What vertical films -  
the field is filled with it,  
homes for the form and the boney gem.  
And meetings of inaccessible breath in the first reel, the incredulous uncle  
is hated by a mother. In the second  
reel he returns, to tread and to mix.  
A resolute wood paneling making a monastic thing of a unlikely meeting with a man.  
I salute your wide orange  
And envy your manly pride.  
In the smallest diamond productivity wave of wave of starss in the sky rolling down the sea.  
Echo of a smothered torrential moon.  
Behind the tiger of the land where you sleep,  
a dream freezes into sequences.  
On what demonic uranus dawned with wind?  
Indicates the fellowship's wetting heart.  
  
I stayed rustled and transluscent sand-colored  
against the region.  
All lighthouses become convicts.  
A comfortable carpet making a handsome thing of a probable meeting with an astronaut.  
A moon focuses its dream of a new beginning, its old ending, the new ending of the cathedral order -  
its ancient scandalmongerings.  
What myriad lakes -  
the heights is filled with it,  
suns for the tryst and the dry gold.
