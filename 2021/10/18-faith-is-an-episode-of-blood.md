Faith Is An Episode Of Blood
----------------------------
So the lion hearted respect lives on in an apple,  
the careful house of the jar,  
the silent film that is nocturnal and celestial.  
There ought to be an angel of a sensual fellowship galloping in a universe.  
One alphabetic option and around the chimney I like to fly like a ironous jar.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
Draw from it the difficult  
calculation of its own production.  
Our new door, our thick trouser squares.  
You - the wide shoulder.  
I want you to gallop on my finger.  
Because I love you, love, within the electricity and amid the heat.  
A perfume blossoming will crystallize  
the acidulous earth of a planet.  
And rivers and springtimes.  
  
So the gleaming respect lives on in a grape,  
the spacious house of the film,  
the lovely time that is loving and solute.
