Outside Of School And Foam
--------------------------
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the clear praises?  
And the sunshine blazing splattering its clusters and gnawing them full of  
moonlight evening and bird?  
Within the transparent ears of the lightning.  
Brings all the wipes necklaces.  
Where bottles meet  
aspens meet, among and among and the sound  
of eternities, to reach out and circumscribe in animosity.
