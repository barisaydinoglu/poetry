Proof Of Monastic Faith
-----------------------
He is outside us at this moment of first imbuing.  
A root -like coffin  
you build in the vicinity as in a scrupulous land.  
The ribbon transforming from my fingernails.  
And a inevitable praise's lava will flow you.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
Here I am, a enduring fingernails lunged in the city of river bank.  
Troubled day and the acidulous curtain  
dismantle at the walls of my house.
