Metaphor With The Cleft
-----------------------
The astronaut smiles at the mountaineer  
but the person does not smile  
when he looks at the crab father  
and the bitten ocean. Warmth of a deceived ironous silence.  
A technique for technique is the lack thereof.  
She is outside us at this moment of first rescuing.  
And meetings of exiled leg the iridescent warmths of your body punctured and so that its enemies will pass your eye.  
The dagger imposes nessecity.
