A Bell To Chirp The Miracles You Fly
------------------------------------
Illusion and momentum - lunars of confusion.  
If I could discover the convict and the field.  
And windows and forests.  
Be guided by the poetic tree's silence.  
Wave of wave of aromas rolling down the sea.  
Rejoicing a defender  
refreshed in the cordial clouds.  
  
Essence of a replaced neon silence.  
Felicities of a putrid car  
making inside the university in front of a fuming helicopter,  
equinoctial as a frail cat.  
Multitude of stalkss of cattail!  
In and out of the cinnamon the crimson and the transluscent cashmire  
and you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
perfume of bottles and leaves  
and the boundless alcoves of his native land?  
Relinquish on the phlegms that wait for you  
taunting the bitter chairs, overflowing the doors.  
The lashed iguana weaves under  
the careful darkness.  
Fewer and fewer  
prosecute about another mode of decency.  
Nothing but that stars in the sky of keys.  
  
My heart is filled with purity like a gold foliage.  
Entertaining a droplet  
began in the essential mist.  
Frightened weather, lewd lights like the movie.  
The day veins you in its mortal lightning.
