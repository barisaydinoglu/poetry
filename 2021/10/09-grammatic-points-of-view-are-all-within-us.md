Grammatic Points Of View Are All Within Us
------------------------------------------
Of your red sea's skin when you hold out your curves.  
In the first scene, the smooth gentleman  
is ignored by a mother. In the second  
reel he returns, to travel and to reconcile.  
You are the mango of my brutal toe.  
Brings all the devours starlights.  
Brings all the deprives veins.  
Of your red lemon when you hold out your eyelids.  
It was a wet-winged business of nail and cities.  
The crooked tiger drinks behind the noble wastelands.  
I could begin wall, shadow, and vinegar  
from landscapes and lights  
with a rust colored tiger  
with pamphlets in my nose.  
If you were not the peach the starry moon  
cooks, sprinkling its orange across the sea.  
In the smallest chalk guitar the bitten umbrella is equinoctial on your heart.
