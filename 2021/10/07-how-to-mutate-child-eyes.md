How To Mutate Child Eyes
------------------------
The mirror ignores, the branch of decisive  
transforms in.  
A black and negligent wheatfield is chained in the land.  
Wave of wave of smooth stones rolling down the sea. The angellic sailor  
grows in the free morning.  
Amid the sepia arm of the wind.  
Sepia hounds of flame,  
sand-colored seams  
above a morose quilt.  
  
Awaken on the corruptions that wait for you  
plaguing the rigid chairs, disguising the doors.  
Where maternities meet  
keys meet, around and among and the sound  
of rectums, to reach out and rescue in sorrow.  
She is in us at this moment of first awakening.  
  
A machine creates,  
congeals - it does not return.  
What phenomena does the elephant contain?  
How little we enchant and how much it fashions the funny things of this computer simulation.
