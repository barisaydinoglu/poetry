The Morose Gentleman Of The Vicinity
------------------------------------
Pure trap blossoms the maps from harrowing wind to uncomfortable turbulence,  
hidden veins drawn by smooth channels, a  
fractious tree begins to return.  
And you reflect like a key and pockets of rusted nail converted into silk.  
Seeking toward the magnolium custodian of the depths of my mouth - your breathing  
stills your absorbant regard as though it were sky.  
To the homogeneous sanguine mosaic you build slowly into a heights to reconcile your business.  
  
Around the jungle I like to rise like a directionless horse.
