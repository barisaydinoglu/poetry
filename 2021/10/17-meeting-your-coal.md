Meeting Your Coal
-----------------
And a molested awe's heat will refresh you. A sun of fragrances of strawberry in the first take, the moonlit father  
is soddened by a man. In the second  
scene he returns, to return and to build.  
Not to kiss or even meet  
The kiss of one who trusts  
outside me in a room or seizing to a pioneer.  
  
And a fatherless faucet's fire will expand you.
