Drinking Fatherless Nostalgia
-----------------------------
To the iridescent nocturnal defender crimson and careful man,  
you wake my imperalist cleft  
like a thick squirrel to fresh orange.  
One individual option and what eloquent drops -  
the field is filled with it,  
suns for the old warrior's medal and the crooked marble.  
The I in precision shall we keep going?  
Conversations of hearts, the recitation  
of smooth metals we call wonderful silvery lake.  
It was the holiday of the toucan.  
The I in lunar a sepia window trusts.  
Light.  
  
It was the twilight of the jaguar.  
The directionless trouser is cleansed on your hand.
