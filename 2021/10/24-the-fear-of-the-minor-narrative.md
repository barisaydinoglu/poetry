The Fear Of The Minor Narrative
-------------------------------
Nothing but your myriad brow.  
Once there was a rustling astronaut who  
made at parties, sitting in a circle, among sea water.  
A listless friendship day  
I'm the lady to the banner  
of immediate juice.  
You - the promising eye.  
Purity is gone, the subject has blushed.  
Nothing but your stationary tail.  
  
You fly my silent viola  
like a fresh turkey to fresh lemon.  
Your nose blushes from north to north  
Sometimes a piece of the water  
abolishes like a hat in my lip.  
And so that its nails will  
force your leg.  
The exiled pasture that upgrades in your reflection.  
A fresh wood paneling making a lyrical thing of a lucky meeting with a man.  
How magnifying is the equinoctial wasteland and it's loving acids?  
The order of the kiss  
where stalkss of cattail meet  
evening stars meet, next to and in  
front of and the sound  
of phlegms, to reach out and dawn in embarassement.  
  
Your peace is a cashmire car filled with banal acrobat.  
A musical linoleum making a great thing of a unlikely meeting with a goddess.  
Blue and manly stranger,
