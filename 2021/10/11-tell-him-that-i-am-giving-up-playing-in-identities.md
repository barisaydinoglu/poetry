Tell Him That I Am Giving Up Playing In Identities
--------------------------------------------------
Your trouser is a mirror filled with fuming fragrance of strawberry.  
A chorus of tigers at afternoon un flew un killed  
comes to a halt before a evening star.  
Multitude of maternities!  
In and out of the cinnamon the sand-colored and the marine  
of your blood colored cluster when you hold out your eye.  
There are many imperfect corks behind directionless events.  
Like rotten stumps  
taunting next to awes.  
This communist affection and fluttering elixir compounds me  
with it's changeless starss in the sky like nose and fingernails  
and dark flowers like breath and juices.  
Transparent mud to my lonely lighthouse!  
You gallop slowly into an area to upgrade your business.  
Inside the wine bottle of the modern office where you sleep,  
a dream loathes into  
languages.
