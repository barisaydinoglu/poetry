Men Must Always Prove Their Homes
---------------------------------
In my thicket at afternoon you are like a garden  
and your form and colour the way I enchant them. It's a relinquishing current of felicities.  
The afternoon autumns you in its mortal jungle.  
One alphabetic option and we get the abstraction  
they must lots to drink  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but masks.  
Perhaps they are not abducted.  
A shoulder and a tail  
seeking the boulevard.  
In the smallest chalk tiger all sun rises become brambles.  
When the modern office is full of banal arm  
amid cities and calculating fuming saxophones  
and the cheerless energies and the bird feathers  
at last give forth their  
crooked wall.  
  
You - the sensual curves.  
Amid the sepia eyelids of the electricity.  
The I in film on what morbid trash barges continued with water?  
You are the calculating person of a cat,  
the silent ness of the dew, the power of the electricity.  
This explosive horse and rising star punctures me  
with it's affluent momenta like mouth and brain  
and brimstone souls like finger and crowns.  
Among the forest of the sea where you sleep,  
a dream impales into images.  
Happiness is gone, the subject has began.  
It's a blossoming guitar of flames.  
Outside the cinnamon arm of the lava.  
A train is not enough to fall me and keep me  
from the modern office of your incredulous epiphany.  
Pure shards of silicon trusts the silences my heart is filled with respect like a crystal prize.  
Sometimes a piece of the ice  
falls like a current in my mouth.  
As soon as the incoming leaves  
gives the slightest indication.  
  
A loaf of bread baked with frightened pride and salt.  
The real dignity of the femininity!
