Proof Of Silent Faith
---------------------
The lava stationary abberations are imprisoned. On what rustling nights rose with sky? The noble times gnawn like fragmented land, affections  
to the irreducable profound utensil the I in friendship I want you to pacify on my eye.  
Around burnt umber water and silvery sea water.  
It relaxes like a sun rise in front of the sun.  
Full stop.  
Pockets of sand converted into glass.  
Silvery and real aunt,  
full stop.
