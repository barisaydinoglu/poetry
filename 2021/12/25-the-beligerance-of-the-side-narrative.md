The Beligerance Of The Side Narrative
-------------------------------------
The I in grape the nail pacifies on its molested mare  
mingling blue candles over the moonlight evening.  
An odor  
has stood among the goblet,  
a mixture of coffin and body, a making  
bed that brings panic.  
Pure evil magnifies the springtimes bride of the depths of my mouth - your fashioning  
stills your velvety regard as though it were heat.  
One of them is noble,  
the other knows projections.  
Where is somebody  
he exclaims, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
  
Within the crushing lineages.  
The droplets exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
behind it in darkness.
