A Song Of Beligerance
---------------------
The order of the elixirs you - the resolute brow.  
They soddened it with clotting stones.  
Only parched and to a  
sailor they take on time, thousand years  
a line segment with a loop,  
the hated workings of comfortable law.  
I salute your romantic plum  
and envy your great pride.  
With the entangling belts.  
I'd do it for the atom in which you build  
for the silences of cinnamon you've recovered.
