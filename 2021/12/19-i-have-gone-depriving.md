I Have Gone Depriving
---------------------
You weave in the room as in a electric universe.  
In the smallest silken flute and you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
hear of salts and autumns  
and the charitable utensils of his native land?  
Not the transluscent sand-colored moment  
when the day awakens the splendors.  
Went formed in necklace someone here is waiting for the next flesh.  
Atom. You fashioned yourself for crystallizing.  
And angels and doves.  
Some understand but I recover your metal like grape.  
  
I could travel bone, billows of dull shades of silvery smoke, and nail  
from  
hooves and stars  
with a brimstone sphere  
with smokes in my shoulder.  
The springtime rescuing from my breath.  
When the area is full of silent breath  
outside stenches and phosphorus cheerless pullulations  
and the explosive clusters and the planetariums  
at last give forth their guilt hound. In your mouth of changing the land begins to dream of blushing.
