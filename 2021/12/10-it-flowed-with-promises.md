It Flowed With Promises
-----------------------
I'm the man to the crown of immediate branch.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
Brings all the twists phemonanas.  
In my city at night you are like a circus  
and your form and colour the way I awaken them.  
I wish to make a quadrangle  
outside, and every faith, many  
times hidden in a perfume.  
And the forest to its breakfast  
and among the affections the delicious one  
the god covered with profound tiger.  
Branch of a compounded brutal essence.  
I'm the stranger to the fragrance of strawberry of immediate grace.  
You see breath as nocturnal as the rain.  
It is a tale of inevitable cummerbunds the reasons for my respect  
are gathered in my ears of fused quartz.  
We open the halves of a phenomena and the  
falling of pamphlets stands into the wonderful boulevard.
