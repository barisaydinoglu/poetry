The Study Has Not Deceived The Promise
--------------------------------------
  
Develop on the extinctions that wait for you  
overflowing the brutal chairs, deforming the doors.  
Yellow jungle to my cold foam!  
I was without doubt the lady cat  
there in the skeleton area.  
When it looked me with its ancient moon eyes  
it had neither hand nor tail  
but bolt of chalk old warrior's medals on its sides.  
If I could shower the shrapnel and the archipeligos.  
I am shattered by crown and cleft, by blood and snow.  
Where currents meet  
lighthouses meet, in and around and the sound  
of clocks, to reach out and mix in embarassement.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the great droplets?  
And the fog electrical splattering its silvery cars and throttling them full of  
university and cat?  
Like pamphlets cracking outside hats.  
What is this image but a memory throttled of its lunars?  
I do not puncture in the divisions of ghostly ego.
