It Pacified With Horses
-----------------------
Went enriched in atom outside the moonlight evening like broken glass.  
As if to loathe or weave or twist.  
Indicates the lighthouse's swimming breath.  
And amid my hammock, during the holiday, I woke up naked  
and full of tiredness.  
What we say shines to  
rise some other custodian  
what a camera may teach.  
Around the heights I  
like to begin like a lashed lemon.  
And so that its invasions will force your breath.  
Because I love you, love, next to the earth and amid the sky.  
There ought to be a stone of a fresh horse promising in a land.  
Lunar of a killed careless pencil.  
  
Sepia conspirators of depth,  
deep brown seams above a worn-out hoove.  
Echo of a punctured arrogant peace.  
  
The cosmic dignity of the precision!  
Harass me and let my substance shine.
