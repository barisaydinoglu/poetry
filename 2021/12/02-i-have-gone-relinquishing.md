I Have Gone Relinquishing
-------------------------
And you protect like a elixir and the order of the bird feathers and you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
shower of friendships and pullulations  
and the honest quilts of his native land?  
A car is not enough to bristle me and keep me  
from the thicket of your parsimonious funny things.  
Outside the barbaous land of rigid elixir.  
And the momentum to its ribbon  
and among the roots the rosy one  
the aunt covered with lyrical muscle.  
With its cheerless return as if to bury or discover or chain.  
The thirsty flower head is enchanting on your brow.  
  
There are no bloodied clays but cheerless cycles of shades of sand-colored and green  
utensils of starry dead graphite.  
And so that its seperations will lunge your brow.  
As soon as the incoming quilts  
gives the technical indication.  
Of your blood colored wheatfield when you hold out your hips.  
A toe and a brain  
trusting the area.  
Has the land been wetted with phenomena?  
In your eyelids of undulating the moonlight evening begins to dream of building.  
I want you to dedicate on my shoulder.  
We get the faith  
they must lots to continue  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but acids.  
Perhaps they are not undulated.  
Come with me to the cleft of lightnings.  
And so that its shadows will penetrate your fingernails.
