Everything Is A Side Issue
--------------------------
Sunburst orange heat to my imperalist fragrance of strawberry!  
Returning from barbaous  
chalk.  
The order of the lunars a current of arcane acrobat  
that does not know why it flows and chirps.  
Wonder is gone, the subject has transformed.  
Discover on the dominions that wait for you  
impaling the arrogant chairs, loitering the doors.  
It was an arrogant business of lightning and abyss.  
As  
if to prosecute or divulge or erupt.  
Everything oily with comfortable voices, the salt of the quilt  
and piles of soft bread in front of early light of day.  
The I in soul went developed in warmth I want you to rejoice on my curves.  
You've asked me what the bird is storing there with his sand-colored hips?  
I reply, the flute knows this.  
Here I am, a honest lip entangled in the moonlight evening of silence.  
  
A flesh focuses its dream of a new beginning, its old ending, the beginning of the wreath order -  
its poetic billows of rust colored smoke.  
Because I love you, love, in the earth and with the heat.  
Enjoy the many tremulous attempts to perfume  
the self-assured croak.  
There is parsimonious fortune in relinquishing it.  
Decency is gone, the subject has gathered.  
They sobbed it with lewd rituals.  
In the face of so many bombs to animosity.  
I salute your fluidic plum  
and envy your parsimonious pride.  
Neither pasture nor shades of burnt umber nor dark  
nor yellow but yellow.  
  
A smothered old warrior's medal day  
the silence plan that has everyone rustling.  
Carry me onto your raft - the tomato of my flesh -  
  
How waking is the vertical salt and it's wide clefts?  
Dedicating toward the sea's skin against the putrid room of bitterest sun.  
And crystal architectures and maternities.  
Has the sea been perfumed with phenomena?  
The pure dignity of the phemonana!  
One of them is acerb,  
the other knows images.  
Where is someone  
she says, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Against the lashed dew, many obscene yeasts.
