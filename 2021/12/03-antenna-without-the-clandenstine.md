Antenna Without The Clandenstine

And so that its alarms will strike your toe. The stone crushes, the mane of arcane  
breathes inside.  
A loaf of bread baked with muzzled happiness and salt.  
There ought  
to be a well of a deedy mosaic weaving in a chimney.  
A quadrangle amid a quadrangle,  
the careless workings of manly law.  
Pockets of metal converted into silk.  
Ritual was no longer above  
the transmission threshold.  
What trusting poppies -  
The archipeligos is filled with it,  
warmths for the land and the disordered chalk.  
And the awe to its foliage  
and among the trousers the great one  
the mountaineer covered with free sea's skin.
