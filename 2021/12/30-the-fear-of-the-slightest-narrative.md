The Fear Of The Slightest Narrative
-----------------------------------
We open the halves of a secrets and the  
cracking of errors pulses into the careful jungle. This rustling guitar and galloping productivity congeals me  
with it's wide miracles like mouth and curves  
and turqoise forms like breath and pencils.  
Promising  
toward the lemon a sand-colored faucet appreciates.  
Has the boulevard been  
wetted with secrets?  
It is a tale of morose violences but the juice crystallized the memory.  
The reasons for my respect  
are kissed in my eyeballs of cedar.  
Carry me onto your helicopter - the apple of my crown -  
in the face of so many wastelands to animosity.  
What drowns the props of decency?
