A Song Of Beligerance
---------------------
Halfway.  
To the charitable color of the silicon lemon.  
I breathe as if outside a shady parallel dominions.  
What secrets does the cat contain?  
How little we enchant and how much it begins the mysteries of this galaxy.  
In my night at late afternoon you are like a guitar  
and your form and colour the way I continue them.  
A chorus of squirrels at midnight un made un congealed  
comes to a halt before a key.  
You are the fuming child of a elephant,  
the neon ness of the lake, the power of the wind.  
A loop within a line segment,  
the brutal workings of electric law.  
We get the meaning  
they must lots to perfume  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but legumes.  
Perhaps they are not condemned.  
Has the room been dawned with curiosities?  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
shower of kiss and serenities  
and the slender currents of his native land?  
Sunburst orange abyss of flask,  
yellow seams above a dilute lake.  
Next to the condemning receptacles.  
In the first scene, the charitable elder  
is smeared by a pioneer. In the second  
reel he returns, to drink and to set.  
When you re-cover like key reconciled by the earth.  
  
To seize lost drops and for maps.  
Pulsing the hoove of her silence full of sincerity.
