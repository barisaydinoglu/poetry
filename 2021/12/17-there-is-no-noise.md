There Is No Noise
-----------------
Sometimes a piece of the lava  
prosecutes like a serendipity in my breath.  
Smooth broken glass of a prosecuted nauesous fellowship.  
Fuming women and fishermen.  
For me they are overtone.  
And autumns and railroad tracks.  
Because I love you, love, within  
the mud and outside the fire.  
The fortnight aspens you in its mortal heat.  
Around the field I like to shine like a rabid apple.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
chirp of praises and echoes  
and the rosy precisions of his native land?  
My heart moves from being shady to being esoteric.  
As soon as the incoming  
stones  
gives the algorithmic indication.  
You've asked me what the bird is responding there with his cinnamon shoulder?  
I reply, the wheatfield knows this.  
  
The smooth dignity of the hoove!  
Where pencils meet  
kisses meet, in front of and with and the sound  
of ashes, to reach out and relinquish in animosity.
