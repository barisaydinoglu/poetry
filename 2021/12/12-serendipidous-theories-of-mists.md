Serendipidous Theories Of Mists
-------------------------------
Full stop.  
To gather lost snows and for stars.  
A metaphor for metaphor is the lack thereof.  
I refresh as if outside a obscene cummerbund.  
Draw from it the distorted  
phenomenon of its own production.  
It was a lewd  
business of juice and noises.  
Enjoy the many mechanical attempts to upgrade  
the perfect coal.  
There is winged fortune  
in fluttering it.  
Writing of a soddened pale trouser.  
  
I stayed made and yellow  
in the middle of the jungle.  
There are many stenches within fire-tipped events.  
To the domestic hidden productivity shall we move on?  
The coral entertains in flying your nose.
