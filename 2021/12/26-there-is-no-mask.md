There Is No Mask
----------------
Dismantle me and let my substance enchant.  
Like the torrential iron of elixirs the holiday farms you in its mortal earth.  
It preserves like a branch among the sea's skin.  
Sometimes a piece of the earth  
buries like a banner in my fingernails.  
Multitude of natures!  
In and out of the crimson the cashmire and the silvery  
which is a spacious awe of directions  
thousand or three hundred, fashioned  
on a magnolium or in the full fellowship  
directions of the arm, a calculation in your eyeballss.
