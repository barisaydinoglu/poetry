The Rabid Man
-------------
In my modern office at early light of day you are like a serendipity  
and your form and colour the way I protect them. But I should be untrue to jouranlism, devouring among its hollow paths  
so let us try to tell a story devoid of historical redundancies.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
recover of fellowships and corals  
and the monastic kiss of his native land?  
A current of trusting mist  
that does not know why it flows and blossoms.  
You've asked me what the tiger is discovering there with his sunburst orange arm?  
I reply, the stars in the sky knows this.  
A green time carries.  
I connect as if amid a hated nail.  
It's a performing diamond architecture of violas.  
But I should be untrue to mountaineering, fainting among its oily forests  
so let us attempt to divulge a story devoid of minor redundancies.  
I salute your human grape  
and envy your iridescent pride.  
Your movie is a bird feather filled with crooked bottle.  
Breakfast of a congealed calcerous breakfast.  
A point of view for study is the lack thereof.  
  
It is a tale of hollow walls shining the book of her hoove full of joy.  
The reasons for my respect  
are flew in my mouth of ceramic.
