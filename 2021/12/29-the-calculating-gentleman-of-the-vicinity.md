The Calculating Gentleman Of The Vicinity
-----------------------------------------
And a hollow rose's lava will seek you.  
If you were not the nectarine the naked moon  
cooks, sprinkling its lemon across the archipeligos.  
A rambunctious production trembles  
even the unguessed  
grammatic land in projection  
to which the metaphor  
will not be excited.  
Which is a lovely tiger of directions  
too few to count or million, trusted  
on a movie or in the thick tiger  
directions of the tail, a calculation in your eyes.  
I'd do it for the precision in which you drink  
for the veins of opaque green you've understood.  
If you were not the peach the parsimonious moon  
cooks, sprinkling its orange across the thicket.
