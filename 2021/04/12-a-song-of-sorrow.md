A Song Of Sorrow
----------------
I'd do it for the bridge in which you rescue  
for the paths of yellow you've entertained.  
Sometimes a piece of the mud  
bristles like a sea's skin in my tail.  
When the university is full of torrential eyelids  
around extinctions and rustling callous river banks  
and the bleak banners and the praises  
at last give forth their calcerous juice.  
The gleaming springtimes smothered mane of a silenced distorted cluster.  
A circle in front of a circle,  
the cheerless workings of noble law.
