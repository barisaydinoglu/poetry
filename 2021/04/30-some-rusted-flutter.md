Some Rusted Flutter
-------------------
Halfway.  
Shaken daughters and people.  
For me they are alphabetic.  
Promise was no longer below the transmission threshold.  
A distorted technique chains  
even the manly  
technical field in study  
to which the metaphor  
will not be excited.  
Of a opaque black sailor that reconciles flags.  
They are all people  
professional granules in whose scrupulous railroad tracks originate.  
  
Enjoy the many wounded attempts to rescue  
the moonlit wall.  
There is cleansed fortune in travelling it.  
In the face of so many deaths to functionality.  
Only raucous and to a  
child they take on time, three hundred years  
multitude of circuss!  
In and out of the deep brown the crimson and the crimson  
a mirror -like lightning  
bloody feathers of a imperalist helicopter  
transforming with the vicinity among a wounded boat,  
scrupulous as a hairy crab.  
A starry sun of homes.  
The early light of day fountains you in its mortal sky.  
Setting a pencil  
blossomed in the winged rain.  
Nothing but that flute of hats.  
  
You blush my shady throat  
like a round squirrel to fresh grape.  
I salute your self-assured wine  
and envy your natural pride.  
All sunburst orange lakes become imperfect gems.  
In the face of so many self-productions to functionality.  
Indicates the salt's re-covering hips.  
Of a dark astronaut that dawns wreaths.  
Everybody here is waiting for the next key.  
Moon. You excited yourself for storing.
