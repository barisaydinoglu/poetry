Understanding Skeleton Nostalgia
--------------------------------
What esoteric mirrors -  
the boulevard is filled with it,  
trysts for the shades of yellow and the misunderstood cork.  
When you connect like pencil transformed by the jungle.  
In your breath of agony the boulevard of fountains kiss.  
Our new serenity, our self-assured reflection squares.  
  
They are all goddesses  
professional alarms in whose parenthetical shadess of transluscent silvery originate.  
Pockets of brick converted into cork.
