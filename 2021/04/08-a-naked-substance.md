A Naked Substance
-----------------
A line segment outside a circle,  
the rusted workings of poetic law.  
The school carrying from my eye.  
A raft is not enough to crack me and keep me  
from the city of your domestic phenomena.  
Somebody here is waiting for the next book.  
Awe. You upgraded yourself for dedicating.  
  
One of them is loving,  
the other knows images.  
Where is  
somebody  
he exclaims, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
They are all pioneers  
professional bloodied ashes in whose serene maternities originate.  
In your leg of sorrow the university of bird feathers create.  
What punctures the props of respect?  
Only lashed and to a  
mother they take on time, twenty-seven years  
only river bank, just the  
nature, nothing but  
It. Saphire architecture.  
Fewer  
and fewer  
wipe about another mode of purity.
