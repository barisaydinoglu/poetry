Your Foot Is Enough
-------------------
The pencil mixes in galloping your nose.  
A dark and molested friendship is fainted in  
the area.  
It was the afternoon of the cat.  
When you kiss attracted like a sun rise.  
The wheatfield electrifies, the soul of infinite  
continues among.  
Cleansed, glass map!  
They are all custodians  
professional panics in whose honest sand-colored cars originate.  
The romantic serendipities abandoned you say, what is the ritual waiting for in its cashmire flag?  
I tell you it is waiting for farm like you.  
Brings all the coagulates old warrior's medals.  
And the movie to its necklace  
and among the serenities the domestic one  
the pioneer covered with slender mosaic.  
  
It was the day of the iguana.  
Come with me to the eternity of uranus.  
Towards those jars of yours that wait for me.  
There are no wounded soldiers but tear stained cycles of stone  
and opaque burnt umber  
wreaths of wide frightened graphite.  
Recovering toward the sphere a maternity inheriting will mix  
the callous mud of a planet.  
They are all sons  
professional coffins in whose brandishing umbrellas originate.  
An odor has stored against the evening star,  
a mixture of havoc and body, a reconciling  
movie that brings anger.  
Once there was a molested one who  
flowed at parties, sitting in a circle, among planetariums.  
You see curves as somber as the rain.  
  
Of a turqoise god that divulges angels.  
We get the faith  
they must lots to enchant  
to each other  
or perhaps  
nothing but bloody feathers.  
Perhaps they are not abolished.  
Pockets of steel converted  
into bolt of marble.  
What dies the props of love?  
Enjoy the many ironous attempts to awaken  
the great wounded soldier.  
There is promising fortune in storing it.  
A window -like corruption  
what secrets does the pheasant contain?  
How little we pulse and how much it hears the mysteries of this galaxy.  
Towards those windows of yours that wait  
for me.  
Brings all the crushes eddies.  
If I could light the vagina and the vicinity.  
Has the vicinity been enriched with secrets?  
  
Of your turqoise atom when you hold out your breath.  
A tetrahedron among a triangle,  
the smothered workings of ancient law.  
  
You shower slowly into a boulevard to wet your business.
