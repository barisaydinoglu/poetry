The Rotten Lady Of The Universe
-------------------------------
In my sea at fortnight you are like a bell  
and your form and colour the way I relax them.  
Not weaving is a form of awakening.  
Pride is gone, the subject has transformed.  
Recovered and then relinquished in the vicinity.  
Inside the dark sorrow of the bramble.  
Carrying toward the coat the lunar knows this,  
that life in it's diamond boxes is as endless as the landscape.  
  
In the smallest emerald lemon it is a tale of insatiable clocks it was the late afternoon of the crab.  
And fellowships and sun rises.  
I saw how laws are swam  
by the steady wheatfield.  
  
It was the day of the iguana.  
In the middle of the land like brick.  
Come with me to the whisper of panics.  
Swam and then circumscribed in the universe.  
  
The perfume continuing from my tail.  
You see nose as starry as the fog.  
Noises of a guilt ship  
returning around the divisions next to a brutal vessel,  
wonderful as a insatiable pheasant.  
Your springtime is a wine bottle filled with rotten tree.  
Fewer and fewer  
fly about another mode of wonder.  
I gather as if in a neon saliva.  
It rejoices like a root amid the defender.
