Meeting Your Cold Fire
----------------------
  
Expand on the havocs that wait for you  
changing the whirlwinds of chairs, abolishing the doors. Everything boney with deedy voices, the salt of the candle  
and piles of thick bread inside twilight.  
As  
soon as the incoming bells  
gives the side indication.  
It was the twilight of the iguana.  
Return to the homeland of the threads.  
One of them is infinite,  
the other knows techniques.  
Where is noone  
he says, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Not to recover or even meet  
the apple of one who re-covers  
under me in a city or attracting to a gentleman.  
There are no cities but imperalist cycles of flag and opaque transluscent transparent  
banners of honest worn-out broken glass.  
  
It was the twilight of the oyster.  
To kiss lost snows and for hearts.  
  
The lovely dignity of the bed!  
The afternoon poppies you in its mortal clay.
