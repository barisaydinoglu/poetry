Overtone Machines Are All Around Us
-----------------------------------
On what hollow corruptions lighted with electricity?  
It's a performing sun rise of circumstances.  
I want you to relax on my eyeballs.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the sensible windows?  
And the fog great splattering its farms and cracking them full of  
heights and iguana?  
Pure noise flutters the corals knave of a decayed rambunctious apple.  
Draw from it the negligent  
phenomenon of its own metaphor.  
Carry me onto your wheel - the grape of my paper-mache architecture -  
She is among us at this moment of first living. I could recover twisting lonely road, alarm, and flame  
from clusters and roots  
with a dark trouser  
with lonely roads in my tail.  
The droplet wetting from my leg.  
Went perfumed in kis hated gods and women.  
For me they are neutral.  
Within the transluscent transparent nose of the ice.  
Performing the wave of her path  
full of purity.  
You see breath as free as the drizzle.  
Sorrow and kiss - quivers of anger.
