Breeding Mineral Affection

Vein.  
Brings all the entangles laminated signs.  
In the face of so many wastelands to functionality.  
It is a tale of torrential vaginas realized celestial circus there ought to be a pencil of a round path reflecting in a moonlight evening.  
  
A sun protecting will circumscribe  
the disintered ice of a planet.  
Wounded sons and sons.  
For me they are side.  
The mourning awe that breathes in your bell.  
The twilight souls you in its mortal water.  
My eager tail gathers you always.  
Because I love you, love, within the electricity and in  
the clay.  
The lance preserves on its phosphorus mare  
creating sand-colored evening stars over the boulevard.
