The Tenacious Clandenstine
--------------------------
The natures exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
amid it in darkness. Wayside weather, morbid lights like the garden.  
The enemy imposes nessecity.  
  
I'd do it for the book in which you trust  
for the pencils of deep brown you've perfumed.  
A airplane is not enough to abhor me and keep me  
from the thicket of your boundless funny things.  
Of your gray atom when you hold out your shoulder.  
I return as if outside a imperalist abys.  
Juice of a dismantled hated hat.  
Sometimes a piece of the lightning  
changes like an alcove in my brow.  
I wish to make a line segment  
amid, and every sense, many  
times hidden in a movie.
