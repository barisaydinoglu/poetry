Minor Studies Are All Around Us
-------------------------------
Fractious mountaineers and giants.  
For me they are historical. You've asked me what the elephant is recovering there with his sepia mouth?  
I reply, the essence knows this.  
A inscription re-covers,  
abhors - it does not return.  
A ship blushing will imbue  
the wayside heat of a planet.  
A language builds,  
coddles - it does not return.
