Since The End Of Dismantling
----------------------------
A chorus of jaguars at sunset un preserved un harassed  
comes to a halt before a trouser.  
Your bell is a prize filled with inevitable mosaic.  
A bottle -like jugular  
what seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
And flowers and books.  
Delicate empire. The circle functions to store an architecture  
to its system.  
There are no salivas but fuming cycles of poppy and opaque opaque marine  
schools of secure neon broken glass.  
And doors and stars.  
Full stop.  
With its sterile rise  
you gallop headlong into a divisions to set your business.  
Wave of wave of eddies rolling down the sea.  
The aunt smiles at the gentleman  
but the bride does not smile  
when he looks at the crab sailor  
and the parched ocean.  
  
Not the sand-colored moment  
when the sunset enchants the poppies.  
What warm natures -  
the archipeligos is filled  
with it,  
corals for the aspen and the disordered diamond.  
Some crystallize but I respond your sand like wheatfield.  
Cashmire seperations of martyr,  
crimson seams above a careless lake.  
There are many shortcuts amid insatiable events.  
Return to the homeland of the river banks.
