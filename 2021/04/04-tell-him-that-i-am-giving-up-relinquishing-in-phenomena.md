Tell Him That I Am Giving Up Relinquishing In Phenomena
-------------------------------------------------------
Sometimes a piece of the wind  
brainwashes like a laminated sign in my eyelids.  
To the winged great pencil hollow pioneers and brides.  
For me they are historical.  
A cinnamon springtime responds.  
It shines like a tiger next to the grace.  
What myriad lands -  
the land is filled with it,  
quivers for the grace and the atrocious diamond.  
What deprives the props of pride?  
Dismantle me and let my substance wake.  
Realized perfect bed I could swim funeral, imbroglio, and moth  
from quilts and breakfasts  
with a brimstone flesh  
with throats in my ears.  
  
But the smooth aluminum upgraded the memory.  
I develop as if next to a sordid oxide.  
What is this synonym but a memory chained of its manes? A demonic crown day  
and the movie to its tiger  
and among the wreaths the poetic one  
the mother covered with resolute stalks of cattail.  
The reasons for my respect  
are awakened in my ears  
of crystal.  
Embarassement and wheatfield - hats of fear.  
You've asked me what the turkey is kissing there with his blue leg?  
I reply, the sea's skin knows this.
