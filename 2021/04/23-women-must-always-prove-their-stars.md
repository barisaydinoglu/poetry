Women Must Always Prove Their Stars
-----------------------------------
A chorus of jaguars at lunchtime un excited un twisted  
comes to a halt before a bell.  
A coral -like scandalmongering  
which is a resolute writing of directions  
too few to count or twenty-seven, perched  
on a jar or in the self-assured quilt  
directions of the eyelids, a calculation in your feet.  
The aroma dedicates in dawning your nose.  
Sunburst orange wind to my fragmented atom!  
Conglomerates of a smothered raft  
showering within the vicinity within a lewd airplane,  
pure as a cheerless turkey.  
The musical dignity of the grace!  
  
Mirror.  
Not to breathe or even meet  
the door of one who divulges  
in the middle of me in a moonlight evening or blossoming to a bride.
