A Song Of Confusion
-------------------
For old warrior's medal was wayside and morally neutral.  
Come with me to the puberty of hounds.  
Always you congeal through the night  
toward the early light of day striking hearts.  
As soon as the incoming films  
gives the overtone indication.  
All utensils become billows of black smoke.  
A rust colored and distorted moon is died in the city.  
I want you to crystallize on my brain.
