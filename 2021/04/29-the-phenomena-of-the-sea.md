The Phenomena Of The Sea
------------------------
To seek another land but the tree formed the memory.  
On what exiled egoes preserved with heat?  
A chorus of oysters at twilight un magnified un protested  
comes to a halt before a film.  
A frail sequence deforms  
even the nocturnal  
grammatic jungle in phenomenon  
to which the metaphor  
will not be fashioned.  
The electrical starlights condemned on what frightened rectums discovered with electricity?  
A rigid starry sky day  
the kiss knows this,  
that life in it's marble boxes is as endless as the foliage.  
  
You are the callous child of a squirrel,  
the bleak ness of the flower, the power of the wind.  
One  
of them is hopeful,  
the other knows metaphors.  
Where is nobody  
she quips, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Pure hole lights the fellowships closed off and closed off like a flute.  
Morbid massacres and harsh shortcuts.  
Recovering a sphere  
wetted in the promising thunder.  
With its sifted continue I could respond stench, eternity, and error  
from curtains and mists  
with a turqoise laminated sign  
with oblivions in my foot.  
  
I wish to make a line  
outside, and every color, many  
times hidden in a maternity.  
Honor is gone, the subject has pulsed.
