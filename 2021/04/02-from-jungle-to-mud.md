From Jungle To Mud
------------------
The clock imposes nessecity.  
The fire-tipped banner that flutters in your phemonana.  
But the jar divulged the memory.  
When you blush relaxed like a star.  
A trouser -like howl  
I wake as if within a boney billows of red smoke.  
There are many violences in rigid events.  
  
Nothing but your vertical tail.  
I want you to play on my ears.  
Has the field been perfumed with curiosities?  
A neurotic synonym brainwashes  
even the poetic  
neutral heights in antenna  
to which the metaphor  
will not be mixed.  
And meetings of dead fingernails the flower knows this,  
that life in it's crystal boxes is as endless as the coat.  
You are the parched lady of a ostrich,  
the harsh ness of the faucet, the power of the lava.  
Crimson and wonderful one,  
the spoiled cat rises among the winged alarms.  
Shall we move on?  
  
Fewer and fewer  
lunge about another mode of honor.  
All propellers become bloody feathers.  
It's a re-covering snow of eternities.  
There are no dungs but sifted cycles of cathedral and cashmire  
autumns of cosmic brutal brick.  
The aquatic daughter  
mixes in the delicious morning.  
The god smiles at the mountaineer  
but the stranger does not  
smile  
when he looks at the lobster man  
and the brutal ocean.  
Conversations of ships, the recitation  
of snows we call nocturnal foliage.
