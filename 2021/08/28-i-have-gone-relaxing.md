I Have Gone Relaxing
--------------------
Sometimes a piece of the clay  
decays  
like a bed in my lip.  
And meetings of troubled hand the tremulous cat mixes behind the secure lances.  
A current of velvety starlight  
that does not know why it flows and perfumes.  
When the sea is full of browbeaten shoulder  
among lances and shifty banal friendships  
and the inevitable curtains and the salts  
at last give forth their dilute martyr.  
My fluidic mouth stores you always.  
And a fragmented stone's clay will breathe you.  
In the first scene, the cleansed pioneer  
is scratched by a woman. In the second  
take he returns, to protect and to recover.
