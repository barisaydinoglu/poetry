I Have Gone Shining
-------------------
Shifty graves and morbid waxes.  
If you were not the nectarine the starry moon  
cooks, sprinkling its bread across the city.  
Woman of the depths of my tail - your trusting  
stills your slender regard as though it were electricity.  
Ironous sunrise and the inevitable aroma  
congeal at the walls of my house.
