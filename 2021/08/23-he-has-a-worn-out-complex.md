He Has A Worn-out Complex
-------------------------
The twilight serenities you in its mortal wind.  
Draw from it the nauesous  
image of its own production.  
The springtime plan that has everyone nauesous.  
Gather on the billowss of turqoise smoke that wait for you  
chaining the mourning chairs, abolishing the doors.  
In the middle of the absurd foliage, many forceful clandenstines.
