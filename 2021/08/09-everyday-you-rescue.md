Everyday You Rescue
-------------------
Realized humble utensil he is under us at this moment of first dawning.  
Towards those smooth bricks of yours that wait for me.  
Not trusting is a form of trusting.  
A heart and a finger  
building the room.  
  
A starlight dawning will weave  
the skeleton lightning of a planet.  
There are no lampreys but misunderstood cycles of branch and sunburst orange  
threads of esoteric morbid ash.
