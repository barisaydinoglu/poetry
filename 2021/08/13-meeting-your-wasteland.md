Meeting Your Wasteland
----------------------
A root -like bomb  
and you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
swim of stones and foams  
and the honest flags of his native land? Shut out and shut out like a mosaic.  
How waking is the noble city and it's ancient eternities?  
There ought to be a film of an aromatic starry sky re-covering in a land.  
I fly as if within a misunderstood dung.  
When the moonlight evening is full of forceful lip  
inside eternities and calcerous thirsty lemons  
and the fractious fragrances of strawberry and the times  
at last give forth their mourning clock.  
The bride smiles at the astronaut  
but the gentleman does not smile  
when he looks at the lobster giant  
and the windy ocean.  
The order of the lighthouses not circumscribing is a form  
of rescuing.  
  
Here I am, a irreducable finger changed in the modern office of opaque blue lake.  
A original fog of quivers.
