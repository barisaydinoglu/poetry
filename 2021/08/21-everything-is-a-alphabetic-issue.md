Everything Is A Alphabetic Issue
--------------------------------
Everything mechanical with incredulous voices, the salt of the quilt  
and piles of smooth bread around midnight. Rescuing from furious copper.  
I stayed promised and cashmire  
under the city.  
A synonym for identity is the lack thereof.
