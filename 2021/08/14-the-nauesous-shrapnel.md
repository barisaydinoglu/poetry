The Nauesous Shrapnel
---------------------
A raft is not enough to erupt me and keep me  
from the jungle of your changeless funny things.  
Neither mosaic nor fragrance of strawberry nor brimstone  
nor crimson but sand-colored.  
A synonym understands,  
soddens - it does not return.  
For a day, maybe too many to count,  
I rested under a ray  
of sunlight  
at a post office, waiting for the lady to be inside.  
Return to the homeland of the bells.  
And next to my hammock, during the midnight, I woke up naked  
and full of decency.  
From her shoulder and her eye chirp  
shadess of yellow of the earth.
