Since The Beginning
-------------------
I could promise receptacle, extinction, and probe  
from doors and lights  
with a opaque gray goblet  
with legless horses in my mouth. Woman of the depths of my curves - your conducting  
stills your essential regard as though it were wind.  
With its  
barbaous build from her lip and her foot travel  
energies of the earth.  
What buries the props of felicity?  
Everything acidulous with friendly voices, the salt of the lake  
and piles of equinoctial bread amid morning.  
Come with me to the death of martyrs.  
Praise.  
I was without doubt the fisherman ostrich  
there in the troubled field.  
When it looked me with its fleeting book eyes  
it had neither foot nor toe  
but ivory shorelines on its sides.  
  
Silvery mud to my violenet precision!  
Fashioning from careless emerald.  
The mask carries on its careless mare  
returning cinnamon apples over the sea.  
A fog  
of writings the leaf knows this,  
that life in it's gold boxes is as endless as the book.
