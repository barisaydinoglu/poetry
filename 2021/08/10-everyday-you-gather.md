Everyday You Gather
-------------------
And you shattered in the fear and played a bristling oxide.  
From blade of grass to uncomfortable turbulence,  
hidden muscles drawn by serendipidous channels, a  
sifted precision begins to attract.  
Opaque deep  
brown lava to my tremulous bottle! My heart is filled with purity like a ceramic evening star.
