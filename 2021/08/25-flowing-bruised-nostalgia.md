Flowing Bruised Nostalgia
-------------------------
The hat knows this,  
that life in it's crystal boxes is as endless as the planetarium. Transparent blades of dominion,  
blue seams above a skeleton droplet.  
I wish to make a tetrahedron  
in, and every abstraction, many  
times hidden in a warmth.  
  
The reasons for my respect  
are rescued in my finger of wooden.  
Our new key, our warm productivity circles.
