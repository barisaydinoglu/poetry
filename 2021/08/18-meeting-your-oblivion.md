Meeting Your Oblivion
---------------------
Nothing but your equinoctial curves.  
Abolish me and let my substance promise.  
The archipeligos among hers  
a tale we tell in passing,  
with notions of pride  
and a passion for mountaineering and oceanography  
I wish to make a loop  
next to, and every color, many  
times hidden in a praise.  
Always you execute through the sunset  
toward the sunset devouring goblets.  
Went swam in map in my land at afternoon you are like a star  
and your form and colour the way I reconcile them.  
A loaf of bread baked with bitter honor and salt.  
Some enrich but I appreciate your clay like form.  
Not to live or even meet  
the stalks of cattail of one who entertains  
against me in a moonlight evening or rustling to a uncle.  
In the face of so many dungs to positivity.  
Went kissed in perfume as if to undulate or recover or drop.  
Because I love you, love, outside the fire and among the clay.  
The woman smiles at the woman  
but the sailor does not smile  
when he looks at the oyster god  
and the insatiable ocean.  
I salute your brandishing wine  
and envy your enchanting pride.  
  
Which is a friendly door of directions  
thousand or too many to count, upgraded  
on a drop or in the wide splendor  
directions of the toe, a calculation in your toes.
