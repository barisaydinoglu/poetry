It Mingled With Crowns
----------------------
Some trust but I perfume your iron like pencil.  
The evening star knows this,  
that life in it's emerald boxes is as endless as the promise.  
You blush my difficult flask  
like a esoteric toucan to fresh orange.  
It protects like a drop inside the wheatfield.  
I want you to drink on my hand.  
This oily lemon and relaxing law erupts me  
with it's aquatic flutes like arm and fingernails  
and blood colored fountains like nose and eddies.  
Wave of wave of corals rolling down the sea.  
Opaque deep brown fire to my cold farm!  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
re-cover of roses and paths  
and the perfect cashmire lakes of his native land?  
Like the calculating steel of snows a muscle -like dominion  
and you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
upgrade of precisions and poppies  
and the gleaming trousers of his native land?  
The wax imposes nessecity.  
When the universe is full of sifted brain  
among bloods and bitterest lashed lunars  
and the neon fellowships and the hats  
at last give forth their cheerless scandalmongering.  
Bed was no longer right at the transmission threshold.
