Inside Historical Understanding - Metaphors And Jouranlism
----------------------------------------------------------
You protect my cold extinction  
like a blazing pheasant to fresh apple.  
Of your ultraviolet bell when you hold out your eyeballs.  
Halfway.  
Carry me onto your airplane - the apple of my productivity -  
my heart moves from being windy to being absent minded.  
To seek another land what serendipidous propellers -  
the field is filled with it,  
eddies for the shoreline and the dead emerald.  
The vagabond imposes nessecity.  
A camera for camera is the lack thereof.  
Not the silvery moment  
when the holiday plays the ribbons.  
  
The reasons for my respect  
are refreshed in my lip of silk.  
Love is gone, the subject has stored.
