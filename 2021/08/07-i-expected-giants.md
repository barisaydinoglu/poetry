I Expected Giants
-----------------
And meetings of communist toe my heart moves from being ironous to being profound.  
Shut up and pulled out like a cathedral.  
The windy forest is human on your eye.  
Of a blood colored sailor that discovers banners.  
Nothing but your comfortable nose.  
Discover on the funerals that wait for you  
wiping the cheerless chairs, dropping the doors.  
  
The warm threads drowned of acerb peach, spirit  
of the sun rises,  
forced goddess blood, your kisses  
swim into exile  
and a droplet of silicon, with remnants of the city.  
What dismantles the props of wonder?  
As soon as the incoming jars  
gives the grammatic indication.  
And wreaths and saxophones.
