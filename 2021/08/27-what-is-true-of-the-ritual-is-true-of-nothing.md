What Is True Of The Ritual Is True Of Nothing
---------------------------------------------
Once there was a molested goddess who  
trusted at parties, sitting in a quadrangle, among lighthouses.  
If I could wake the saliva and the jungle.  
Only horse, just the  
quiver, nothing but  
it. Smooth sand.  
Browbeaten twilight and the misunderstood serenity  
invade at the walls of my house.  
The bitterest poppy that understands in your sun rise.  
Within the loitering cadavers.  
  
The I in sweetnes and outside my hammock, during the afternoon, I woke up naked  
and full of wonder.  
Draw from it the oily  
technique of its own projection.  
There are no uranus but violenet cycles of evening star and sunburst orange  
maps of real dead rusted nail. A flute attracting will make  
the blood-stained earth of a planet.  
Of your black book when you hold out your eye.
