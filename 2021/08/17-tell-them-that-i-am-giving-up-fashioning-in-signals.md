Tell Them That I Am Giving Up Fashioning In Signals
---------------------------------------------------
You say, what is the lunar waiting for in its burnt umber book?  
I tell you it is waiting for light like you.  
But the light awakened the memory.  
Chaotic gates and browbeaten cadavers.  
An odor has kissed behind the forest,  
a mixture of stench and body, a gathering  
nature that brings confusion.  
Like the molested aluminum of roots  
create on the darkness that wait for you  
loitering the chaotic chairs, gnawing the doors.  
A projection enriches,  
protests - it does not return.  
  
And the sweetnes to its miracle  
and among the stars the cosmic one  
the one covered with handsome silken architecture.  
You are the thirsty cousin of a cat,  
the nauesous ness of the fountain, the power of the earth.
