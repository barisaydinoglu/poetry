Here I Conduct You
------------------
My silent heart weaves you always.  
I could inherit stench, blood, and imperfect glass  
from roots and  
evening stars  
with a dark nature  
with egoes in my eyelids.  
I'm the uncle to the serenity of immediate lunar.  
Behind the quiver of the city where you sleep,  
a dream wets into images.
