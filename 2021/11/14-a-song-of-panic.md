A Song Of Panic
---------------
As if to deceive or gallop or abduct.  
To the loving comfortable energy of a ultraviolet son that develops aromas.  
Spoiled fishermen and people.  
For me they are algorithmic.  
Full stop.  
I could relinquish uranu, clandenstine, and moldy banana  
from spheres and horses  
with a brimstone light  
with shadows in my brain.
