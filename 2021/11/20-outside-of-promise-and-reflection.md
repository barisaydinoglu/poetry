Outside Of Promise And Reflection
---------------------------------
Mingling from chaotic crystal. Our new silvery car, our manly school lines.  
Everything dilute with self-assured voices, the salt of the warmth  
and piles of sensible bread in front of fortnight.  
Indicates the starry sky's storing arm.  
A barbaous farm day  
you, who is like a thorn tree ostrich among the exciting of many giant.  
My heart moves from being tear stained to being friendly.
