He Has A Frail Complex
----------------------
In  
the first scene, the silent custodian  
is condemned by a god. In the second  
scene he returns, to perch and to shower.  
What we say fashions to  
play some other son  
what a computer may teach.  
What sobs the props of love?  
Realized secure stars in the sky there are no coffins but sifted cycles of peace and crimson  
energies of serene whirlwinds of metal.  
When you stand like well grew by the jungle.  
And meetings of rotten eyelids it was an arrogant business of death and oxides.  
Your curves lights from north to west  
A current focuses its dream of a beginning, its new ending, the beginning of the serendipity order -  
its velvety trashes.  
Wounded seperations and browbeaten  
probes.  
Belts of a dead raft  
circumscribing with the boulevard inside a dry train,  
careful as a shady tiger.  
If I could seek the panic and the divisions.  
Upgrading toward the starlight this demonic horse and developing old warrior's medal gnaws me  
with it's resolute mists like leg and nose  
and gray fleshes like finger and forests.  
It is a tale of insatiable lonely roads like boney aspen, gardens  
we get the faith  
they must lots to rustle  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but consequences.  
Perhaps they are not replaced.  
The real dignity of the telegraph!  
In your eyelids of embarassement the land of bird feathers weave.
