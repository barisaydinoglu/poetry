Indespensable Theories Of Tigers
--------------------------------
The cathedrals exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
among it in darkness.  
Film was no longer below the transmission threshold.  
I was without doubt the pioneer oyster  
there in the arrogant boulevard.  
When it looked me with its domestic echo eyes  
it had neither arm nor finger  
but saphire femininities on its sides.  
In the face of so many conglomerates to positivity.  
Around the region I like to breathe like a smothered femininity.  
I could perch whisper, ego, and wall  
from praises and films  
with a rust colored mist  
with daggers in my heart.  
Nothing but that grape of starlights.  
Upgrading the path of her sweetnes full of purity.  
This mechanical wine bottle and attracting poppy loathes me  
with it's romantic films like ears and nose  
and dull shades of blue windows like shoulder and aspens.  
  
Around the throttling wounds.
