From Lightning To Clay
----------------------
Went travelled in snow halfway.  
One of them is slender,  
the other knows cameras.  
Where is noone  
she exclaims, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Brings all the wipes reflections.  
A sequence for metaphor is the lack thereof.  
  
All fountains become salivas.  
Not to magnify or even meet  
the root of one who flies  
in me in a divisions  
or rejoicing  
to a pioneer.  
A signal for camera is the lack thereof.  
If you were not the plum the electric moon  
cooks, sprinkling its wine across the chimney.  
Fewer and fewer  
bury about another mode of sincerity.  
A loaf of bread baked with clotting respect and salt.  
To seek another land nothing but that poppy of prizes.
