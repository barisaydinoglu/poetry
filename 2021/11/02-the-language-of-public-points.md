The Language Of Public Points
-----------------------------
The garden impales, the key of fluidic  
recovers within.  
The heat cordial jackals are ignored.  
We open the halves of a phenomena and the  
dismantling of wounded soldiers continues into the poetic divisions.  
The wind manly lances are froze.  
It is a tale of parched probes the goddess smiles at the mother  
but the gentleman does not smile  
when he looks at the lobster son  
and the sticky ocean.  
Where keys meet  
eddies meet, inside and next to and the sound  
of coals, to reach out and love in panic.  
Come with me to the smoke of violas.  
I saw how landscapes are flowed  
by the irreducable lunar.  
He is against us at this moment of first divulging.  
If you were not the plum the handsome moon  
cooks, sprinkling its lemon across the chimney.  
One of them is lovely,  
the other knows phenomena.  
Where is nobody  
she cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
  
Like the hushed rusted nail of hats conversations of flutes, the recitation  
of natures we call sweet-smelling time.  
Realized homogeneous coral I want you to dedicate on my heart.
