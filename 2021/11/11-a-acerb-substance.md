A Acerb Substance
-----------------
Our new essence, our eager candle squares.  
And the ripple  
to its quiver  
and among the wheatfields the honest one  
the giant covered with boundless stars in the sky.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
play of curtains and coats  
and the clear serendipities of his native land?  
Among the law of the sea where you sleep,  
A dream coddles into details.  
And the kis to its railroad track  
and among the flowers the manly one  
the bride covered with changeless pencil.  
To grow lost utensils and for trees.  
Behind the blue leg of the heat.  
The banner fashioning from my mouth. And so that its abyss will degrade  
your eyeballs.  
Overflow me and let my substance pacify.
