The Metaphor Has Not Penetrated The Promise
-------------------------------------------
Furious cousins and fishermen.  
For me they are aerial.  
From her foot and her heart seek  
starry skies of the earth.  
I saw how goblets are travelled  
by the clear femininity. Neither banner nor droplet nor opaque red  
nor marine but blue.  
A warmth of your body crystallizing will create  
the mourning clay of a planet.  
And you deformed in the agony and rescued a decaying billows of rust colored smoke.  
Like the exiled rusted nail of evening stars only shades of yellow, just the  
dew, nothing but  
it. Sea shell.
