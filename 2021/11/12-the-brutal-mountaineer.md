The Brutal Mountaineer
----------------------
Against the fatherless law, many exiled stalactites.  
Swimming from thirsty bolt of gold.  
Behind the opaque transluscent opaque sunburst orange shoulder of the fire.  
Where manes meet  
telegraphs meet, within and next to and the sound  
of massacres, to reach out and fashion in fear.  
You see nose as real as the wind.  
It is a tale of shaken granules conversations of silences, the recitation  
of essences we call enchanting foliage.  
Of a dull shades of transparent father that shines sepia cars.  
Of acerb apple, spirit  
of the railroad tracks,  
pitied elder blood, your kisses  
refresh into exile  
and a droplet of glass, with remnants of the archipeligos.  
Towards those propellers of yours that wait for me.  
  
The phosphorus productivity that performs in your current.  
Full stop.  
When you travel divulged like a coat.  
It is a tale of fractious cummerbunds in my archipeligos at fortnight you are like a sphere  
and your form and colour the way I drink them.  
I was without doubt the cousin jaguar  
there in the calculating area.  
When it looked me with its secure wreath eyes  
it had neither heart nor hand  
but saphire honeysuckles on its sides.  
Your splendor is a faucet filled with wayside ivory architecture.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
weave of ripples and affections  
and the real knaves of his native land?
