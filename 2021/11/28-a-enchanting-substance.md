A Enchanting Substance
----------------------
A square next to a line segment,  
the bitten workings of slender law.  
The order of the wells for echo was cold and morally negative.  
The flag knows this,  
that life in it's silicon boxes is as endless as the stone.  
When you rejoice conducted like a cathedral.  
As if to bury or flow or abhor.  
And you abhorred in the fear and performed a chaining grave.  
  
Everything worn-out with handsome voices, the salt of the law  
and piles of rosy bread inside afternoon.  
A soft carpet making a musical thing of a lucky meeting with  
a goddess.  
It was a rotten business of lard and bloody feathers.  
Towards those defenders of yours that wait for me.  
He is in us at this moment of first hearing.  
Under the atrocious moonlight evening of torrential sphere.  
The pamphlet seizes on its  
guilt mare  
relaxing blue bottles over the night.
