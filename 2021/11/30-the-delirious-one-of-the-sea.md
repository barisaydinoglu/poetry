The Delirious One Of The Sea
----------------------------
One of them is perfect,  
the other knows sequences.  
Where is someone  
he cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
In the face of so many legless horses to positivity.  
This fractious smooth stone and flying nature pampers me  
with it's plumed awes like shoulder and eye  
and dull shades of sand-colored momenta like arm and echoes.  
Of your brimstone river when you hold out your arm.  
Rustling toward the elixir in the middle of the heights like brick.  
Neither serenity nor film nor brimstone  
nor opaque cinnamon but marine.  
  
I am plagued by school and receptacle, by imbroglio and wind.  
Went gathered in laminated sign pure ash pulses the starlights we get the color  
they must lots to form  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but deaths.  
Perhaps they are not foreboded.
