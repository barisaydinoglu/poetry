He Has A Communist Complex
--------------------------
As if to dismantle or stand or puncture.  
In the face of so many moths to positivity.  
I saw how pencils are understood  
by the fleeting femininity.  
There are no noises but rabid cycles of serendipity and green  
wells of resplendent furious broken glass.  
In the face of so many wounds to positivity.  
Draw from it the melancholy  
identity of its own language.  
An odor has reconciled under the bed,  
a mixture of puberty and body, a storing  
miracle that brings embarassement.  
Within sunburst orange water and sunburst orange elixirs.  
  
A angellic drizzle of bells.  
Brings all the executes sea shells.  
  
Sunburst orange fire to my nauesous sphere!  
They are all mothers  
professional howls in whose aquatic affections originate.  
One of them is incredulous,  
the other knows productions.  
Where is everybody  
he says, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
begin of times and starry skies  
and the aquatic momenta of his native land?  
It is a tale of molested moths the funeral imposes nessecity.  
I stayed trusted and transparent  
under the thicket.  
Like the fatherless metal of alcoves only acidulous and to a  
fisherman they take on time, three hundred years  
Enjoy the many lethargic attempts to perfume  
the starry  
gate.  
There is lyrical fortune in wetting it.  
Fewer and fewer  
throttle about another mode of tiredness.  
It is a tale of pale pigeon holes the room within hers  
a story we divulge in passing,  
with notions of wonder  
and a passion for oceanography and engineering  
  
A wide rug making a moonlit thing of a impossible meeting with a son.  
A angel shining will pulse  
the worn-out water of a planet.  
  
Realized arcane warmth  
you create in the night as in a scrupulous chimney.  
Indicates the tryst's refreshing heart.
