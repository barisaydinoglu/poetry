From What Are Beds Imbued
-------------------------
You've asked me what the pheasant is swimming there with his opaque burnt umber  
toe?  
I reply, the friendship knows this.  
Where lands meet  
lands meet, in and inside and the sound  
of clefts, to reach out and wake in anger.  
Pure imperfect cedar dedicates the pastures in opaque marine water and transparent clusters.  
The quilt imprisons, the breakfast of blazing  
enriches in.  
Shut out and pulled out like a peace.  
Because I love you, love, amid the wind and  
with the electricity.  
And amid my hammock, during the early light of day, I woke up naked  
and full of joy.  
A shoulder and a leg  
attracting the modern office.  
  
She is inside us at this moment of first entertaining.  
One of them is manly,  
the other knows points of view.  
Where is nobody  
she says, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?
