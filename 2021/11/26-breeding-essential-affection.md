Breeding Essential Affection
----------------------------
Not breathing is a form of showering.  
We get the sense  
they must lots to swim  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but cubicles.  
Perhaps they are not punctured.  
Burnt umber clay to my violenet light!  
You chirp headlong into a jungle to attract your business.  
Return to the homeland of the promises.  
It pulses like a river inside the salt.  
Frail flames and motionless salts.
