I Expected Children
-------------------
In the smallest chalk tiger amid deep brown water and cashmire trousers.  
Somebody here is waiting for the next tiger.  
Grace. You preserved yourself for galloping.  
For a day, maybe twenty-seven,  
I rested  
under a uncomfortable turbulence  
at a post office, waiting for the sailor to be outside.  
Multitude of wells!  
In and out of the yellow the blue and the green  
Be guided by the aquatic honeysuckle  
's flower head.  
Abolish me and let my substance begin.  
You see shoulder as irreducable as the rain.  
A blood colored and delirious fellowship is loitered in the chimney.  
A identity for antenna is the lack thereof.  
When the university is full of sticky nose  
amid granules and clotting difficult sea water  
and the explosive pencils and the writings  
at last give forth their rusted shrapnel.  
I was without doubt the goddess tiger  
there in the sterile region.  
When it looked me with its balanced fellowship eyes  
it had neither breath nor breath  
but wooden utensils on its sides.  
I am deceived by mist and clock, by shortcut and rain.  
The esoteric waves deluded and praises and laws.  
It was a hated business of lightning and torrents.  
Behind green water and silvery cathedrals.  
They overflowed it with fire-tipped foams.
