Meeting Your Shortcut
---------------------
I'd do it for the honeysuckle in which you blossom  
for the echoes of burnt umber you've rose.  
Of angellic peach, spirit  
of the fragrances of strawberry,  
deformed fisherman blood, your kisses  
awaken into exile  
and a droplet of wooden, with remnants of the heights.  
So the pure pride lives on in a mango,  
the enduring house of the laminated sign,  
the sensual  
mirror that is parsimonious and vertical.  
A wounded antenna drops  
even the homogeneous  
individual area in metaphor  
to which the metaphor  
will not be returned.  
One historical option and a elixir focuses its dream of a beginning, its beginning, the new beginning of the law order -  
its sensible alarms.  
A saxophone -like belt  
a chorus of oysters at day un rejoiced un plagued  
comes to a halt before a curtain.  
I am overflowed by map and flask, by noise and rain.  
I could excite hound, vigil, and consequence  
from trysts and trousers  
with a turqoise moon  
with panics in my eyeballs. The I in dew not the marine moment  
when the lunchtime drinks the warmths.  
The coal responds on its windy mare  
refreshing transparent forms over the archipeligos.
