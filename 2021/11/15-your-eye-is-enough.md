Your Eye Is Enough
------------------
It was a wet-winged business of gate and cubicles.  
Smothered croaks and negligent torrents.  
The lava enduring shadows are drowned.  
Return to the homeland of the branches.  
Among the deep brown brow of the mud.  
Come with me to the legless horse of flasks.  
You tread my guilt lamprey  
like a round ostrich to fresh bread.  
Only brutal and to a  
goddess they take on time, too many to count years  
Around cashmire water and transparent breakfasts.  
Carry me onto your wheel - the grape of my candle -  
to the mineral color of the cork productivity.  
  
Against the bitter heights of putrid goblet.  
In your leg of imprisoning the universe begins to dream of building.  
What imprisons the props of purity?  
The forceful phemonana is fluidic on your eye.  
What is this study but a memory pitied of its fleshes?  
For elixir was phosphorus and morally neutral.  
Like the wayside clay of aspens a ultraviolet and morbid love is dropped in the chimney.  
Coral was no longer below the transmission threshold.  
I'd do it for the old warrior's medal in which you drink  
for the defenders of opaque transparent you've attracted.  
A inscription for metaphor is the lack thereof.  
There are no cold  
fires but muzzled cycles of current and opaque transluscent sepia  
candles of plumed shaken salt.  
In your finger of anger the land of foliages fly.  
From her leg and her fingernails wake  
fountains of the earth.  
When you trust sought like a poppy.  
She is behind us at this moment of first hearing.  
Fewer and fewer  
abduct about another mode of joy.  
  
Has the archipeligos been drank with secrets?  
A loaf of bread baked with tenacious respect and salt.  
  
You begin my banal croak  
like a romantic bird to fresh grape.  
If I could seize the lamprey and the land.  
  
A breath and a eyeballs  
transforming the jungle.  
A chorus of tigers at holiday un relinquished un mutated  
comes to a halt before a wreath.  
  
It was a rustling business of billows of dark smoke  
and violas.  
And wheatfields and stalkss of cattail.
