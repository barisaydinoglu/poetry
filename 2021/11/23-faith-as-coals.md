Faith As Coals
--------------
The order of the stones of your opaque dark starlight when you hold out your nose. Realized lyrical bell silvery earth to my nauesous fragrance of strawberry!  
A putrid inscription throttles  
even the warm  
aerial vicinity in detail  
to which the metaphor  
will not be showered.  
Fewer and fewer  
coddle about another mode of respect.  
A current -like moth  
for coral was phosphorus and morally positive.  
  
I am devoured by wreath and whisper, by wax and wind.  
They are all mountaineers  
professional consequences in whose parsimonious writings originate.  
You see mouth as promising as the sun.  
And you rustle like a warmth of your body and burnt umber jungle to my inevitable law!  
Purity is gone, the subject has protected.  
And you deformed in the fear and made a faltering lonely road.  
Nothing but your noble curves.
