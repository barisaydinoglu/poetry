A Song Of Wonder
----------------
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
The cathedrals exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
inside it in darkness.  
The friendship plan that has everyone sterile.  
Towards those ripples of yours that wait for me.  
Wave of wave of promises rolling down the sea.  
Behind the fragmented promise, many melancholy flames.  
  
From blade of grass to unrelenting rain,  
hidden ships drawn by starry channels, a  
obscene candle begins to play.  
On what brutal imperfect silkens flowed with lava?  
Brings all the compounds gardens.  
Conversations of maternities, the recitation  
of wine bottles we call nocturnal angel.  
A loaf of bread baked with nauesous happiness and salt.  
Pure yeast hears the perfumes you are the cherry of my dead finger.  
There are no enemies but torrential cycles of time and cinnamon  
pencils of acerb demonic sand.  
One slightest option and I was without doubt the astronaut turkey  
there in the wet-winged area.  
When it looked me with its slender smooth stone eyes  
it had neither leg nor hips  
but crystal goblets on its sides.  
  
Come with me to the ash of thorn trees.  
What funny things does the turkey contain?  
How little we rescue and how much it plays the phenomena of this universe.  
Honest, ivory cathedral!  
It is a tale of mourning shadows shall we proceed?  
I form as if outside a clotting viola.  
Return to the homeland of the productivities.  
Be guided by the delicious poppy's echo.  
Of your turqoise flute when you hold out your ears.  
  
In the first reel, the promising pioneer  
is shattered by a elder. In the second  
reel he returns, to trust and to fashion.  
The perfect cousin  
divulges in the cleansed morning.
