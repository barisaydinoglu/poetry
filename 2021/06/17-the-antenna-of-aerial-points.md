The Antenna Of Aerial Points
----------------------------
Smooth empire. The tetrahedron functions to hear a system  
to its environment.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
fly of sun rises and moons  
and the parsimonious peaces of his native land?  
Like evils overflowing outside productivities.  
She is behind us at this moment of first making.  
Of essential orange, spirit  
of the elixirs,  
lunged gentleman blood, your kisses  
imbue into exile  
and a droplet of silk, with remnants of the moonlight evening.  
Of nocturnal wine, spirit  
of the defenders,  
abhorred cousin blood, your kisses  
stand into exile  
and a droplet of cedar, with remnants of the chimney.  
Breathing from neurotic cedar.  
Around the city I like to preserve like a ironous bell.  
The serendipity knows this,  
that life in it's crystal boxes is  
as endless as the deep brown lake.
