Since The Beginning Of Trembling
--------------------------------
Our new landscape, our wonderful garden lines.  
So the stationary happiness lives on in a fruit,  
the lyrical house of the promise,  
the infinite wave that is poetic and charitable.  
Wave of wave of momenta rolling down the sea.  
A quiver wetting will travel  
the chaotic ice of a planet.  
Fewer and fewer  
abduct about another mode of honor.
