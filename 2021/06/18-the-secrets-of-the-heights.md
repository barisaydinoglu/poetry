The Secrets Of The Heights
--------------------------
We get the meaning  
they must lots to flutter  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but pins.  
Perhaps they are not coddled. Burnt umber consequences of wasteland,  
transluscent opaque silvery seams above a callous breakfast.  
Abberations of a tenacious airplane  
upgrading within the room with a morose vessel,  
steady as a disintered pheasant.  
It perches like a sun in the knave.  
It's a re-covering bird feather of utensils.  
A current of sensible crown  
that does not know why it flows and weaves.  
Protecting toward the energy inside the moonlight evening like rusted nail.  
And next to my hammock, during the twilight, I woke up naked  
and full of tiredness.  
For a day, maybe twenty-seven,  
I rested under a blade of grass  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the astronaut to be among.
