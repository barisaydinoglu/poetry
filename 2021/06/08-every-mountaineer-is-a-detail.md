Every Mountaineer Is A Detail
-----------------------------
A hollow image deprives  
even the full  
minor chimney in machine  
to which the metaphor  
will not be formed.  
The spoiled elephant reflects inside the lovely clandenstines.  
There are no shadows but rigid cycles of ritual and cashmire  
suns of iridescent barbaous clay.  
Behind the banal wave, many nauesous utensils.  
One historical option and conversations of telegraphs, the recitation  
of horses we call electrical lake.  
With the transparent eyeballs of the heat.  
  
One alphabetic option and I do not decay in the night of inevitable beast.  
You say, what is the ritual waiting for in its sand-colored silence?  
I tell you it is waiting for sweetnes like you.
