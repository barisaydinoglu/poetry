The Sorrow Of The Individual Narrative
--------------------------------------
A transluscent marine defender flies.  
Fewer and fewer  
taunt about another mode of respect.  
I salute your warm lemon  
and envy your serene pride.  
Pulsing the landscape of her angel full of sincerity.  
Your eyelids carries from south to north  
I salute your natural sugar  
and envy your deedy pride.
