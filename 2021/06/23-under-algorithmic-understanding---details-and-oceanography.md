Under Algorithmic Understanding - Details And Oceanography

And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
trust of tigers and planetariums  
and the cosmic muscles of his native land?  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
mingle of friendships and clusters  
and the clear circuss of his native land?  
Sunburst orange electricity to my spoiled drop!  
To seek another land a chorus of ostriches at afternoon un showered un deprived  
comes to a halt before a praise.  
Freeze me  
and let my substance imbue.  
A chorus of cats at morning un heard un decayed  
comes to a halt before a wreath.  
  
It was  
a fuming business of vagina and utensils.  
Outside the foreboding clandenstines.  
Custodian of the depths of my tail - your magnifying  
stills your stationary regard as though it were jungle.  
Of trusting cheesecake, spirit  
of the railroad tracks,  
chained cousin blood, your kisses  
blush into exile  
and a droplet of silken, with remnants of the archipeligos.  
Shaken afternoon and the lethargic necklace  
devour at the walls of my house.  
Around the boulevard I like to continue like a whirlwinds of defender.  
You, who is like a rectum elephant among the growing of many father.
