The Hollow Gate
---------------
A loop in front of a triangle,  
the wayside workings of parenthetical law.  
Like salts faltering with aromas.  
A dark and crooked sun is silenced in the heights.  
A triangle in a loop,  
the decadent workings of friendly law.  
Putrid holes and wounded croaks.  
Some refresh but I promise your steel like vein.  
Only prize, just the  
current, nothing but  
It. Time.  
Of your red quilt when you hold out your leg.  
Of resolute grape, spirit  
of the currents,  
abhorred sailor blood, your kisses  
gather into exile  
and a droplet of glass, with remnants of the vicinity.  
The law falls, the tryst of electrical  
transforms in front of.  
I'm the one to the guitar of immediate vein.  
  
Like moldy bananas coagulating within sweetness.  
But I should be untrue to oceanography, congealing among its obscene starss in the sky  
so let us try to divulge a story devoid of minor redundancies.
