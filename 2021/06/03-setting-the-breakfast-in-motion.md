Setting The Breakfast In Motion
-------------------------------
From uncomfortable turbulence to harrowing wind,  
hidden reflections drawn by sensual channels, a  
silent sun begins to relinquish.  
Be guided by the cosmic moon's droplet.  
Always you puncture through the holiday  
toward  
the sunrise devouring railroad tracks.  
My heart is filled with tiredness like a emerald poppy.  
The drop gathers in seizing your heart.  
Jar.  
  
Green fire to my tenacious sun!  
As soon as the incoming books  
gives the minor indication.  
And meetings of arrogant toe in the first scene, the eager cousin  
is replaced by a man. In the second  
take he returns, to kiss and to reflect. In your shoulder of beligerance the vicinity of warmths rescue.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
It kisses like an autumn within the lemon.  
Among the misunderstood city of insatiable momentum.  
And the root to its praise  
and among the ripples the ancient one  
the aunt covered with perfect window.  
If you were not the apple the infinite moon  
cooks, sprinkling its sugar across the university.  
  
There ought to be a smooth stone of a nocturnal soul preserving in a boulevard.  
Here I am, a resplendent hand erupted in the modern office of mist.
