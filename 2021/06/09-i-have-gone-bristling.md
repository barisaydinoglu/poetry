I Have Gone Bristling
---------------------
The reasons for my respect  
Are developed in my fingernails of gem.  
And a careless leaf's sky will trust you.  
Perching the window of her bell full of sincerity.  
Carry me onto your boat - the banana of my grace -  
a momentum waking will travel  
the cold ice of a planet.  
Abolish me and let my substance build.  
We get the color  
they must lots to relinquish  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but howls.  
Perhaps they are not electrified.  
Like the dead iron of femininities it was a pale business of stain and eternities.  
It was a furious business of shadow and complaints.  
In the first take, the honest astronaut  
is deceived by a sailor. In the second  
take he returns, to play and to stand.  
To the full wonderful smooth stone in the first scene, the gleaming lady  
is foreboded by a person. In the second  
scene he returns, to crystallize and to create.  
I saw how landscapes  
are understood  
by the steady garden.  
One of them is smooth,  
the other knows techniques.  
Where is noone  
she exclaims, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Equinoctial, diamond leaf!  
  
Shut out and closed off like a hoove.  
The irreducable sailor  
protects in the serendipidous morning.
