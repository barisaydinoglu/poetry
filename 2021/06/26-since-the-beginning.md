Since The Beginning
-------------------
Phosphorus fishermen and sons.  
For me they are alphabetic. Outside burnt umber water and sand-colored moons.  
All veins become granules.  
The cheerless elephant seeks outside the electric funerals.  
Here I am, a lovely leg devoured in the night of crown.  
I was without  
doubt the goddess iguana  
There in the phosphorus university.  
When it looked me with its absent minded bell eyes  
it had neither ears nor lip  
but bolt of glass currents on its sides.
