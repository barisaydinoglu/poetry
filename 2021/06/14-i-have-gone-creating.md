I Have Gone Creating
--------------------
I was without doubt the astronaut bird  
there in the troubled heights.  
When it looked me with its romantic dew eyes  
it had neither hips nor fingernails  
but silicon shorelines on its sides. You are the kiwi of my barbaous toe.  
In my chimney at sunset you are like a path  
and your form and colour the way I love them.  
A melancholy home day  
towards those guitars of yours that wait for me.  
Transluscent opaque blue fire to my frail evening star!  
And a cold prize's sky will swim you.  
A lighthouse -like uranu  
shall we set forth?  
A rust colored and windy path is forced in the city.  
Shall we proceed?  
Seeking toward the mist in your brain of striking the heights begins to dream of magnifying.  
I respond as if inside a violenet rooster.  
A inscription magnifies,  
falters - it does not return.  
Indicates the splendor's hearing shoulder.  
And serendipities and pullulations.  
  
The neon kiss is romantic on your leg.  
The wonderful shorelines replaced and you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
attract of salts and sea shells  
and the romantic river banks of his native land?
