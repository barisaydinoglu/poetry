The Agony Of The Algorithmic Narrative
--------------------------------------
What is this phenomenon but a memory abducted of its awes?  
So the unguessed respect lives on in a mango,  
the thick house of the leaf,  
the mineral awe that is humble and silent.  
A detail for sequence is the lack thereof.  
A sepia evening  
star connects.  
The clear miracle gave it decency.
