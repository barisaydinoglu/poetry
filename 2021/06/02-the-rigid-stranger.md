The Rigid Stranger
------------------
And the candle to its peace  
and among the sun rises the loving one  
the fisherman covered  
with great tree.  
Neither phemonana nor mosaic nor gray  
nor silvery but transparent.  
Marine mud to my mourning tiger!  
You love slowly into a moonlight evening to form your business.  
Reconcile on the yeasts that wait for you  
pitying the barbaous chairs, silencing the doors.  
Halfway.  
Not to pacify or even meet  
the flute of one who upgrades  
inside me in an area or treading to a one.
