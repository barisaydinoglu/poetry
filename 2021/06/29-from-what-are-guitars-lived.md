From What Are Guitars Lived
---------------------------
The bride smiles at the fisherman  
but the son does not smile  
when he looks at the iguana goddess  
and the rusted ocean.  
Everybody here is waiting for the next hoove.  
Flower head. You appreciated yourself for magnifying.  
Nothing but your esoteric leg.  
The scrupulous bride  
trusts in the balanced morning.  
Imperalist daughters and ladies.  
For me they are grammatic.  
Our new atom, our iridescent star quadrangles.  
In my university at holiday you are like a splendor  
and your form and colour the way I expand them.  
Brings all the falls times.  
You, who is like a thorn tree elephant among the forming of many pioneer.  
Shall we recount?  
I want you to relinquish on my ears.  
You are the fruit of my pale brain.  
It's an attracting tree of massacres.  
In the area like steel.  
  
Around the region I like to dedicate like a directionless awe.  
A wheel is not enough to drown me and keep me  
from the region of your promising secrets.  
Not to wet or even meet  
the well of one who treads  
among me in a chimney or waking to a man.  
You are the tomato of my boney arm.  
I wish to make a square  
outside, and every faith, many  
times hidden in a salt.  
As if to harass or swim or fly.  
One of them is vertical,  
the other knows sequences.  
Where is someone  
he quips, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
And within my hammock, during the lunchtime, I woke up naked  
and full of honor.  
But the drop upgraded the memory.  
To the changeless color of the bolt of glass propeller.  
Of your black form when you hold out your eye.  
  
Like clenched ritual, railroad tracks  
I stayed blushed and marine  
behind the land.  
Like oblivions attacking behind crowns.
