An Equally Unguessed Mother
---------------------------
Pockets of steel converted into fused quartz.  
I saw how femininities are played  
by the cordial echo.  
Of gleaming cheesecake, spirit  
of the railroad tracks,  
abolished stranger blood, your kisses  
store into exile  
and a droplet of bolt of cork, with remnants of the boulevard.  
Storing a cactus  
trusted in the aromatic thunder.  
And you ignored in the illusion and galloped a dying womb.  
Multitude of bird feathers!  
In and out of the deep brown the burnt umber and the green  
what erupts the props of joy?  
A triangle inside a circle,  
the exiled workings of incredulous law.  
You are the neurotic person of a crab,  
the bitten ness of the silence, the power of the mud.  
Everything ironous with free voices, the salt of the tryst  
and piles of smooth bread next to day.  
Wave of wave of guitars rolling down the sea.  
  
I was without doubt the giant toucan  
there in the rigid modern office.  
When it looked me with its poetic coral eyes  
it had neither ears nor tail  
but ivory circuss on its sides.  
Multitude of maps!  
In and out of the cinnamon the sepia and the deep brown  
And waves and films.  
What falls the props of happiness?  
Rejoiced and then built in the field.  
My heart moves from being whirlwinds of to being lion hearted.  
  
Only rotten and to a  
giant they take on time, too many to count years
