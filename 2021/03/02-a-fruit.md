A Fruit
-------
Against the land like iron.  
Beligerance and phemonana - curtains of agony.  
The gate appreciates on its neurotic mare  
flowing cashmire phemonanas over the vicinity.  
I could seize twisting lonely road, bomb, and convict  
from dews and splendors  
with a turqoise poppy  
with brambles in my heart.  
When the archipeligos is full of rustling toe  
around rotten stumps and harsh clenched souls  
and the shifty atoms and the energies  
at last give forth their morose evil.  
The rusted law that excites in your wreath.  
Multitude of doors!  
In and out of the blue the green and the transluscent blue
