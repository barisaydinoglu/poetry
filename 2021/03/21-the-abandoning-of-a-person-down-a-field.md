The Abandoning Of A Person Down A Field
---------------------------------------
Of your black tryst when you hold out your breath.  
The shifty breakfast is smooth on your brain.  
Panic and lighthouse - flutes of animosity.  
Fashioning a movie  
heard  
in the esoteric fog.  
So the profound tiredness lives on in a tomato,  
the homogeneous house of the quilt,  
the free window that is natural and scrupulous.  
Crimson receptacles of uranu,  
transluscent blue seams above a listless alcove.  
Once there was a bitten aunt who  
protected at parties, sitting in a triangle, among poppies.  
A loaf of bread baked with shifty tiredness and salt.  
Like silent propeller, hats  
outside the ritual of the vicinity where you sleep,  
a dream chains into images.  
A lake -like wound  
nothing but your infinite fingernails.  
Formed and then mixed in the city.  
Indicates the foliage's waking toe.  
The maternity kisses in protecting your hips.  
Your breath inherits from east to west  
  
Making a sea shell  
trod in the naked fog.  
Realized original river a rustling inscription rejects  
even the real  
neutral moonlight evening in phenomenon  
to which the metaphor  
will not be  
circumscribed.
