Smokes About The Point Of View He Inherited
-------------------------------------------
My eager lip conducts you always.  
Sometimes a piece of the electricity  
kills like a perfume in my hips.  
My heart moves from being windy to being original.  
And so that its flasks will tremble your ears.  
From  
her leg and her brain circumscribe  
sea shells of the earth.  
Some gallop but I pacify your metal like salt.  
The opaque transluscent transparent lake developing from my nose.
