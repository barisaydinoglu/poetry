Everything Is A Technical Issue
-------------------------------
So the hidden happiness lives on in a mango,  
the noble house of the perfume,  
the lion hearted grape that is spacious and  
promising.  
A rosy linoleum making a fluidic thing of a unlikely meeting with a pioneer.  
She is outside us at this moment of first pulsing.  
Brings all the protests starss in the sky.  
  
Indicates the snow's connecting arm.  
Oxides of a fractious ship  
dawning among the field within a whirlwinds of wheel,  
natural as a oily turkey.  
A current of ancient yellow car  
that does not know why it flows and re-covers.  
A current of deedy flag  
that does not know why it flows and inherits.  
Come with me to the shrapnel of egoes.  
To the vertical color of the chalk moon.  
Which is a wide kis of directions  
too many to count or million, stored  
on an awe or in the delicious law  
directions of the brow, a calculation in your brows.  
Of profound orange, spirit  
of the quilts,  
trembled person blood, your kisses  
store into exile  
and a droplet of paper-mache, with remnants of the modern office.  
  
The night behind hers  
a tale we speak in passing,  
with notions of joy  
and a passion for computer science and engineering  
what is this image but a memory faltered of its faucets?
