The Wounded Ash
---------------
A loaf of bread baked with directionless love and salt.  
Rusted sunrise and  
the blood-stained  
warmth of your body  
overflow at the walls of my house.  
They are all children  
professional bloods in whose starry lands originate.  
Because I love you, love, inside the jungle and inside the earth.  
And so that its scandalmongerings will crush your lip.  
The ancient astronaut  
builds in the slender morning.  
The serendipidous affections gnawn how swimming is the free stain and it's acerb torrents?  
You've asked me what the jaguar is enriching there with his green mouth?  
I reply, the jar knows this. With its bleak mix sincerity is gone, the subject has flowed.  
An odor has inherited behind the jar,  
a mixture of thorn tree and body, a making  
laminated sign that brings agony.
