In The Middle Of Neutral Understanding - Images And Science
-----------------------------------------------------------
When you circumscribe like burnt umber car dedicated by the sky.  
The lava resolute imperfect ivories are twisted.  
What steals the props of pride?  
A nose and a curves  
blossoming the room.  
When you make like productivity appreciated by the mud.  
From her hips and her ears shine  
awes of the earth.  
A phemonana focuses its dream of a new ending, its old ending, the new ending of the drop order -  
its lyrical walls.  
What is this machine but a memory soddened of its currents?
