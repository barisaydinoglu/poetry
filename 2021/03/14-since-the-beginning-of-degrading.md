Since The Beginning Of Degrading
--------------------------------
Fewer and fewer  
ignore about another mode of love.  
A chorus of cats at afternoon un connected un harassed  
comes to a halt before a bottle.  
Bleak twilight and the exiled branch  
smother at the walls of my house.  
A image stands,  
faints - it does not return.  
He is inside us at this moment of first returning.  
Draw from it the rusted  
camera of its own phenomenon.  
In the face of so many corpses to functionality.  
And you blush like an angel and sometimes a piece of the lava  
dies like an awe in my mouth.  
  
Resolute, gem smooth iron!  
It creates like a warmth within the foliage.  
  
Among the misunderstood precision, many silent vagabonds.
