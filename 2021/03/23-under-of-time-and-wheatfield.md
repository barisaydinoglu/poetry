Under Of Time And Wheatfield
----------------------------
Behind the deep brown toe of the lava. I'd do it for the smooth brick in which you awaken  
for the aromas of yellow you've recovered.  
He is inside us at this moment of first blossoming.  
A inscription for study is the lack thereof.  
It's a chirping book of imbroglios.  
Crimson fire to my clenched river!  
The ice serene cities are sobbed.  
  
A autumn focuses its dream of a ending, its old ending, the ending of the perfume order -  
its eager oblivions.  
The enduring dignity of the maternity!  
You've asked me what the turkey is chirping there with his green eye?  
I reply, the fountain knows this.  
And the starlight to its hoove  
and among the stalkss of cattail the balanced one  
the gentleman covered with incredulous flint.
