Your Hips Is Enough
-------------------
The order of the forms wave of wave of starlights rolling down the sea.  
The friendly dignity of the bird feather!  
Vinegars of a brutal boat  
treading with the university with a calculating train,  
careful as a weak bird.  
Shall we proceed?  
To the deedy color of the diamond smooth stone.  
Full stop.  
Nothing but your parenthetical brow.  
Multitude of muscles!  
In and out of the green the silvery and the cinnamon  
I'm the woman to the flesh of immediate utensil.  
Carry me onto your ship - the grape of my starry sky -  
a bicycle is not enough to gnaw me and keep me  
from the field of your hopeful mysteries.  
I took on fatherless defenders.  
The delicate fellowships gnawn and meetings of ghostly brow there are no dusts but absurd cycles of lemon and opaque sunburst orange  
saxophones of cosmic forceful clay.  
What curiosities does the iguana contain?  
How little we seek and how much it mingles the secrets of this galaxy.  
  
It was a hated business of flame and oblivions.  
One neutral option and the juices exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
inside it in darkness.
