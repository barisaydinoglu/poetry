Mountaineers Of A Neon Country
------------------------------
When you refresh like warmth of your body flew by the electricity.  
Of your gray  
magnolium when you hold out your eye.  
A rustling land day  
imbroglios of a morbid wheel  
fashioning in front of the thicket outside a phosphorus train,  
friendly as a lethargic iguana.  
When the night is full of molested eyelids  
within conspirators and rambunctious calcerous propellers  
and the bitten farms and the aspens  
at last give forth their lethargic explication.  
I want you to flutter on my curves.  
Sand-colored legless horses of heart,  
opaque cashmire seams above a fragmented well.  
  
You are the tomato of my parched eyeballs.  
Always you devour through the sunset  
toward the late afternoon deceiving wine bottles.
