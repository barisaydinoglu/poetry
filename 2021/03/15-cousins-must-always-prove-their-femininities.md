Cousins Must Always Prove Their Femininities
--------------------------------------------
Like the lethargic brick of mosaics blue and fresh god,  
conversations of eddies, the recitation  
of praises we call lyrical tryst.  
I do not drown in the region of weak invasion.  
In your eyeballs of devouring the land begins to dream of enchanting.  
Be guided by the balanced foliage's sea water.  
The cleansed form gave it wonder.  
You recover headlong into a boulevard to excite your business.  
You divulge in the universe as in a boundless universe.  
As soon as the incoming ripples  
gives the aerial indication.  
My self-assured shoulder responds you always.  
  
It was the fortnight of the iguana.  
If you were not  
the plum the eager moon  
cooks, sprinkling its sugar across the city.  
To seek another land not to refresh or even meet  
the tryst of one who hears  
among me in a university or responding to a giant.  
  
It was the night of the bird.  
Sincerity is gone, the subject has enriched.
