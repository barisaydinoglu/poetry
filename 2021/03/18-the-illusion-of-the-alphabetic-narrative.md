The Illusion Of The Alphabetic Narrative
----------------------------------------
Amid opaque burnt umber water and transparent fountains.  
The movie connects in chirping your shoulder.  
Pockets of ash converted into crystal.  
Cheerless weather, mourning lights like the transparent car.  
The resplendent dignity of the fragrance of strawberry!  
The man smiles at the sailor  
but the pioneer does not smile  
when he looks at the oyster woman  
and the hairy ocean.  
A vein -like pigeon hole  
expanding a sun  
pacified in the slender sunshine.
