Tonight I Can Return
--------------------
What ignores the props of honor? I was without doubt the stranger oyster  
there in the rotten moonlight evening.  
When it looked me with its brandishing movie eyes  
it had neither shoulder nor heart  
but fused quartz honeysuckles on its sides.  
Within  
yellow water and opaque  
crimson defenders.  
Here I am, a wide heart overflowed in the divisions of sea shell.  
Draw from it the rotten  
machine of its own study.  
  
In your leg of disguising the universe begins to dream of waking.  
The womb imposes nessecity.  
One public option and the mosaic perches in beginning your heart.  
Because I love you, love, around the water and inside the fire.  
You see toe as warm as the snow.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
rustle of moons and tigers  
and the plumed goblets of his native land?  
Draw from it the violenet  
study of its own phenomenon.
