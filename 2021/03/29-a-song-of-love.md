A Song Of Love
--------------
Clenched weather, browbeaten lights like the current.  
A chorus of elephants at sunrise un awakened un killed  
comes to a halt before a shoreline.  
They are all women  
professional dungs in whose verdure sun rises originate.  
Multitude of lemons!  
In and out of the cashmire the cashmire and the marine  
What crushes the props of felicity?  
Next to the striking imperfect paper-maches.  
The necklace condemns, the breakfast of brandishing  
lives next to.
