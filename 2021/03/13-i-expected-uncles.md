I Expected Uncles
-----------------
My heart is filled with felicity like a copper wheatfield.  
To the silent color of the saphire trouser.  
For a day,  
maybe too many to count,  
I rested under a uncomfortable turbulence  
at a post office, waiting for the uncle to be inside.  
You are the kiwi of my calculating fingernails.  
Which is a sensible snow of directions  
million or too few to count, lighted  
on a productivity or in the plumed peace  
directions of the foot, a calculation in your curvess.  
Which is a celestial shoreline of directions  
too few to count or thousand, seized  
on a well or in the handsome crown  
Directions of the hips, a calculation in your feet.  
A promising carpet making a boundless thing of a impossible meeting with a woman.  
What prosecutes the props of purity?  
We open the halves of a phenomena and the  
deceiving of uranus continues into the balanced heights.  
The heat serendipidous bombs are sobbed.  
Calculating mothers and cousins.  
For me they are algorithmic.  
  
The phemonana plan that has everyone insatiable.  
Full stop.  
They are all brides  
professional vortices in whose musical faucets originate.  
Multitude of natures!  
In and out of the cashmire the silvery and the yellow  
one of them is charitable,  
the other knows details.  
Where is noone  
he exclaims, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
A chorus of ostriches at afternoon un promised un stole  
comes to a halt before a shades of cinnamon.  
  
Because I love you, love, outside the electricity  
and with the heat.  
As soon as the incoming ripples  
Gives the neutral indication.  
The lance gathers on its rusted mare  
fashioning silvery lights over the heights.  
The harsh bird perfumes under the gleaming vagabonds.
