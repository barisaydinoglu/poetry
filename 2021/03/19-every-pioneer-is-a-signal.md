Every Pioneer Is A Signal
-------------------------
Femininity was no longer below the recording threshold.  
The order of the lights it was a ghostly business of noise and bombs.  
And rivers and fountains.  
On what sticky self-productions set with wind?  
What is this projection but a memory shattered of its fellowships?  
All river banks become vinegars.  
Towards those branches of yours that wait for me.
