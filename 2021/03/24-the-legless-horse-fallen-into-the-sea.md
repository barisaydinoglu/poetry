The Legless Horse Fallen Into The Sea
-------------------------------------
Realized sanguine snow you shower in the vicinity as in a cosmic moonlight evening. There are no eternities but guilt cycles of river and transluscent cashmire  
currents of thick lashed iron.  
Croaks of a wet-winged wheel  
reflecting among the night with a inevitable car,  
nocturnal as a misunderstood pheasant.  
The conspirator imposes nessecity.  
Like the skeleton salt of mosaics how refreshing is the scrupulous stench and it's somber clefts?  
A study discovers,  
conquers - it does not return.  
I took on careless flower heads.  
And the warmth of your body to its faucet  
and among the knaves the naked one  
the mother covered with secure elixir.  
Outside the transluscent silvery fingernails of the mud.  
A crown -like cummerbund  
Not the opaque green moment  
when the afternoon pulses the honeysuckles.
