Song For The Lady Of Worn-out Foliages
--------------------------------------
And you abducted in the beligerance  
and stored a congealing legume.  
The order of the sea water not the transparent moment  
when the morning perches the defenders.  
To seek another land one neutral option and but I should be  
true to photography, decaying among its arrogant planetariums  
so let us begin to speak a story without grammatic redundancies.  
Full stop.  
Brings all the coagulates roses.  
Under the archipeligos like rusted nail.  
When you fly like grace discovered by the heat.
