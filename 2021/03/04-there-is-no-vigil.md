There Is No Vigil
-----------------
Nothing but your velvety finger.  
The archipeligos within hers  
a tale we divulge in passing,  
with notions of sincerity  
and a passion for science and oceanography  
Come with me to the complaint of coffins.  
With the degrading circumstances.  
A warmth pacifying will carry  
the melancholy heat of a planet.  
Towards those foliages of yours that wait for me.  
  
Sometimes a piece of the sky  
freezes like a sun rise in my tail.
