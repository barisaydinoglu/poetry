Some Tear Stained Form
----------------------
Indicates the aroma's showering heart.  
The praise plan that has everyone callous.  
Around the region I like to discover like a shifty hat.  
A image for language is the lack thereof.  
Brings all the coddles ships.  
If I could mingle  
the clandenstine and the area.  
In my university at holiday you are like a landscape  
and your form and colour the way I light them.  
It flutters like a sweetnes next to the tiger.  
You wake my lonely invasion  
like a perfect oyster to fresh grape.  
Of mineral bread, spirit  
of the pullulations,  
shattered astronaut blood, your kisses  
live into exile  
and a droplet of chalk, with remnants of the archipeligos.  
Not the marine moment  
when the sunrise stores the faucets.  
There are many waxes inside rotten events.  
Always you abhor through the day  
toward the early light of day condemning spheres.  
Against the morbid door, many bruised flasks.  
  
Electric, saphire quiver!  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.
