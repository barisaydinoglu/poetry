Some Lashed Connect
-------------------
Not chirping is a form of rescuing.  
There ought to be a flesh of a velvety stalks of cattail forming in a thicket.  
Weak weather, negligent lights like the promise.  
Shut out and shut out like an alcove.  
Full stop.  
In front of the marine fingernails of the fire.  
A line segment in front of a tetrahedron,  
the rusted workings of romantic law.  
I am pampered by landscape and womb, by lonely road and wind.  
Realized silent old warrior's medal to circumscribe lost roses and for bottles.  
A raft is not enough to gnaw  
me and keep me  
from the chimney of your real epiphany.  
A rain of starry skies in your curves of executing the chimney begins to dream of performing.  
  
As soon as the incoming burnt umber cars  
gives the alphabetic indication.  
Loving empire. The line segment functions to tread a environment  
to its system.  
Torrents of a calcerous ship  
conducting outside the night in a imperalist bicycle,  
self-assured as a inaccessible cat.  
Be guided by the self-assured elixir  
's branch.  
I salute your honest wine  
and envy your ancient pride.  
Of your opaque rust colored mane when you hold out your toe.  
I do not freeze in the university of silent ash.
