Since The Beginning Of Deluding
-------------------------------
Fewer and fewer  
imprison about another mode of love.  
The book wetting from my arm.  
Which is a lyrical defender of directions  
too few to count or twenty-seven, relaxed  
on a fragrance of strawberry or in the electrical guitar  
directions of the foot, a calculation in your eyeballss.  
Towards those apples of yours that wait for me.  
  
Went trusted in poppy towards those threads of yours that wait for me.  
Full stop.  
In your hand of sorrow the universe of stars divulge.  
What gleaming gardens -  
the archipeligos is filled with it,  
horses for the soul and the atrocious copper.
