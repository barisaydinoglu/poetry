I Have Gone Filtering
---------------------
One minor option and be guided by the steady momentum's breakfast.  
This dead flute and seeking laminated sign attacks me  
with it's changeless awes like leg and  
mouth  
and rust colored planetariums like heart and stalkss of cattail.  
It was a directionless business of conglomerate and coals.  
Shut up and  
shut up like a dove.  
Conversations of sea water, the recitation  
of propellers we call original path.  
I saw how lunars are entertained  
by the self-assured quiver.  
All drops become jackals.  
The starlight knows this,  
that life in it's emerald boxes is as endless as the prize.  
The cousin smiles at the one  
but the cousin does not smile  
when he looks at the jaguar man  
and the fatherless ocean.  
A mirror -like shadow  
outside the depriving lards.  
  
Sand-colored mud to my insufferable landscape!  
In the smallest gold warmth a neon poppy day  
I salute your velvety  
bread  
and envy your iridescent pride.  
  
In the face of so many lonely roads to positivity.  
When you fly like crown pacified by the ice.  
Your apple is a river bank filled with spoiled nature.  
A spoiled study buries  
even the poetic  
algorithmic region in image  
to which the metaphor  
will not be fashioned.  
  
And the star to its pullulation  
and among the eddies the lyrical one  
the bride covered with cordial reflection.  
A current of cordial flesh  
that does not know why it flows and pulses.  
The nauesous snow is comfortable on your mouth.  
The lyrical dignity of the juice!  
There are many trashes inside clotting events.  
Carry me onto your boat - the fruit  
of my flint -  
  
All snows become torrents.  
Realized original honeysuckle the lunchtime natures you in its mortal wind.
