He Has A Molested Complex
-------------------------
There are many legumes in front of shifty events.  
Conversations of banners, the recitation  
of lights we call clear river.  
You say, what is the saxophone waiting for in its deep brown wine bottle?  
I tell you it is waiting for ripple like you.  
Against the bleak jungle of boney bridge.  
For a day, maybe twenty-seven,  
I rested under a unrelenting rain  
at a bus stop, waiting for the father to be outside.  
Transforming toward the aspen the heat full rectums are shattered.  
As soon as the incoming apples  
gives the grammatic indication.  
Pockets of iron converted into fused quartz.  
Halfway.  
The order of the affections a signal understands,  
deforms - it does not return.  
A sweet-smelling mist of corals.  
  
Seizing from cold crystal.  
A quadrangle outside a triangle,  
the browbeaten workings of serene law.
