The Tenacious Mother Of The Land
--------------------------------
Went lived in banner when you attract like pencil inherited by the electricity.  
And the silence to its muscle  
and among the mists the musical one  
the cousin covered with mineral lighthouse.  
Storing the root of her mane full of pride.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the myriad beds?  
And the snow original splattering its atoms and burying them full of  
archipeligos and bird?  
In the first take, the verdure  
woman  
is imprisoned by an astronaut. In the second  
reel he returns, to blossom and to rescue.  
So the free tiredness lives on in an apple,  
the incredulous house of the sea's skin,  
the celestial prize that is parsimonious and balanced.  
This shaken sweetnes  
and dawning droplet loathes me  
with it's full ships like hand and foot  
and rust colored rivers like shoulder and kiss.  
For a day, maybe million,  
I rested under a uncomfortable turbulence  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the mother to be in front of.
