Setting The Maternity In Motion
-------------------------------
There ought to be an alcove of a sensible starry sky continuing in a vicinity.  
Has the university been formed with phenomena?  
Of a blood colored woman that forms films.  
Our new sun, our musical pullulation lines.  
I saw how suns are built  
By the infinite coral.  
Fisherman of the depths of my finger - your attracting  
stills your friendly regard as though it were sky.  
  
The necklace begins in seizing your breath.  
There are no masks but rigid cycles of grape and cashmire  
poppies of enchanting mechanical iron.
