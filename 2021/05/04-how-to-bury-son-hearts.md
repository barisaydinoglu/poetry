How To Bury Son Hearts
----------------------
I was without doubt the aunt cat  
there in the bleak universe.  
When it looked me with its equinoctial angel eyes  
it had neither finger nor leg  
but emerald wheatfields on its sides.  
And meetings  
of skeleton tail I want you to upgrade on my eye.  
From harrowing wind to palm tree leaf,  
hidden roots drawn by honest channels, a  
wayside sea water begins to flutter. I want you to trust on my nose.
