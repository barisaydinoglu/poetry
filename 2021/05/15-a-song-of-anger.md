A Song Of Anger
---------------
There ought to be an autumn of a musical promise fluttering in an area.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
live of precisions and flags  
and the ancient corals of his native land?  
And you appreciate like a mirror and and the wine bottle to its springtime  
and among the guitars the changeless one  
the stranger covered with warm phemonana.  
Illusion and kiss - grapes of fear.  
  
Which is an affluent bed of directions  
too  
few to count or thousand, attracted  
on a rose  
or in the serendipidous vein  
directions of the nose, a calculation in your arms.  
Around the turqoise anger of the bloody feather.
