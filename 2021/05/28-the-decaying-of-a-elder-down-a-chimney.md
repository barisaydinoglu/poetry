The Decaying Of A Elder Down A Chimney
--------------------------------------
Pulled out and closed off like a banner.  
The wave storing from my mouth.  
And you drink like a hat and I'm the fisherman to the door of immediate coral.  
Sunburst orange trash barges of darknes,  
marine seams above a shady aroma.  
Nothing but that tiger of stalkss of cattail.  
A honeysuckle crystallizing will enchant  
the arrogant water of a planet.  
What funny things does the cat contain?  
How little we preserve and how much it kisses the secrets of this universe.  
A current of starry cedar architecture  
that does not know why it flows and hears.  
  
Green clay to my wet-winged grace!  
Beligerance and shades of burnt umber - natures of anger.  
Shall we set forth?  
Shall we keep going?
