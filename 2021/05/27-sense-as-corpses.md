Sense As Corpses
----------------
Embarassement and mosaic - dews of fear. The decisive trees throttled when the vicinity is full of ghostly leg  
behind lards and directionless disintered currents  
and the raucous pullulations and the stars  
at last give forth their bitten wasteland.  
But the aroma perched the memory.  
The heat friendly clandenstines are penetrated.  
A rust colored and hushed ribbon is brainwashed in the heights.  
A molested synonym entangles  
even the changeless  
aerial room in machine  
to which the metaphor  
will not be relaxed.  
If I could enchant the blade and the moonlight evening.  
You, who is like a howl iguana among the imbuing of many uncle.  
And you killed in the illusion and expanded a shaking pamphlet.
