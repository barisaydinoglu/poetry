Point Of View In The Slightest Services
---------------------------------------
The stone crushes, the cactus of infinite  
rejoices around.  
Lewd astronauts and women.  
For me they are historical.  
Goddess of the depths of my leg - your chirping  
stills your delicious regard as though it were water.  
Behind the gray embarassement of the abberation.  
I'd do it for the wheatfield in which you flow  
for the quivers of deep brown you've stood.  
I was without doubt the lady pheasant  
there in the calcerous field.  
When it looked me with its equinoctial warmth eyes  
it had neither fingernails nor brow  
but marble paths on its sides.  
I do not deceive in the chimney of blood-stained complaint.  
For a day, maybe three hundred,  
I rested under a palm tree leaf  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the uncle to be outside.
