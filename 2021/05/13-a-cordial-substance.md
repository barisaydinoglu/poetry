A Cordial Substance
-------------------
You've asked me what the ostrich is inheriting  
there with his sand-colored mouth?  
I reply, the smooth clay knows this. You are the chaotic pioneer of a tiger,  
the exiled ness of the flesh, the power of the electricity.  
Tryst of a died blood-stained acrobat.  
  
What secrets does the pheasant contain?  
How little we rejoice and how  
much it crystallizes the epiphany of this galaxy.
