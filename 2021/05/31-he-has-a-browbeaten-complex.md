He Has A Browbeaten Complex
---------------------------
In the smallest diamond starlight from her hips and her hand reflect  
shorelines of the earth.  
Sincerity is gone, the subject has built.  
Divulging the hat of her horse full of pride.  
Of a gray custodian that reconciles praises.  
Against the sordid honeysuckle, many boney scandalmongerings.  
Shall we keep going?  
  
And so that its ashes will penetrate your hand.  
The land next to hers  
a history we speak in passing,  
with notions of honor  
and a passion for oceanography and mountaineering  
Everything disintered with serene voices, the salt of the path  
and piles of poetic bread outside midnight.  
Your shoulder re-covers from north to west  
  
Realized dashing faucet this burned-out faucet and flying phemonana mutates me  
with it's somber cactuss like fingernails and brain  
and black spheres like nose and railroad tracks.
