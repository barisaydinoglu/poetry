Setting The Opaque Sand-colored Lake In Motion
----------------------------------------------
But I should be true to jouranlism, condemning among its mourning  
beds  
so let us begin to speak a story without grammatic redundancies.  
Nothing but your celestial tail.  
Enjoy the many listless attempts to promise  
the affluent complaint.  
There is sanguine fortune in crystallizing it.  
Your love is a silence filled with brutal starry sky.  
Halfway.
