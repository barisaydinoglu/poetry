An Equally Profound Goddess
---------------------------
Return to the homeland of the guitars.  
Muzzled elders and gentlemen.  
For me they are historical.  
A clouds  
of aromas it loves like a flag behind the warmth of your body.  
I was without doubt the cousin lobster  
there in the bitterest city.  
When it looked me with its soft cactus eyes  
it had neither breath nor lip  
but gold wheatfields on its sides.  
In your arm of changing the archipeligos begins to dream of dawning.  
I could inherit coffin, jugular, and cummerbund  
from coats and guitars  
with a ultraviolet path  
with lightnings in my foot.  
  
The starry mirrors fell the electric dignity of the pullulation!  
From her eyeballs and her eyeballs reconcile  
opaque burnt umber cars of the earth.
