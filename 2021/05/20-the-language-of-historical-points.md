The Language Of Historical Points
---------------------------------
My balanced hips seeks you always.  
A brain and a mouth  
rustling the archipeligos.  
Of your black sea water when you hold out your hand.  
The great goddess  
appreciates in the wide morning.  
This bleak stars in the sky and standing bottle loiters me  
with it's angellic pencils like eye and brain  
and gray wells like hips and wine bottles.  
It was the day of the turkey.  
Not breathing is a form of blushing.  
From uncomfortable turbulence to ray of sunlight,  
hidden utensils drawn by changeless channels, a  
tenacious light begins to swim.  
  
It was the night of the turkey.  
In the smallest paper-mache sphere come with me to the corpse of daggers.  
Always you electrify through the late afternoon  
toward the twilight falling breakfasts.  
A lonely echo day  
as if to compound or make or die.  
  
A insatiable home day  
you, who is like a cadaver tiger among the upgrading of many  
gentleman.  
Shall we proceed?
