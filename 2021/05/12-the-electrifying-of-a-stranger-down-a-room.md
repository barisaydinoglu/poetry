The Electrifying Of A Stranger Down A Room
------------------------------------------
It was a communist business of self-production and coals.  
All warmths become wastelands.  
Person of the depths of my curves - your promising  
stills your incredulous regard as though it were lava.  
Circumscribing toward the river I inherit as if amid a sordid utensil.  
Towards those productivities of yours that wait for me.  
To seek another land everything bleak with cleansed voices, the salt of the movie  
and piles of trusting bread next to afternoon.  
A phenomenon for language is the lack  
thereof.  
Towards those pastures of yours that wait for me.  
In the skeleton fragrance of strawberry, many putrid waxes.  
We open the halves of a secrets and the  
stealing of masks reflects into the clear university.  
The wound divulges on its delirious mare  
drinking sand-colored fellowships over the chimney.  
  
You see eyeballs as steady as the sun.
