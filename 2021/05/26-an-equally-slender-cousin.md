An Equally Slender Cousin
-------------------------
What secrets does the oyster contain?  
How little we reflect and how much it re-covers the mysteries of this galaxy.  
Transluscent blue and poetic daughter,  
all precisions become clandenstines.  
Sepia and pure pioneer,  
I could understand trash, invasion, and blood  
from homes and circuss  
with a gray lunar  
with lampreys in my mouth.  
Neither flesh nor wine bottle nor dark  
nor transparent but sepia.  
A quadrangle within a triangle,  
the difficult workings of angellic law.  
Around the moonlight evening I like to attract like a insatiable form.  
He is in us at this moment of first building.  
A camera  
for machine is the lack thereof.  
I stayed chirped and crimson  
inside the chimney.  
A nocturnal drizzle of elixirs.  
  
For fountain was muzzled and morally positive.  
Fewer and fewer  
congeal about another mode of tiredness.  
Towards those mists of yours that wait for me.
