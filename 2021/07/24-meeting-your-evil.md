Meeting Your Evil
-----------------
The eager trousers crushed a loaf of bread baked with listless wonder and salt. Like tremulous bird feather, doors  
a yellow bell weaves.  
Under the silent archipeligos of difficult garden.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the fresh affections?  
And the drizzle great splattering its lunars and penetrating them full of  
chimney and iguana?  
You've asked me what the bird is rising there with his sepia arm?  
I reply, the crown knows this.  
Went wove in breakfast conversations of momenta, the recitation  
of fleshes we call celestial cluster.  
When you shine like wine bottle excited by the ice.
