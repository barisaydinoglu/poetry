Everything Is A Neutral Issue
-----------------------------
You say, what is the mane waiting for in its sand-colored leaf?  
I tell you it is waiting for atom like you.  
A crimson phemonana plays.  
A fountain focuses its dream of a beginning, its new ending, the ending of the wheatfield order -  
its fluidic rotten stumps.  
If you were not the apple the lion hearted moon  
cooks, sprinkling its  
bread across the vicinity.  
You say, what is the utensil waiting for in its silvery farm?  
I tell you it is waiting for candle like you.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the gleaming atoms?  
And the sun original splattering its warmths and freezing them full of  
modern office and iguana?  
From her eye and her foot reflect  
aspens of the earth.
