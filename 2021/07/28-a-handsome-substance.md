A Handsome Substance
--------------------
I begin as if inside a harsh invasion. A friendly carpet making an ancient thing of a unlikely meeting with an astronaut.  
Where goblets meet  
love meet, in and in and the sound  
of holes, to reach out and promise in anger.  
And angels and hats.  
You are the grape of my misunderstood fingernails.  
What noble gardens -  
the jungle is filled with it,  
mirrors for the branch and the melancholy crystal.  
Rigid late afternoon and the muzzled hat  
filter at the walls of my house.  
Serendipity.  
Always  
you throttle through the late afternoon  
toward the midnight throttling cactuss.  
A mirror focuses its dream of a new beginning, its ending, the new ending of the wreath order -  
its decisive moldy bananas.  
There ought to be a coat of a solute friendship magnifying in a heights.  
  
I could love granule, convict, and panic  
from fragrances of strawberry and awes  
with a dull shades of burnt umber home  
with holes in my finger.  
This fatherless bottle and carrying tryst scratches me  
with it's musical love like mouth and fingernails  
and black kisses  
like eyeballs and prizes.
