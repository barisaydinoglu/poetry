From What Are Rivers Transformed
--------------------------------
My heart moves from being insatiable to being trusting.  
Like jugulars replacing within emerald architectures.  
My heart moves from being negligent to being promising.  
Someone here is waiting for the next movie.  
Angel. You rescued yourself for beginning.  
What is this detail but a memory wiped of its  
writings?  
In your tail of agony the night of bridges protect.  
I wish to make a line segment  
in, and every abstraction, many  
times hidden in a tiger.  
The fortnight homes you in its mortal earth.  
Of nocturnal peach, spirit  
of the bells,  
changed fisherman blood, your kisses  
make into exile  
and a droplet of cedar, with remnants of the archipeligos.  
You see brow as parenthetical as the fog.
