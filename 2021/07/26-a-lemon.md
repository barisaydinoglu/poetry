A Lemon
-------
Under the lashed river, many smothered egoes.  
I want you to mingle on my curves.  
What is this antenna but a memory changed of its phemonanas?  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the stationary windows?  
And the sun natural splattering its flowers and pampering them full of  
heights and pheasant?  
The troubled wine bottle is musical on your shoulder.  
Halfway.  
The foliage knows this,  
that life in it's chalk boxes is as endless as the branch.  
Forebode me and let my substance gather.  
The order of the clusters as if to sodden or hear or drown.  
The exiled jaguar wakes inside the arcane oxides.  
Come  
with me to the violence of dominions.  
  
Your arm flies from west to south  
if you were not the bread the free moon  
cooks, sprinkling its grape across the land.
