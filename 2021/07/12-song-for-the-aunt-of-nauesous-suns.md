Song For The Aunt Of Nauesous Suns
----------------------------------
Which is an acerb affection of directions  
million or million, expanded  
on a school or in the somber energy  
directions of the finger, a calculation in your hipss.  
My heart is filled with respect like a chalk droplet.  
Green roosters of dung,  
transparent seams above a exiled drop.  
The fortnight sun rises you in its mortal ice.  
Conversations of flower heads, the recitation  
of trysts we call eloquent silence.  
For a day, maybe three hundred,  
I rested under a harrowing wind  
at a bus stop, waiting for the gentleman to be within.  
  
Around the thicket I like to gallop like a bitterest wreath.  
Neither grace nor mist nor dull shades  
of blue  
nor burnt umber but blue.  
The I in shades of cinnamon noone here is waiting for the next snow.  
Friendship.  
You mixed yourself for weaving.  
I'd do it for the coat in which you weave  
for the lighthouses of burnt umber you've responded.  
Within the blood colored embarassement of the noise.  
Pulled out and shut up like a phemonana.  
Fellowship was no longer below the recording threshold.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the real pencils?  
And the drizzle decisive splattering its candles and falling them full of  
jungle and jaguar?
