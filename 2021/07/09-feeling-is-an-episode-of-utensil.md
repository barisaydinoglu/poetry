Feeling Is An Episode Of Utensil
--------------------------------
Happiness is gone, the subject has understood.  
Sometimes a piece of the water  
cracks like a flower in my fingernails.  
There are no oxides but lethargic cycles of snow and yellow  
apples of irreducable harsh rusted nail.  
If you were not the plum the blazing moon  
cooks, sprinkling its plum across the vicinity.  
In the burnt umber car of the area where you sleep,  
a dream condemns into machines.  
Carry me onto your helicopter - the banana of my love -  
the troubled bottle is iridescent on your tail.  
Grew and then inherited in the heights.  
A rigid production crushes  
even the original  
algorithmic sea in metaphor  
to which the metaphor  
will not be expanded.  
With its directionless expand pure serection lights the drops thick, copper wine bottle!  
My  
heart is filled with felicity like a glass bottle.  
  
The changeless dignity of the affection!  
Nobody here is waiting for the next guitar.  
Precision. You perfumed yourself  
for transforming.  
You see hand as serendipidous as the clouds. You enrich my rustling parallel noises  
like a profound iguana to fresh nectarine.
