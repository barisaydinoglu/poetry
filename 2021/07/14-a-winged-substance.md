A Winged Substance
------------------
Pulled out and shut up like a green lake.  
Pioneer of the depths of my eyeballs - your relaxing  
stills your real regard as though it were ice.  
A nocturnal wood paneling making a real thing of a probable meeting with a child.  
It was a sterile business of cold fire and clandenstines.  
But I should be true to oceanography, puncturing among its spoiled trysts  
so let us attempt to divulge a story devoid of individual redundancies.  
I saw how quilts are imbued  
by the perfect farm.  
Umbrella of an abhorred absurd film.  
Full stop.  
What we say dedicates to  
grow some other goddess  
what a technique may teach.  
Return to the homeland of the cathedrals.  
It was the morning of the turkey.  
It was the late afternoon of the cat.  
In the smallest silk praise a lip and a toe  
drinking the divisions.  
It was the late afternoon of the oyster.  
Among the gnawing pins.  
  
It was the morning of the oyster.  
Has the heights been continued  
with funny things?  
When you re-cover enchanted  
like a starry sky.  
A faucet -like complaint  
for wave was neurotic and morally positive.  
Nothing  
but your decisive shoulder.  
Smooth stone of a taunted rotten tree.
