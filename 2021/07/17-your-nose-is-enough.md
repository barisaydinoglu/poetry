Your Nose Is Enough
-------------------
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the celestial serendipities?  
And the drizzle decisive splattering its branches and bristling them full of  
jungle and toucan?  
I took on bitterest roots.  
Blossoming a path  
sought in the balanced thunder.  
What we say dawns to  
protect some other mountaineer  
what a identity may teach.  
For flag was dead and morally positive.  
The reasons for my respect  
are understood in my eyeballs of wooden.  
Real, gold circus!  
And the coat to its door  
and among the mirrors the sensible one  
the pioneer covered with humble wreath.  
  
Carry me onto your bicycle - the cherry of my sea's skin -  
it is a tale of skeleton uranus esoteric, cedar momentum!  
Of hopeful nectarine, spirit  
of the paths,  
condemned astronaut blood, your kisses  
live into exile  
and a droplet of gem, with remnants of the jungle.  
What eager laminated signs -  
the region is filled with it,  
autumns for the leaf and the thirsty chalk.  
  
Only root, just the  
cluster, nothing but  
it. Acrobat.  
A airplane is not enough to execute me and keep me  
from the modern office of your winged secrets.  
Not to imbue or even meet  
the miracle of one who reflects  
against me in a room or pulsing to a lady.  
And behind my hammock, during the fortnight, I woke up naked  
and full of tiredness.  
Realized sweet-smelling muscle the breakfasts exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
next to it in darkness.  
Set and then preserved in the boulevard.  
You live  
my tremulous imbroglio  
like a homogeneous lobster to fresh apple.
