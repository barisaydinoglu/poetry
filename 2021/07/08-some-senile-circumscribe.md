Some Senile Circumscribe
------------------------
Rusted twilight and the tremulous film  
condemn at the walls of my house.  
Mutate me and let my substance perch.  
What is this study but a memory ignored of its essences?  
A river upgrading will weave  
the lonely lightning of a planet.  
I stayed wetted and transluscent transluscent deep brown  
under the thicket.  
A chorus of cats at early light of day un rescued un petrified  
comes to a halt before a foam.  
Arrogant legumes and nauesous pigeon holes.  
To seek another land my heart moves from being boneless to being homogeneous.  
It was a tear stained business of nail and eternities.  
Among the disordered divisions of molested affection.  
A loaf of bread baked with forceful tiredness and salt.  
Which is  
an affluent film of directions  
million or million, gathered  
on a femininity or in the manly flower  
directions of the tail, a calculation in your mouths.  
Like the motionless ash of movies enjoy the many arrogant attempts to mingle  
the warm  
stain.  
There is lovely fortune in playing it.  
But I should be true  
to computer science, plaguing among its phosphorus awes  
so let us seek to divulge a story without neutral redundancies.  
This hollow silence and swimming energy smears me  
with it's loving wine bottles like hips and lip  
and gray banners like shoulder and doors.  
  
I play as if inside a troubled lamprey.  
Full stop.
