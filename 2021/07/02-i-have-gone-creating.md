I Have Gone Creating
--------------------
Not to upgrade or even meet  
the cinnamon lake of one who mixes  
in the middle of me in a boulevard or waking to a goddess.  
A inscription attracts,  
drowns - it does not return.  
In my divisions at sunset you are like a book  
and your form and colour the way I build them.  
Outside the cashmire ears of the jungle.  
Brings all the silences manes.  
Like blades loitering with pastures.  
Return to the homeland of the ships.  
How hearing is the sanguine moldy banana and it's incredulous bombs?  
Pure ghost preserves the banners I want you to recover on my hips.  
Of a dull  
shades of blue pioneer that stands flowers.  
  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
gather of curtains and perfumes  
and the decisive praises of his native land?  
Shall we keep going?  
  
Motionless weather, directionless lights like the breakfast.  
For door was obscene and morally negative.
