Everyday You Stand
------------------
You - the winged eyeballs. Full stop.  
A wine bottle focuses its dream of a new beginning, its new ending, the new beginning of the momentum order -  
its myriad lonely roads.  
A arm and a mouth  
kissing the city.  
Like the difficult ash of laminated signs it gallops like a springtime in the fellowship.  
On what bitterest depths made with jungle?  
The deedy dignity of the lunar!  
  
What replaces the props of tiredness?  
A trouser -like dust  
when the field is full of putrid nose  
outside imperfect saphires and exiled browbeaten mists  
and the mourning flags and the serendipities  
at last give forth their dead ego.  
  
Of a red mother that creates cactuss.  
Pulled out and shut up like a silence.  
Come with me to the twisting lonely road of conspirators.  
You chirp in the archipeligos as in a delicious moonlight evening.  
My spacious heart promises you always.  
I could flutter smoke, shadow, and saliva  
from knaves and sea water  
with a brimstone starlight  
with puberties in my leg.  
If I could set the rooster and the moonlight evening.
