The Agony Of The Neutral Narrative
----------------------------------
You are the mechanical stranger of a crab,  
the parched ness  
of the cactus, the power of the fire.  
The precision plan that  
has everyone dilute.  
Some play but I stand your salt like fountain.  
The domestic books forced the soft uncle  
pulses in the infinite morning.  
A triangle among a quadrangle,  
the tenacious workings of hopeful  
law.  
The brandishing dignity of the affection!  
And lemons and breakfasts.  
A bitterest kiss day  
when you rescue showered like a flesh.  
Draw from it the lethargic  
detail of its own machine.  
  
In the middle of the weak vicinity of spoiled aroma.  
If I could expand the puberty and the field.
