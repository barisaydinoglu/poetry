An Equally Absent Minded Woman
------------------------------
My heart moves from being forceful to being parenthetical.  
In your tail of entangling the room begins to dream of rejoicing.  
Noone here is waiting for the next burnt umber lake.  
Grace. You recovered yourself for standing.  
Always you fly through the sunset  
toward the late afternoon killing energies.  
Towards those goblets of yours that wait for me.
