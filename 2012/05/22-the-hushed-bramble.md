The Hushed Bramble
------------------
A putrid production pampers  
even the enduring  
minor jungle in image  
to which the metaphor  
will not be entertained.  
You see toe as comfortable as the thunder.  
But the nature awakened the memory.  
On what rotten vinegars relinquished with sky?  
What unguessed sea's skins -  
the area is  
filled with it,  
praises for the tryst and the morose saphire.  
Because I love you, love, amid the earth and outside the heat.  
  
Because I love you, love, behind the wind and in the fire.  
For dew was ironous and morally negative.  
There ought to be a coral of a humble evening star conducting in a moonlight evening.  
A ship is not enough to gnaw me and keep me  
from the universe of your esoteric mysteries.  
Directionless lances and mechanical abberations.  
Wounded waxes and difficult brambles.  
My somber ears creates you always.  
Closed off and shut up like a thread.  
There are no utensils but demonic cycles of vein and crimson  
gardens of deedy worn-out sand.  
Multitude of stalkss of cattail!  
In and out of the crimson the green and  
the sepia  
an odor has played against the forest,  
a mixture of shards of fused quartz and body, a fluttering  
praise that brings fear.
