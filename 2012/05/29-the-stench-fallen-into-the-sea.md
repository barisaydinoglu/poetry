The Stench Fallen Into The Sea
------------------------------
A breath and a tail  
performing the moonlight evening.  
And angels and poppies.  
Under the smothered cedar architecture, many hushed wombs.  
Around the crimson finger of the ice.  
The abys imposes nessecity.  
I am dismantled by stars in the sky and lonely road, by martyr and drizzle.  
Only flint, just the  
stalks of cattail, nothing but  
it. Home.  
Like deaths dismantling inside energies.  
Pure panic returns the goblets the order of the kisses but I should be untrue to science, abolishing among its barbaous momenta  
so let us try to divulge a story devoid of technical redundancies.  
To the balanced eager atom on what mourning panics played with water?
