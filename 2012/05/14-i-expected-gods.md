I Expected Gods
---------------
A blood-stained leaf day  
the I in energy nothing but that old warrior's medal of mosaics.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
Not to reflect or even meet  
the ship of one who enriches  
under me in a modern  
office or magnifying to a giant.  
Return to the homeland of the wreaths.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
In your breath of dismantling the jungle begins to dream of upgrading.  
A unguessed thunder of flowers.
