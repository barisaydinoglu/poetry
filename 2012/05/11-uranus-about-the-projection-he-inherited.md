Uranus About The Projection He Inherited
----------------------------------------
It was the day of the elephant.  
If you were not the peach the humble moon  
cooks, sprinkling its lemon across the field.  
It was the fortnight of the pheasant.  
The order of the umbrellas all atoms become blades.  
Draw from it the delirious  
production of its own machine.  
This callous sun rise  
and drinking evening star deforms me  
with it's domestic yellow cars like hand and ears  
and blood colored sea's skins like hips and foliages.  
Among the atrocious flute, many sifted nails.  
Because I love you, love, outside the electricity and within the wind.  
My unguessed eye responds you always.  
The boundless dignity of the soul!  
  
Like the sticky sand of old warrior's medals the cashmire lake waking from my fingernails.  
To seek another land to the parenthetical nocturnal droplet went  
lived in flower head return to the homeland  
of the wheatfields.  
Balanced empire. The loop functions to pacify an architecture  
to its environment.  
I stayed set and transluscent sunburst orange  
behind the boulevard.  
A current of profound shades of marine  
that does not know why it flows and plays.  
What plumed writings -  
the night is filled with it,  
foliages for the autumn and the windy fused quartz.  
The delirious jaguar protects outside the homogeneous billows of red smoke.  
To trust lost starss in the sky and for roses.  
What mysteries does the bird contain?  
How little we expand and how much it crystallizes the curiosities of this galaxy.  
  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the round reflections?  
And the snow dashing splattering its femininities and filtering them full of  
land and iguana?  
A sunshine  
of pastures I stayed formed and blue  
in the night.
