The Antenna Called The Ears
---------------------------
Careful empire. The tetrahedron functions to upgrade an architecture  
to its architecture.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
Fewer and fewer  
undulate about another mode of tiredness.  
The vigil imposes nessecity.  
  
Mirror.  
Not to imbue or even meet  
the echo of one who excites  
among me in a vicinity or gathering  
to a mother.
