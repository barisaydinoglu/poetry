I Expected Brides
-----------------
The ghost circumscribes on its hairy mare  
conducting sand-colored stars over the sea.  
They are all brides  
professional dominions in whose parsimonious utensils originate.  
The order of the silicon architectures and the pullulation to its star  
and among the horses the mineral one  
the mother covered with slender umbrella.  
I inherit as if with a distorted night.  
There are many moths within torrential events.  
You say, what is the stars in the sky waiting for  
in its yellow flesh?  
I tell you it is waiting for rose like you.  
Closed off and shut out like a writing.  
One algorithmic option and has the field been divulged  
with epiphany?  
Aunt of the depths of my hips - your reflecting  
stills your friendly regard as though it were heat.  
My heart moves from being molested to being clear.  
My heart moves from being parched to being infinite.  
  
With its bruised rustle in the red animosity of the wounded soldier.
