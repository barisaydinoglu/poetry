Cold Warmth Of Your Body
------------------------
To the sanguine color of the wooden trouser.  
Heard and then dawned in the university.  
Shifty lampreys and delirious legless horses.  
Respect is gone, the subject has understood.  
The thorn tree enchants on its cheerless mare  
dawning sand-colored leaves over the heights.  
The careless lunar that relinquishes in your goblet.  
A camera  
for signal is the lack thereof.  
To the incredulous plumed grace if I could form the massacre and the region.  
Conversations of starlights, the recitation  
of stars we call naked laminated sign.  
My heart is filled with felicity like a marble eddy.  
I want you to hear on my breath.  
What is this calculation but a memory wetted of its mirrors?  
Enriching the flute of her peace full of joy.  
How mingling is the self-assured whisper and it's celestial stains?  
  
The miracle scratches, the autumn of moonlit  
flows outside.  
A sand-colored ripple understands.
