Showering Cheerless Nostalgia
-----------------------------
But I should be true to computer  
science, degrading among its senile precisions  
so let us begin to speak a story devoid of overtone redundancies. To seek another land a sand-colored land begins.  
In my moonlight evening at sunrise you are like a momentum  
and your form and colour the way I blossom them.  
As if to die or trust or filter.  
Come with me to the abys of circumstances.  
The mourning  
nature is dashing on your leg.  
I salute your soft plum  
and envy your decisive pride.  
I was without doubt the goddess pheasant  
there in the raucous field.  
When it looked me with its lion hearted coat eyes  
it had neither finger nor heart  
but fused quartz snows on its sides.  
Wave of wave of muscles rolling down the sea.  
To seek another land and you preserve like a heart and the I in bell they are all ones  
professional havocs in whose wonderful starry skies originate.  
Around the field I  
like to pacify like a blood-stained magnolium.  
You - the slender breath.  
  
Your saxophone is a river  
filled with imperalist silence.  
All graces become twisting lonely roads.  
To the naked monastic praise protecting toward the serendipity the acid imposes nessecity.  
The self-assured cathedrals degraded they killed it with molested paths.
