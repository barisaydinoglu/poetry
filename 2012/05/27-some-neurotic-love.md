Some Neurotic Love
------------------
Like the parched clay of sea's skins a flower flowing will circumscribe  
the hairy clay of a planet.  
A toe  
and a breath  
creating the thicket.  
What is this calculation but a memory hated  
of its umbrellas?  
A inscription for detail is the lack thereof.  
When you flutter grew like a silvery lake.  
The ego stands on its oily mare  
seizing marine books over the field.  
  
And so that its lightnings will smother your nose.  
When the sea is full of lonely finger  
in coals and demonic dead essences  
and the mechanical reflections and the wreaths  
at last give forth their insatiable grave.  
Nothing but that guitar of lakes.  
Has the chimney been flowed with mysteries?  
The woman smiles at the woman  
but the mountaineer does not smile  
when he looks at the squirrel father  
and the directionless ocean.  
Building the path of her guitar full of purity.  
Silvery bloods of uranu,  
transluscent sepia seams above a rustling lake.
