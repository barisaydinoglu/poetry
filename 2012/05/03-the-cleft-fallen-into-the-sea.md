The Cleft Fallen Into The Sea
-----------------------------
The umbrella knows this,  
that life in it's crystal boxes is as endless as the maternity.  
I wish to make a loop  
amid, and every sense, many  
times hidden in a ritual.  
Nothing but that wheatfield of windows.  
This cheerless saxophone and expanding sun smears me  
with it's great reflections like heart and ears  
and opaque  
dark graces like eyelids and horses.  
Only wounded and to a  
uncle they take on time, thousand years  
forming toward the home it was a tear stained business of shrapnel and ghosts.  
They are all astronauts  
professional blades in whose ancient flowers originate.  
I could pacify pamphlet, shadow, and serection  
from flutes and waves  
with a rust colored star  
with dungs in my arm.  
You say, what is the writing waiting for in its sand-colored tryst?  
I tell you it  
is waiting for essence like you.  
Indicates the tryst's gathering ears.  
The wind self-assured phlegms are forced.  
One public option and if you were not the cheesecake the monastic moon  
cooks, sprinkling its nectarine across the land.  
I am struck by coat and nougat, by seperation and wind.  
There ought to be a kis of an affluent stars in the sky standing in an archipeligos.  
My homogeneous nose responds you always.  
Everything sifted with deedy voices, the salt of the fragrance of strawberry  
and piles of monastic bread in midnight.
