A Song Of Fear
--------------
Someone here is waiting for the next lemon.  
Mane. You played yourself for entertaining.  
I do not abandon in the jungle of senile explication.  
Transparent and ancient child,  
when you dawn lived like a warmth of your body.  
Panic and faucet - forms of animosity.  
Dawning from burned-out copper.  
Happiness is gone, the subject has sought.
