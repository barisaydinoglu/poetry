A Clear Substance
-----------------
Only mechanical and to a  
one they take on time, three hundred years  
the fire iridescent wastelands are punctured.  
A wind of natures and you refresh like an acrobat and I salute your charitable nectarine  
and envy your wide pride.  
I'd do it for the stalks of cattail in which you perfume  
for the love of opaque crimson you've pulsed.  
The delirious ship is smooth on your shoulder.  
When you kiss like praise formed by the earth.  
The day femininities you in its mortal lightning.  
I wish to make a line  
outside, and every color, many  
times hidden in  
a cinnamon lake.  
Our new sun, our loving landscape triangles.  
  
Gnaw me and let my substance dedicate.  
The sunset sea's skins you in its mortal water.
