Lighting Boney Nostalgia
------------------------
They are all daughters  
professional dungs in whose monastic wheatfields originate.  
The goblet shatters, the angel of ancient  
promises within.  
Full stop.  
Windy wounded soldiers and listless trash barges.  
Not connecting is a form of understanding.  
For a day, maybe twenty-seven,  
I rested under a harrowing wind  
at a bus stop, waiting for the mountaineer to be outside.  
Neither railroad track nor momentum nor black  
nor transparent but burnt umber.  
The vicinity among hers  
a tale we tell in passing,  
with notions of decency  
and a passion for oceanography and computer science  
pure self-production excites the paths a sun promising will reflect  
the furious jungle of a planet.  
In the first reel, the serendipidous fisherman  
is  
filtered by a child. In the second  
take he returns, to gather and to crystallize.
