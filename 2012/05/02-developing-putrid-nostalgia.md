Developing Putrid Nostalgia
---------------------------
As if to loiter or protect or protest.  
Refresh on the darkness that wait for you  
harassing the violenet chairs, entangling the doors.  
The torrential lobster shines in the middle of the myriad cadavers.  
Return to the homeland of the gardens.
