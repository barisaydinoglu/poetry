Proof Of Delicate Feeling
-------------------------
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the resolute souls?  
And the sun parsimonious splattering its stones and erupting them full of  
boulevard and oyster?  
And meetings of banal finger I'm the man  
to the prize of immediate lake.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
My lyrical foot excites you always.  
  
Of a opaque brimstone gentleman that mixes farms.  
Someone here is  
waiting for the next movie.  
Sweetnes. You gathered yourself for circumscribing.  
For femininity was sterile and morally positive.  
You see fingernails as equinoctial as  
the drizzle.  
Pockets of broken glass converted into cedar.  
The warmth of your body knows this,  
that life in it's gold boxes is as endless as the guitar.  
I saw how sea water are transformed  
by the cleansed sea's  
skin.  
Halfway.  
Be guided by the essential quiver's phemonana.  
Once there was a spoiled son who  
blushed at parties, sitting in a circle, among graces.  
And you enchant like a smooth stone and behind the putrid vein, many listless granules.  
  
A arm and a hand  
promising the night.  
Your sea's skin is a essence filled with bitterest form.
