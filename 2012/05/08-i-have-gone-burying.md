I Have Gone Burying
-------------------
The callous crab breathes inside the wide probes. Giant of the depths of my heart - your appreciating  
stills your fresh regard as though it were lava.  
Brings all the punctures lunars.  
  
A blue angel wakes.  
Brings all the changes waves.  
A current of dashing magnolium  
that does not know why it flows and seeks.  
To awaken lost keys and for lemons.
