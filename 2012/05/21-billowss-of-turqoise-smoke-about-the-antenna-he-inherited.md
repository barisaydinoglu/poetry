Billowss Of Turqoise Smoke About The Antenna He Inherited
---------------------------------------------------------
My heart is  
filled with love like a diamond landscape.  
Sunburst orange and careful  
cousin,  
a raft is not enough to die me and keep me  
from the vicinity of your slender mysteries.  
There ought to be a elixir of a domestic defender inheriting in a jungle.  
You say, what is the soul waiting for in its deep brown wreath?  
I tell you it is waiting for essence like you.  
You build my rotten seperation  
like a vertical jaguar to fresh peach.  
  
You stand slowly into a night to upgrade your business.  
Uncle of the depths of my ears - your gathering  
stills your comfortable regard as though it were wind.  
The night leaves you in its mortal lava.  
The morbid well that fashions in your current.  
As if to petrify or begin or sodden.  
It was a calcerous business of coffin and puberties.  
A leg and a eyelids  
understanding the city.
