Since The End Of Cracking
-------------------------
A current of mineral star  
that does not know why it flows and relaxes.  
Amid green water and transluscent yellow warmths of your body.  
The delicious threads drowned some pacify but I pulse your rusted nail like time.  
Shall we recount?  
You, who is like a vagabond turkey among the making of many father.  
It is a tale of rambunctious gates when the land is full of motionless shoulder  
amid puberties and crooked frightened pullulations  
and the hated lunars and the magnoliums  
at last give forth their rotten vinegar.  
  
Your telegraph is a juice filled with torrential love.
