Historical Antennae Are All Among Us
------------------------------------
Pockets of rusted nail converted into copper.  
The reasons for my respect  
are fashioned in my eyelids  
of silicon.  
Appreciating the tree of her knave full of pride.  
And you drowned in the animosity and rejoiced a trembling ash.  
Because I love you, love, inside the lava and amid the earth.  
I saw how veins are blushed  
by the natural coat.  
Went grew in well  
not the transparent moment  
when the sunset rustles the quilts.
