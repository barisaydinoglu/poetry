The Exiled Extinction
---------------------
And you enchant like a crown and when the sea is full of spoiled brain  
in lightnings and tenacious inaccessible souls  
and the hairy fountains and the windows  
at last give forth their oily jugular.  
Around the night I like to begin like a weak dew.  
Furious sunrise and the lethargic grace  
prosecute at the walls  
of my house. Halfway.
