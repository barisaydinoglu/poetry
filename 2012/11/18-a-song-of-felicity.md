A Song Of Felicity
------------------
She is in us at this moment of first rustling.  
Some re-cover but I kiss your rusted nail like starry sky.  
Pure oblivion begins the movies cathedral was no longer below the transmission threshold.  
In the face  
of so many whispers to animosity.  
They disguised it with banal mists.  
What soft corals -  
the boulevard is filled with it,  
marine lakes for the mirror and the bitter cedar.  
If you were not the orange the clear moon  
cooks, sprinkling its wine across the land.  
Once there was a rotten cousin who  
recovered at parties, sitting in a line segment, among smooth graphites.  
Of stationary bread, spirit  
of the sand-colored cars,  
scratched mother blood, your kisses  
create into exile  
and a droplet of diamond, with remnants of the archipeligos.  
My heart moves from being morose to being serene.
