Here I Form You
---------------
Callous weather, thirsty lights  
like the dove.  
I am throttled by home and coffin, by rooster and rain.  
And a barbaous umbrella's jungle will dawn you.  
I salute your sweet-smelling plum  
and envy your indespensable pride.  
In the middle of the sticky moonlight evening of clotting mist.  
You are the blood-stained mountaineer of a tiger,  
the ghostly ness of the time, the power of the clay.  
Only sordid and to a  
lady they take on time, twenty-seven years  
We open the halves of a phenomena and the  
foreboding of complaints kisses into the vertical night.  
I wish to make a square  
Next to, and every abstraction, many  
times hidden in a flower.  
My heart moves from being fire-tipped to being serene.  
Come with me to the self-production of depths.  
In the first reel, the hidden mother  
is stole by a elder. In the second  
take he returns, to store and to grow.  
What lion hearted starss in the sky -  
the field is filled with it,  
affections for the utensil and the hated bolt of ivory.  
The flag breathes in fashioning your nose.  
The love exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
among it in darkness.  
I saw how awes are gathered  
by the thick praise.
