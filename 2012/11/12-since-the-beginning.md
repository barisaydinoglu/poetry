Since The Beginning
-------------------
They trembled it with clenched promises.  
Boneless aunts and pioneers.  
For me they are historical.  
They buried it with mourning fountains.  
Enchanting a stars in the sky  
dedicated in the resolute drizzle.  
My heart is filled with felicity like a cedar candle.  
A rust colored and wounded pencil is soddened in the area.  
And windows and juices.  
In your shoulder of dying the area begins to dream of galloping.  
And so that its billowss of blood colored smoke will deform your heart.  
  
Only arrogant and to a  
pioneer they take on time, million years  
your brain refreshes from west to east
