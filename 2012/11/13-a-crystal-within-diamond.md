A Crystal Within Diamond
------------------------
Human, fused quartz book!  
You trust my clenched explication  
like a friendly squirrel to fresh bread.  
Hated midnight and the frail bed  
mourn at the walls of my house.  
My heart is filled with tiredness like a gold  
sea shell.  
  
Cinnamon convicts of eternity,  
cinnamon seams above a brutal bottle.  
Halfway.
