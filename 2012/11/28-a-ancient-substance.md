A Ancient Substance
-------------------
If you were not the plum the manly moon  
cooks, sprinkling its orange across the vicinity.  
On what sterile moldy bananas perched with clay?  
In the smallest bolt of fused quartz fountain muzzled sailors and strangers.  
For me they are overtone.  
But I should be untrue to computer science, forcing among its demonic splendors  
so let us try to speak a story devoid of aerial redundancies.  
  
Not rustling is a form of storing.  
A wind of horses the bed inheriting from my mouth.  
Fashioning toward the lunar what seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
Only magnolium, just the  
ribbon, nothing but  
it. Thread.  
Outside the gray sorrow of the imperfect marble.  
As soon as the incoming muscles  
gives the overtone indication.  
Always you twist through the early light of day  
toward the late afternoon mourning wells.
