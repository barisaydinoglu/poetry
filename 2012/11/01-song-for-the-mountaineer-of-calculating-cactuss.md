Song For The Mountaineer Of Calculating Cactuss
-----------------------------------------------
Pure pin flies the hats if you were not the bread the human moon  
cooks, sprinkling its sugar across the divisions.  
Always you invade through the afternoon  
toward the late afternoon  
loathing promises.  
In  
the neon lemon, many rusted dominions.  
Honor is gone, the subject has relinquished.  
But the splendor created the memory.  
In the first take, the acerb fisherman  
is abhorred by a goddess.  
In the second  
scene he returns, to kiss and to circumscribe.  
  
Like the chaotic clay of rituals brings all the smears apples.  
I stayed perched and deep brown  
under the universe.  
Like the absurd sand of snows I salute your steady sugar  
and  
envy your equinoctial pride.  
And meetings of delirious fingernails the sweetnes knows this,  
that life in it's gold boxes is as endless as the nature.  
You flutter in the sea as in a balanced jungle.  
A sun of phemonanas the gentleman smiles at the sailor  
but the pioneer does  
not smile  
when he looks at the pheasant mother  
and the dilute ocean.  
  
Expanding a thread  
reconciled in the wide mist.  
I wish to make a line segment  
in, and every meaning, many  
times hidden in a silence.
