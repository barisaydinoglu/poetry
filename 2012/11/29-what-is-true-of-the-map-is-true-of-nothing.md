What Is True Of The Map Is True Of Nothing
------------------------------------------
Shall we recount? In my archipeligos at sunset you are like a railroad track  
and your form and colour the way I continue them.  
Like the lonely rusted nail of pullulations carry me onto your ship - the mango of my drop -  
of your red flute when you hold out your ears.  
A chorus of iguanas at early light of day un rose un filtered  
comes  
to a halt before a land.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the great maternities?  
And the rain deedy splattering its moons and attacking them full of  
night and toucan?  
One of them is real,  
the other knows synonyms.  
Where is someone  
he cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
The planetariums exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
next to it in darkness.  
  
You are the harsh elder of a turkey,  
the worn-out ness of the wave, the power of the mud.  
Shall we proceed?  
You - the homogeneous curves.  
A lake performing will awaken  
the insufferable sky of a planet.  
And currents and maternities.  
Towards those jars of yours that wait for me.  
They are all fishermen  
professional whispers in whose absent minded perfumes originate.
