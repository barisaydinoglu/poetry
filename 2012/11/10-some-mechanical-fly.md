Some Mechanical Fly
-------------------
I could chirp consequence, saliva, and acid  
from sweetness and planetariums  
with a gray poppy  
with violences in my eyeballs.  
Neither jar nor pasture nor gray  
nor deep brown but cashmire.  
There are many cadavers in front of rambunctious events.  
In the dull shades of cashmire sorrow of the nail.  
Unguessed, ceramic droplet!  
The astronaut smiles at the goddess  
but the woman does not smile  
when he looks at the jaguar one  
and the whirlwinds of ocean.  
  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
Comfortable, chalk forest!  
You, who is like a cold fire squirrel among the drinking of many gentleman.  
Nothing but your musical brain.  
  
For a day, maybe twenty-seven,  
I rested under a ray of sunlight  
at a post office, waiting for the giant to be in.  
The wet-winged turkey perfumes among the handsome moths.  
A steady rug making a sensual thing of a likely meeting with a woman.  
For a day, maybe too few to count,  
I rested under a unrelenting rain  
at a post office, waiting for the gentleman to be behind.  
A bell perfuming will flow  
the insatiable electricity of a planet.  
In my thicket at sunrise you are like an atom  
and your form and colour the way I fashion them.  
Closed off and closed off like an alcove.
