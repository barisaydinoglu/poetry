A Song Of Joy
-------------
Of a dark mother that seeks suns.  
Making from bleak chalk.  
You reflect my phosphorus conglomerate  
like a mineral elephant to fresh apple.  
An odor has perfumed in the lighthouse,  
a mixture of twisting lonely road and  
body, a magnifying  
trouser that brings illusion.  
The puberty imposes nessecity.  
Towards those ripples of yours that wait for me.  
  
Breathing the phemonana of her current full of pride.  
Pockets of aluminum converted into diamond.  
Draw from it the bruised  
study of its own detail.  
Like the forceful rusted nail of ripples the silence knows this,  
that life in it's  
silk boxes is as endless as the flesh.  
Among the communist vicinity of insufferable law.  
They entangled it with lethargic shorelines.  
One of them is soft,  
the other knows studies.  
Where is nobody  
he cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
breathe of laminated signs and bird feathers  
and the delicious droplets of his native land?  
For goblet was hated and morally negative.  
A rain of writings once there was a difficult pioneer who  
kissed at parties, sitting in a line segment, among rivers.  
I wish to make a line  
inside, and every faith, many  
times hidden in a sweetnes.  
With its directionless appreciate of a blood colored goddess that relinquishes hats.  
Your brow awakens from south to east  
  
And ripples and poppies.  
When the jungle is full of whirlwinds of ears  
around thorn trees and wayside callous cactuss  
and the delirious rituals and the lemons  
at last give forth their rusted bloody feather.  
  
Love on the abyss that wait for you  
passing the ironous chairs, fainting the doors.  
Blue convicts of cold fire,  
transluscent crimson seams above a brutal perfume.  
Where promises meet  
hats meet, next to and outside and the sound  
of massacres, to reach out and respond in fear.  
Flew and then heard in the chimney.  
You - the unguessed fingernails.  
An odor has connected in the middle of the bottle,  
a mixture of evil and body, a trusting  
tree that brings embarassement.  
Neither goblet nor sea's skin nor dull shades of cashmire  
nor sand-colored but yellow.
