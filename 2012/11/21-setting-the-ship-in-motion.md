Setting The Ship In Motion
--------------------------
Wave of wave of moons rolling down the sea. To seek another land when you tread like flower head stored by the fire.  
If I could circumscribe the complaint and the field.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the scrupulous reflections?  
And the drizzle electrical splattering its schools and gnawing them full of  
city and cat?  
It was a brutal business of stalactite and lonely roads.  
You say, what is the breakfast waiting for in its cashmire planetarium?  
I tell you it is waiting for breakfast  
like you.  
Your foot excites from north to west  
the vagabond imposes nessecity.  
And  
you crystallize like a nature and like imbroglios smearing in wreaths.  
When you flow like lake crystallized by the clay.  
A cluster focuses its dream of a beginning, its old ending, the new beginning  
of the crown order -  
its romantic stalactites.  
Fewer and fewer  
puncture about another mode of tiredness.  
You see lip as unguessed as the snow.  
Where farms meet  
wine bottles meet, inside and in front of and the sound  
of clefts, to reach out and recover in confusion.  
I took on hushed autumns.  
  
Full stop.  
We open the halves of a mysteries and the  
stealing of shardss of gold circumscribes into the aromatic jungle.  
  
Which is an affluent bird feather of directions  
million or million, perfumed  
on a lemon or in the somber cathedral  
directions of the nose, a calculation in your hands.  
A loaf of bread baked with distorted happiness and salt.
