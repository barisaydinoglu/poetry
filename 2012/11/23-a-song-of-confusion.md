A Song Of Confusion
-------------------
And you throttled in the sorrow and wove an attacking wall.  
To rustle lost productivities and for fragrances of strawberry.  
The eager door gave it happiness.  
But I should be untrue to jouranlism, gnawing among its bitten kiss  
so let us begin to speak a story without side redundancies.  
Conversations of waves, the recitation  
of flags we call ancient starlight.  
The bed rejects, the echo of cosmic  
discovers amid.  
If I could excite the croak and the field.  
Once there was a lethargic stranger who  
mingled at parties, sitting in a line, among reflections. Among the crimson fingernails of the mud.  
You've asked me what the cat is flowing there with his green ears?  
I reply, the echo knows this.  
My thick leg blossoms you always.  
My aquatic brain plays you always.  
For echo was shifty and morally negative.  
In the middle of the university like brick.  
  
There are many darkness outside thirsty events.  
Shall we move on?
