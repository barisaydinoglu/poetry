The Fuming Lady
---------------
To the affluent color of the glass laminated sign.  
Bitter weather, clenched lights like the bridge.  
Motionless weather, hairy lights like the praise.  
The giant smiles at the woman  
but the lady does not smile  
when he looks at the squirrel aunt  
and the negligent ocean.
