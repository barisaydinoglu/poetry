An Equally Serene Father
------------------------
Brainwash me and let my substance perform.  
Not the cinnamon moment  
when the late afternoon develops the wheatfields.  
I'm the person to the pullulation of immediate writing.  
Inaccessible daughters and sons.  
For me they are grammatic.  
  
Perform on the flasks that wait for you  
twisting the inevitable chairs, brainwashing the doors.  
A transparent eddy understands.  
You say, what is the old warrior's medal waiting for in its transluscent blue saxophone?  
I tell you it is waiting for utensil like you.
