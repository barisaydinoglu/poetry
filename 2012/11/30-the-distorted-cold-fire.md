The Distorted Cold Fire
-----------------------
Sometimes a piece of the clay  
dismantles like a pencil in my foot.  
Only bridge, just the  
cathedral, nothing but  
it. Fragrance of strawberry.  
Silence was no longer above the transmission threshold.  
Outside the modern office like brick.
