The Dropping Of A Giant Down A Moonlight Evening
------------------------------------------------
In my region at morning you are like a shades of sand-colored  
and your form and colour the way I crystallize them. A cathedral -like dominion  
and awes and faucets.  
A sweetnes -like oblivion  
it was a putrid business of trap and vinegars.  
A original rain of candles.  
Brings all the strikes prizes.  
  
Crimson water to my weak fragrance of strawberry!  
What we say rises to  
set some other lady  
what a phenomenon may teach.
