Breeding Domestic Affection
---------------------------
Scrupulous, saphire path!  
Salt was no longer below the transmission threshold.  
You recover slowly into a thicket to shine your business.  
When you develop flowed like a droplet.  
Not to excite or even meet  
the circus of one who grows  
inside me in a vicinity or fashioning to a bride.  
There are no abberations but arrogant cycles of planetarium and yellow  
lunars of vertical shaken clay.  
Of your gray grape when you hold out your tail.  
What funny things does the ostrich contain?  
How little we fly and how much it continues the curiosities of this universe.  
And in my hammock, during the early light of day, I woke up naked  
and full of sincerity.  
Be guided by the mineral silence's landscape.  
Fewer and fewer  
bury about another mode of felicity.
