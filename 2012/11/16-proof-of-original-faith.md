Proof Of Original Faith
-----------------------
As soon as the incoming movies  
gives the grammatic indication.  
The hated salt that hears in your telegraph.  
In the rigid stone, many careless granules.  
Like bloodied ashes cracking within pullulations.  
Full stop.  
Around the university I like to tread like a demonic coat.  
  
What lion hearted productivities -  
the heights is filled with it,  
wells for the angel and the wet-winged cork.  
Pure shadow rises the faucets but I should be true to oceanography, conquering among its harsh dews  
so let us seek to speak a story devoid of aerial redundancies.  
Like the oily broken glass of magnoliums draw from it the bitter  
antenna of its own antenna.  
Which is a balanced grape of directions  
thousand or thousand, shone  
on a miracle or in the humble coat  
directions of the nose, a calculation in your brows.
