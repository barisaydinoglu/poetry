The Wax Fallen Into The Sea
---------------------------
Brutal morning and the frail bird feather  
smear at the walls of my house.  
The nature responding from my mouth.  
I circumscribe as if in front of a fractious mask.  
Wave of wave of pastures rolling  
down the sea.  
I do not impale in the land of smothered gate.  
A furious image rejects  
even the smooth  
public archipeligos in technique  
to which the metaphor  
will not be performed.  
And so that its vortices will conquer your curves.
