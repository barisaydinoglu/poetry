The Mysteries Of The Thicket
----------------------------
What we say promises to  
recover some other bride  
what a camera may teach.  
In the face of so many evils to functionality.  
Like the raucous salt of stones the night within  
hers  
a tale we divulge in passing,  
with notions of respect  
and a passion for photography and photography  
I saw how roots are built  
by the parenthetical tryst.  
Understanding a phemonana  
lighted  
in the brandishing thunder.  
I was without doubt the bride crab  
there in the delirious field.  
When it looked me with its enchanting apple eyes  
it had neither toe nor eyeballs  
but bolt of crystal aromas on its sides.  
I want you to seize on my eye.  
It rescues like a garden around the saxophone.  
When you respond like horse enchanted by the water.  
And trees and apples.
