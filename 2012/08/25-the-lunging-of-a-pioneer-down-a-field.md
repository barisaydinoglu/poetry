The Lunging Of A Pioneer Down A Field
-------------------------------------
Only light, just the  
wave, nothing but  
it. Landscape.  
Misunderstood vaginas and communist dungs.  
Fear and precision - smooth stones of animosity.  
I stayed woke and transluscent sand-colored  
in the middle of the sea.  
You've  
asked me what the pheasant is perching there with his yellow brow?  
I reply, the productivity knows this.
