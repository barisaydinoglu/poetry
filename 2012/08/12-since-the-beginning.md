Since The Beginning
-------------------
The careless cat blushes inside the serene serections.  
A line segment amid a circle,  
the spoiled workings of moonlit law.  
The womb imposes nessecity.  
Morbid weather, obscene lights like the dove.  
Because I love you, love, outside the mud and amid the fire.  
With its neurotic attract your cactus is a bed filled with inaccessible kiss.  
Beligerance and stalks of cattail - praises of beligerance.  
An odor has  
created against the old warrior's medal,  
a mixture of noise and body, a expanding  
praise that brings fear.  
Come with me to the trash barge of violences.  
  
A film pacifying will upgrade  
the putrid jungle of a planet.
