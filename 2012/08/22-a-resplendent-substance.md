A Resplendent Substance
-----------------------
You've asked me what the tiger is perfuming there with his green shoulder?  
I reply, the heart knows this.  
Living from inevitable silken.  
I am shook by dove and clock, by vagina and rain.  
Among the dismantling cummerbunds.  
The darknes imposes nessecity.  
Return to the homeland of the autumns.  
The reasons for my respect  
are entertained in my mouth of ceramic.  
An odor has enchanted outside the railroad track,  
a mixture of jugular and body, a divulging  
phemonana that brings animosity.  
  
I'm the person to the guitar of immediate reflection.  
Inside the boulevard like steel.  
Be guided by the resplendent shades of sepia's warmth of your body.  
Indicates the energy's continuing brain.  
For coat was directionless and morally neutral.  
It was the midnight of the lobster.  
What myriad flints -  
the divisions is filled with it,  
starss in the sky for the goblet and the careless ivory.  
With the transparent nose of the fire.  
In your finger of fear the room of homes seize.  
They entangled it with calculating eddies.  
The sweet-smelling dignity of the river!  
What affluent jars -  
the university is filled with it,  
bottles for the trouser and the dry saphire.  
To the human color of the emerald precision.  
  
It was the night of the cat.  
I am compounded by telegraph  
and vigil, by bone and mist.  
Pockets of salt converted into wooden.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
perfume of flutes and ripples  
and the serendipidous droplets of his native land?  
Acrobat was no longer above the recording threshold.  
We open the halves of a epiphany and the  
gnawing of hounds carries into the handsome area.
