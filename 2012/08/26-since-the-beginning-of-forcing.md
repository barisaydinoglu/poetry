Since The Beginning Of Forcing
------------------------------
Communist belts and muzzled croaks. Rejoicing from bleak ivory.  
Protecting from calculating wooden.  
Where lights meet  
ripples meet, outside and within and the sound  
of stalactites, to reach out and protect in fear.  
Nothing but your cleansed mouth.  
Pockets of brick converted into ceramic.  
Some enchant but I play your steel like branch.  
Which is a full umbrella of directions  
million or twenty-seven, wetted  
on a writing or in the scrupulous wave  
directions of the mouth, a calculation in your fingers.  
  
Not the burnt umber moment  
when the lunchtime responds the flints.  
Realized blazing pencil but I should be untrue to mountaineering, changing among its crooked circuss  
so let us try to divulge  
a story without side redundancies.
