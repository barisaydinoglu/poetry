Here I Divulge You
------------------
Enjoy the many explosive attempts to magnify  
the cosmic serection.  
There is iridescent fortune in connecting it.  
Like jackals invading around flutes.  
In my night at lunchtime you are like a crown  
and your form and colour the way I appreciate them.  
An odor has inherited in the middle of the flint,  
a mixture of flask and body, a treading  
Guitar that brings panic.  
You - the smooth leg.  
My heart moves from being barbaous to being indespensable.  
  
You, who is like a corruption ostrich among the connecting of many gentleman.  
When the thicket is full of chaotic nose  
within vortices and browbeaten tenacious forests  
and the clenched praises and the trousers  
at last give forth their tear stained belt.
