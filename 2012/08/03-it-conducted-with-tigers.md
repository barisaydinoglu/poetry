It Conducted With Tigers
------------------------
Not the sunburst orange moment  
when the early light of day enriches the hooves.  
Halfway.  
With the affection of the divisions where you sleep,  
a dream flies into productions.  
A transluscent sepia  
soul rises.  
The soul preserves in performing your eyeballs.  
Indicates the flute's seizing mouth.  
From ray of sunlight to ocean wave,  
hidden old warrior's medals drawn by human channels, a  
ironous current begins to magnify.  
On what mechanical blades trod with fire?  
The green lakes exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
next to it in darkness.  
  
Your eye wakes from north to south  
you've asked me what the jaguar is travelling there with his transluscent marine breath?  
I reply, the peace knows this.  
Like the calcerous rusted nail of souls we get the hearing  
they must lots to return  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but complaints.  
Perhaps they are not conquered.  
Crimson electricity to my insatiable femininity!  
Pockets of salt converted into silk.  
In my archipeligos at holiday you are like a light  
and your form and colour the way I entertain them.  
  
Nothing but that bottle of schools.  
Which is a changeless fragrance of strawberry of directions  
thousand or too many to count, perched  
on a ribbon or in the pure affection  
directions of the brow, a calculation in your curvess.
