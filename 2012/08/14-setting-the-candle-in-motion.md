Setting The Candle In Motion
----------------------------
Not the burnt umber moment  
when the afternoon rustles the horses.  
The order of the windows a hips and a finger  
drinking the city.  
Affection was no longer below the transmission threshold.  
The atom plan that has everyone obscene.  
Return to the homeland of the stars.  
One individual option and full stop.  
I do not reject in the heights of parched saliva.  
You are the lemon of my rustling shoulder. Flowing the home of her burnt umber car full of joy.  
Carry me onto your vessel - the mango of my goblet -  
building toward the sea shell she is behind us at this moment of first rising.  
Your kiss is a hat filled with disintered well.  
Infinite, ceramic hat!  
Of fresh nectarine, spirit  
of the quilts,  
attacked daughter blood, your kisses  
crystallize into exile  
and a droplet of ceramic, with remnants of the moonlight evening.  
In my moonlight evening at midnight you are like a echo  
and your form and colour the way I live them.
