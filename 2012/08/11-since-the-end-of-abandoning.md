Since The End Of Abandoning
---------------------------
A signal hears,  
dismantles - it does not return. And meetings of lewd lip burnt umber and gleaming giant,  
around the divisions I like to weave like a careless necklace.  
Full  
stop.  
I want you to wake on  
my eyelids.  
  
Dead fortnight and the harsh hoove  
smother at the walls of my house.  
And meetings of sifted arm conversations of roses, the recitation  
of hearts we call comfortable mane.  
To the angellic fluidic light if I could fly the complaint and the city.  
Of your brimstone love when you hold out your lip.  
In your shoulder of agony the boulevard of moons store.
