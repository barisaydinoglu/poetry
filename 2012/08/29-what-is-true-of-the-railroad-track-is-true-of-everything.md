What Is True Of The Railroad Track Is True Of Everything
--------------------------------------------------------
And starry skies and souls.  
It is a tale of wet-winged circumstances I saw how honeysuckles are flowed  
by the cleansed flag.  
Be guided by the infinite starry sky's propeller.  
When the night is full of difficult eyeballs  
with whispers and forceful putrid lighthouses  
and the senile acrobats and the planetariums  
at last give forth their torrential wound.  
It was a bruised business of rectum and invasions.  
All flower heads become pamphlets.  
A loop behind a circle,  
The spoiled workings of handsome law.  
Only promise, just the  
promise, nothing but  
it. Juice.  
And so that its shrapnels will prosecute your hips.  
On what forceful lineages relaxed with ice?  
Carry me onto your train - the banana of my prize -  
  
A detail magnifies,  
undulates - it does not return.  
In the face of so many bloodied aluminums to positivity.
