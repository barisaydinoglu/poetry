The Phenomenon Of Side Points
-----------------------------
My full nose responds you always.  
Of your black pullulation when you hold out your eyeballs.  
Shut up and shut up like a vein.  
Around the university I like to grow like a lewd tiger.  
In front of the deluding clefts.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem  
so to another.  
The schools exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
in it in darkness.  
Map was no longer below the recording threshold.  
To mix lost springtimes and for moons.  
What falters the props of wonder?  
You say, what is the thread waiting for in its cashmire heart?  
I tell you it is waiting for lemon like you.  
The serendipity chirping from my brow.  
As if to plague or pulse or crush.  
In the blood colored fear of the convict.  
What executes the props of sincerity?
