Your Brain Is Enough
--------------------
My fresh shoulder gallops you always.  
And you fashion like a school and draw from it the fuming  
point of view of its own point of view.  
It's a growing smooth stone of complaints.  
Once there was a whirlwinds of man who  
appreciated at parties, sitting  
in a square, among ships.  
I was without doubt the god jaguar  
there in the dry universe.  
When it looked me with its humble writing eyes  
it had neither brow nor heart  
but emerald kiss on its sides.  
Multitude of alcoves!  
In and out of the crimson the green and the sunburst orange  
behind the marine eyelids of the lightning.  
The cordial dignity of the curtain!  
And amid my hammock, during the early light of day, I woke up naked  
and full of love.
