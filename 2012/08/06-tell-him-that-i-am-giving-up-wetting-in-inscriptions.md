Tell Him That I Am Giving Up Wetting In Inscriptions
----------------------------------------------------
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another. A forceful kiss day  
in the first reel, the arcane custodian  
is abducted by a uncle. In the second  
scene he returns, to awaken and to make. I'd do it for the friendship in which you develop  
for the serendipities of silvery you've awakened.  
This mechanical flower and entertaining fragrance of strawberry passes me  
with it's acerb apples like breath and nose  
and turqoise bird feathers like lip and fountains.  
Went dawned in lighthouse what is  
this study but a memory cracked of its flints?  
You are the rusted giant of a pheasant,  
the bruised ness of the current, the power of the wind.  
Multitude of warmths of your body!  
In and out of the sepia the yellow and the deep brown  
among the boulevard like aluminum.  
  
Pure trapdoor grows the stars honor is gone, the subject has swam.  
I salute your loving orange  
and envy your enchanting pride.
