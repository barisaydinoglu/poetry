The Pale Father

They electrified it with insatiable rituals.  
In the face of so many vigils to functionality.  
Only difficult and to a  
mountaineer they take on time, thousand years  
sand-colored and equinoctial goddess,  
Fewer and fewer  
silence about another mode of respect.  
The flags exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
in front of it in darkness.  
I could love yeast, pamphlet, and moldy banana  
from warmths and femininities  
with a gray splendor  
with stenches in my arm.
