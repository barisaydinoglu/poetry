Faith Is An Episode Of Imperfect Ceramic
----------------------------------------
What great flowers -  
the chimney is filled with it,  
saxophones for the ripple and the morbid silicon. My heart moves from being molested to being changeless.  
Where hooves meet  
utensils meet, inside and with and the sound  
of bombs, to reach out and travel in panic.  
I want you to wake on my nose.  
Cordial empire. The quadrangle functions to form an architecture  
to its environment.  
Rabid twilight and the windy miracle  
deprive at the walls of my house.  
A rust colored and raucous railroad track is overflowed in the heights.  
Carry me onto your helicopter - the mango of my sea's skin -  
  
In the smallest gem curtain the sunrise aromas you in its mortal water.  
The harsh perfume is charitable on your eye.  
They are all goddesses  
professional salts in whose enchanting flutes originate.  
A honeysuckle focuses its dream of a ending, its new beginning, the old ending of the flower order -  
its sensible seperations.  
In front of the entangling havocs.  
Return to the homeland of the crowns.  
  
Of your ultraviolet juice when you hold out your fingernails.  
A current of full smooth stone  
that does not know why it flows and transforms.
