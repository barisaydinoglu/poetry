Hearing As Lards
----------------
Like wastelands coddling in front of sea shells.  
I could travel havoc, night, and cummerbund  
from wine bottles and bells  
with a blood colored guitar  
with violas in my shoulder.  
She is behind us at this moment of first understanding.  
In the first scene, the fresh pioneer  
is throttled by a mountaineer. In the second  
take he returns, to hear and to relinquish.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the brandishing lakes?  
And the rain blazing splattering its jars and smearing them full of  
vicinity and squirrel?  
The reasons for my respect  
are grew in my arm of paper-mache.  
  
With its neurotic rustle you, who is like a vigil bird among the understanding of many elder.  
The delicious uncle  
loves in the changeless morning.  
Carry me onto your boat - the cherry of my jar -  
they bristled it with wounded foams.  
You see ears as smooth as the snow.  
You see ears as decisive as the thunder.  
Shining toward the star the rusted wreath that promises in your foliage.  
There are no complaints but frail cycles of tryst and marine  
pencils of vertical harsh ash.  
Silvery and parenthetical woman,  
we get the color  
they must lots to light  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but brambles.  
Perhaps they are not wiped.  
Towards those acrobats of yours that wait for me.  
A rambunctious phenomenon decays  
even the lyrical  
aerial jungle in inscription  
to which the metaphor  
will not be transformed.  
And smooth rusted nails and flutes.
