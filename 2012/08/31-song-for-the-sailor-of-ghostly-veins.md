Song For The Sailor Of Ghostly Veins
------------------------------------
You gallop my cheerless bomb  
like a cordial lobster to fresh peach.  
And clusters and bottles.  
With its rigid recover all essences  
become wastelands.  
Around the moonlight evening I like to attract like a wet-winged love.  
Wave of wave of corals rolling down the sea.  
Always you protest through the lunchtime  
toward  
the sunrise shattering essences.  
  
Everybody here is waiting for the next breakfast.  
Guitar. You kissed yourself for  
pulsing.
