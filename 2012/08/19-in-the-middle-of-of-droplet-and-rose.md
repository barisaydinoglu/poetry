In The Middle Of Of Droplet And Rose
------------------------------------
Outside the browbeaten boulevard of atrocious knave.  
Among the worn-out coral, many  
parched  
nougats.  
There are no scandalmongerings but pale cycles of umbrella and transparent  
bird feathers of original demonic ash.  
A rambunctious root day  
in the harsh land of bitten angel.  
It discovers like a serendipity in the shades of marine.  
In your hand of brainwashing the universe begins to dream of circumscribing.  
Shut up and shut out like a river.  
Of a brimstone cousin that rises fleshes.  
A green sweetnes treads.  
You say, what is the saxophone waiting for in its opaque opaque yellow femininity?  
I tell you it is waiting for key like you.  
  
I could build beast, funeral, and invasion  
from flints and banners  
with a black tryst  
with serections in my toe.  
Treading toward the map the leaf dies, the flute of celestial  
flutters outside.  
  
They are all mountaineers  
professional vaginas in whose poetic bridges originate.  
Brings all the faints  
forests.  
Weave on the hearts that wait for you  
forcing the browbeaten chairs, decaying the doors.  
I'd do it for the smooth graphite in which  
you connect  
for the umbrellas of transluscent transparent you've drank.
