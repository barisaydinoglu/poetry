The Animosity Of The Technical Narrative
----------------------------------------
So the ancient purity lives on in a mango,  
the moonlit house  
of the starlight,  
the romantic lake that is esoteric and balanced. A curves and a finger  
creating the thicket.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
From tornado to blade of grass,  
hidden curtains drawn by angellic channels, a  
exiled jar begins to live.  
Creating from rambunctious paper-mache.
