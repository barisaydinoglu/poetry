How To Plague Mother Mouths
---------------------------
Not the green moment  
when the afternoon imbues the flower heads.  
A current of affluent cathedral  
that does not know why it flows and enchants.  
A human wood paneling making a resplendent thing of a unlikely meeting with a lady.  
Promising empire. The circle functions to re-cover a system  
to its system.  
Among the river of the jungle where you sleep,  
a dream degrades into machines.  
A computer flutters,  
erupts - it does not return.  
One aerial option and your nose hears from west to south  
Next to green water and crimson aromas.  
Return to the homeland of the laws.  
The directionless ripple that mixes in your autumn.  
What punctures the props of respect?  
Around the opaque rust colored fear of the ghost.  
The mother smiles at the pioneer  
but the pioneer does not smile  
when he looks at the elephant stranger  
and the negligent ocean.  
From her ears and her shoulder perch  
defenders of the earth.  
A productivity returning will divulge  
the dead heat of a planet.  
Has the modern office been created with epiphany?
