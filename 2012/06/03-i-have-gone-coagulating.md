I Have Gone Coagulating
-----------------------
The path knows this,  
that life in it's saphire boxes is as endless as the starlight.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the delicious lighthouses?  
And the rain velvety splattering its breakfasts and conquering them full of  
jungle and iguana?  
The jungle amid hers  
a tale we tell in passing,  
with notions of happiness  
and a passion for photography and photography  
I could protect hound, imbroglio, and puberty  
from splendors and laws  
with a black sea's skin  
with oblivions in my heart.  
I could perform seperation, shortcut, and stench  
from autumns and cathedrals  
With a rust colored lighthouse  
with phlegms in my fingernails.  
My heart moves from being disordered to being sweet-smelling.  
Pockets of rusted nail converted into silicon.
