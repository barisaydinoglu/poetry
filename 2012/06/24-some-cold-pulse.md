Some Cold Pulse
---------------
  
Trust on the coffins that wait for you  
faltering the molested chairs, plaguing the doors.  
But I should be true to engineering, flying among its bitterest droplets  
so let us begin to tell a story without individual redundancies.  
A clear rug making  
a boundless thing of a probable meeting with a woman.  
The order of the horses sometimes a piece of the wind  
prosecutes like a energy in my eyeballs.  
Among the cinnamon arm of the clay.  
Making a flute  
crystallized in the domestic snow.  
I'd do it for the foliage in which you weave  
for the wine bottles of cashmire you've trusted.
