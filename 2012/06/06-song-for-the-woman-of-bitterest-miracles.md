Song For The Woman Of Bitterest Miracles
----------------------------------------
A current of full bottle  
that does not know why it flows and blossoms.  
From her ears and her lip crystallize  
drops of the earth.  
Always you abolish through the holiday  
toward the sunset drowning trousers.  
Next to the turqoise embarassement of the vigil.  
It's a dawning root of holes.  
You are the torrential elder of a bird,  
the raucous ness of the momentum, the power of the ice.  
The reasons for my respect  
are sought in my tail of glass.  
The ironous jaguar breathes outside the acerb clefts. And so that its scandalmongerings will impale your shoulder.  
It's a trusting salt of cadavers.
