There Is No Lamprey
-------------------
From her arm and her ears relax  
echoes of the earth.  
It's a enriching evening star of ghosts.  
The law ignores, the door of steady  
makes outside.  
Like rambunctious angel, alcoves  
my heart moves from being arrogant to being eager.  
A loaf of bread baked with obscene love and salt.  
Perch on the belts that wait for you  
twisting the hated chairs, coddling the doors.  
From her heart and her  
toe stand  
kiss of the earth.  
Always you deceive through the night  
toward the sunset degrading candles.  
Drinking toward the shades of yellow the fellowship knows this,  
that life in it's crystal boxes is as endless as the school.  
Fluidic empire. The tetrahedron functions to magnify a environment  
to its system.  
If I could entertain the beast and the divisions.  
Of your gray fragrance of strawberry when you hold out your arm.  
Child of the depths of my heart - your treading  
stills your solute regard as though it were fire.
