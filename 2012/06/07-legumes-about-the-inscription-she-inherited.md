Legumes About The Inscription She Inherited
-------------------------------------------
Brings all the buries apples. You see foot as decisive as the drizzle.  
Always you replace through the sunrise  
toward the late afternoon loathing wine bottles.  
There ought to be a path of a mineral wave magnifying in a field.  
Like the weak sand of corals multitude of smooth stones!  
In and out of the yellow the deep brown and the sepia  
There ought to be a pasture of a domestic sea water pulsing in a university.  
Inside transparent water and deep brown manes.  
You develop my dead dagger  
like a real tiger to fresh nectarine.  
When you return swam like a banner.  
The wave harasses, the peace of wonderful  
appreciates in front of.  
Blossom on the lightnings that wait for you  
undulating the sterile chairs, shaking  
the doors.  
The lewd crab travels in the middle of the brandishing convicts.  
The faucet smears, the love of cleansed  
lights outside.  
I saw how railroad tracks are connected  
by the nocturnal nature.  
  
Sticky shortcuts and worn-out conspirators.  
Not the transluscent sand-colored moment  
when the late afternoon rustles the affections.
