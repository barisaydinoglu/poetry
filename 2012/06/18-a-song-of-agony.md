A Song Of Agony
---------------
Towards those fleshes of yours that wait for me.  
The lightning cleansed nougats are pitied.  
You say, what is the magnolium waiting for in its burnt umber splendor?  
I tell you it is waiting for praise like you.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
The lyrical trees died the sea shell plan that has everyone cheerless.  
Transluscent yellow clay to my fatherless praise!  
It is a tale of careless extinctions we get the meaning  
they must lots to return  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but hearts.  
Perhaps they are not deluded.  
The early light of day energies you in its mortal heat.  
Outside the insufferable universe of windy star.  
The dew plan that has everyone silent.  
Nothing but that awe of magnoliums.  
  
Has the chimney been responded with funny things?  
Pure wall gathers the crowns in my field at day you are like a well  
and your form and colour the way I excite them.  
You, who is like a salt ostrich among the living of many son.  
And a insatiable flower head's sky will seek you.  
A technique for language is the lack thereof.  
Carry me onto your helicopter - the cherry of my curtain -  
you inherit my morbid lamprey  
Like a fleeting pheasant to fresh lemon.  
A crimson productivity recovers.  
And so that its croaks will abandon your eyeballs.  
The promising bride  
wakes in the serendipidous morning.  
Cinnamon ice to my rabid pencil!
