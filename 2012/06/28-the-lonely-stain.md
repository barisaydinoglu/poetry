The Lonely Stain
----------------
A ship is not enough to disguise me and keep me  
from the divisions of your celestial funny things.  
I took on frail miracles.  
Someone here is waiting for the next ship.  
Defender. You grew yourself for relinquishing. Like beasts condemning in front of honeysuckles.  
The order of the wine bottles not the transluscent cinnamon moment  
when the twilight divulges the emerald architectures.  
You say, what is the moon waiting for in its sunburst orange knave?  
I tell you it is waiting for mane like you.  
The lightning round pamphlets are pitied.  
My lyrical fingernails reconciles you always.  
When the sea is  
full of disintered brow  
outside massacres and tremulous chaotic maps  
and the mechanical acrobats and the river banks  
at last give forth their bleak funeral.  
I could recover yeast, funeral, and lamprey  
from poppies and sweetness  
with a red saxophone  
with serections in my fingernails.
