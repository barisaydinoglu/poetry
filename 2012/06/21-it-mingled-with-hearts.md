It Mingled With Hearts
----------------------
The clenched quiver is aromatic on your hand. There are no cities but muzzled cycles of cathedral and crimson  
grapes of stationary crooked metal. Conversations of perfumes, the recitation  
of sunburst orange cars we call absorbant writing.  
A loaf of bread baked with disintered joy and salt.  
You've asked me what the iguana is reconciling there with his blue brow?  
I reply, the warmth of your body knows this.  
You awaken in the moonlight  
evening as in a clear city.  
We open the halves of a epiphany and the  
loathing of jackals rescues into the solute region.  
Amid cinnamon water and cinnamon branches.  
My boundless shoulder showers you always.
