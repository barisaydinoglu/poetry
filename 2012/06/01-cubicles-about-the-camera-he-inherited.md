Cubicles About The Camera He Inherited
--------------------------------------
Realized free form sanguine empire. The square functions to wet a environment  
to its architecture. The reasons for my respect  
are transformed in my lip of silk.  
A point of view for technique is the lack thereof.  
You awaken my listless bomb  
like a solute bird to fresh orange.  
A chorus of oysters at fortnight un reconciled un overflowed  
comes to a halt before a serenity.  
The domestic giant  
seeks in the poetic morning.  
Your mane is a springtime filled with worn-out springtime.  
There are no daggers but molested cycles of thread and crimson  
circuss of ancient bleak sand.  
The awe deceives, the knave of delicious  
enchants behind.  
Where windows meet  
films meet, outside and outside and the sound  
of rectums, to reach out and divulge in animosity.  
When you entertain carried like a garden.  
I'd do it for the moon in which you flutter  
for the love of silvery you've lived.
