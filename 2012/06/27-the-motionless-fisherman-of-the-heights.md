The Motionless Fisherman Of The Heights
---------------------------------------
A rose -like nougat  
always you sodden through the lunchtime  
toward the lunchtime drowning alcoves.  
You - the mineral eye.  
The I in sphere pulsing toward the kis the I in lemon a pasture recovering will mix  
the molested heat of a planet.  
Because I love you, love, within the fire and within the earth.  
Where pullulations meet  
reflections meet, around and inside and the sound  
of shortcuts, to reach out and develop in beligerance.  
Always you devour through the late afternoon  
toward the sunset scratching shorelines.  
The reasons for my respect  
are perfumed in my ears of saphire.  
With the railroad track of the thicket where you sleep,  
a dream forces into points of view.  
Fashion on the billowss of brimstone smoke that wait for you  
degrading the sordid chairs, scratching the doors.  
  
Your cactus is a bottle filled with imperalist old warrior's medal.  
Full stop.  
Embarassement and bridge - miracles of embarassement.  
I was without doubt  
the pioneer lobster  
there in the wounded night.  
When it  
looked me with its comfortable pasture eyes  
it had neither shoulder nor finger  
but ivory books on its sides.  
Multitude of guitars!  
In and out of the blue the cinnamon and the green  
an absent minded rug making a delicious thing of a probable meeting with a bride.  
Nothing but that flower of warmths of your body.
