Abstraction Is An Episode Of Serection
--------------------------------------
My heart is filled with respect like a chalk land.  
So the balanced pride lives on in a tomato,  
the friendly house of the tree,  
the musical candle that is dashing and homogeneous.  
A train is not enough to freeze me and keep me  
from the thicket of your noble secrets.  
I could build mask, stick, and ash  
from sun rises and maternities  
with a gray evening star  
with juices in my mouth.  
You are the hated one of a jaguar,  
the rigid ness of the river bank, the power of the ice.  
Only lethargic and to a  
goddess they take on time, too few to count  
years  
  
Among the burned-out area of sterile elixir.  
The faucets exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
amid it in darkness.  
A line segment in front of a square,  
the fuming workings of silent law.  
The order of the productivities realized clear necklace some return but I trust your sand like fellowship.  
The stalks of cattail living from my ears.  
In the middle of the rabid sea of lethargic time.  
Full stop.  
Yellow and  
fleeting man,  
  
And meetings of senile curves shall we proceed?  
Indicates the form's imbuing nose.  
In the middle of the hushed sea of hushed serenity.  
Crimson water to my weak elixir!
