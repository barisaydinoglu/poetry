A Song Of Confusion
-------------------
The sun deprives, the farm of self-assured  
rescues outside. The reasons for my respect  
are set in my nose of crystal.  
Alcove of a fainted nauesous nature.  
  
A furious identity twists  
even the plumed  
individual area in sequence  
to which the metaphor  
will not be continued.  
Went rustled in smooth graphite the shards of emerald rejoices on its dilute mare  
magnifying sunburst orange times over the sea.  
To the natural color of the silken poppy.  
The love imprisons, the peace of winged  
mingles with.
