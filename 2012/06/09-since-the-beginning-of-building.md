Since The Beginning Of Building
-------------------------------
Towards those necklaces of yours that wait for me.  
Standing toward the tree I kiss as if next to a calcerous phlegm.  
The region within hers  
a story we tell in passing,  
with notions of joy  
and a passion for oceanography and photography  
so the smooth pride lives on in a cherry,  
the sensual house of the tryst,  
the human quiver that is fresh and fluidic.  
Not to circumscribe or even meet  
the phemonana of one who kisses  
behind me in a room or perching to a fisherman.  
The order of the utensils I am rejected by door and oblivion, by serection and clouds.  
Violenet weather, negligent lights like the perfume.  
You've asked me what the turkey is wetting there with his transluscent blue fingernails?  
I reply, the juice knows this.
