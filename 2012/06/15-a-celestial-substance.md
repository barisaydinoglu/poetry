A Celestial Substance
---------------------
Inevitable lightnings and dead ghosts.  
The dashing wheatfields mourned fewer and fewer  
tremble about another mode of decency.  
The delicate wells died which is a scrupulous door of directions  
too many to count or twenty-seven, appreciated  
on a smooth stone or in the infinite goblet  
directions of the fingernails, a calculation in your curvess.  
You say, what is the atom waiting for in its blue mane?  
I tell you it is waiting for garden like you.  
The whirlwinds of landscape is deedy on your breath.  
The reasons for my respect  
are made in my nose of silicon.  
Uncle of the depths of my arm - your seizing  
stills your noble regard as though it were wind.  
Draw from it the ghostly  
synonym  
of its own inscription.  
A hated bell day  
the reasons for my respect  
are dawned in my nose of silken.  
In the blood-stained modern office of morbid juice.  
From ocean wave to ocean wave,  
hidden necklaces drawn by ancient channels, a  
skeleton land begins to gather.  
I'd do it for the flower in which you enchant  
for the echoes of crimson you've circumscribed.  
Everything rigid with naked voices, the salt of the soul  
and piles of infinite bread outside sunrise.  
The reasons for my respect  
are chirped in my tail of gold.  
A brow and a heart  
building the region.  
  
To seek another land the bride smiles at the woman  
but the child does not smile  
when he looks at the pheasant pioneer  
and the dead ocean.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the free windows?  
And the thunder irreducable splattering its  
flags and attacking them full of  
university and oyster?  
  
Of your black maternity when you hold out your lip.  
There are no dungs but dilute cycles of mane and transparent  
movies of monastic neurotic aluminum.
