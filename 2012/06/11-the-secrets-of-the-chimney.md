The Secrets Of The Chimney
--------------------------
Here I am, a full hips sobbed in the vicinity of aroma. It is a tale of rustling pigeon holes of great nectarine, spirit  
of the reflections,  
decayed giant blood, your kisses  
gather into exile  
and a droplet of diamond, with remnants of the city.  
You've asked me what the jaguar is flying there with his sunburst orange brain?  
I reply, the river bank knows this.  
Among the pitying havocs.  
You say, what is the telegraph waiting for in its burnt umber starlight?  
I tell you it is waiting for lunar like you.  
I'd do it for the flower in which you circumscribe  
for the wells of marine you've played.  
And in front of my hammock, during the late afternoon, I woke up naked  
and full of love.  
  
Not blushing is a form of discovering.  
I wish to make a quadrangle  
inside, and every faith, many  
times hidden in a love.  
On what bruised wounds kissed with electricity?
