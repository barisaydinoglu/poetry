I Have Gone Replacing
---------------------
My lyrical arm showers you always. Troubled moldy bananas and spoiled oxides.  
The lyrical custodian  
continues in the lyrical morning.  
Our new serendipity, our charitable cathedral tetrahedrons.  
  
Re-cover on the gates that wait for you  
stealing the sterile chairs, scratching the doors.  
If you were not the cheesecake the absent minded moon  
cooks, sprinkling its bread across the archipeligos.  
The night juices you in its mortal sky.  
  
Behind the turqoise sorrow of the havoc.  
Always you abhor through the afternoon  
toward the early light of day rejecting guitars.  
Garden of a twisted obscene wave.
