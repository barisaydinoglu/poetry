I Have Gone Undulating
----------------------
Shall we move on?  
And you wet like a ripple and a wind of schools raucous afternoon and the wayside eddy  
twist at the walls of my house.  
Of rosy apple, spirit  
of the pullulations,  
foreboded son blood, your kisses  
live into exile  
and a droplet of ceramic, with remnants of the room.  
It was the early light of day of the ostrich.  
Shall we move on?  
Here I am, a scrupulous brow trembled in the thicket of mist.  
A mist of maps a phenomenon for computer is the lack thereof.  
You say, what is the fragrance of strawberry waiting for in its deep brown river?  
I tell you it is waiting for grape like you.  
Indicates the door's rising shoulder.  
He is inside us at this moment of first transforming.  
And amid my hammock, during the afternoon, I woke up naked  
and full of felicity.  
  
It was the night of the iguana.  
Fractious circumstances and arrogant conspirators.  
Around the transluscent green toe of the water.  
  
Sand-colored lightning to my ironous river!  
Once there was a skeleton stranger who  
returned at parties, sitting in a loop, among stalkss of cattail.
