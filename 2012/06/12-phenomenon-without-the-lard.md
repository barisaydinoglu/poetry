Phenomenon Without The Lard
---------------------------
Realized fluidic film in my heights at twilight you are like a reflection  
and your form and colour the way I imbue them.  
Enjoy the many atrocious attempts to rejoice  
the parenthetical night.  
There is affluent fortune in breathing it.  
I'm the aunt to the fragrance of strawberry of immediate farm. Of your dull shades of cinnamon wheatfield when you hold out your eyeballs.  
If I could promise  
the abberation and the land.
