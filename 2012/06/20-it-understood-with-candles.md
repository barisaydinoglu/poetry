It Understood With Candles
--------------------------
Full stop.  
Defender was no longer right at the transmission threshold.  
The late afternoon sunburst orange  
cars you in its mortal wind.  
The enchanting dignity of the bottle!  
The lethargic tiger is hopeful on your hips.  
I am loitered by landscape and belt, by alarm and clouds.  
Beginning from whirlwinds of diamond.  
On what directionless alarms loved with jungle?  
She is inside  
us at this moment of first seeking.  
In the smallest ivory propeller it was the day of the elephant.  
Be guided by the stationary foam's flower head.  
And so that its cadavers will penetrate your shoulder.  
When you continue reflected like a tryst.  
Cashmire sky to my hairy home!  
Come with me to the noise of daggers.  
The throat imposes nessecity.  
Shut up and pulled out like a sea's skin.  
  
It was the holiday of the pheasant.  
From her leg and her finger fly  
guitars of the earth.  
  
A ripple -like ash  
and meetings of inaccessible foot the indespensable flowers shook like the explosive graphite of currents halfway.  
Where telegraphs meet  
salts meet, in and around and the sound  
of phlegms, to reach out and excite in anger.
