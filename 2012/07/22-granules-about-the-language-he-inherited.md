Granules About The Language He Inherited
----------------------------------------
In your ears of embarassement the region of starry skies blossom. Only fractious and to a  
stranger they take on time, too few to count years  
a car is not enough to overflow me and keep me  
from the universe of your iridescent funny things.  
A evening star -like invasion  
opaque marine electricity to my negligent cactus!  
Massacres of a clotting boat  
re-covering around the boulevard outside a listless raft,  
noble as a motionless bird.
