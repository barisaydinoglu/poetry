From Electricity To Fire
------------------------
In your foot of agony the vicinity of cactuss enrich.  
Conversations of ships, the recitation  
of magnoliums we call fleeting productivity.  
You are the raucous fisherman of a squirrel,  
the melancholy ness of the juice, the power of the clay.  
Domestic, glass candle!  
The bitterest ostrich circumscribes outside the sensual convicts.  
And a clotting fragrance of strawberry's mud will attract you.  
It was a nauesous business of flask and brambles.  
Only bell, just the  
garden, nothing but  
it. Stars in the sky.  
Of a brimstone one that refreshes telegraphs.  
I was without doubt the person elephant  
there in the furious heights.  
When it looked me with its lyrical springtime eyes  
it had neither finger nor arm  
but bolt of paper-mache trysts on its sides.  
Not to return or even meet  
the lake of one who mixes  
outside me in a divisions or dedicating to an aunt.  
I salute your essential grape  
and envy your deedy pride.  
A current of blazing mosaic  
that does not know why it flows and blushes.  
I was without doubt the mother lobster  
there in the frightened boulevard.  
When it looked me with its incredulous lighthouse eyes  
it had neither fingernails nor hips  
but diamond flags on its sides.  
  
A tetrahedron within a square,  
the hairy  
workings of decisive law.
