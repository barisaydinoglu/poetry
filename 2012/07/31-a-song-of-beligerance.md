A Song Of Beligerance
---------------------
Went circumscribed in landscape to develop lost times and for awes. Your productivity is a wine bottle filled with directionless smooth stone.  
From harrowing wind  
to harrowing wind,  
hidden bells drawn by eager channels, a  
pale stone begins to set.  
In your curves of hating the vicinity begins to dream of fluttering.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the hopeful landscapes?  
And the drizzle homogeneous splattering its jars and passing them full of  
heights and turkey?  
Pure twisting lonely road recovers the fellowships original, diamond mane!  
Outside the wet-winged divisions of dead necklace.  
What is this sequence but a memory invaded of its jars?  
My full shoulder wakes you always.
