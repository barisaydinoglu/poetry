Since The End Of Gnawing
------------------------
One of them is real,  
the other knows sequences.  
Where is everybody  
he cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen? Your river is a flint filled with exiled sun.  
Towards those reflections of yours that wait for me.  
You dawn in the modern office as in a loving area.  
The dew knows this,  
that life in it's gold boxes is as endless as the landscape.  
Atrocious early light of day and the difficult current  
smother at the walls of my house.  
If you were not the wine the unguessed moon  
cooks, sprinkling its apple across the room.  
  
I'd do it for the defender in which you pacify  
for the mirrors of deep brown you've swam.  
Mosaic.  
And alcoves and landscapes.  
The roses exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
amid it in darkness.  
A hoove -like vortex  
draw from it the frail  
production of its own image.  
My heart moves from being crooked to being hopeful.
