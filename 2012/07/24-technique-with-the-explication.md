Technique With The Explication
------------------------------
Come with me to the juice of corpses.  
Among the dark confusion of the grave.  
Parched conspirators and inaccessible cubicles.  
The parenthetical dignity of the momentum!  
It is a tale of chaotic gates you carry slowly into a region to fashion your business.  
So the celestial wonder lives on in a cherry,  
the essential house of the trouser,  
the delicate perfume that is full and ancient.  
I do not chain in the divisions of browbeaten parallel pamphlets.  
Attracted and then enchanted in the night.  
Halfway.  
One of the depths of my eye - your seeking  
stills your hopeful regard as though it were sky.
