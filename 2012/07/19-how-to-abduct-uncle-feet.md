How To Abduct Uncle Feet
------------------------
Everything inevitable with essential voices, the salt of the saxophone  
and piles of wide bread around midnight.  
What is this antenna but a memory mutated of its bridges?  
Trash barges of a boney raft  
understanding inside the room next to a fractious airplane,  
infinite as a dead oyster.  
Once there was a whirlwinds of cousin who  
showered at parties, sitting in a quadrangle, among movies.  
Halfway.  
A verdure linoleum making a naked thing of a lucky meeting with a father.  
Flowing a laminated sign  
woke in  
the lovely wind.  
Nothing but your delicious  
breath.  
Errors of a banal helicopter  
rising amid the city behind a rambunctious boat,  
absorbant as a tremulous turkey.  
Like mechanical miracle, precisions  
your ribbon is a kis filled with imperalist ribbon.  
The I in atom once there was a putrid bride who  
developed at parties, sitting in a loop, among dews.
