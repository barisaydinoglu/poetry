From What Are Shadess Of Sepia Flowed
-------------------------------------
The vicinity outside hers  
a story we tell in passing,  
with notions of joy  
and a passion for jouranlism and photography a black and directionless fellowship is dropped in the university.  
Inevitable dungs and weak puberties.  
My heart is filled with decency like a ceramic heart.  
You say, what is the aroma waiting for in its silvery droplet?  
I tell you it is waiting for silence like you.  
Full stop.  
A loaf of bread baked with cheerless happiness and salt.  
I saw how circuss are discovered  
by the domestic forest.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the handsome energies?  
And the clouds steady splattering its stones and entangling them full of  
sea and oyster?  
The I in drop everything guilt with parsimonious voices, the salt of the starlight  
and piles of rosy bread amid late afternoon.  
How flying is the rosy vortex and it's hidden wombs?  
All peaces become dungs.  
  
Fewer and fewer  
crush about another  
mode of joy.  
The horses exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
in it in darkness.  
  
The order of the flints has the modern office been conducted with secrets?  
Ship was no longer below the transmission threshold.  
What curiosities does the elephant contain?  
How little we pacify and how much it kisses the curiosities of this universe.  
What great shorelines -  
the archipeligos is filled with it,  
affections for the quiver and the shifty gold.
