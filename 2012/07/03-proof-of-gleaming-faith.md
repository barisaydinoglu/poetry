Proof Of Gleaming Faith
-----------------------
Of arcane lemon, spirit  
of the corals,  
plagued stranger blood, your kisses  
form into exile  
and a droplet of bolt of paper-mache, with remnants of the area.  
Our new copper architecture, our real cactus quadrangles.  
I'm the father to the wheatfield of immediate sun.  
A brimstone and shaken land is overflowed in the area.
