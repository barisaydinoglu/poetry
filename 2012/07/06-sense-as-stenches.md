Sense As Stenches
-----------------
And you scratched in the beligerance and fashioned a decaying wounded soldier.  
Rustling weather, atrocious lights like the awe.  
Everything skeleton with celestial voices, the salt of the ritual  
and piles of fleeting bread outside twilight.  
Blood-stained weather, blood-stained lights like the serendipity.  
For a day, maybe too few to count,  
I rested under a unrelenting rain  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the woman to be outside.  
A circle next to a line segment,  
the bleak  
workings of steady law.  
  
The solute flute gave it purity.  
This lashed current and flying maternity wets me  
with it's celestial mists like brow and brow  
and turqoise horses like brow and paths.
