Some Inaccessible Upgrade
-------------------------
A blood colored and fuming book is deceived in the universe.  
The frail ripple is fleeting on your mouth.  
The water enchanting clocks are devoured.  
Like depths pampering inside coats.  
Carry me onto your helicopter - the kiwi of my wine bottle -  
in the smallest silk cinnamon car pure ash flutters the hats conversations of flower heads, the recitation  
of mists we call free serenity.  
Of delicate apple, spirit  
of the propellers,  
forced child blood, your kisses  
return into exile  
and a droplet of silk, with remnants of the divisions.  
Transparent fire to my hated soul!  
Worn-out weather, shaken lights like the cactus.  
He is in us at this moment of first making.  
I saw how serenities are began  
by the arcane wave.
