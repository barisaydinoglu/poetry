Sordid Silence
--------------
As soon as the incoming tigers  
gives the aerial indication. Shall we set forth?  
Only coral, just the  
planetarium, nothing but  
it. Sphere.  
To seek another land what is this calculation but a memory sobbed of its grapes?  
My heart is filled with love like a gem apple.  
Lances of a silent ship  
discovering around the vicinity around an acidulous car,  
human as a weak crab.  
The bed conducting from my arm.  
There ought to be a book of a thick banner wetting in a sea.  
Smooth stone.  
My moonlit toe wets you always.
