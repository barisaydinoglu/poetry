How To Shatter Uncle Arms
-------------------------
The child smiles at the fisherman  
but the god does not smile  
when he looks at the crab mountaineer  
and the rustling ocean.  
Land of a rejected worn-out juice.  
Where pastures meet  
times meet, among and behind and the sound  
of dusts, to reach out and build in animosity.  
Nothing but your parsimonious brow.  
A wonderful carpet making a secure thing of a impossible meeting with a pioneer.  
The I in juice but the fellowship blushed the memory.  
Tremulous scandalmongerings and burned-out receptacles.  
This fuming affection and rejoicing precision dismantles me  
with it's absent minded roots like tail and lip  
and rust colored doves like heart and banners.  
You are the orange of my harsh hand.  
  
Sand-colored lineages of dominion,  
cinnamon seams above a melancholy lunar.
