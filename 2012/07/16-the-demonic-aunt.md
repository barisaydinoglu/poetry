The Demonic Aunt
----------------
Under the barbaous thicket of boney breakfast.  
Silvery shrapnels of puberty,  
silvery seams above a melancholy railroad track.  
On what cold nails performed with jungle?  
My heart is filled with happiness like a gold form.  
We open the halves of a mysteries and the  
mutating of dusts awakens into the vertical land.  
If you were not the plum the promising moon  
cooks, sprinkling its wine across the vicinity.  
Where smooth bricks meet  
cactuss meet, within and inside and the sound  
of shrapnels, to reach out and tread in fear.
