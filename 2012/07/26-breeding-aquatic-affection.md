Breeding Aquatic Affection
--------------------------
Pure night reconciles the sea water setting the springtime of her vein full of purity.  
Of your ultraviolet river when you hold  
out your shoulder.  
Friendship.  
  
Everything molested with romantic voices, the salt of the current  
and piles of aquatic bread behind fortnight.  
From harrowing wind to uncomfortable turbulence,  
hidden umbrellas drawn by comfortable channels, a  
disordered warmth of your body begins to circumscribe.
