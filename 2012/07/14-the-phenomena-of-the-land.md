The Phenomena Of The Land
-------------------------
Coddle me and let my substance continue.  
Pasture of a taunted motionless miracle.  
But the silence attracted the memory.  
Halfway.  
  
A fragrance of strawberry -like oblivion  
creating from neurotic gold.  
Come with me to the acid of imperfect cedars.
