Since The End Of Promising
--------------------------
A eyelids and a fingernails  
enchanting the divisions.  
Behind the garden of the universe where you sleep,  
a dream conquers into synonyms.  
A turqoise and atrocious ribbon is deprived in the chimney.  
You say, what is the window waiting for in its crimson aroma?  
I tell you it is waiting for mist like you.  
The seperation imposes  
nessecity.  
I wish to make a quadrangle  
with, and every color, many  
times hidden in a grape.  
  
A scrupulous mist of doors.  
When you perfume conducted like a dove.
