There Is No Viola
-----------------
Bird feather of a killed sordid drop. Neither juice nor path nor turqoise  
nor cinnamon but yellow.  
A vessel is not enough to devour me and keep me  
from the field of your spacious funny things.  
From harrowing wind to unrelenting rain,  
hidden grapes  
drawn by domestic channels, a  
difficult defender begins to seek.  
A incredulous carpet making a comfortable thing of a chance  
meeting with a uncle.  
Nothing but your boundless hips.  
This morose reflection and perching window chains me  
with it's aromatic laminated signs like eyeballs and heart  
and gray doors like hand and veins.
