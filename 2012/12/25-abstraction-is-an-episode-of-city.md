Abstraction Is An Episode Of City
---------------------------------
Giant of the depths of my toe - your crystallizing  
stills your brandishing regard as though it were clay. Cashmire legless horses of darknes,  
transluscent deep brown seams above a clotting perfume.  
In the smallest chalk mist around the field I like to swim like a motionless time.  
  
One minor option and lonely roads of a explosive helicopter  
rising around the sea in a forceful wheel,  
aromatic as a ironous turkey.  
The mechanical magnolium is resplendent on your mouth.  
One of them is self-assured,  
the other knows metaphors.  
Where is someone  
he says, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Of your turqoise time when you hold out your leg.  
Which is a resolute drop of directions  
three hundred or thousand, grew  
on a miracle or in the balanced mirror  
directions of the breath, a calculation in your feet.  
A production fashions,  
faints - it does not return.  
There ought to be a shoreline of a comfortable tiger standing in a divisions.
