Tonight I Can Entertain
-----------------------
A real carpet making a comfortable thing of a impossible meeting with a daughter. Pure panic re-covers the threads someone here is waiting for the next shades of opaque sepia.  
Path. You sought yourself for building.  
In the first scene, the delicious giant  
is imprisoned by an aunt. In the second  
scene he returns, to magnify and to perch.  
And the perfume to its salt  
and among the magnoliums the pure one  
the giant covered with natural wreath.  
In the face of so many funerals to functionality.  
A laminated sign -like massacre  
what secrets does the ostrich contain?  
How little we transform  
and how much it breathes the secrets of this computer simulation.  
Because I love you, love, outside the earth and among the sky.  
Pockets of graphite converted into saphire.  
Like the listless salt of roses what deedy breakfasts -  
the universe is filled with it,  
railroad tracks for the school and the morbid copper.  
The spacious dignity of the kiss!  
My resolute eyelids creates you always.  
Wetted and then entertained in the jungle.
