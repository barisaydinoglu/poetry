I Expected Custodians
---------------------
And you drink like a ship and our new nature, our spacious light lines.  
You say, what is the book waiting for in its silvery mist?  
I tell you it is waiting for soul like you.  
There are no vortices but bitten cycles of form and yellow  
wine bottles of incredulous banal aluminum.  
The muzzled iguana magnifies under the delicious shrapnels.  
I saw how awes are seized  
by the hopeful sun.  
And you petrified in the confusion and conducted a undulating blade.  
A chorus of crabs at early light of day un  
entertained un killed  
comes to a halt before a prize.
