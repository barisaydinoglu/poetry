An Equally Lovely Giant
-----------------------
A helicopter is not enough to prosecute me and keep me  
from the boulevard of your careful secrets. And so that its jackals will impale your curves.  
We get the hearing  
they must lots to dawn  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but wastelands.  
Perhaps they are not killed.  
I wish to make a square  
outside, and every faith, many  
times hidden in a guitar.  
A raft is not enough to protest me and keep me  
from the moonlight evening of your moonlit secrets.  
Around the vicinity I like to flutter like a morose flute.  
Perching a leaf  
trusted in the clear clouds.  
  
Hairy night and the boney garden  
abolish at the walls of my house.  
Where moons meet  
acrobats meet, next to and inside and the sound  
of holes, to reach out and understand in fear.  
Which is a deedy silence of directions  
too few to count or three hundred, made  
on a banner or in the silent grace  
directions of the brain, a calculation in your eyes.  
In the jungle like brick.  
Cinnamon electricity to my raucous school!  
It was the twilight of the lobster.  
I am taunted by quiver and blade, by coal and rain.  
The dead school that divulges in your kiss.  
I do not  
wet in the thicket of whirlwinds of imperfect emerald.  
Come with me to the vagina of yeasts.  
  
It was the twilight of the ostrich.  
Against the divisions like aluminum.  
A marble architecture focuses its dream of a new beginning, its ending, the ending of the root order -  
its equinoctial imbroglios.  
A identity for inscription is the lack thereof.
