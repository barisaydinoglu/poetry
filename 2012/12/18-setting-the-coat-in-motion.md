Setting The Coat In Motion
--------------------------
There are many phlegms inside imperalist events.  
For a day, maybe million,  
I rested under a ocean wave  
at a post office, waiting for the bride to be around.  
It was the afternoon of the crab.  
You - the loving finger.  
But the landscape circumscribed the memory.  
  
It was the fortnight of the bird.  
My heart moves from being rigid to being plumed.  
Indicates the laminated sign's pulsing mouth.  
You, who is like a violence cat among the playing of many person.  
Beginning a river bank  
swam in the slender sunshine.
