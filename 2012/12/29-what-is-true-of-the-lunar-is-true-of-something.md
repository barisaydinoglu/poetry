What Is True Of The Lunar Is True Of Something
----------------------------------------------
There ought to be a wreath of a original essence trusting in a room.  
The winged aunt  
swims in the musical morning.  
A lion hearted mist of wheatfields.  
A arm and a shoulder  
dawning the field.  
Be guided by the ancient miracle's  
stars in the sky.  
A burnt umber elixir forms.  
  
What silent clusters -  
the night is filled with it,  
umbrellas for the umbrella and the morbid gem.  
In the smallest paper-mache sea's skin you are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the solute leaves?  
And the mist slender splattering its mosaics and depriving them full of  
jungle and pheasant?
