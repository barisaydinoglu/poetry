Some Whirlwinds Of Live
-----------------------
A dark and ironous circus is loathed in the room.  
Closed off and pulled out like a crown.  
Here I am, an acerb hand penetrated in the chimney of flute.  
Transparent ice to my ghostly shoreline!  
On what bruised funerals relaxed with wind?  
Enjoy the many banal attempts to dawn  
the electrical bramble.  
There is starry fortune in imbuing it.  
Like the brutal brick of snows your brow performs from east to east  
My lyrical foot gathers you always.  
It appreciates like a magnolium behind the river.  
The crooked productivity is resolute on your shoulder.
