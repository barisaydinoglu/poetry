Since The Beginning Of Appreciating
-----------------------------------
Here I am, a changeless brain erupted in the moonlight evening of elixir.  
Full stop.  
The chimney with hers  
a history we divulge in passing,  
with notions of honor  
and a passion for jouranlism and computer science  
in the smallest fused quartz aroma fewer and fewer  
throttle about another mode of decency.  
An odor has shone outside the elixir,  
a mixture of martyr and body, a circumscribing  
landscape that brings  
anger.  
And inside my hammock, during the sunrise, I woke up naked  
and full of happiness.
