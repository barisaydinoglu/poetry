Your Arm Is Enough
------------------
I stayed carried and silvery  
under the field. The deedy dignity of the femininity!  
A lonely starlight day  
what cosmic energies -  
the jungle is filled with it,  
lakes for the silk architecture and the decadent silk.  
A chorus of iguanas at twilight un entertained un abolished  
comes to a halt before a droplet.  
To the nocturnal color of the gem quiver.  
Inside the morbid salt, many exiled corpses.  
You play my hairy violence  
like a indespensable crab to fresh nectarine.  
And the friendship to its candle  
and among the spheres the changeless one  
the uncle covered with perfect vein.  
I do not tremble in the archipeligos of boneless dung.  
Some travel but I recover your broken glass like bridge.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
Loved and then connected in the field.  
Wounded holiday and  
the hushed flower  
forebode at the walls of my house.  
On what troubled errors kissed with wind?  
I'm the elder to the dew of immediate affection.
