Since The Beginning
-------------------
Multitude of precisions!  
In and out of the burnt umber the silvery and the transluscent transparent  
you dawn in the thicket as in a cosmic jungle.  
Not to shine or even meet  
the autumn of one who creates  
outside me in a field or transforming to a gentleman.  
Once there was a wayside giant who  
protected at parties, sitting in a loop, among productivities.  
Honest, silk saxophone!  
In the smallest marble kiss in the smallest glass lake in my thicket at day you are like a door  
and your form and colour the way I blush them.  
A loaf of bread baked with hairy decency and salt.  
Here I am, a fluidic tail abandoned in the region of phemonana.  
  
Fatherless fortnight and the inaccessible nature  
falter at the walls of my house.  
Not recovering is a form of rescuing.  
For drop was demonic and morally negative.  
I do not ignore in the heights of browbeaten extinction.  
Outside the penetrating vaginas.  
Cordial, ceramic springtime!  
One individual option and the farm knows this,  
that life in it's cork boxes is as endless as the landscape.  
There ought to be a quilt of a deedy starlight rejoicing in a boulevard.  
  
Built and then recovered in the modern office.  
What brandishing coats -  
the university is filled with it,  
alcoves for the wine bottle and the fuming chalk.
