Faith As Enemies
----------------
Acerb empire. The circle functions to mix a system  
to its system.  
Branch.  
A square next to a square,  
the bruised workings of lyrical law.  
A loaf of bread baked with banal joy and salt.  
Nothing but that film of telegraphs.  
Shall we recount?  
A soft rain of phemonanas.
