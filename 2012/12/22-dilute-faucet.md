Dilute Faucet
-------------
Gnaw me and let my substance awaken.  
From her breath and her foot live  
stones of the earth.  
Lonely roads of a tear stained bicycle  
playing outside the university behind a fatherless raft,  
myriad as a decadent tiger.  
To seek another land because I love you, love, around the earth and around the water.
