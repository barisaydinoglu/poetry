Here I Relax You
----------------
Like hushed dew, salts  
you enchant my misunderstood blade  
like a winged iguana to fresh grape. Realized resplendent railroad track when you imbue like landscape relinquished by the mud.  
It was a rabid business of lamprey and invasions.  
Under the hollow guitar, many crooked convicts.  
And meetings of burned-out leg a current of absorbant stone  
that does not know why it flows and circumscribes.  
  
What fresh spheres -  
the thicket is filled with it,  
ribbons for the wine bottle and the sifted marble.
