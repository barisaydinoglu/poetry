Overtone Computers Are All Outside Us

Cinnamon and parenthetical lady,  
the reasons for my respect  
are entertained in my fingernails of cedar.  
Of a blood colored elder that upgrades necklaces.  
There ought to be a perfume of a romantic atom mixing in a heights.  
It enchants like a light around the peace.  
Wave of wave of veins rolling down the sea.  
A quadrangle inside a triangle,  
the bitten workings of myriad law.  
We get the meaning  
they must lots to drink  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but stenches.  
Perhaps they are not wetted.  
  
You see eye as perfect as the wind.  
Draw from it the fatherless  
inscription of its own sequence.  
I took on hated times.  
To the absent minded color of the saphire starlight.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the ancient rivers?  
And the fog humble splattering its railroad tracks and throttling them full of  
archipeligos and ostrich?  
Nothing but your equinoctial tail.  
The starlights exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
in it in darkness.  
To the incredulous musical ship I salute  
your poetic peach  
and envy your human pride.  
So the lyrical joy lives on in a banana,  
the eloquent house of the railroad track,  
the soft flower head that is mineral and fluidic.  
Daughter of the depths of my hand - your wetting  
stills your noble regard as though it were clay.  
Brandishing empire. The line functions to imbue an architecture  
to its architecture.
