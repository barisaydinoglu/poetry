Mechanical Nature
-----------------
On what senile trash barges attracted with electricity? Full stop.  
In my university at morning you are like an awe  
and your form and colour the way I conduct them.  
I am bristled by form and seperation, by cold fire and fog.  
The hopeful pencil gave it felicity.  
And meetings of furious curves I wish to make a loop  
in front of, and every meaning, many  
times hidden in a faucet.  
Like the melancholy brick of threads a charitable mist of phemonanas.  
In the first take, the natural son  
is cracked by an aunt. In the second  
reel he returns, to blossom and to create.  
Pure cold fire awakens the doors the clear dignity of the door!  
A wonderful carpet making an affluent thing of a unlikely meeting with a father.
