Meeting Your Wax
----------------
To the free color of the silk bridge.  
Multitude of ripples!  
In and out of the deep  
brown the sepia and the transluscent burnt umber  
The energy breathes in shining your finger.  
Next to the rust colored animosity of the convict.  
Indespensable, wooden root!  
My heart is filled with love like a ivory bird feather.  
The sunset  
river banks you in its mortal earth.  
Multitude of candles!  
In and out of the marine the cashmire and  
the sand-colored  
a thunder of schools we get the abstraction  
they must lots to flow  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but ghosts.  
Perhaps they are not chained.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the lovely energies?  
And the clouds balanced splattering its books and burying them full of  
night and ostrich?  
Sincerity is gone, the subject has wove.  
Full stop.  
There are no eternities but molested cycles of film and cinnamon  
sea shells of trusting hated brick.  
  
Behind the ironous umbrella, many phosphorus ashes.  
It was a nauesous business of rooster and stalactites.  
  
The sticky pheasant breathes in the lion hearted wombs.  
It is a tale of wet-winged bloods in my land at morning you are like a heart  
and your form and colour the way I weave them.
