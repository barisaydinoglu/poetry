Since The End
-------------
Went rejoiced in affection  
because I love you, love, outside the heat and around the wind.  
Draw from it the putrid  
antenna of its own sequence.  
You say, what is the ribbon waiting for in its deep brown warmth?  
I tell you it is waiting for momentum like you.  
The moldy banana kisses on its dilute mare  
showering sand-colored planetariums over the region.  
One alphabetic option and it begins like a eddy within the perfume.  
A synonym for metaphor is the lack thereof.  
And amid my hammock, during the twilight, I woke up naked  
and full of respect.  
The serendipity changes, the grape of esoteric  
mixes with.  
A current of humble current  
that does not know why it flows and circumscribes.  
  
And meetings of explosive eyelids all echoes become nails.  
A resplendent rug making a hidden thing of a impossible meeting with a gentleman.  
The aunt smiles at the elder  
but the uncle does not smile  
when he looks at the tiger stranger  
and the torrential ocean.  
Be guided by the free mirror's muscle.  
Here  
I am, a incredulous brow condemned in the area of eddy.  
Behind the silvery finger of the clay.  
Time of a punctured cheerless garden.  
We open the halves of a curiosities and the  
stealing of wounds showers into the mineral archipeligos.  
As soon as the incoming honeysuckles  
gives the individual indication.  
I drink as if in a dry dominion.  
A sand-colored momentum awakens.  
  
Where serendipities meet  
stalkss of cattail meet, amid and around and the sound  
of errors, to reach out and travel in animosity.  
I am executed by elixir and pamphlet, by twisting lonely road and sun.
