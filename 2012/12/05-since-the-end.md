Since The End
-------------
What kills  
the props of purity?  
Dead weather, melancholy lights like the crystal architecture.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
In the first take, the fleeting stranger  
is condemned by a father. In the second  
reel he returns, to flow and to shower.  
To inherit lost wells and for mists.
