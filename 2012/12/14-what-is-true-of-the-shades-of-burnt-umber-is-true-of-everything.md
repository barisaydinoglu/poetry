What Is True Of The Shades Of Burnt Umber Is True Of Everything
---------------------------------------------------------------
It's a playing root of croaks.  
If I could mix the dung and the divisions.  
If you were not the peach the esoteric moon  
cooks, sprinkling its grape across the modern office.  
Wave of wave of manes rolling down the sea.  
Burnt umber ice to my raucous marble architecture!  
With the silencing pigeon holes.  
A imperalist projection degrades  
even the resplendent  
historical sea in identity  
to which the metaphor  
will not be entertained.  
He is behind us at this moment of first treading. I do not gnaw in the moonlight evening of thirsty complaint.  
A sensual snow of leaves.  
Full stop.  
Fewer and fewer  
Silence about another mode of joy.
