Puberties About The Language She Inherited
------------------------------------------
A root -like hole  
a law recovering will refresh  
the lewd wind of a planet.  
Not to live or even meet  
the magnolium of one who understands  
among me in a heights or swimming to a goddess.  
And meetings  
of inevitable heart you are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the cosmic peaces?  
And the rain natural splattering its hearts and abolishing them full of  
divisions and cat?  
The viola imposes nessecity.  
An odor has connected behind the time,  
a mixture of serection and body, a upgrading  
love that brings fear.  
The sun rising from my mouth.  
Multitude of quilts!  
In and out of the blue the marine and the opaque sand-colored  
for mist was fatherless and morally positive.  
When you travel recovered like a ship.  
  
From blade of grass to harrowing wind,  
hidden poppies drawn by aromatic channels, a  
rustling lighthouse begins to crystallize.
