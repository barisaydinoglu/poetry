From What Are Pencils Upgraded
------------------------------
Outside the movie of the university where you sleep,  
a dream falters into studies.  
Cashmire and handsome pioneer,  
the region outside hers  
a tale we tell in passing,  
with notions of sincerity  
and a passion for science and oceanography  
Enjoy the many fire-tipped attempts to fly  
the gleaming cadaver.  
There is deedy fortune in rustling it.  
Developing an acrobat  
protected in the poetic drizzle.  
And meetings of worn-out brow I could rustle depth, pigeon hole, and stalactite  
from kisses and guitars  
with a dull shades of yellow flesh  
with explications in my curves.  
The absorbant one  
expands in the sensible morning.  
Bruised lunchtime and the clotting curtain  
silence at the walls of my house.  
Pockets of brick converted into diamond.  
Always you abandon through the fortnight  
toward the sunrise deforming graces.  
Outside the opaque ultraviolet confusion of the granule.  
  
As if to deprive or store or freeze.  
Once there was a thirsty fisherman who  
set at parties, sitting in a loop, among productivities.  
They mutated it with harsh propellers.  
The cluster condemns, the shades of transluscent transparent of delicate  
builds next to.  
  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the dashing maternities?  
And the wind angellic splattering its bottles and twisting them full of  
room and lobster?
