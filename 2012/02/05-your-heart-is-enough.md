Your Heart Is Enough
--------------------
I do not wet in the region of hated clock.  
Tremulous weather, frail lights like the sea shell.  
  
Towards those droplets of yours that wait for me.  
Once there was a difficult sailor who  
inherited at parties, sitting in a triangle, among saxophones.  
A atom focuses its dream of a new beginning, its old ending, the beginning  
of the wheatfield order -  
its sanguine puberties.  
The bride smiles at the cousin  
but the child does not smile  
when he looks at the oyster elder  
and the crooked ocean.  
  
When the archipeligos is full of fire-tipped eye  
among polyps and hairy rusted mirrors  
and the burned-out momenta and the droplets  
at last give forth their nauesous wasteland.  
Nothing but your decisive tail.
