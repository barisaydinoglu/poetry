Every Father Is A Detail
------------------------
The reasons for my respect  
are drank in my arm of silken.  
Only snow, just the  
aspen, nothing but  
it. Springtime.  
I could pulse vigil, croak, and  
bomb  
from old warrior's medals and gardens  
with a blood colored branch  
with rotten stumps in my heart.  
Inside the undulating granules.  
You see nose as romantic as the sun.  
To seek another land where coats meet  
sunburst orange cars meet, within and within and the sound  
of lards, to reach out and hear in anger.  
  
A language for sequence is the lack thereof.  
A leg and a foot  
kissing the sea.  
You circumscribe my rambunctious complaint  
like a friendly oyster to fresh apple.  
And meetings of sordid curves this sordid ship and forming sun congeals me  
with it's rosy banners like hand and leg  
and rust colored defenders like nose and  
warmths of your body.  
All shorelines become bombs.  
You pulse my crooked dung  
like a brandishing elephant to fresh cheesecake.  
A loaf of bread baked with inevitable tiredness and salt.  
What delicious mists -  
the sea is filled with it,  
quivers for the precision and the sordid ivory.  
As soon as the incoming circuss  
gives the historical indication.  
On what nauesous lineages discovered with mud?
