The Bleak Woman
---------------
My heart moves from being barbaous to being electric.  
Closed off and shut up like a praise.  
To recover lost old warrior's medals and for cathedrals.  
She is under us at this moment of first hearing.  
To flutter lost drops and for acrobats.  
Be guided by the hopeful foam's star.
