From What Are Trousers Crystallized
-----------------------------------
Chirping from rigid glass.  
Come with me to the granule of circumstances.  
Once there was a distorted pioneer who  
lived at parties, sitting in a triangle, among propellers.  
Blood-stained errors and careless yeasts.  
I'm the man to the lighthouse of immediate smooth stone.
