Sight As Flames
---------------
Not pulsing is a form of developing.  
You've asked me what the tiger is drinking there with his sand-colored curves?  
I reply, the faucet knows this.  
Indicates the rose's responding eyeballs.  
My heart is filled with decency like a saphire bottle.  
To flutter lost suns and for laws.  
The manly dignity of the bottle!  
What seems simultaneous to one will  
not seem so to another.
