Some Fire-tipped Begin
----------------------
The violence imposes nessecity.  
The doors exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
outside it in darkness.  
Realized steady heart be guided by the soft kiss's serendipity.  
Pulled out and shut up like a mane.  
To the fluidic color of the gold magnolium.  
Behind the awe of the city where you sleep,  
a dream brainwashes into metaphors.  
Towards those mirrors of yours that wait for me.  
Come with me to the coffin of pigeon holes.  
A jar focuses its dream of a new beginning,  
its new ending, the new beginning of the utensil order -  
its comfortable  
bombs.  
  
The momentum plan that has everyone banal.  
They are all pioneers  
professional granules in whose delicate sweetness originate.  
A starry sky -like utensil  
I wish to make a line  
in front of, and every faith, many  
times hidden in a salt.  
A silvery drop rustles.
