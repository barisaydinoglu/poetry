Breeding Smooth Affection
-------------------------
The acerb ritual gave it purity.  
The torrent imposes nessecity.  
In the smallest gem fragrance of strawberry  
as soon as the incoming praises  
gives the individual indication.  
I could swim throat, legless  
horse, and panic  
from bells and defenders  
with a red ribbon  
with abyss in my hand.  
Sometimes a piece of the water  
plagues like a circus in my breath.  
My moonlit tail continues you always.  
I saw how silences are enchanted  
by the gleaming time.  
Always you erupt through the late afternoon  
toward the night filtering threads.  
As if to pamper or seek or bristle.  
In the smallest diamond propeller sorrow and alcove - aromas of beligerance.  
Everything exiled with friendly voices, the salt of the utensil  
and piles  
of sensual bread behind day.  
  
Enjoy the many fire-tipped attempts to divulge  
the honest whisper.  
There is manly fortune in flying it.  
When the boulevard is full of sordid nose  
inside funerals and sticky hollow ships  
and the fuming farms and the productivities  
at last give forth their rusted felicity.
