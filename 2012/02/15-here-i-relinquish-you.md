Here I Relinquish You
---------------------
To shower lost knaves and for flutes.  
Conversations of wreaths, the recitation  
of lakes we call great soul.  
The crowns exists even when there is  
lots  
to say, and it ceases  
behind it in darkness.  
You begin slowly into a field to preserve your business.  
When you seek perfumed like a branch.  
You are the misunderstood goddess  
of a bird,  
the violenet ness of the peace, the power of the lava.  
The funeral imposes nessecity.
