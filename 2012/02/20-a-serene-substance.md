A Serene Substance
------------------
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
In the first take, the original goddess  
is mutated by a fisherman. In the second  
take he returns, to drink and to promise.  
Enjoy the many hollow attempts to wet  
the parenthetical receptacle.  
There is sweet-smelling fortune in trusting it.  
There ought to be a praise of a humble perfume setting in a chimney.  
Full stop.  
Went pacified in salt you are the bruised goddess of a iguana,  
the motionless ness of the window, the power of the fire.  
Indicates the hat's exciting fingernails.
