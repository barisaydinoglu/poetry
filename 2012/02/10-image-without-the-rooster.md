Image Without The Rooster

You attract slowly into a jungle to attract your business.  
Shall we keep going?  
Cashmire and enchanting person,  
a current of sensual flesh  
that does not know why it flows and awakens.  
The path knows this,  
that  
life in it's fused quartz boxes is as endless as the sea shell.  
A shoreline entertaining will begin  
the violenet heat of a planet.  
But I should be true to jouranlism, electrifying among its acidulous warmths of your body  
so let  
us seek to speak a story devoid of technical redundancies.  
Which is an absorbant rose of directions  
too many to count or three hundred, refreshed  
on an autumn or in the handsome starlight  
directions of the tail, a calculation in your noses.  
Like jugulars overflowing around wreaths.  
  
To the fresh musical affection the divisions among hers  
a tale we tell in passing,  
with notions of sincerity  
and a passion for jouranlism and mountaineering  
with its fire-tipped upgrade a loaf of bread baked with boneless honor and salt.  
For a day, maybe million,  
I rested under a pillow of fog  
at a bus stop, waiting for the lady to be inside.  
This frail mosaic and perching muscle mutates me  
with it's friendly aspens like fingernails and eyeballs  
and rust colored wine bottles like foot and shadess of burnt umber.  
Where schools meet  
serendipities meet, amid and next to and the sound  
of serections, to reach out and conduct in panic.  
Not the cinnamon moment  
when the twilight gallops the foliages.  
Around the land I like to perfume like a oily faucet.  
There ought to be a flower of a wide telegraph flowing in a sea.  
What undulates the props of wonder?  
Only hated and to a  
man they take on time, too few to count years  
it's a pulsing serendipity of vinegars.  
  
My heart moves from being muzzled to being electrical.  
Your mosaic is a coat filled with spoiled knave.
