Setting The Sweetnes In Motion
------------------------------
In my university at sunrise you are like a sunburst orange lake  
and your form and colour the way I begin them.  
On what silent dungs continued with wind?  
Multitude of perfumes!  
In and out of the silvery the burnt umber  
and the yellow  
return to the homeland of the bottles.  
Halfway.  
Carry me onto your vessel - the grape of my sea's skin -  
Decadent evils and fractious bones.
