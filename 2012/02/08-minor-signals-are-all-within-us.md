Minor Signals Are All Within Us
-------------------------------
A square within a tetrahedron,  
The clenched workings of infinite law.  
On what melancholy errors trod with jungle?  
All stars become pins.  
A momentum focuses its dream of a ending, its beginning, the new ending of the flower order -  
its ancient coals.  
Which is a cosmic angel of directions  
three hundred or too few to count, dawned  
on a utensil or in the fluidic mist  
directions of the hips, a calculation in your brains.  
Reflected  
and then rustled in the chimney.  
My heart is filled with happiness like a silicon breakfast.  
Shall we go forward?  
The charitable mosaics deformed around the night I like to gallop like a fragmented pencil.  
The croak travels on its demonic mare  
gathering burnt umber trousers over the moonlight evening.  
Conversations of fleshes, the recitation  
of starss in the sky we call enduring well.  
  
All flowers become billows of brimstone smoke.  
They pampered it with worn-out spheres.  
The reasons for my respect  
are mingled in my ears of cedar.  
I am rejected by starlight and lonely road, by oblivion and rain.
