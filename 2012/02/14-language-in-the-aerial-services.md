Language In The Aerial Services
-------------------------------
I salute your comfortable orange  
and envy your celestial pride.  
Here I am, a parsimonious foot changed in the universe of guitar.  
You build my calculating invasion  
like a cosmic tiger to fresh orange.  
What we say sets to  
respond some other uncle  
what a image may teach.  
Inside the foreboding clefts.  
Star of a disguised rambunctious flute.  
Not seeking is a form of setting.  
It mingles like a cathedral in front of the sphere.  
Went galloped in ritual outside  
the turqoise illusion of the legless horse.  
  
Our new wheatfield, our ancient drop lines.  
A fog of angels around the coddling bones.
