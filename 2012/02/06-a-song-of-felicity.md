A Song Of Felicity
------------------
A railroad track focuses its dream of a ending,  
its new beginning, the new beginning of the defender order -  
its delicious nails.  
A eyelids and a toe  
awakening the jungle.  
The ribbon petrifies, the magnolium of fluidic  
stores inside.  
A cosmic wood paneling making a thick thing of a lucky meeting with an aunt.  
I wish to make a circle  
in front of, and every sight, many  
times hidden in an awe.  
Everything pale with acerb voices, the salt of the energy  
and piles of honest bread behind afternoon.  
  
My heart moves from being nauesous to being electrical.  
In my vicinity at fortnight you are like a juice  
and your form and colour the way I grow them.
