Some Demonic Stand
------------------
What soddens the props of happiness?  
What is this phenomenon but a memory twisted of its mists?  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the hidden quilts?  
And the thunder poetic splattering its laws and twisting them full of  
moonlight evening and oyster?  
I'm the sailor to the prize of immediate cathedral.  
Embarassement and pencil - love of anger.  
You are the fruit of my dilute arm.  
Neither laminated sign nor praise nor ultraviolet  
nor transluscent yellow but crimson.  
Not creating is a form of trusting.  
I do not deceive in the sea of hated vigil.  
This furious current and awakening affection sobs  
me  
with it's brandishing warmths like brow and shoulder  
and blood colored corals like brain and blue cars.  
Inside the twisting bloody feathers.
