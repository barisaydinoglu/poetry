The Camera Of Slightest Points
------------------------------
The ritual chirps in discovering your leg.  
Wine bottle was no longer below the transmission threshold.  
Under the sordid awe, many whirlwinds of abyss.  
The order of the miracles the lightning profound lonely roads are smothered.  
Corruptions of a delirious boat  
travelling next to the universe outside a dry boat,  
human as a dead squirrel.  
Noone here is waiting for the next phemonana.  
Sun. You magnified yourself for entertaining.  
He is in the middle of us at this moment of first mingling.  
The bone rustles on its distorted mare  
waking sepia manes over the sea.  
Shall we recount?  
He is behind us at this moment of first divulging.  
And a disordered  
smooth stone's ice will hear you.  
Pockets of steel converted into crystal.  
To the eloquent color of the ceramic fellowship.  
Connected and then heard in the university.  
Like browbeaten reflection, mosaics  
a wind of juices nothing but that path of eddies.
