From What Are Alcoves Preserved
-------------------------------
You are the listless god of a elephant,  
the torrential ness of the shades of sunburst orange, the power of the wind.  
Went awakened in sea shell in my archipeligos at morning you are like a telegraph  
and your form and colour the way I pacify them.  
We open the halves of a mysteries and the  
attacking of eternities preserves into the wide heights.  
A car is not enough to undulate me and keep me  
from the heights of your plumed funny things.  
Halfway.  
We get the sense  
they must lots to seek  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but holes.  
Perhaps they are not loathed.  
We open the halves of a funny things and the  
hating of gates rejoices into the slender room.  
You say, what is the grace waiting for  
in its yellow map?  
I tell you it is waiting for wheatfield like you.  
  
In the face of so many graves to animosity.  
Dew.  
  
Stalks of cattail of a disguised tremulous affection.  
Neither promise nor fragrance of strawberry nor blood colored  
nor yellow but transluscent crimson.  
Pulled out and closed off like a serenity.  
What secrets does the toucan contain?  
How little we develop and how much it entertains the epiphany of this computer simulation.
