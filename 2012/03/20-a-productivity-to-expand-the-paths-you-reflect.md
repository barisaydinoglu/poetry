A Productivity To Expand The Paths You Reflect
----------------------------------------------
In the face of so many deaths to functionality.  
As soon as the incoming smooth sand  
gives the neutral indication.  
Some breathe but I imbue your rusted nail like railroad track.  
I stayed rejoiced and marine  
inside the moonlight evening.  
But the fellowship inherited the memory.  
Pockets of salt converted into silicon.  
I am electrified by current and jackal, by vigil and rain.  
The self-assured sea water gave it wonder.  
The aromatic pencils plagued because I love you, love, behind the lava and in the electricity.  
You dedicate headlong into a region to hear your business.
