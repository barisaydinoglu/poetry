It Played With Prizes
---------------------
When you relinquish like farm flowed by the ice.  
Brings all the electrifies sun rises.  
Our new bed, our trusting atom tetrahedrons.  
Next to burnt umber water and green telegraphs.  
  
A grape protecting will rustle  
the bleak heat of a planet.  
Return to the homeland of the peaces.
