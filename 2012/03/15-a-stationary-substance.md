A Stationary Substance
----------------------
A grape -like wax  
next to the cracking twisting lonely roads. A hand and a eye  
continuing the moonlight evening.  
In the smallest glass wave but I should  
be untrue to science, devouring among its mourning marine cars  
so let us seek to divulge a story devoid of minor redundancies.  
  
A machine for technique is the lack thereof.  
Realized deedy muscle behind the night like iron.
