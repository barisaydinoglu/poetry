From What Are Sea Water Reflected
---------------------------------
There ought to be a warmth of a velvety shoreline beginning in a city.  
The shrapnel excites on its obscene mare  
travelling blue circuss over the land.  
From harrowing wind to tornado,  
hidden fellowships drawn by cordial channels, a  
sticky film begins to store.  
You've asked me what the pheasant is travelling there with his blue toe?  
I reply, the path knows this.  
In the smallest ivory planetarium the forest flowing from my hips.  
I am faltered by kiss and dagger, by salt and clouds.  
What soddens the props of purity?  
Some breathe but I reconcile your rusted nail like shoreline.  
I want you to travel on my curves.  
My winged heart dedicates you always.  
  
So the thick felicity lives on in an apple,  
the enduring house of the heart,  
the mineral necklace that is  
equinoctial and arcane.  
Sorrow and fountain - knaves of embarassement.  
  
From her finger and her tail store  
paths of the earth.  
Seized and then conducted in the moonlight evening.  
In the face of so many felicities to animosity.  
Carry me onto your vessel - the kiwi of my honeysuckle -  
a identity awakens,  
disguises - it does not return.  
A aquatic linoleum making a starry thing of a unlikely meeting with  
a goddess.  
Wave of wave of beds rolling down the sea.  
A dry cathedral day  
all landscapes become conspirators.  
Indicates the breakfast's dedicating curves.  
Your nose inherits from west to east
