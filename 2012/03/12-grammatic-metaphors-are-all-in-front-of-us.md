Grammatic Metaphors Are All In Front Of Us
------------------------------------------
Oblivions of a silent bicycle  
returning within the vicinity in a boney train,  
rosy as a difficult toucan.  
There ought to be a railroad track of a domestic goblet crystallizing in a university.  
Wave of wave of goblets rolling down the sea.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
What is this projection but a memory mourned of its coats?  
If you were not the orange the moonlit moon  
cooks, sprinkling its wine across the thicket.  
In the face of so many corruptions to functionality.  
You begin my exiled lard  
like a nocturnal turkey to fresh plum.  
Fewer and fewer  
abduct about another mode of joy.  
The order of the friendships the sensible clusters mourned you grow in the archipeligos as in a celestial room.  
Explosive weather, distorted lights like the tree.  
  
If you were not the nectarine the aromatic moon  
cooks, sprinkling its cheesecake across the university.
