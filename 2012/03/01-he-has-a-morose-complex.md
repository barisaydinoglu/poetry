He Has A Morose Complex
-----------------------
With yellow water and yellow lighthouses.  
The late afternoon snows you in its mortal sky.  
Has the vicinity been gathered with curiosities?  
We open the halves of a phenomena and the  
puncturing of cold fires relaxes into the decisive archipeligos.  
From her eyeballs and her tail relax  
praises of the earth.  
A line in a line,  
the wet-winged workings of fleeting  
law.  
Pockets of ash converted into chalk.  
They harassed it with lewd writings.  
It is a tale of putrid clefts return to the homeland of the knaves.  
But I should be untrue to mountaineering, devouring among its misunderstood snows  
So let us attempt to speak a story without slightest redundancies.  
Animosity and film - natures of fear.  
  
Appreciating from hollow glass.  
And amid my hammock, during the twilight, I woke up naked  
and full of pride.
