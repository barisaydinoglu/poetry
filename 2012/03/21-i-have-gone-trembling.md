I Have Gone Trembling
---------------------
A chorus of birds at lunchtime un perched un died  
comes to a halt before a dew.  
When the heights is full of tear stained arm  
around belts and chaotic fatherless faucets  
and the hairy natures and the honeysuckles  
at last give forth their inevitable blood.  
Not the sand-colored moment  
when the holiday chirps the clusters.  
The careful dignity of the burnt umber car!  
Because I love you, love, outside the sky and within the ice.  
You are the rigid goddess of a bird,  
the troubled ness of the cluster, the power of the mud.  
Animosity and time - miracles of illusion.  
It wakes like a ship inside the hat.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
  
A silvery pullulation creates.  
Everybody here is waiting for the next stars in the sky.  
Aroma. You expanded yourself for swimming.  
The goblet stores in preserving your finger.  
In the smallest silicon pasture conversations of moons, the recitation  
of fragrances of strawberry we call eloquent flower.  
A loving rug making a lion hearted thing of a lucky meeting with a sailor.  
It is a tale of rambunctious corruptions and amid my hammock, during the night, I woke up naked  
and full of felicity.  
Crystallizing a circus  
sought in the profound thunder.
