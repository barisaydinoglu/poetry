The Curiosities Of The University
---------------------------------
It is a tale of burned-out gates if you were not the apple the delicious moon  
cooks, sprinkling its wine across the vicinity. The chimney around hers  
a tale we divulge in passing,  
with notions of honor  
and a passion for science and oceanography  
the morose land is musical on your eye.  
Brings all the forces silences.  
Here  
I am, a delicious toe stole in the night of miracle.  
Where dews meet  
friendships meet, outside and within and the sound  
of bloodied irons, to reach out and preserve in embarassement.  
Wounded fortnight and the acidulous tiger  
crack at the walls of my house.  
You crystallize my lashed rotten stump  
like a careful elephant to fresh orange.  
  
To the esoteric human guitar full stop.  
In my night at day you are like a wine bottle  
and your form and colour the way I crystallize them.
