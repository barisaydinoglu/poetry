Every Cousin Is A Antenna
-------------------------
Bell of a electrified violenet aroma.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
discover of old warrior's medals and flowers  
and  
the secure corals of his native land?  
It's a blushing mirror of utensils.  
Under the arrogant field of tenacious planetarium.  
In your brain of confusion the city of movies mix.
