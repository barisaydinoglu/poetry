Since The Beginning Of Scratching
---------------------------------
This weak form and seizing well electrifies me  
with it's serene planetariums like eye and nose  
and turqoise guitars like toe and perfumes.  
Multitude of waves!  
In and out of the sand-colored the transluscent marine and the sunburst orange  
the blood imposes nessecity.  
What we say circumscribes to  
promise some other man  
what a image may teach.  
The ice sensible hearts are deluded.  
Blossoming a sweetnes  
stood in the incredulous fog.  
You kiss my  
skeleton utensil  
like a full oyster to fresh sugar.  
What secrets does the cat contain?  
How little we enchant and how much it builds the funny things of this universe.  
What epiphany does the cat contain?  
How little we build and how much it plays the epiphany of this computer simulation.  
Our new coral, our wide silence line segments.  
To seek another land be guided by the self-assured love's magnolium.  
Inside the burnt umber arm of the heat.  
Of honest grape, spirit  
of the promises,  
abolished custodian blood, your kisses  
set into exile  
and a droplet of ceramic, with remnants of the night.
