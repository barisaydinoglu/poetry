It Trusted With Flutes
----------------------
When you understand divulged like a bird feather.  
It was the midnight of the pheasant.  
The water original wounded soldiers are taunted.  
I'd do it for the grape in which you perform  
for the hearts of blue you've pulsed.  
Guitar was no longer right at the transmission threshold.  
All sea shells become lampreys.  
The rabid serendipity is loving on your hand.  
Pockets of rusted nail converted into paper-mache.  
Of your brimstone path when you hold out your mouth.  
  
It was the midnight of the oyster.  
And you invaded in  
the agony and blossomed a foreboding heart.  
Pockets of broken glass converted into ceramic.  
Dawning from bruised gold.  
Delicate, crystal splendor!  
A shaken foliage day  
it's a treading warmth of your body of twisting lonely roads.
