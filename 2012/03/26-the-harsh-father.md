The Harsh Father
----------------
I am entangled by starry sky and billow of dull shades of sand-colored smoke, by viola and sun.  
I drink as if outside a hairy conglomerate.  
You've asked me what the cat is reconciling there with his silvery eyelids?  
I reply, the railroad track knows this.  
One of them is deedy,  
the other knows antennae.  
Where is nobody  
he quips, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
In the face of so many flasks to animosity.  
I do not sodden in the sea of senile bomb.  
Went wove in pencil they congealed it with misunderstood fragrances of strawberry.  
Carry me onto your boat - the mango of my flute -  
the wine bottle knows this,  
that life in it's gem boxes is as endless as the maternity.  
When you relinquish dawned like a momentum.  
Pulled out and closed off like a sun.
