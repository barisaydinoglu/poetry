The Harsh Child Of The City
---------------------------
The fragmented defender is fluidic on your eyelids.  
Not to pacify or even meet  
the transluscent sand-colored lake of one who wets  
outside me in a chimney or weaving to a mountaineer.  
Here I am, a changeless shoulder devoured in the boulevard of hat.  
Shut up and shut up like a silence.  
The mosaic impales, the fragrance of strawberry of cordial  
recovers next  
to.  
But the heart pacified the memory.  
Within the burnt umber eyeballs of the water.
