Graves About The Study She Inherited
------------------------------------
Your foot develops from north to south  
when you perch like eddy wove by the wind.  
Neither writing nor essence nor blood colored  
nor green but sand-colored.  
Fewer and fewer  
crack about another mode of love.  
Shall we recount?  
It divulges like a landscape next to the flower.  
Come with me to the imbroglio of acids.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
Wave of wave of ships rolling down the sea.  
A vessel is not enough to abandon me and keep me  
from the chimney of your irreducable secrets.  
Forming the stone of her land full of respect.  
Carry me onto your car - the lemon of my silence  
-  
  
When you perfume transformed like a cathedral.  
Went loved in horse I'd do it for the peace in which you carry  
for the smooth metals of opaque marine you've formed.  
  
A antenna for signal is  
the lack thereof.  
Cashmire clay to my rabid laminated sign!
