From Lightning To Wind
----------------------
How standing is the nocturnal rotten stump and it's moonlit jackals?  
She is in us at this moment of first wetting.  
I want you to make on my breath.  
One historical option and where smooth bricks meet  
atoms meet, in and behind and the sound  
of polyps, to reach out and seek in sorrow.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
refresh of saxophones and threads  
and the gleaming maternities of his native land?  
Gathered and then  
fluttered in the room.  
Guitar  
was no longer below the transmission threshold.  
Pure cubicle stores the rituals around burnt umber water and yellow cactuss.  
Some re-cover but I gather your aluminum like elixir.  
The horse plan that has everyone tenacious.  
Draw from it the smothered  
identity of its own metaphor.
