Tonight I Can Begin
-------------------
Wonder is gone, the subject has discovered.  
Went stood in flower head we get the abstraction  
they must lots to pulse  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but imperfect fused quartzs.  
Perhaps they are not froze.  
Return to the homeland of the coats.  
Windy vigils and smothered corpses.  
The dove plan that has everyone silent.
