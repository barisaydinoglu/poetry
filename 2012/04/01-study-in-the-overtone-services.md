Study In The Overtone Services
------------------------------
They forced it with callous books.  
Next to the blood colored sorrow of the lamprey.  
And around my hammock, during the sunset, I woke up naked  
and full of tiredness.  
We open the halves of a epiphany and the  
disguising of imbroglios rises into the aromatic land.  
There are no holes but brutal cycles of hat and cashmire  
maternities of sanguine communist clay.  
Because I love you,  
love, inside the electricity and around the earth.
