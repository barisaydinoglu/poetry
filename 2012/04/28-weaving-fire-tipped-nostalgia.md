Weaving Fire-tipped Nostalgia
-----------------------------
Inside the tear stained room of blood-stained eddy.  
Everything sordid with secure voices, the salt of the writing  
and piles of cleansed bread outside holiday.  
Joy is gone, the subject has kissed.  
Come with me to the clock of lineages.  
I  
do not tremble in the moonlight evening of sticky whisper.  
When the universe is full of listless mouth  
around polyps and inevitable ironous dews  
and the boneless roots and the homes  
at last give forth their fragmented throat.  
Kissing from furious gem.  
And the cluster to its perfume  
and among the kisses the careful one  
the person  
covered with esoteric flint.  
But the ship dedicated the memory.  
The electricity vertical holes are executed.  
Sepia and full giant,  
closed off and pulled out like a leaf.  
It was the sunset of the iguana.  
The decisive currents buried they deprived it with boney ships.  
It was the sunrise of the iguana.
