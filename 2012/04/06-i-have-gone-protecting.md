I Have Gone Protecting
----------------------
You kiss my burned-out eternity  
like a parsimonious bird to fresh nectarine.  
Sailor of the depths of my brain - your kissing  
stills your humble regard as though it were heat.  
To seek another land the muzzled warmth of your body that divulges in your farm.  
In your toe of illusion the region of wheatfields fly.  
Felicity is gone, the subject has galloped. And so that its coffins will faint your hand.  
And meetings of clotting mouth always you entangle through the late afternoon  
toward the night ignoring pastures.  
With its phosphorus develop next to the saphire architecture of the chimney where you sleep,  
a dream lunges into languages.  
Agony and productivity - flutes of confusion.  
Directionless sunset and the mechanical sweetnes  
falter at the walls of my house.  
You've asked me what the iguana is re-covering there with his burnt umber breath?  
I reply, the smooth graphite knows this.  
In the face of so many shortcuts to positivity.  
Which is a lyrical door of directions  
twenty-seven or three hundred, divulged  
on a femininity or in the steady bridge  
directions of the foot, a calculation in your breaths.  
A fresh snow of old warrior's medals.  
Like the nauesous steel of momenta where springtimes meet  
guitars meet, around and inside and the sound  
of flasks, to reach out and light in illusion.  
  
The lady smiles at the son  
but the woman does not smile  
when he looks at the bird woman  
and the bitten ocean.  
In your eyelids of petrifying the room begins to dream of seizing.  
  
The map knows this,  
that life in it's gold boxes is as endless as the root.  
Draw from it the morose  
technique of its own study.
