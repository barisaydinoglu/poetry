A Saphire Within Ceramic
------------------------
Conversations of flower heads, the recitation  
of fleshes we call somber flint.  
Here I  
am, a infinite eyelids abandoned in the vicinity of law.  
In the smallest silicon light in my universe at late afternoon you are like a shoreline  
and your form and  
colour the way I appreciate them.  
And a skeleton circus's earth  
will connect you.  
Stood and then lived in the jungle.  
Upgrading from motionless chalk.  
A opaque gray and furious crimson lake is coddled in the thicket.  
Sand-colored mud to my listless coral!
