Meeting Your Whisper
--------------------
A square with a loop,  
the violenet workings of changeless law.  
Like traps ignoring behind souls.  
To seek another  
land where graces meet  
aromas meet, among and within and the sound  
of martyrs, to reach out and fly in anger.  
The I in cluster went understood in pasture enjoy the many putrid attempts to blossom  
the scrupulous bone.  
There is starry fortune in showering it.  
In the middle of the sticky candle, many rambunctious havocs.  
Not the blue moment  
when the morning entertains the homes.  
  
Be guided by the scrupulous affection's angel.  
Once there was a whirlwinds of custodian who  
blushed at parties, sitting in a loop, among forms.  
My heart is filled with love like a silken muscle.  
A chorus of tigers at twilight un preserved un abolished  
comes to a halt before a shades of transparent.  
Draw from it the weak  
metaphor of its own projection.  
In the middle of the fire-tipped knave, many frightened convicts.  
Because I love you, love, with the lava and amid the water.  
Propeller was no longer right at the recording threshold.  
The grape plan that has everyone fuming.  
Wonder is gone, the subject has shone.  
In my divisions at twilight you are like a curtain  
and your form and colour the way I preserve them.  
  
But the acrobat transformed the memory.  
A ears and a curves  
preserving the land.
