I Have Gone Building
--------------------
Behind the neurotic form, many troubled self-productions.  
When you gather blossomed like an awe.  
Pockets of steel converted into silken.  
As soon as the incoming ripples  
gives the grammatic indication.  
Nothing but your round breath.  
Because I love you, love, with the lightning and within the ice.  
My resplendent brow flows you always.  
Closed off and closed off like a star.  
From blade of grass to palm tree leaf,  
hidden flower heads drawn by celestial channels, a  
fatherless wave begins to blush.  
Nothing but that thread of saxophones.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
mix of rivers and wells  
and the charitable honeysuckles of his native land?  
A dull shades of cashmire and cheerless warmth is penetrated in the universe.  
  
As if to scratch or respond or shatter.  
Halfway.  
A signal rises,  
deludes - it does not return.  
Embarassement and prize - stars of confusion.
