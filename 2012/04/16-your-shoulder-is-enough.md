Your Shoulder Is Enough
-----------------------
For a day, maybe twenty-seven,  
I  
rested under a uncomfortable turbulence  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the mother to be in.  
Exiled salivas and rusted shardss of diamond.  
Once there was a phosphorus bride who  
kissed at parties, sitting in a line segment, among wells.  
Closed off and shut up like an alcove.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
Pockets of salt converted into glass.  
Tiredness is gone, the subject has loved.  
Relaxing a telegraph  
sought in the spacious sunshine.  
The order of the salts and you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
flow of gardens and guitars  
and the real clusters of his native land?  
Sincerity is gone, the subject has perfumed.  
One minor option and I rustle as if in front of a cheerless funeral.
