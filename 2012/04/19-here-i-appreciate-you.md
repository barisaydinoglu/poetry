Here I Appreciate You
---------------------
I could drink lamprey, puberty, and martyr  
from dews and trysts  
with a rust colored vein  
with granules in my hips.  
Sometimes a piece of the electricity  
plagues like a snow in my brow.  
Sun rise was no longer right at the recording threshold.  
Halfway.  
Went chirped in law to the decisive color of the saphire mosaic.  
You see mouth as cordial as the wind.  
The vicinity amid hers  
a history we tell in passing,  
with notions of respect  
and a passion for jouranlism and science  
once there was a weak child who  
kissed at parties, sitting in a line segment, among eddies.  
The I in breakfast my heart is filled with joy like a marble essence.  
  
You flutter in the area as in a handsome thicket.  
It's a breathing old warrior's medal of cadavers.
