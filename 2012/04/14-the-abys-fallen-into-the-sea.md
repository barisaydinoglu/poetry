The Abys Fallen Into The Sea
----------------------------
Pure bomb forms the splendors one of them is round,  
the other knows points of view.  
Where is everybody  
she quips, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Not the blue moment  
when the day lights the lakes.  
A plumed fog of lighthouses.  
It was a rigid business of vagabond and graves.  
Not the burnt umber moment  
when the sunset performs the corals.  
Amid sunburst orange water and cinnamon honeysuckles.  
One of them is handsome,  
the other knows languages.  
Where is nobody  
he quips, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
What dashing elixirs -  
the divisions is filled with it,  
springtimes for the salt and the torrential diamond.  
Pockets of graphite converted into diamond.  
Within the deep brown nose of the mud.  
Not connecting is a form of enriching.  
A loop among a tetrahedron,  
the bitter workings of fleeting law.  
Transluscent deep brown and cosmic stranger,  
the womb enchants on its wet-winged mare  
rustling transluscent sunburst orange laws over the jungle.  
Home of a penetrated ironous magnolium.  
  
I am abandoned by book and imperfect gold, by billow of rust colored smoke and clouds.  
You see foot as stationary as the sunshine.
