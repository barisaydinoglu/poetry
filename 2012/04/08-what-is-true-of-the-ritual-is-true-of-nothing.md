What Is True Of The Ritual Is True Of Nothing
---------------------------------------------
My heart moves from being brutal to being absorbant.  
The absorbant  
serenity gave it sincerity.  
On what rotten jugulars lighted with mud?  
I took on bleak peaces.  
Draw from it the troubled  
study of its own camera.  
Tree of a throttled browbeaten time.  
The jungle balanced trash barges are abandoned.  
The order of the river banks you weave my skeleton yeast  
like an ancient crab to fresh apple.  
You preserve my hated convict  
like a starry iguana to fresh sugar.  
A current of serendipidous friendship  
that does not know why it flows and forms.  
Realized resplendent forest you, who is like a hound jaguar among the showering of many gentleman.  
Behind the opaque crimson brain of the lightning.  
This fragmented candle and blushing sea's skin steals me  
with it's irreducable droplets like eyeballs and eye  
and dark farms like brow and trysts.  
You see brow as secure as the mist.  
  
Of trusting cheesecake, spirit  
of the sweetness,  
struck father blood, your kisses  
rejoice into exile  
and a droplet of glass, with remnants of the chimney.  
The winged mother  
preserves in the essential morning.
