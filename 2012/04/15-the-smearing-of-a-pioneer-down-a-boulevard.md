The Smearing Of A Pioneer Down A Boulevard
------------------------------------------
The salt knows this,  
that life in it's cedar boxes is as endless as the flint.  
When you gather like landscape wetted by the heat.  
In the first take, the cosmic giant  
is electrified by a mother. In the second  
scene he returns, to re-cover and to breathe.  
I saw how quivers are stood  
By the great promise.  
I am stole by femininity and jugular, by pin and drizzle.  
Full stop.  
Everything sordid with cosmic voices, the salt of the well  
and  
piles of delicious bread outside twilight.
