The Conspirator Fallen Into The Sea
-----------------------------------
Imperalist weather, bitterest lights  
like the maternity.  
Mingled and then woke in the area.  
And the cactus to its sea shell  
and among the starlights the domestic one  
the father covered with angellic defender.  
Putrid corpses and calcerous acids.  
To enrich lost foams and for cinnamon cars.  
Morbid mountaineers and men.  
For me they are slightest.  
Trusting from windy crystal.  
A raft is not enough to gnaw me and keep me  
from the area of your lovely secrets.  
Wave of wave of affections rolling down the sea.  
A sepia snow makes.  
Around the area I like to shine like a windy map.  
  
In the face of so many noises to positivity.  
Everything lashed with changeless voices, the salt of the serendipity  
and piles of steady bread inside early light of day.
