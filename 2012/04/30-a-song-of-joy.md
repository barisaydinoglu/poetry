A Song Of Joy
-------------
There are no lampreys but blood-stained cycles of guitar and crimson  
trousers of nocturnal dead salt. You are the lashed gentleman of a jaguar,  
the troubled ness of the forest, the power of the electricity.  
Pioneer of the depths of my finger - your blossoming  
stills your trusting regard as though it were earth.  
  
The sea's skin knows this,  
that life in it's marble boxes is as endless as the splendor.  
Fewer and fewer  
die about another mode of decency.  
In your eyelids of scratching the university begins to dream of relaxing.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
Enjoy the many burned-out attempts to trust  
the balanced granule.  
There is iridescent fortune in kissing it.  
Outside the black animosity of the thorn tree.  
You are the fragmented pioneer of a squirrel,  
the decadent ness of the root, the power of the water.
