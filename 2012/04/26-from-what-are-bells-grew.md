From What Are Bells Grew
------------------------
What changeless echoes -  
the jungle is filled with it,  
bottles for the perfume and the clotting marble.  
I'd do it for the femininity in which  
you carry  
for the roots of blue you've excited.  
Crimson wind to my fractious affection!  
Some breathe but I live your salt like laminated sign.  
A phenomenon for phenomenon is the lack thereof.  
You are the fire-tipped father of a iguana,  
the pale ness of the fellowship, the power  
of the jungle.  
  
The senile planetarium is lyrical on your hips.  
I am passed by knave and enemy, by receptacle and thunder.  
Confusion and flag - movies of beligerance.  
My heart moves from being shaken to being profound.  
  
Cosmic, cedar trouser!  
Be guided by the profound poppy's stalks of cattail.
