Awakening Sifted Nostalgia
--------------------------
And in my hammock, during the afternoon, I woke up naked  
and full of sincerity.  
Living the goblet of her sun full of purity.  
In my region at early light of day you are like a wine bottle  
and your form and colour the way I conduct them. Halfway.  
What condemns the props of respect?
