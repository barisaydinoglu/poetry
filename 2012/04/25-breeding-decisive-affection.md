Breeding Decisive Affection
---------------------------
Wave of wave  
of bridges rolling down the sea.  
As if to overflow or entertain or coagulate.  
The wheatfield shines in expanding your mouth.  
Be guided by the arcane angel's snow.  
Conversations of circuss, the recitation  
of schools we call romantic cluster.  
With its silent reconcile flowing from dead silk.  
  
The angellic horses lunged in my city at twilight you are like a guitar  
and your form and colour the way I relinquish them.  
Nobody here is waiting for the next ship.  
Curtain. You set yourself for rejoicing.
