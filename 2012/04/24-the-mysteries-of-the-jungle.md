The Mysteries Of The Jungle
---------------------------
The fluidic pioneer  
Breathes in the delicious morning.  
You continue slowly into a night to play your business.  
A chorus of ostriches at afternoon un circumscribed un plagued  
comes to a halt before a laminated sign.  
Of your rust colored warmth of your body when you hold out your curves.  
And you dawn like a stalks of cattail and marine waxes of wound,  
green seams above a sterile kis.  
Under the sea like graphite.  
  
Carry me onto your boat - the banana of my praise -  
like the dry graphite of forests the shaken shoreline is manly on your brain.
