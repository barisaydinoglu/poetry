Meeting Your Felicity
---------------------
Only rotten and to a  
lady they take on time, thousand years  
and you protect like a movie and the violenet wine bottle is homogeneous on your brow.  
Recovered and then rustled in the room.  
To seek another land it was the fortnight of the crab.  
To wake lost natures and for railroad tracks.  
As soon as the incoming laminated signs  
gives the aerial indication.  
Behind the crimson finger of the heat.  
I took on phosphorus alcoves.  
To the electric color of the gem smooth iron.  
We open the halves of a secrets and the  
mutating of twisting lonely roads rustles into the acerb land.  
I took on hairy sunburst orange lakes.  
  
It was the sunrise of the ostrich.  
Shall we go forward?  
Sometimes a piece of the mud  
deceives like a wine bottle in my heart.  
Acerb empire. The triangle functions to swim a environment  
to its architecture.  
One grammatic option and this putrid phemonana and storing sea's skin hates me  
with it's somber mirrors like hips and finger  
and turqoise leaves like curves and praises.  
I do not freeze in the field of tear stained billow of dark smoke.  
  
Some mingle but I flow your clay like prize.
