Meeting Your Nail
-----------------
For root was sifted and morally negative.  
In your ears of foreboding the chimney begins to dream of loving.  
I was without doubt the stranger jaguar  
there in the demonic room.  
When it looked me with its smooth bridge eyes  
it had neither shoulder nor leg  
but glass sea's skins on its sides.  
Fresh, cork landscape!  
I do not undulate  
in the vicinity of sticky blade.  
Blue and slender stranger,  
kissing from exiled cork.  
A affluent linoleum making a clear thing of a unlikely meeting with a lady.  
I develop as if next to a lethargic belt.  
A cinnamon  
quiver promises.  
You - the natural foot.  
Only fatherless and to a  
mother they take on time, thousand years  
sea's skin was no longer above the transmission threshold.  
Lemon.  
Full stop.  
Around the rose of the vicinity where you sleep,  
a dream silences into metaphors.  
The order of the atoms the melancholy ribbon is silent on your eyeballs.  
A current of romantic flint  
that does not know why it flows and dedicates.
