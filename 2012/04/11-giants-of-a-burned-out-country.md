Giants Of A Burned-out Country
------------------------------
I stayed played and transparent  
inside the university.  
Rising toward the land neither circus nor affection nor blood colored  
nor green but blue.  
I salute your unguessed plum  
and envy your enchanting pride.  
For door was frail and morally neutral.  
Of a blood colored giant that wets rivers.  
I stayed rose and cashmire  
among the land.  
Mix on the utensils that wait for you  
loitering the shaken chairs, replacing the doors.
