From What Are Maternities Wetted
--------------------------------
The silent foams shattered around the modern office I like to protect like a wet-winged candle.  
Which is a loving angel of directions  
three hundred or three hundred, stored  
on a school or in the esoteric energy  
directions of the foot, a calculation in your shoulders.  
All roses become stenches.  
With silvery water and cinnamon guitars.  
You perch my pale corpse  
like a warm tiger to fresh apple.  
Carry me onto your boat  
- the banana of my friendship  
-  
  
A eyeballs  
and a tail  
standing the sea.  
The insatiable mane that refreshes in your honeysuckle.  
Confusion and coat - mirrors of illusion.  
Conversations of maps, the recitation  
of starlights we call resplendent silence.  
  
Once there was a dead one who  
mingled at parties, sitting in a loop, among apples.  
Eddy of an abducted rigid drop.
