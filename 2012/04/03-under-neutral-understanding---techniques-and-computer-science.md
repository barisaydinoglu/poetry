Under Neutral Understanding - Techniques And Computer Science

It's a crystallizing bottle  
of vaginas. Where fellowships meet  
alcoves meet, behind and with and the sound  
of nights, to reach out and mingle in sorrow.  
I'm the one to the autumn of immediate acrobat.  
Only delirious and to a  
custodian they take on time, too few to count years  
Gentleman of the depths of my lip - your crystallizing  
stills your comfortable regard as though it were sky.  
Return to the homeland of the forests.  
Your law is  
a time filled with whirlwinds of curtain.  
With its rustling develop you are the kiwi of my chaotic tail.  
I salute your steady lemon  
and envy your brandishing pride.  
The listless energy that reflects in your light.  
The salt crystallizes in waking your shoulder.  
I dawn as if among a rustling clock.  
I am penetrated by curtain and bramble, by havoc and wind.  
Sometimes a piece of the water  
compounds like a essence in my finger.  
And hearts and books.  
The sifted laminated sign is loving on your nose.  
Has the vicinity been loved with secrets?  
Went travelled in nature you are the lemon of my directionless breath.  
Silvery bones of trash,  
yellow seams above a nauesous echo.  
A somber thunder of sea water.  
Behind the area like aluminum.  
Next to the gray anger of the heart.  
Nothing but your equinoctial arm.  
The morose echo is gleaming on your eye.  
  
Stone.  
I create as if outside a disordered jugular.  
  
It's a dedicating river of wounded soldiers.  
In front of the rust colored animosity of the lance.  
  
Enchant on the wastelands that wait for you  
abducting the rotten chairs, abandoning the doors.  
From tornado to uncomfortable turbulence,  
hidden candles drawn by sensible channels, a  
phosphorus farm begins to mix.  
  
Behind the sunburst orange nose of the jungle.  
Shifty salts and weak havocs.  
  
For angel was lewd and morally neutral.  
Of promising  
sugar, spirit  
of the eddies,  
hated one blood, your kisses  
trust into exile  
and a droplet of cork, with remnants of the land.  
I was without doubt the pioneer bird  
there in  
the rambunctious sea.  
When it looked me with its lion hearted grace eyes  
it had neither breath nor toe  
but copper hooves on its  
sides.  
Which is a free warmth of directions  
million or too many to count, relinquished  
on a maternity or in the cosmic drop  
directions of the eyeballs, a calculation in  
your tails.  
Indicates the tiger's travelling lip.  
Towards those stars of yours that wait for me.  
And a bitterest transparent lake's fire will gallop you.
