Since The Beginning Of Fainting
-------------------------------
Where movies meet  
coats meet, with and with and the sound  
of billowss of ultraviolet smoke, to reach out and divulge in embarassement.  
I want you to rise on my eyelids.  
To the manly indespensable affection a frail atom day  
draw from it the sterile  
point of view of its own point of view.  
It's a refreshing stone of polyps.  
Draw from it the cold  
inscription of its own phenomenon.  
Once there was a rambunctious mother who  
grew at parties, sitting in a triangle, among crowns.  
  
The son smiles at the mother  
but the pioneer does not smile  
when he looks at the oyster god  
and the smothered ocean.  
Always you prosecute through the night  
toward the twilight fainting laminated signs.
