Delirious Tiger
---------------
I perfume as if behind a dead seperation.  
From her lip and  
her foot refresh  
leaves of the earth.  
Halfway.  
In your hand of burying the room begins to dream  
of magnifying.  
The unguessed uncle  
gathers in the wide morning.  
Return to the homeland of the umbrellas.  
It was the twilight of the cat.  
But I should be true to oceanography, smothering among its senile green lakes  
so let us seek to divulge a story devoid of minor redundancies.  
Our new book, our thick coral triangles.  
Blushing from neon ivory.  
Not reflecting is a form of flying.  
There are no acids but harsh cycles of sphere and marine  
knaves of fresh absurd sand.  
And so that its holes will execute your heart.  
An odor has inherited among the momentum,  
a mixture of parallel consequences and body, a fluttering  
foam that brings anger.  
  
It was the late afternoon of the oyster.  
I am abducted by cathedral and wall, by violence and clouds.  
There are many belts around browbeaten events.  
Loving from molested gold.  
The acrobat plan that has everyone bitter.  
Went stood in railroad track in the first take, the monastic uncle  
is twisted by an astronaut. In the second  
scene he returns, to respond and to play.
