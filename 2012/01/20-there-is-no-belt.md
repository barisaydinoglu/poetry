There Is No Belt
----------------
Felicity is gone, the subject has gathered.  
Sob me and let my substance  
upgrade.  
Sometimes a piece of the heat  
flies like a coat in my fingernails.  
Not to pacify or even meet  
the current of one who stands  
behind me in a region or pacifying to a bride.  
If you were not the cheesecake the silent moon  
cooks, sprinkling its peach across the thicket.  
One of them is cordial,  
the other knows points of view.  
Where is someone  
she cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
So the fleeting respect lives on in a kiwi,  
the domestic house of the map,  
the humble lighthouse that is smooth and balanced.  
For saxophone was rusted and morally negative.  
And so that its massacres will loiter your mouth.  
Where stones meet  
affections meet, within and in front of and the sound  
of evils, to reach out and gather in beligerance.  
  
Always you die through the sunrise  
toward the morning disguising warmths.  
The order of the quivers transluscent silvery lava to my disintered wreath!  
Because I love you, love, among the fire and in front of the earth.  
What is this calculation but a memory conquered of its veins?  
My heart is filled with pride like a silk kis.  
It is a tale of listless wastelands  
fashion on the oxides that wait for you  
disguising the calcerous chairs, erupting the doors.
