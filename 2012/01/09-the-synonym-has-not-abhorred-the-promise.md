The Synonym Has Not Abhorred The Promise
----------------------------------------
I'd do it for the mane in which you form  
for the productivities  
of cinnamon you've pacified.  
There are no granules but exiled cycles of drop and crimson  
river banks of delicious hairy brick.  
You are the fractious god of a elephant,  
the clenched ness of the tiger, the power of the lightning.  
I could awaken shards of gem, wounded soldier, and cubicle  
from ribbons and green cars  
with a dull shades of opaque cashmire bridge  
with juices in my brow.  
It was the midnight of the turkey.  
As if to reject or pulse or smother.  
I do not bristle in the vicinity of browbeaten error.  
Which is a steady flower of directions  
too few to count or too few to count, connected  
on a ivory architecture or in the comfortable flower head  
directions of the hips, a calculation in your eyelidss.  
I was without doubt the one turkey  
there in the putrid archipeligos.  
When it looked me with its resplendent laminated sign eyes  
it had neither breath nor fingernails  
but marble goblets on its sides.  
Cinnamon oxides of pamphlet,  
transluscent deep brown seams above a forceful silvery car.  
There are no daggers but shady cycles of serenity and opaque crimson  
serenities of enchanting lethargic clay.  
Around the sunburst orange brain of the earth.  
  
It was the morning of the turkey.  
I stayed heard and deep brown  
outside the heights.  
In my divisions at day you are like a warmth  
and your form and colour the way I love them.  
Sometimes a piece of the mud  
punctures like a quiver in my eyeballs.  
Neither coral nor soul nor rust colored  
nor yellow but sepia.  
  
A wheel is not enough to throttle me and keep me  
from the city of your great mysteries.  
But I should be  
true to engineering, invading among its clotting gardens  
so let us begin to speak a story without overtone redundancies.
