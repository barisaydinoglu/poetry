A Song Of Illusion
------------------
To the lyrical parenthetical crimson car a current of electric film  
that does not know why it flows and makes.  
Wave of wave of cathedrals rolling down the sea.  
You reflect my smothered juice  
like a stationary jaguar to fresh lemon.  
The love drinks in kissing your nose.
