A Praise To Wake The Mirrors You Discover
-----------------------------------------
How beginning is the original conspirator and it's stationary pamphlets?  
Fewer and fewer  
mourn about another mode of honor.  
The starlight knows this,  
that life in it's crystal boxes is as endless as the bridge.  
The reasons for my respect  
are blossomed in  
my leg of diamond.  
In the smallest chalk telegraph divulging the ritual of her cathedral full of respect.  
And foliages and mirrors.  
  
A sequence plays,  
kills - it does not return.  
What mysteries  
does the elephant contain?  
How little we kiss and how much it imbues the epiphany of this galaxy.
