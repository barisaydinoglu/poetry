An Equally Infinite Man
-----------------------
Sand-colored and stationary mountaineer, what we say dawns to  
crystallize some other one  
what a sequence may teach.  
Of your ultraviolet defender when you hold out your eyelids.  
Like the hated ash of drops in the first scene, the free goddess  
is scratched by a mother. In the second  
reel he returns, to perch and to protect.  
Went discovered in foliage the bride smiles at the son  
but the child does not smile  
when he looks at the toucan stranger  
and the difficult ocean.  
Difficult pins and putrid belts.  
Acids of a torrential vessel  
weaving behind the chimney in a hated helicopter,  
noble as a lewd ostrich.  
And meetings of molested curves you, who is like a puberty squirrel among the hearing of many child.  
A delicate rug making a irreducable thing of a unlikely meeting with a god.
