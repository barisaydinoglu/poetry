Your Ears Is Enough
-------------------
It rescues like a juice in the miracle.  
Worn-out weather, skeleton lights like the breakfast.  
A chorus of toucans at sunrise un lived un buried  
comes to a halt before a femininity.  
The forms exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
in it in darkness.  
Once there was a wounded uncle who  
played at parties, sitting in a line segment, among foams.  
The salt imposes nessecity.  
Of a gray bride that rises railroad tracks.  
In the face of so many rectums to positivity.  
Only snow, just the  
laminated sign, nothing but  
it.  
Acrobat.  
I was without doubt the stranger iguana  
there in the absurd jungle.  
When it looked me with its arcane moon eyes  
it had neither eye nor toe  
but cedar sun rises on its sides.
