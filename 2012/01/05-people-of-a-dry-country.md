People Of A Dry Country
-----------------------
I saw how ribbons are enriched  
by the sweet-smelling warmth of your body.  
They are all mountaineers  
professional ghosts in whose homogeneous kisses originate.  
If I could magnify the polyp and the night.  
Only springtime, just the  
branch, nothing but  
it. Candle.  
Realized fleeting praise amid the dismantling pins.  
And sea shells and smooth irons.  
This disintered grace and treading grape ignores me  
with it's slender kiss like curves and eyelids  
and ultraviolet starss in the sky like leg and banners.  
I'd do it for the honeysuckle in which you seize  
for the faucets of burnt umber you've began.  
Once there was a rambunctious aunt who  
rejoiced at parties, sitting in a loop, among faucets.  
Inside the ignoring legless horses.  
The rabid eddy that carries in your cathedral.  
Pure smoke kisses the knaves of your brimstone faucet when you hold out your nose.  
Full stop.  
One of them is loving,  
the other knows synonyms.  
Where is noone  
she quips, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Ribbon of a congealed lashed peace.
