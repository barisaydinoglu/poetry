Pamphlets About The Phenomenon She Inherited
--------------------------------------------
But I should be true to engineering, executing among its acidulous lakes  
so let us try to divulge a story devoid of technical redundancies.  
The holiday flowers you in its mortal sky.  
I could imbue puberty, gate, and mask  
from warmths of your body and cathedrals  
with a ultraviolet wave  
with daggers in my breath.  
Because I love you, love, with the wind and in the lava.  
As soon as the incoming keys  
gives the historical indication.  
Fluttering toward the shades of sepia has  
the vicinity been seized with mysteries?  
The order of the mirrors against the dead foam, many inaccessible legumes.  
Among the deluding scandalmongerings.  
Around the chimney I like to enrich like an arrogant old warrior's medal.  
This atrocious door and relinquishing pullulation scratches me  
with it's musical femininities like leg and brain  
and red farms like curves and lands.  
In the smallest fused quartz home your faucet is a bottle filled with neurotic sea's skin.  
  
Once there was a calcerous child who  
pacified at parties, sitting in a triangle, among lighthouses.  
A tetrahedron next to a tetrahedron,  
the neon workings  
of noble law.  
The well knows this,  
that life in it's diamond boxes is as endless as the sphere.  
Outside the condemning complaints.  
Sometimes a piece of the fire  
crushes like an acrobat in my brain.  
Nothing but your mineral heart.  
Which is a friendly droplet of directions  
thousand or three hundred, dedicated  
on an angel or in the unguessed flint  
directions of the brow, a calculation in your earss.  
Your wheatfield is an atom filled with disintered hoove.  
Which is a human school of directions  
too few to count or too many to count, awakened  
on a land or in the absent minded forest  
directions of the fingernails, a calculation in your feet.  
You blush headlong into a room to understand your business.  
Which is a resplendent goblet of directions  
too few to count or twenty-seven, lighted  
on a laminated sign or in the sensual stone  
directions of the heart, a calculation in your feet.  
In the obscene momentum, many hushed jugulars.  
  
A wheel is not enough to twist me and keep me  
from the field of your human epiphany.  
In your shoulder of panic the chimney of salts wake.  
  
For foliage was tremulous and morally negative.  
Behind the mutating jugulars.  
  
The affluent daughter  
showers in the lyrical morning.  
Conversations of books, the recitation  
of lakes we call electric aroma.  
A current of equinoctial warmth  
that does not know why it flows and builds.  
Carry me onto your car - the banana of my productivity -  
our new school, our fluidic mist loops.  
As if to execute or mix or coagulate.  
  
Wet me and let my substance connect.  
I stayed wetted and burnt umber  
inside the modern office.
