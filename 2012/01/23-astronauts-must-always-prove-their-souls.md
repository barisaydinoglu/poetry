Astronauts Must Always Prove Their Souls
----------------------------------------
One of them is plumed,  
the other knows cameras.  
Where is someone  
she says, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
As soon as the incoming shadess of transluscent silvery  
gives the historical indication.  
What natural suns -  
the vicinity is filled with it,  
springtimes for the kiss and the listless crystal.  
I enrich as if behind a frightened coal.
