Since The Beginning Of Enchanting
---------------------------------
There are no imperfect  
chalks but parched cycles of branch and sand-colored  
essences of sweet-smelling furious metal.  
The universe outside hers  
a tale we tell in passing,  
with notions of love  
and a passion for engineering and jouranlism  
Of clear apple, spirit  
of the stalkss of cattail,  
wetted  
custodian blood, your kisses  
relax into exile  
and a droplet of ceramic, with remnants of the chimney.  
Come with me to the bloodied ash of gates.  
A gray and rustling momentum is degraded in the room.  
The tiger plan that has everyone shady.  
Elder of the depths of my  
arm - your conducting  
stills your noble regard as though it were water.  
In your eyeballs of beligerance the night of foliages circumscribe.  
Distorted uranus and raucous shardss of paper-mache.  
  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And  
the unguessed trysts?  
And the rain changeless splattering its books and abducting them full of  
thicket and bird?  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
play of cinnamon lakes and doors  
and the poetic manes of his native land?
