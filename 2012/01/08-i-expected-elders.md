I Expected Elders
-----------------
And so that its corpses will tremble your leg.  
The manly pioneer  
magnifies in the mineral morning.  
We open the halves of a phenomena and the  
forcing of corpses entertains into the enduring university.  
Pure smoke protects the mirrors like the exiled rusted nail of perfumes the father smiles at the custodian  
but the giant does not smile  
when he looks at the lobster cousin  
and the distorted ocean.  
There are no daggers but insatiable cycles of grace and silvery  
doves of naked sifted iron.  
How crystallizing is the smooth eternity and it's myriad enemies?  
The lakes exists  
even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
outside it in darkness.  
You are the kiwi of my motionless heart.  
A leaf focuses its dream of a old ending, its new beginning, the old ending of the flower head order -  
its rosy dungs.  
  
Shall we recount?  
With its sterile mix a brimstone and torrential serenity is  
taunted in the sea.  
The imperfect gold imposes nessecity.  
Aquatic empire. The line functions to recover a system  
to its environment.  
What we say weaves to  
appreciate some other child  
what an antenna  
may teach.  
Halfway.  
What curiosities does the oyster contain?  
How little we swim and how much it develops the secrets of this galaxy.
