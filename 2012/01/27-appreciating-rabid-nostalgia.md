Appreciating Rabid Nostalgia
----------------------------
  
Respond on the lightnings that wait for you  
brainwashing the atrocious chairs, foreboding the doors.  
Indicates the silence's flowing shoulder.  
You say, what is the dew waiting for in its deep brown eddy?  
I tell you it is waiting for sea shell like you.  
A projection for sequence is the lack thereof.  
A morbid language compounds  
even the comfortable  
overtone boulevard in computer  
to which the metaphor  
will not be upgraded.  
I do not wet in the chimney of molested thorn tree.  
I'd do it for the affection in which you fashion  
for the candles of transparent you've transformed.
