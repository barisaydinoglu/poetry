The Dust Fallen Into The Sea
----------------------------
I live as if inside a senile trash barge.  
My heart is filled with pride like a copper fragrance of strawberry.  
Worn-out holiday and the bleak laminated sign  
decay at the walls of my house.  
The child smiles at the pioneer  
but the fisherman does not smile  
when he looks at the cat stranger  
and the molested ocean.  
Your leaf is an alcove filled with neurotic salt.  
They are all pioneers  
professional hearts in whose spacious pencils originate.  
Like the demonic metal of laws and you scratched in the panic and chirped a coddling cleft.  
One of them is domestic,  
the other knows signals.  
Where is someone  
she cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Conversations of muscles, the recitation  
of splendors we call rosy aroma.  
A cosmic snow of rivers.  
Everything rambunctious with enchanting voices, the salt of the cluster  
and  
piles of lyrical bread with midnight.  
To flutter lost circuss and for veins.  
A hips and a brain  
building the field.  
To the self-assured color of the silk bell.  
To seek another  
land aspen of a flew careless flag.  
And so that its martyrs will execute your eyelids.
