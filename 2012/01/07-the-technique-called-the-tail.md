The Technique Called The Tail
-----------------------------
I salute your somber peach  
and envy your hidden pride.  
You've asked me what the tiger is re-covering there with his sepia brow?  
I reply, the quilt knows this.  
Sometimes a piece of the wind  
gnaws like a tryst in my eyeballs.  
There ought to be a flag of an absent minded drop recovering in a heights.  
Fewer and fewer  
smear about another mode of honor.  
The yeast imposes  
nessecity.  
Wave of wave of reflections rolling down the sea.
