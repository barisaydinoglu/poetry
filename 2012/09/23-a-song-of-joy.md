A Song Of Joy
-------------
Fear and railroad track - forests of agony.  
Under the chimney like steel.  
One overtone option and where laminated signs meet  
warmths meet, behind and in front of and the sound  
of blades, to reach out and shower in animosity.  
Like explications soddening within mists.
