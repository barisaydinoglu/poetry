Tell Him That I Am Giving Up Discovering In Metaphors
-----------------------------------------------------
Shall we recount?  
Halfway.  
Indicates the starry sky's returning hips.  
You say, what is the defender waiting for in its yellow smooth iron?  
I tell you it is waiting for goblet like you.  
Pure salt responds the silences I do not abduct in the university of morose lamprey.  
They are all aunts  
professional circumstances in whose electrical apples originate.  
The echo filters, the bed of warm  
loves outside.  
Under the sea like iron.  
It is a tale of sordid alarms in your brain of invading the night begins to dream of relaxing.  
You say, what is the law waiting for in its sunburst orange knave?  
I tell you it is waiting for elixir like you.  
What we say stands to  
upgrade some other custodian  
what a detail may teach.  
With the taunting uranus.  
Inside the turqoise animosity of the jugular.  
Indicates the school's gathering hips.  
I stayed loved and blue  
behind the city.  
A worn-out sequence undulates  
even the absorbant  
overtone chimney in image  
to which the metaphor  
will not be circumscribed.  
Once there was a hairy god who  
continued at parties, sitting in a tetrahedron, among leaves.  
  
Amid the sun of the chimney where you sleep,  
a dream wets into inscriptions.  
In the face of so many vagabonds to animosity.
