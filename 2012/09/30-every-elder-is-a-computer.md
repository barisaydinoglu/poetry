Every Elder Is A Computer
-------------------------
But the railroad track crystallized the memory.  
The shaken pullulation that flows in your sea shell.  
A fog of souls brings all the devours circuss.  
Brings all the drops roses.  
One algorithmic option and behind transparent water and deep brown corals.  
A metaphor reconciles,  
forces - it does not return.  
  
Under the divisions like graphite.  
In the first scene, the indespensable father  
is fell by a son. In the second  
scene he returns, to wake and to divulge.  
A vessel is not enough to coddle me and keep me  
from the universe of your dashing secrets.  
Which is a serene quiver of directions  
thousand or too many to count, grew  
on a pencil or in the pure map  
directions of the eyelids, a calculation in your brows.  
In the smallest saphire mosaic how gathering is the fluidic seperation and it's musical pamphlets?  
You say, what is the hat waiting for in its sepia echo?  
I tell you it is waiting for drop like you.  
Always you conquer through the afternoon  
toward the sunset rejecting wells.
