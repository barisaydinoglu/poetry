Meaning As Panics
-----------------
The daughter smiles at the man  
but the giant does not smile  
when he looks at the oyster man  
and the negligent ocean.  
And  
you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
travel of suns and propellers  
and the absent minded flags of his native land?  
Outside transparent water and  
yellow sepia cars.  
A loaf of bread baked with inevitable happiness and salt.  
In my chimney at holiday you are like a rose  
and your form and colour the way I rejoice them.  
I wish to make a tetrahedron  
outside, and every abstraction, many  
times hidden in an awe.  
I stayed lighted and  
transparent  
in the jungle.  
Not performing is a form of drinking.  
The apple knows this,  
that life in it's  
emerald boxes is as endless as the candle.  
A serenity -like consequence  
the writing knows this,  
that life in it's diamond boxes is as endless as the book.  
The hated alcove is  
solute on your mouth.  
For a day, maybe too few to count,  
I rested under a pillow of fog  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the astronaut to be in.  
If I could tread the conspirator and the night.
