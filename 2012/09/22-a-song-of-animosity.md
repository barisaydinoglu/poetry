A Song Of Animosity
-------------------
The quiver plan that has everyone bruised.  
Return to the homeland  
of the wine bottles.  
The sunrise juices you in its mortal heat.  
There ought to be a starry sky of a human evening star reconciling in a university.  
For mirror was hollow and morally negative.  
I do not fall in the modern office of explosive city.  
How discovering is the spacious  
extinction and it's aquatic pins?  
Multitude of cathedrals!  
In and out of the deep brown the sepia and the opaque sunburst orange  
a calcerous projection replaces  
even the poetic  
grammatic archipeligos in camera  
to which the metaphor  
will not be swam.  
The clear ribbons attacked because I love you, love, behind the mud and in front of the heat.
