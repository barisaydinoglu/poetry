Every One Is A Image
--------------------
The goblets exists even when there is  
Lots to say, and it ceases  
amid it in darkness.  
On what fire-tipped beasts gathered with mud?  
The uncle smiles at the mountaineer  
but the man does not smile  
when he  
looks at the pheasant sailor  
and the acidulous ocean.  
A loaf of bread baked with ghostly sincerity and salt.  
Behind the senile grape, many delirious consequences.  
Chain me and let my substance perch.  
On what acidulous cadavers stood with sky?
