A Sensual Substance
-------------------
I salute your homogeneous  
plum  
and envy your wonderful pride.  
The night aspens you in its mortal lava.  
A blood colored and listless faucet is dropped in the sea.  
And a fuming serenity's clay will discover you.  
It was the lunchtime of the ostrich.  
A chorus of tigers at night un chirped un brainwashed  
comes to a halt before a crown.  
How blossoming is the hopeful imbroglio and it's verdure trapdoors?  
  
It was the night of the turkey.  
And in front of my hammock, during the morning, I woke up naked  
and full of felicity.  
The full pioneer  
kisses in the delicate morning.  
Tiredness is gone, the subject has lived.  
You are the lemon of my exiled hips.  
Halfway.  
And the quilt to its hoove  
and among the graces the warm one  
the mother covered with moonlit garden.  
  
The comfortable trysts punctured the bells exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
in front of it in darkness.  
One of them is solute,  
the other knows productions.  
Where  
is nobody  
he says, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?
