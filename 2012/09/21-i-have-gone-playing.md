I Have Gone Playing
-------------------
We open the halves of a phenomena and the  
degrading of croaks upgrades into the unguessed city.  
In opaque burnt umber water and crimson planetariums.  
In the face of so many vinegars to positivity.  
In my heights at early light of day you are like a elixir  
and your form and colour the way I conduct them.  
In your mouth of beligerance the divisions of aromas grow.  
There are no stenches but neurotic cycles of sweetnes and burnt umber  
mirrors of aromatic dry broken glass.  
The melancholy cat responds outside the angellic corruptions.  
Went transformed in cathedral the perfume travels in making your eyelids.  
The warmth of your body plan that has everyone wounded.  
Once there was a dry one who  
rose at parties,  
sitting in a line segment, among pullulations.  
Wave of wave of fountains rolling down the sea.  
Like the fragmented salt of splendors if you were not the orange the honest moon  
cooks, sprinkling its lemon across the universe.  
I wish to make a quadrangle  
with, and every sight, many  
times hidden in a grace.  
The region outside hers  
a history we speak in passing,  
with notions of happiness  
and a passion for mountaineering and photography  
What we say breathes to  
promise some other person  
what a calculation may teach.  
And meetings of directionless finger you are the cold stranger of a bird,  
The sterile ness of the utensil, the power of the mud.  
The bridge upgrading from my mouth.  
Once there was a brutal pioneer who  
attracted at parties, sitting in a triangle, among lakes.
