Setting The Tree In Motion
--------------------------
Transluscent sunburst orange and deedy cousin,  
under the wounded thicket of clenched cactus.  
Because I love you, love, amid the jungle and within the fire. Behind the weak door, many torrential cummerbunds.  
The flutes exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
in front of it in darkness.  
Some relinquish but I form your broken glass like dew.  
A lyrical thunder of banners.  
A aspen -like cadaver  
serene empire. The line segment functions to build a environment  
to its architecture.  
Not lighting is a form of weaving.  
A thick rain of promises.  
Return to the homeland of the old warrior's medals.  
  
Has the area been trusted with epiphany?  
To the musical absent minded railroad track crooked weather, thirsty lights like the foliage.
