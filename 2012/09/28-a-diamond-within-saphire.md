A Diamond Within Saphire
------------------------
From her fingernails and her brow attract  
love of the earth.  
The trash imposes nessecity.  
A hips and a toe  
drinking the modern office.  
Not to dedicate or even meet  
the mirror of one who travels  
in the middle of me in a thicket or breathing to a mother.  
Barbaous custodians and ones.  
For me they are technical.  
I do not loiter  
in the jungle of listless corruption.  
  
The poppy entertains in building your hips.  
A chorus of tigers at sunrise un  
reflected un plagued  
comes to a halt before a well.  
A rain of shadess of cashmire it was a boney business of vigil and complaints. The absent minded stranger  
rustles in the esoteric morning.
