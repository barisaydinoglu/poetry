A Diamond Within Diamond
------------------------
In your lip of agony the sea of silences relax.  
The obscene river bank is serene on your eyeballs.  
The tremulous fellowship is perfect on your eyelids.  
Outside cashmire water and yellow fused quartz architectures.  
In the first take, the delicious person  
is shattered by a person. In the second  
reel he returns, to attract and to relinquish.  
A frail detail wets  
even the hopeful  
algorithmic modern office in technique  
to which the metaphor  
will not be played.  
  
To seek another land rose of a rejected rotten book.  
The I in current the foams exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
outside it in darkness.
