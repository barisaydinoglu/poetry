The Technique Called The Fingernails
------------------------------------
Sometimes a piece of the sky  
mourns like a land in my eyeballs.  
Behind the motionless chimney of sordid wheatfield.  
Senile salts and inaccessible coals.  
From uncomfortable turbulence to harrowing wind,  
hidden homes drawn by clear channels, a  
arrogant propeller begins to develop.  
Your tail understands from north to west  
the sweet-smelling wooden architectures silenced carry me onto your bicycle - the grape of my autumn -  
which is a sensible foliage of directions  
too few to count or twenty-seven, began  
on a splendor or in the essential peace  
directions of the arm, a calculation in your mouths.
