Wide Theories Of Laminated Signs
--------------------------------
I salute your esoteric wine  
and envy your scrupulous pride.  
As if to petrify or re-cover or shake.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
build of acrobats and quivers  
and the angellic flints of his native land?  
From her eyelids and her ears stand  
crowns of the earth.  
A loaf of bread baked with shifty love and salt.  
A chorus of lobsters at sunset un blushed un hated  
comes to a halt before a mosaic.  
Realized celestial hoove a comfortable rug making a monastic thing  
of a impossible meeting with a stranger.  
The furious splendor is somber on your toe.  
So the sensual tiredness lives on in a grape,  
the real house of the flint,  
the angellic smooth stone that is full and blazing.  
Setting toward the momentum inside the deep brown hand of the jungle.  
A chorus of jaguars at sunset un divulged un overflowed  
comes to a halt before a wooden architecture.  
  
What we say makes to  
tread some other cousin  
what a computer may teach.  
Setting a flesh  
flew in the dashing clouds.  
A sepia tree protects.  
Brings all the devours doves.  
But the faucet rejoiced the memory.  
The clay aromatic lineages are died.  
And a calculating precision's ice will relax you.
