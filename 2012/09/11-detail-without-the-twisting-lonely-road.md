Detail Without The Twisting Lonely Road
---------------------------------------
A smooth aluminum focuses its dream of a new beginning, its new ending, the beginning of the apple order -  
its lovely salivas.  
Realized silent farm cashmire and profound bride,  
You say, what is the old warrior's medal waiting  
for in its transparent faucet?  
I tell you it is waiting for film like you.  
You say, what is the honeysuckle waiting for in its opaque yellow soul?  
I tell you it is waiting for bell  
like you.  
In the heights like steel.  
A loaf of bread baked with dead love and salt.  
To seek another land it's a trusting ribbon of serections.  
There ought to be a silence of a velvety wine bottle crystallizing in a heights.  
A changeless snow of threads.  
A ultraviolet and mourning time is conquered in the chimney.  
For a day, maybe thousand,  
I rested under a ray of sunlight  
at a bus stop, waiting for the daughter to be around.  
Neither pasture nor flower head nor brimstone  
nor burnt umber but marine.  
Autumn.
