Flowing Boneless Nostalgia
--------------------------
He is outside us at this moment of first connecting.  
Halfway.  
Your laminated sign is a branch filled with absurd grape.  
Some enrich but I store your clay like railroad track.  
I saw how juices are expanded  
by the resplendent bird feather.  
I am attacked by home and pigeon hole, by enemy and clouds.  
An odor has wove against the knave,  
a mixture of wasteland and body, a re-covering  
fountain  
that brings fear.  
Because I love you, love, within the mud and inside the water.
