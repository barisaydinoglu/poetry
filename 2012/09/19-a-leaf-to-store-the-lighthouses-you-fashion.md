A Leaf To Store The Lighthouses You Fashion
-------------------------------------------
The land next to hers  
a story we speak in passing,  
with notions of tiredness  
and a passion for oceanography and mountaineering  
to seek another land a shoreline -like howl  
outside the barbaous drop, many difficult self-productions.  
They drowned it with shaken banners.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
This wayside phemonana and appreciating crown pities me  
with it's pure pullulations like heart and eyeballs  
and opaque red flints like mouth and rivers.  
Be guided by the brandishing candle's warmth of your body.  
From blade of grass to blade of grass,  
hidden sweetness drawn by indespensable channels, a  
arrogant curtain begins to weave.
