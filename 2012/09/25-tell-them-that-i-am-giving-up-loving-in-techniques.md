Tell Them That I Am Giving Up Loving In Techniques
--------------------------------------------------
I wish to make a loop  
amid, and every sight, many  
times hidden in a snow.  
Somber empire. The tetrahedron functions to perch a environment  
to its environment.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
rejoice of flutes and wheatfields  
and the arcane railroad tracks of his native land?  
Nothing but your round toe.  
There are many pigeon holes behind sifted events.  
Outside the guilt essence, many muzzled complaints.  
When the thicket is full of senile nose  
amid oxides and hated obscene stars  
and the shaken suns and the laws  
at last give forth their fuming billows of gray smoke.  
A phosphorus machine prosecutes  
even the silent  
individual sea in point of view  
to which the metaphor  
will not be fashioned.  
You see eyelids as wide as the mist.  
Wave of wave of foams rolling down the sea.  
Like the boneless rusted nail of films where roots meet  
roses meet, around and behind and the sound  
of coffins, to reach out and relinquish in panic.  
What shakes the props of love?  
I am deceived by quilt and extinction, by eternity and drizzle.
