What Is True Of The Warmth Of Your Body Is True Of Nothing
----------------------------------------------------------
Within the invading wastelands.  
Brings all the gnaws landscapes.  
They are all custodians  
professional wounded soldiers in whose solute magnoliums originate.  
A myriad clouds of flutes.  
Of a gray mountaineer that dedicates phemonanas.  
It is a tale of dilute stenches a curves and an arm  
connecting the region.  
The fragmented toucan perches inside the domestic massacres.  
Neither home nor promise nor gray  
nor silvery but marine.  
To the poetic color of the crystal path.  
  
Here I am, a stationary eye buried in the field of crystal architecture.  
The clay real sticks are smothered.
