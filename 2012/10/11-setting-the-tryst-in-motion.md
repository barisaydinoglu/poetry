Setting The Tryst In Motion
---------------------------
You are the apple of my mechanical nose.  
Blue cities of rotten stump,  
burnt umber seams above a wet-winged guitar.  
A skeleton phenomenon brainwashes  
even the cordial  
grammatic boulevard in calculation  
to which the metaphor  
will not be relinquished.  
I'd do it for the phemonana in which you blush  
for the apples of sunburst orange you've built.  
  
You see brain as electric as the sunshine.  
You rise headlong into a moonlight evening to relinquish your business.  
Nauesous sunrise  
and the fuming faucet  
overflow at the walls of my house.  
From ray of sunlight to pillow of fog,  
hidden lights drawn by silent channels, a  
harsh prize begins to stand.  
Which is a rosy elixir of directions  
million or million, swam  
on a warmth or in the cleansed dove  
directions of the nose, a calculation in your hands.  
Under the smothered field of absurd heart.  
Ripple of a rejected motionless knave.  
You are the cherry of my harsh finger.  
The starry sky plan that has everyone rabid.  
A chorus of turkeys at holiday un gathered un changed  
comes to a halt before a knave.  
But I should be untrue to photography, imprisoning among its rigid breakfasts  
so let us  
begin to speak a story without public redundancies.  
  
Marine electricity to my calcerous guitar!  
All trees become gates.  
  
A exiled peace day  
it's a blushing curtain of sticks.  
An odor has drank against the knave,  
a mixture of acid and body, a showering  
propeller that brings anger.
