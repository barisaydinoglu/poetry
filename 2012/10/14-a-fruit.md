A Fruit
-------
A chorus of pheasants at fortnight un responded un filtered  
comes to a halt before a poppy.  
As if to crack or pulse or shake.  
Which is a resplendent candle of directions  
three hundred or million, recovered  
on a wheatfield or in the somber river  
directions of the tail, a calculation in your curvess.  
A image seizes,  
abandons - it does not return.  
In the smallest chalk starlight an odor has lighted under the productivity,  
a mixture of blade and body, a relinquishing  
apple that brings animosity.  
Happiness is gone, the subject has reconciled.  
  
How reflecting is the aquatic lineage and it's parenthetical sticks?  
In the face of so many seperations to functionality.  
Around the city I like to wet like a neon stone.  
So the deedy sincerity lives on in a mango,  
the stationary house of the mane,  
the enchanting sea water that is lion hearted and parenthetical.  
Our new tiger, our equinoctial school quadrangles.
