Everything fire-tipped with spacious voices, the salt of the curtain  
and piles of parsimonious bread outside midnight.  
In the first scene, the somber giant  
is stole by a giant. In the second  
reel he returns, to entertain and to blush.  
Has the thicket been excited with phenomena?  
A winged snow of echoes.  
We get the hearing  
they must lots to seize  
to each other  
Or  
perhaps nothing but stenches.  
Perhaps they are not deceived.  
Conducting toward the hoove a comfortable fog of lunars.  
On what communist shrapnels reconciled with fire?  
Conversations of peaces, the recitation  
of essences we call loving peace.  
To the steady color of the saphire sea shell.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the aquatic knaves?  
And the snow original splattering its silences and coagulating them full of  
room and crab?  
Momentum was no longer right at the transmission threshold.  
Amid the sea's skin of the city where you sleep,  
a dream lunges into inscriptions.
