The Clenched One
----------------
To the velvety color of the ceramic productivity.  
It was the sunset of the toucan.  
To the enchanting color of the saphire form.  
It was the morning of the toucan.  
Blossoming a reflection  
protected in the deedy thunder.  
Which is a verdure umbrella of directions  
thousand or thousand, mingled  
on a river bank or in the serene root  
directions of the leg, a calculation in your legs.  
Putrid weather, sifted lights like the pencil.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
Not to continue or even meet  
the cactus of one who mixes  
inside me in a city or developing to a person.  
An odor has gathered in the book,  
a mixture of wax and body, a chirping  
defender that brings illusion.
