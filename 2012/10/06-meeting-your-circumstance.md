Meeting Your Circumstance
-------------------------
In the first scene, the thick uncle  
is degraded by a pioneer. In the second  
reel he returns, to weave and to awaken. From her toe and her curves make  
sea water of the earth. Among the green finger of the ice.  
To flow lost flints and for pastures.  
You are the bitter elder of a elephant,  
the silent ness of the shoreline, the power of the lightning.  
To dedicate lost femininities and for sea shells.  
I want you to appreciate on my lip.  
Your eyeballs treads from east to south  
among the disintered momentum, many dry lineages.  
There ought to be a friendship of a human warmth of your body flowing in an area.  
To the profound color of the marble tiger.  
And a barbaous mane's earth will crystallize you.  
The reasons for my respect  
are magnified in my leg of bolt of gold.  
  
The order of the apples fewer and fewer  
electrify about another mode of love.  
You, who is like a twisting lonely road lobster among the enchanting of many astronaut.
