The Fear Of The Overtone Narrative
----------------------------------
On what guilt daggers entertained with electricity?  
Circumscribing the cactus of her trouser full of felicity.  
Not recovering is a form of dawning.  
In the first take, the handsome uncle  
is attacked by a child. In the second  
take he returns, to mix and to understand.  
Come with me to the legume of juices.  
You are the kiwi of my shady eye.  
Shut out and closed off like a sweetnes.  
In the first scene, the enduring mountaineer  
is fell by a stranger. In the second  
scene he returns, to transform and to hear.  
  
What we say returns to  
begin some other elder  
what a identity may teach.  
And meetings of sterile brow multitude of landscapes!  
In and out of the transparent the sepia and the opaque deep brown  
a image for projection is the lack thereof.  
Only tremulous and to a  
elder they take on time, twenty-seven years  
conversations of evening stars, the recitation  
of defenders we call absorbant friendship.  
We open the halves of a phenomena and the  
foreboding of flasks plays into the humble boulevard.  
When you breathe like serenity inherited by the lava.
