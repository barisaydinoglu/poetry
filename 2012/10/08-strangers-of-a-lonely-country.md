Strangers Of A Lonely Country
-----------------------------
  
Flutter on the conspirators that wait for you  
replacing the sordid  
chairs, trembling the doors.  
To seek another land the order of the leaves a law focuses its dream of a old ending, its beginning, the beginning of the wreath order -  
its lyrical traps.  
Not to reflect or even meet  
the atom of one who responds  
against me in an area or travelling to a elder.  
Oily early light of day and the rusted perfume  
throttle at the walls of my house.
