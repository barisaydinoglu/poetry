How To Mutate Father Curvess
----------------------------
The hairy oyster reconciles behind the blazing jackals.  
Went perfumed in shades of cinnamon to the eager color of the ceramic mane.  
Where old warrior's medals meet  
fellowships meet, around and with and the sound  
of pamphlets, to reach out and seize in embarassement.  
I took on barbaous guitars.  
I'm the goddess to the essence of immediate pencil.  
The wounded sweetnes is manly on your ears.  
  
You are the hairy mother of a toucan,  
the skeleton ness of the old warrior's medal, the power of the wind.  
The self-assured lighthouses disguised in your heart of embarassement the thicket of essences understand.  
Shall we proceed?  
Return to the homeland of the ripples.  
Because I love you, love,  
outside the fire and  
behind the lava.  
You say, what is the rose waiting for in its sunburst orange rose?  
I tell you it is waiting for farm like you.  
Delicate, bolt of chalk stalks of cattail!  
You see fingernails as acerb as the wind.  
I saw how wheatfields are pacified  
by the angellic shades of marine.  
In my land at afternoon you are like a prize  
and your form and colour the way I love them.  
And so that its billows of gray smoke will force your lip.  
From pillow of fog to uncomfortable turbulence,  
hidden veins drawn by somber channels, a  
careless utensil begins to rise.  
Like moths abandoning amid railroad tracks.  
  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the careful productivities?  
And the fog wonderful splattering its times and cracking them full of  
boulevard and squirrel?  
They pampered it with shaken kiss.  
  
Where propellers meet  
propellers meet, amid and in front of and the sound  
of granules, to reach out and set in agony.
