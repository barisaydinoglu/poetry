Since The End
-------------
To seek another land always you congeal through the sunrise  
toward the afternoon bristling magnoliums.  
You are the shady pioneer of a lobster,  
the imperalist ness of the autumn, the power of the electricity.  
The celestial dignity of the smooth stone!  
Your breath mingles from west to north  
Shut up and shut up like a sea water.  
Imbroglios of a rotten car  
flowing around  
the chimney outside a exiled bicycle,  
steady as a careless bird.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.
