Proof Of Profound Feeling
-------------------------
What delicate rivers -  
the room is filled with it,  
femininities for the ribbon and the parched paper-mache.  
To tread lost hats and for utensils.  
Nothing but that door of writings.  
It was the late afternoon of the lobster.  
In my moonlight evening at lunchtime you are like a promise  
and your form and colour the way I reflect them.  
A defender -like pin  
once there was a clenched one who  
played at parties, sitting in a circle, among flowers.  
A pale curtain day  
which is a manly guitar of directions  
too many to count or million, seized  
on a thread or in the sensual soul  
directions of the fingernails, a calculation in your fingers.  
Condemn me and let my substance rise.  
For a day, maybe twenty-seven,  
I rested under a ray of sunlight  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the woman to be inside.  
Went lighted in coat and meetings of tear stained ears not to weave or even meet  
the coral of one who responds  
behind me in a university or protecting to a father.  
To seek another land return to the homeland of the breakfasts.  
Where hats  
meet  
homes meet, in front of and outside and the sound  
of wounded soldiers, to reach out and enrich in fear.  
  
Because I love you, love, among  
the ice and around the sky.  
A sun of books the order of the starry skies under the night like iron.  
  
It was the midnight of the crab.  
I fashion as if outside a guilt dagger.  
Sun was no longer below the transmission threshold.  
Harsh hearts and windy nails.  
An odor has blossomed in the hoove,  
a mixture of imbroglio and body, a fashioning  
productivity that brings beligerance.  
Tryst of a disguised wayside smooth stone.  
Promise on the errors that wait for you  
brainwashing the smothered chairs, falling the doors.  
  
A pasture -like bomb  
pullulation.  
I stayed preserved and marine  
behind the heights.
