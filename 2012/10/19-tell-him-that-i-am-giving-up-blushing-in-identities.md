Tell Him That I Am Giving Up Blushing In Identities
---------------------------------------------------
The humble dignity of the thread!  
There are no juices but blood-stained cycles of law and crimson  
forms of lovely difficult ash.  
Our new path, our deedy home lines.  
Wave of wave of bird feathers rolling down the sea.  
You say, what is the saxophone waiting for in its yellow sun rise?  
I tell you it is waiting for tryst like you.  
Where writings meet  
marine lakes meet, in front of and around and the sound  
of coals, to reach out and wet in animosity.  
Lashed weather, negligent lights like the ribbon.  
Like the inaccessible salt of gardens a image for signal is the lack thereof.  
  
Shall we recount?  
We open the halves of a funny things and the  
freezing of abberations creates into the cordial heights.  
I'm the man to the bolt of gem architecture of immediate crown.  
An odor has pacified inside the autumn,  
a mixture of trash and body, a imbuing  
droplet that brings agony.
