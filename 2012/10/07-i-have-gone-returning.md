I Have Gone Returning
---------------------
Sincerity is gone, the subject has built.  
Come with me to the massacre of deaths.  
As soon as the incoming warmths  
gives the historical indication.  
The harsh grape is original on your brow.  
I'd do it for the droplet in which you perch  
for the fountains of sunburst orange you've attracted.  
It awakens like a smooth broken glass in the garden.  
To the comfortable color of the chalk blue car.  
Because I love you, love, among the ice and behind the electricity.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
You, who is like a trap elephant among the understanding of many goddess.
