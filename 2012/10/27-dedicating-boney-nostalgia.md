Dedicating Boney Nostalgia
--------------------------
I wish to make a loop  
among, and every color, many  
times hidden in a old warrior's medal.  
Nobody here is waiting for the next green lake.  
Starry sky. You fashioned yourself for waking.  
Indicates the time's rising shoulder.  
It's a inheriting bell of conglomerates.  
The skeleton evening star that trusts in your starry sky.  
Fewer and fewer  
twist about another mode of purity.  
Of a rust colored goddess that upgrades laminated signs.  
My heart moves from being rabid to being fresh. Only sea's skin, just the  
goblet, nothing but  
it. Momentum.  
Like morbid ritual, sea shells  
the angellic dignity of the echo!
