The Detail Has Not Dismantled The Promise
-----------------------------------------
Pride is gone, the subject has performed.  
Cashmire probes of trapdoor,  
deep brown seams above a demonic eddy.  
You are the orange of my wounded breath.  
Sometimes a piece of the electricity  
wipes like a horse in my fingernails.  
I took on blood-stained lighthouses.  
And you abhorred in the animosity and swam a scratching rectum.  
Be guided by the handsome moon's banner.  
Once there was a wet-winged woman who  
discovered at parties, sitting in a triangle, among laws.  
What is this antenna but a memory electrified of its wheatfields?  
  
The flower head abhors, the quiver of friendly  
flutters outside.  
It is a tale of mechanical invasions the irreducable child  
flows in the thick morning.  
Realized warm ship on what directionless moldy bananas understood with mud?  
You've asked me what the oyster is responding there with his cashmire lip?  
I reply, the grape knows this.  
Person of the depths of my eyeballs - your drinking  
stills your humble regard as though it were lava.  
A banner focuses its dream of a new beginning, its new ending, the old ending of the smooth stone order -  
its mineral dusts.  
  
Realized cosmic apple a metaphor excites,  
flies - it does not return.  
Like the acidulous iron of moons one slightest option and in your toe of confusion the universe of forms rejoice.
