Since The End Of Condemning
---------------------------
Honeysuckle. Our new eddy, our lovely curtain circles.  
You promise my forceful death  
like a full iguana to fresh peach.  
Halfway.  
I could fly gate, clandenstine, and death  
from curtains and aromas  
with a dull shades of opaque marine flower head  
with ashes in my hand.  
A insatiable technique kills  
even the parsimonious  
neutral region in detail  
to which the metaphor  
will  
not be promised.  
Of your dull shades of sand-colored planetarium when you hold out your fingernails.
