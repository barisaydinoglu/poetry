Song For The Pioneer Of Melancholy Serenities
---------------------------------------------
Of a turqoise mountaineer that flies defenders.  
The reasons for my respect  
are recovered in my mouth of chalk.  
You refresh slowly into an archipeligos to promise your business. Behind the green  
nose of the sky.  
To seek another land like violenet bed, magnoliums  
so the incredulous decency lives on in a mango,  
the somber house of the faucet,  
the promising heart that is absorbant and electrical.
