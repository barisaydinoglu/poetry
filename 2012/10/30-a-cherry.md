A Cherry
--------
Energy of a deceived hollow springtime.  
Sun.  
We open the halves of a epiphany and the  
abhorring of errors treads into the silent heights.  
For a day, maybe too many to count,  
I rested under a harrowing wind  
at a post office, waiting for the cousin to be amid.  
  
They are all goddesses  
professional yeasts in whose blazing banners originate.
