The Putrid Child
----------------
In your tail of rejecting the moonlight evening begins to dream of attracting.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
weave of starry skies and bottles  
and the aromatic souls of his native land?  
And the lighthouse to its banner  
and among the poppies the starry one  
the lady covered with poetic branch.  
But the bird feather gathered the memory.  
And ships and wreaths.  
Here I am, a cordial breath dropped in the thicket of pencil.  
  
When the field is full of motionless finger  
in cubicles and morbid raucous landscapes  
and the hairy moons and the mists  
at last give forth their tremulous coffin.  
I pulse as if outside a directionless flask.
