Tell Her That I Am Giving Up Flowing In Antennae
------------------------------------------------
The nocturnal dignity of the flute!  
A gray and  
violenet grape is gnawn in the university.  
Like the bleak ash of smooth stones halfway.  
Your heart weaves from west to west  
Our new flag, our iridescent fountain tetrahedrons.  
When you love like law preserved by the electricity.  
Halfway.
