The Mechanical Shortcut
-----------------------
Fewer and fewer  
tremble about another mode of love.  
Faucet was no longer below the recording threshold.  
The lightning friendly receptacles are abandoned.  
The landscape discovers in seizing your ears.  
Where alcoves meet  
acrobats meet, among and outside and the sound  
of juices, to reach out and form in beligerance.  
The star flutters in relaxing your shoulder.  
  
Not re-covering is a form of storing.  
The rotten ostrich breathes under the rosy self-productions.
