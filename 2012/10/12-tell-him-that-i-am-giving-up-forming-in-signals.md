Tell Him That I Am Giving Up Forming In Signals
-----------------------------------------------
Your brain seizes from east to north  
the water aquatic sticks are wetted.  
In the silvery curves of the mud.  
Muzzled dusts and wet-winged probes.  
Not the crimson moment  
when the early light of day upgrades the tigers.  
Shut out and pulled out like a serenity.  
Like distorted lake, ripples  
I recover as if in front of a careless stain.  
Dedicated and then breathed in the night.  
With its barbaous play there are many nougats outside decadent events.  
The eager dignity of the sweetnes!  
Dedicate on the enemies that wait for you  
foreboding the clenched chairs, coagulating the doors.  
And reflections and umbrellas.  
Our new school, our balanced ribbon loops.  
A production for technique is the lack thereof.  
They gnawn it with rigid pullulations.  
I salute your promising cheesecake  
and envy your slender pride.
