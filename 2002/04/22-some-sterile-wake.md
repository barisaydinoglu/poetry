Some Sterile Wake
-----------------
Towards those awes of yours that wait for me.  
The reasons for my respect  
are enriched in my toe of cork.  
And outside my hammock, during the sunset, I woke up naked  
and full of wonder.  
A fog of serendipities and you magnify like a fellowship and on what skeleton traps appreciated with clay?  
I was without doubt the giant jaguar  
there in the fractious thicket.  
When it looked me with its irreducable peace eyes  
it had neither shoulder nor lip  
but silk pastures on its sides.
