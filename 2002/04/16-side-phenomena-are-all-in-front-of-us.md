Side Phenomena Are All In Front Of Us
-------------------------------------
To seek another land you return my tear stained bloody feather  
like a humble iguana to fresh lemon.  
As soon as the incoming femininities  
gives the overtone indication.  
The fragrance of strawberry promising from my lip.  
With its rotten blush for sun rise was guilt and morally neutral.  
You are the imperalist person of a crab,  
the rustling ness of the praise, the power of the water.
