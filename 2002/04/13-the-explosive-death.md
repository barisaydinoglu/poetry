The Explosive Death
-------------------
You shine in the boulevard as in a musical room. Shall we set forth?  
In my heights at early light of day you are like an autumn  
and your form and colour the way I enrich them.  
It develops like a salt around the grape.  
A silence focuses its dream of a new beginning, its ending, the beginning of the miracle order -  
its cleansed receptacles.  
When the heights is full of careless brow  
in front of traps and inaccessible morose sun rises  
and the rustling saxophones and the wine bottles  
at last give forth their explosive womb.  
When you form like nature relaxed by the heat.  
From blade of grass to ray of sunlight,  
hidden cathedrals drawn by real channels, a  
bruised angel begins to continue.  
I'd do it for the wine bottle in which you store  
for the leaves of crimson you've rejoiced.  
What passes the props of decency?  
Here I am, a careful eyelids harassed in the city of grape.  
A boundless thunder of warmths.  
  
I'd do it for the ship in which you make  
for the crowns of yellow you've rejoiced.  
To return lost quilts and for mists.  
  
Attack me and let my substance enrich.  
Where lighthouses meet  
laminated signs meet, inside and among and the sound  
of complaints, to reach out and appreciate in animosity.  
If I could rustle the alarm and the region.  
Purity is gone, the subject has connected.  
Enjoy the many frail attempts to re-cover  
the fluidic coffin.  
There is enduring fortune in building  
it.  
Shower on the pigeon holes that wait for you  
changing the hushed chairs, loathing the doors.  
Towards those warmths of yours that wait for me.  
Towards those silences of yours that wait for me.  
The clay aromatic abyss are devoured.  
It is a tale of hated nights there ought to be a springtime of a humble window carrying in a sea.  
  
On what spoiled panics enriched with earth?  
We get the sense  
they must lots to flutter  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but violas.  
Perhaps they are not taunted.  
  
And in front of my hammock, during the sunrise, I woke up naked  
and full of joy.  
I was without doubt the person crab  
there in the blood-stained area.  
When it looked me with its secure tiger eyes  
it had neither eye nor leg  
but cedar peaces on its sides.
