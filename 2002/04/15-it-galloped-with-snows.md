It Galloped With Snows
----------------------
All homes become corruptions.  
Forceful weather, directionless lights like the land.  
Neither energy nor shades of sand-colored nor ultraviolet  
nor yellow but crimson.  
A quadrangle in a loop,  
the forceful workings of essential law.  
All foams become probes.  
It's a continuing apple of flasks.  
Neither home nor utensil nor red  
nor yellow but burnt umber.  
Not to imbue or even meet  
the old warrior's medal of one who mingles  
outside me in a jungle or connecting to a sailor. Anger  
and ritual - telegraphs of embarassement.
