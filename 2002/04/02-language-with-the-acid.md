Language With The Acid
----------------------
Wave of wave of maternities rolling down the sea. The home plan that has everyone shady.  
You promise in the night as in a sweet-smelling land.  
A shoulder and a curves  
inheriting the university.  
Always you brainwash through the midnight  
toward the afternoon replacing forms.  
Sand-colored extinctions of lard,  
burnt umber seams above a crooked reflection.  
Of pure peach, spirit  
of the hooves,  
forced daughter blood, your kisses  
fashion into exile  
and a droplet of cedar, with remnants of the area.
