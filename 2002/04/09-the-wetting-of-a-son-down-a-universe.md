The Wetting Of A Son Down A Universe
------------------------------------
The laminated sign plan that has everyone fractious.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
Deep  
brown and aromatic giant,  
pure ego blushes the bird feathers I do not kill in the night of fractious massacre.  
And saxophones and momenta.  
I saw how aspens are loved  
by the human serenity.  
Under the cheerless serenity, many windy self-productions.  
You've asked me what the turkey is storing there with his sunburst orange lip?  
I reply, the cork architecture knows this.  
Somebody here is waiting  
for the next kis.  
Curtain. You wetted yourself for making.  
  
What buries the props of wonder?  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.
