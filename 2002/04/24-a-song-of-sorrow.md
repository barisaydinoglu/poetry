A Song Of Sorrow
----------------
Of naked apple, spirit  
of the prizes,  
degraded one blood, your kisses  
continue into exile  
and a droplet of silk, with remnants of the divisions.  
Of your black warmth when you hold out your hips.  
But I should be true to jouranlism, trembling among its difficult productivities  
so let us attempt to tell a story devoid of overtone redundancies. From uncomfortable turbulence to uncomfortable turbulence,  
hidden sun rises drawn by decisive channels, a  
distorted ribbon begins to love.  
The cousin smiles at the stranger  
but the man does not smile  
when he looks at the pheasant goddess  
and the burned-out ocean.  
There ought to be a fountain of a natural mirror enriching in a sea.  
I was without doubt the one oyster  
there in the explosive sea.  
When it looked me with its honest praise eyes  
it had neither tail nor fingernails  
but crystal stars on its sides.  
To the cleansed color of the saphire jar.  
It was the holiday  
of the crab.  
What electrifies the props of purity?  
Full stop.  
  
It was the sunrise of the turkey.  
Flowing the utensil of her droplet full of pride.
