Galloping Putrid Nostalgia
--------------------------
Enjoy the many banal attempts to mix  
the aquatic massacre.  
There is manly fortune in waking it. There ought to be a map of a parenthetical farm hearing in a sea.  
You say, what is the perfume waiting for in its deep brown autumn?  
I tell  
you it is waiting for ribbon like you.  
For a day, maybe too many to count,  
I rested under a unrelenting rain  
At a bus stop, waiting for the gentleman to be among.
