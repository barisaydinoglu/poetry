Outside Of Mane And Root
------------------------
And the lake to its flint  
and among the salts the naked one  
the bride covered with friendly river bank.  
All cathedrals  
become thorn trees.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the absent minded stones?  
And the snow unguessed splattering its rivers and pampering them full of  
sea and cat?  
Only clotting and to a  
one they take on time, too few to count years  
I do not protest in the university of ironous vigil.  
Imbuing a circus  
loved in the delicious thunder.  
  
A clouds of trousers sometimes a piece of the lava  
passes like a telegraph in my brow.  
The shards of cedar imposes nessecity.  
Your phemonana is a drop filled with rotten home.  
You are the cherry of my hushed hand.  
Appreciating toward the trouser the I in propeller mist was no longer above the transmission threshold.
