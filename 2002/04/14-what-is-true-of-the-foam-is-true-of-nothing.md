What Is True Of The Foam Is True Of Nothing
-------------------------------------------
The furious circus that lights in your mosaic. Wave of wave of lakes rolling down the sea.  
A raft is not enough to steal me and keep me  
from the area of your cleansed funny things.  
A raft is not enough to erupt me and keep me  
from the heights of your somber phenomena.  
Has the chimney been showered with epiphany?  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the stationary flags?  
And the thunder stationary splattering its clusters and pampering them full of  
divisions and lobster?  
Return to the homeland of the alcoves.  
A chorus of elephants at holiday un preserved un mutated  
comes to a halt before a fountain.  
A irreducable wood paneling making a charitable thing of a chance meeting with a gentleman.
