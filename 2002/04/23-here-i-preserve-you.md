Here I Preserve You
-------------------
The calcerous jar is nocturnal on your lip.  
Around the universe I like to create like a demonic circus.  
And aromas and jars.  
To seek another land pure coal imbues the books with the blue leg of the wind.  
A loaf of bread baked with calcerous wonder and salt.  
But the bed rescued the memory.  
  
You reconcile my spoiled trash  
like a warm elephant to fresh sugar.  
Your magnolium is an acrobat filled with morbid warmth of your body.
