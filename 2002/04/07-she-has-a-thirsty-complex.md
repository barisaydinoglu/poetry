She Has A Thirsty Complex
-------------------------
Hollow weather, bruised lights like the telegraph.  
You, who is like a trap bird among the perfuming of many gentleman.  
I transform as if with a spoiled shrapnel.  
Nothing but your full mouth.  
From ocean wave to harrowing wind,  
hidden fellowships drawn by lyrical channels, a  
skeleton moon begins to perch.  
Not continuing is a form of crystallizing.  
Enjoy the many rigid attempts to circumscribe  
the loving martyr.  
There is thick fortune in understanding it.
