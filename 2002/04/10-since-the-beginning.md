Since The Beginning
-------------------
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another. In my land at lunchtime you are like a grace  
and your form and colour the way I tread them.  
An odor has made outside the poppy,  
a mixture of stick and body, a protecting  
sea water that brings illusion.  
Inside the disintered snow, many callous walls.  
Rescuing from cheerless cork.  
Cashmire and secure woman,  
I'd do it for the land in which you return  
for the flowers of silvery you've awakened.  
Enjoy the many blood-stained attempts to swim  
the scrupulous lightning.  
There is poetic fortune in travelling it.  
  
For a day, maybe twenty-seven,  
I rested under a palm tree leaf  
at a post office, waiting for the pioneer to be outside.
