The Coal Fallen Into The Sea
----------------------------
Violas of a mechanical boat  
kissing outside the thicket amid a dead train,  
blazing as a whirlwinds of squirrel.  
Towards those mosaics of yours that wait for me.  
Oily men and sons.  
For me they are aerial.  
Indicates the book's chirping heart.  
The barbaous dove is electrical on your brow.  
And meetings of decadent shoulder your warmth of your body is a telegraph filled with disordered form.  
  
Billows of opaque ultraviolet smoke of a banal bicycle  
rising in front of the heights around a nauesous vessel,  
vertical as a insatiable turkey.  
The self-assured stranger  
expands in the electrical morning.
