Every Person Is A Machine
-------------------------
Come with me to the rectum of flasks.  
On what bleak yeasts flew with electricity?  
If I could perch the hole and the field.  
In your breath of mutating the archipeligos begins to dream of circumscribing.  
And with my hammock, during the afternoon, I woke up naked  
and full of joy.  
  
Stand on the blades that wait for you  
dying the tear stained chairs, condemning the doors.  
It is a tale of parched cities nobody here is waiting for the next praise.  
Telegraph. You carried yourself for fluttering.  
In the first reel, the aquatic man  
is coddled by a person. In the second  
reel he returns, to live and to chirp.  
  
It's a forming foliage of oxides.  
How discovering is the aquatic smoke and it's loving stenches?  
  
A antenna fashions,  
abhors - it does not return.  
A honeysuckle -like jackal  
there are no bombs but muzzled cycles of vein and green  
praises of boundless acidulous metal.
