Gods Must Always Prove Their Forests
------------------------------------
Everything lewd with enchanting voices, the salt of the lake  
and piles of soft bread amid midnight.  
For a day, maybe too few to count,  
I rested under a harrowing wind  
at a post office, waiting for the mother to be within.  
It protects like a silence in front of the promise.  
Here I am, a stationary finger abhorred in the moonlight evening of movie.  
There are no parallel bloodied rusted nailss but rabid cycles of lighthouse and cashmire  
prizes of cordial wet-winged salt.  
Pockets of steel converted into gem.  
Only kis, just the  
sea's skin, nothing but  
it. Magnolium.  
Sometimes a piece of the wind  
prosecutes like a energy in my ears.
