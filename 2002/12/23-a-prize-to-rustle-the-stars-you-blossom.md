A Prize To Rustle The Stars You Blossom
---------------------------------------
The bird feathers exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
inside it in darkness.  
There are many  
violences within inaccessible events.  
Rusted giants and children.  
For me they are grammatic.  
Multitude of currents!  
In and out of the sand-colored the sepia and the crimson  
Where wreaths meet  
movies meet, outside and outside and the sound  
of bloods, to reach out and begin in anger.  
Conversations of silences, the recitation  
of cactuss we call monastic coral.  
Steady, copper ritual!
