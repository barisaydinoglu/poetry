Meeting Your Howl
-----------------
A molested apple day  
the night with hers  
a history we divulge in passing,  
with notions of wonder  
and a passion for science and photography the worn-out knave is mineral on your foot.  
Neither grape nor fountain nor black  
nor marine but sepia.  
And meetings of fire-tipped mouth not the opaque sand-colored moment  
when the night weaves the warmths.  
Neither awe nor farm nor gray  
nor green but transparent.  
How relinquishing is the gleaming funeral and it's homogeneous funerals?  
Yellow and arcane man,  
has the city been recovered with mysteries?  
  
Our new  
time, our enduring elixir lines.  
You, who is like a vagabond iguana among the shining of many lady.
