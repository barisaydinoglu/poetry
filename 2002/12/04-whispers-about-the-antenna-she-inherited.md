Whispers About The Antenna She Inherited
----------------------------------------
You are the lemon of my windy breath. If you were not the apple the fleeting moon  
cooks, sprinkling its lemon across the region.  
From her  
curves and her breath kiss  
poppies of the earth.  
It perfumes like a flesh with the railroad track.
