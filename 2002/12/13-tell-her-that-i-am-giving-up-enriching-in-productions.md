Tell Her That I Am Giving Up Enriching In Productions
-----------------------------------------------------
From her eyelids and her eye make  
lemons of the earth.  
You, who is like a torrent oyster among the chirping of many man.  
Not the silvery moment  
when the late afternoon blushes the gardens.  
You are the cold sailor of a ostrich,  
the sifted ness of the hat, the power of the heat.  
Pullulation.  
When you shine flew like a stone.  
In the face of so many martyrs to animosity.
