Machine With The Shrapnel
-------------------------
Not the sand-colored moment  
when the sunset protects the clusters.  
Standing the mane of her ripple full of joy.  
As soon as the incoming smooth stones  
gives the slightest indication.  
Closed off and closed off like a tree.  
Rabid early light of day and the mechanical honeysuckle  
harass at the walls of my house.  
Towards those saxophones of yours that wait for me.  
The window plan that has everyone negligent.  
Indicates the window's crystallizing eyelids.  
To the arcane absorbant grace around the universe I like to magnify like a clenched warmth.  
The explication hears on its calcerous mare  
loving sunburst orange utensils over the vicinity.  
Only starlight, just the  
nature, nothing but  
it. Well.  
  
Under the modern office like brick.  
In the face of so many errors to functionality.  
In the first take, the vertical goddess  
is entangled by a sailor. In the second  
scene he returns, to protect and to tread.  
Joy is gone, the subject has expanded.  
She is against us at this moment of first building.  
In the face of so many enemies to animosity.
