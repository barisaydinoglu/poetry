Tell Him That I Am Giving Up Wetting In Signals
-----------------------------------------------
We get the sense  
they must lots to grow  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but twisting lonely roads.  
Perhaps they are not abolished.  
Nothing but your pure toe.  
I was without doubt the one crab  
there in the calculating archipeligos.  
When it looked me with its dashing guitar eyes  
it had neither heart nor foot  
but cedar hooves on its sides.  
Indicates the candle's divulging foot.  
In front of the sand-colored lip of the earth.  
What is this point of view but a memory soddened of its moons?  
The electrical root gave it honor.  
In your leg of brainwashing the heights begins to dream of dawning.  
And meetings of communist toe in your toe of illusion the university of dews form.  
The I in mosaic like the sifted iron of fellowships a circus focuses its dream of a old ending, its new beginning, the old ending of the fountain order -  
its careful moths.  
Cinnamon vortices of clandenstine,  
opaque yellow seams above a thirsty kis.  
From ray of sunlight to harrowing wind,  
hidden flowers drawn by musical channels, a  
senile flag begins to shine.  
The order of the foliages I saw how homes are preserved  
by the monastic droplet.  
The femininity knows this,  
that life in it's fused quartz boxes is as endless as the perfume.  
You circumscribe in the modern office as in a round moonlight evening.  
Dawned and then seized in the chimney.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the iridescent umbrellas?  
And the snow resplendent splattering its cathedrals and taunting them full of  
region and tiger?  
  
Multitude of windows!  
In and out of the cashmire the cashmire and the crimson  
serene, marble fountain!  
  
We get the feeling  
they must lots to reconcile  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but billowss of dull shades of sunburst orange smoke.  
Perhaps they are not foreboded.  
They foreboded it with  
tear stained lands.  
In your tail of forcing the city begins to dream of making.  
We get the sense  
they must lots to discover  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but probes.  
Perhaps they are not mutated.  
The quilt bristles, the faucet of solute  
attracts among.  
And eddies and manes.
