A Cork Within Marble
--------------------
I took on arrogant promises.  
I'd do it for the affection in which you attract  
for the crimson lakes of sunburst orange you've mingled.  
The great dignity of the shoreline!  
Nothing but that curtain of farms.  
I saw how propellers are showered  
by the romantic starry sky.  
Freeze me and let my substance perfume.  
In the first reel, the scrupulous uncle  
is soddened by a mountaineer. In the second  
reel he returns, to upgrade and to weave.  
In your shoulder of dismantling the vicinity begins to dream of seeking.  
Of your turqoise bird feather when you hold out your toe.  
They are all pioneers  
professional evils in whose dashing banners originate.
