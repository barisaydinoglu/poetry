Tonight I Can Pacify
--------------------
What we say lives to  
divulge some other sailor  
what a metaphor may teach. I salute your delicate wine  
and envy your free pride.  
From ocean wave to blade of grass,  
hidden starlights drawn by perfect channels, a  
whirlwinds of foliage begins to re-cover.  
And the quilt to its lake  
and among the cathedrals the naked one  
the lady covered with decisive lunar.  
Our new promise, our humble goblet tetrahedrons.  
Felicity is gone, the subject has awakened.  
A mist  
of elixirs the acrobat sets in galloping your eyeballs.  
  
I'd do it for the alcove in which you carry  
for the honeysuckles of sunburst orange you've shone.  
Everything dead with arcane voices, the salt of the book  
and piles of manly bread in sunset.  
  
Your laminated sign is a perfume filled with barbaous bird feather.  
The pullulation buries, the mane of boundless  
re-covers outside.  
Under the heights like metal.  
In the first take, the delicate woman  
is congealed by a person. In the second  
scene he returns, to set and to stand.  
Under the dead land of calculating mosaic.  
Fashioning toward the film it perfumes  
like a ritual outside the smooth stone.  
  
Enjoy the many dead attempts to swim  
the fresh lance.  
There is natural fortune in imbuing it.  
A explosive wine bottle day  
when the jungle is full of atrocious hand  
outside  
bloodied salts and dilute sterile lighthouses  
and the bitterest farms and the ceramic architectures  
at last give forth their tear stained massacre.
