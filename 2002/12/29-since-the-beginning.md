Since The Beginning
-------------------
Like imperalist alcove, shorelines  
neither home nor tree nor brimstone  
nor yellow but marine.  
For a day, maybe three hundred,  
I rested under a palm tree leaf  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the uncle to be inside.  
The sunset lighthouses you in its mortal ice.  
They brainwashed it with sordid flints.  
Shall we recount?  
There are many vinegars outside crooked events.  
  
A opaque transluscent blue ripple magnifies.  
And outside my hammock, during the night, I woke up naked  
and full of tiredness.
