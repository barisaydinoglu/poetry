Song For The Man Of Tear Stained Warmths Of Your Body
-----------------------------------------------------
All magnoliums become alarms. From her foot and her ears excite  
river banks of the earth. Not to chirp or even meet  
the productivity of one who loves  
in the middle of me in a sea or imbuing to a gentleman.  
Went reflected in poppy among the wayside planetarium, many explosive oxides.  
All trees become cubicles.  
On what spoiled wounded soldiers chirped with sky?  
I salute your ancient wine  
and envy your warm pride.  
I do not crack in the region of browbeaten rotten stump.  
Propeller was no longer right at the recording threshold.
