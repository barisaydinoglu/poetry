Since The Beginning Of Hating
-----------------------------
The natural splendor gave it tiredness.  
Fewer and fewer  
undulate about another mode of pride.  
Enjoy the many putrid attempts to travel  
the dashing shrapnel.  
There is monastic fortune in dedicating it.  
What human cactuss -  
the boulevard is filled with it,  
sea shells for the snow and the delirious saphire.  
Charitable empire. The line functions to seize a environment  
to its environment. To the careful color of the cedar trouser.  
And farms and awes.  
The cold fire imposes nessecity.  
Only river bank, just the  
stone, nothing but  
it. Grace.
