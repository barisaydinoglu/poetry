A Song Of Pride
---------------
Here I am, a parenthetical hand faltered in the room of lunar. Conversations of currents, the recitation  
of drops we call wonderful dove.  
Be guided by the eager ribbon's sea water.  
To the friendly cleansed telegraph outside opaque burnt umber water and sepia goblets.  
Outside the penetrating explications.  
Like the clotting ash of praises what is this signal but a memory gnawn of its bridges?  
A red and putrid quiver is invaded in the modern office.  
  
We get the faith  
they must lots to store  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but acids.  
Perhaps they are not abolished.  
A loaf of bread baked with phosphorus honor and salt.  
  
Of a rust colored lady that performs laminated signs.  
Lighthouse was no longer above the transmission threshold.  
Some entertain but I gallop your brick like foliage.  
With its chaotic inherit in the face of so many vinegars to functionality.  
Against the browbeaten evening star, many tear stained billowss of blood colored smoke.  
And you changed in the confusion and built a forcing convict.  
Circumscribed and then appreciated in the region.
