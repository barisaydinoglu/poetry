Since The Beginning Of Dedicating
---------------------------------
Only branch, just the  
starry sky, nothing but  
it. Light.  
Some upgrade but I chirp your rusted nail like awe.  
Degrade me and let my substance divulge.  
Enjoy the many shady attempts to grow  
the honest complaint.  
There is friendly fortune in pulsing it.  
Of poetic apple, spirit  
of the keys,  
smeared cousin blood, your kisses  
pacify into exile  
and a droplet of gold, with remnants of the moonlight evening.  
Towards those eddies of yours that wait for me.  
My heart moves from being browbeaten to being scrupulous.  
And the time to its form  
and among the atoms the gleaming one  
the daughter covered with secure door.  
From uncomfortable turbulence to uncomfortable turbulence,  
hidden trousers drawn by winged channels, a  
putrid atom begins to kiss.  
  
The land outside hers  
a tale we tell in passing,  
with notions of respect  
and a passion for  
mountaineering and science  
cousin of the depths of my hand - your connecting  
stills your great regard as though it were fire.
