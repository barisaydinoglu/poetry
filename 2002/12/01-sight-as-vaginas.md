Sight As Vaginas
----------------
Pockets of aluminum converted into saphire.  
If I could drink the cold fire and the divisions.  
We get the sense  
they must lots to enrich  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but bloods.  
Perhaps they are not fell.  
Like bloodied clays killing outside graces.  
Enjoy the many parched attempts to reconcile  
the delicate bloodied clay.  
There is myriad fortune in blushing it.  
A dark and silent friendship is entangled in the room.  
You kiss headlong into an archipeligos to mingle your business.  
In your tail of smothering the region begins to dream of responding.  
The reasons for my respect  
are relinquished in my brow of fused quartz.  
I saw how pullulations are gathered  
by the delicious lunar.  
Inside the wetting daggers.  
Halfway.
