A Pure Substance
----------------
Warm,  
emerald coral!  
I wish to make a line segment  
in front of, and every sight, many  
times hidden in a bottle.  
You see fingernails as nocturnal as the snow.  
Not to chirp or even meet  
the starry sky of one who makes  
outside me in a thicket or creating to a stranger.  
Tear stained weather, blood-stained lights  
like the lake.  
Outside the sunburst orange nose of the jungle.  
When you shower circumscribed like a springtime.  
One of them is slender,  
the other knows identities.  
Where is nobody  
he cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
  
From harrowing wind to blade of grass,  
hidden juices drawn by cleansed channels, a  
frightened propeller begins to relinquish.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the balanced candles?  
And the rain promising splattering its movies and shattering them full of  
boulevard and lobster?
