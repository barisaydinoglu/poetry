Sons Must Always Prove Their Cactuss
------------------------------------
Around the region I like to awaken like a neurotic autumn.  
A naked thunder of femininities.  
And a tenacious serenity's lava will conduct you.  
But I should be untrue to mountaineering, striking among its hairy pencils  
so let us begin to tell a story devoid  
of neutral redundancies.  
When the universe is full of dilute eye  
outside conglomerates and cold weak threads  
and the neurotic tigers and the homes  
at last give forth their decadent abberation.  
Joy is gone, the subject has seized.  
Understanding the stars in the sky of her perfume full of purity.  
Of a dull shades  
of transparent goddess that expands cactuss.  
  
I salute your comfortable lemon  
and envy your charitable pride.  
I wish to make a circle  
behind, and every sense, many  
times hidden in an affection.  
Where flints meet  
pencils meet, around and amid and the sound  
of whispers, to reach  
out and shine in fear.  
Of your red friendship when you hold out your lip.  
The neon garden that makes in your echo.  
A starry sky flowing will conduct  
the arrogant water of a planet.  
Resolute, wooden garden!  
I'm the sailor to the mist of immediate garden.  
Sunburst orange and fresh man,  
Among the fragrance of strawberry of the area where you sleep,  
a dream condemns into machines.  
Refreshing from forceful bolt of glass.
