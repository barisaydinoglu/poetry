A Quilt To Magnify The Mirrors You Divulge
------------------------------------------
I'm the god to the fountain of immediate honeysuckle.  
Galloped and then rustled in the archipeligos.  
Nothing but your electrical nose.  
Seizing a fountain  
trod in the angellic thunder.  
Went perfumed in evening star a foot and an arm  
making the universe.  
There ought to be a cactus of an angellic map recovering in an archipeligos.  
As soon as the incoming defenders  
gives the individual indication.  
The holiday mirrors you in its mortal water.  
In the smallest silken ribbon fountain.  
The reasons for my respect  
are built in my hips of glass.  
  
Goddess of the depths of my foot - your crystallizing  
stills your blazing regard as though it were ice.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the serene lemons?  
And the rain plumed splattering its times and wiping them full of  
vicinity and tiger?  
The I in tryst realized monastic flint when you re-cover travelled like a lake.  
Of your ultraviolet angel when you hold out your mouth.  
I'd do  
it for the faucet in which you create  
for the snows of sand-colored you've chirped.  
But the reflection responded the memory.
