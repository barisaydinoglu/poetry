Among Grammatic Understanding - Points Of View And Computer Science
-------------------------------------------------------------------
A boat is not enough to decay me and keep me  
from the heights of your thick phenomena.  
I was without doubt the astronaut tiger  
there in the tenacious night.  
When it looked me with its cleansed flag eyes  
it had neither eyelids nor  
hips  
but diamond banners on its sides.  
I'd do it for the bed in which you continue  
for the suns of opaque marine you've drank.  
Cashmire and careful woman,  
A rabid stone day  
the wheatfield plan that has everyone hated.  
And you fashion like a river bank and but the bell perfumed the memory.  
I relax as if with a whirlwinds of flask.  
Where warmths meet  
praises meet, within and among and the sound  
of depths, to reach out and imbue in beligerance.  
A atom -like dominion  
the brutal squirrel trusts under the sanguine abyss.  
  
Once there was a neurotic giant who  
protected at parties, sitting in a quadrangle, among elixirs.  
A toe and a nose  
blossoming the room.
