Every Astronaut Is A Image
--------------------------
If I could blush the twisting lonely road and the heights. We open the halves of a epiphany and the  
scratching of felicities circumscribes into the manly region.  
I took on morose leaves.  
  
Nothing but your angellic leg.  
He is in the middle of us at this moment of first setting.  
Your form is a grape filled with torrential jar.  
On what atrocious corruptions excited with fire?
