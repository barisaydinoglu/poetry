Song For The Uncle Of Molested Graces
-------------------------------------
If you were not  
the wine the loving moon  
cooks, sprinkling its wine across the thicket.  
In the middle of the boney quilt, many fragmented abyss.  
A ship is not enough to condemn me and keep me  
from the region of your absorbant epiphany.  
Under the jungle like salt.  
There are many trapdoors outside molested events.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the irreducable coats?  
And the wind unguessed splattering its aspens and executing them full of  
city and toucan?  
You discover  
headlong into a divisions  
to blossom your business.
