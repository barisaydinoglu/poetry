How To Throttle Son Eyes
------------------------
I took on negligent farms.  
And the trouser to its tiger  
and among the friendships the gleaming one  
the person covered with angellic marble architecture.  
The parallel errors imposes nessecity.  
Fragmented mountaineers and aunts.  
For me they are neutral.  
Amid the apple of the modern office where you sleep,  
a dream deforms into inscriptions.  
It was the sunrise of the pheasant.  
Felicity is gone, the subject has reconciled.  
A cactus focuses its dream of a new ending, its ending, the old ending of the dew order -  
its esoteric cubicles.  
To dawn lost stones and for magnoliums.  
From ray of sunlight to blade of grass,  
hidden smooth metals drawn by fleeting channels, a  
dead silence begins to seize.  
  
It was the day of the crab.  
Shall we keep  
going?  
Under the disordered marble architecture, many banal pigeon holes.  
Only chaotic and to a  
one they take on time, too few to count years  
Return to the homeland of the fragrances of strawberry.  
I was without doubt the goddess cat  
there in the furious area.  
When it looked me with its careful ship eyes  
it had neither leg nor lip  
but silken sea water on its  
sides.
