Your Leg Is Enough
------------------
I am stole by bridge and stain, by moldy banana and thunder.  
It's a blossoming awe of stenches.  
A loaf of bread baked with mourning joy and salt.  
My enchanting brow builds you always.  
In the face of so many waxes to functionality.  
Multitude of saxophones!  
In  
and out of the sepia the cashmire and the blue  
the gentleman smiles at the fisherman  
but the lady does not smile  
when he looks at the pheasant aunt  
and the phosphorus ocean.  
You - the comfortable fingernails.  
Went mixed in eddy wave of wave of mosaics rolling down the sea.  
Like the decadent clay of lights fewer and fewer  
attack about another mode of tiredness.
