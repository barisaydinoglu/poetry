I Expected Custodians
---------------------
Wheatfield was no longer right at the transmission threshold.  
What dismantles the props of love?  
Pockets of aluminum converted into cork.  
Which is a real grace of directions  
three hundred or three hundred, understood  
on an atom or in the pure eddy  
directions of the eyeballs, a calculation in your noses.  
The currents exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
among it in darkness.  
It was the twilight of the tiger.  
Draw from it the molested  
sequence of its own projection.  
I want you to promise on my hand.  
  
It was the late afternoon of the lobster.  
I salute your careful wine  
and envy your thick pride.  
The farm plan that has everyone hairy.  
An odor has galloped outside the propeller,  
a mixture of utensil and body, a flying  
wine bottle that brings beligerance.  
A square amid a square,  
the clotting workings of self-assured law.  
  
A sequence lights,  
electrifies - it does  
not return.  
To set lost energies and for necklaces.
