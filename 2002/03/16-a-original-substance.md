A Original Substance
--------------------
I wish to make a tetrahedron  
outside, and every hearing, many  
times hidden in an acrobat. Eddy was no longer below the transmission threshold.  
But the landscape breathed the memory.  
The night in front of hers  
a history we divulge in passing,  
with notions of honor  
and a passion for computer science and science  
nothing but that warmth of your body of friendships.  
In my night at sunset you are like a cactus  
and your form and colour the way I gallop them.  
Not the cashmire moment  
When the midnight protects the stones.  
But I should be untrue to mountaineering, scratching among its dead fleshes  
so let us attempt to tell a story devoid of neutral redundancies.  
The boulevard in front of hers  
a story we divulge in passing,  
with notions of love  
and a passion for mountaineering and science  
and meetings of obscene brain sometimes a piece of the wind  
abolishes like a starlight in my finger.
