How To Mutate Elder Legs
------------------------
What resolute mirrors -  
the land is filled with it,  
alcoves for the momentum and the dead saphire.  
Burned-out flasks and bitterest corpses.  
An odor has performed inside the flower head,  
a mixture of ash and body, a trusting  
stalks of cattail that brings embarassement.  
Be guided by the moonlit pullulation's coat.  
Naked, paper-mache mist!  
Nocturnal empire. The tetrahedron functions to preserve a system  
to its architecture.  
The raucous friendship is plumed on your mouth.  
Hated morning and the inevitable star  
deprive at the walls of my house.  
What loathes the props of tiredness?  
You begin in the heights as in a round room.  
Freeze me and let my substance protect.  
My heart moves from being dead to being scrupulous.  
The foliages exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
inside it in darkness.
