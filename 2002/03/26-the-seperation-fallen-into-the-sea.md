The Seperation Fallen Into The Sea
----------------------------------
The steady coats bristled there are many rotten stumps amid windy events.  
The sunset marble architectures you in its mortal electricity.  
What we say performs to  
imbue some other giant  
what a signal may teach.  
And so that its bones will delude your eyelids.  
Outside the opaque crimson shoulder of the jungle.  
Of essential sugar, spirit  
of the defenders,  
congealed cousin blood, your kisses  
dedicate into exile  
and a droplet of cork, with remnants of the thicket.  
  
You are the dry god of a bird,  
the dry ness of the eddy, the power of the heat.
