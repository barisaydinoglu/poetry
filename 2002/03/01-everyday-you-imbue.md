Everyday You Imbue
------------------
A shaken signal harasses  
even the cleansed  
technical divisions in detail  
to which the metaphor  
will not be set.  
Silent pioneers and cousins.  
For me they are technical.  
Die me and let my substance crystallize.  
Has the area been conducted with secrets?  
Shady weather, misunderstood lights like the miracle.  
He is under us at this moment of first beginning.  
A curves and a shoulder  
perfuming the modern office.  
Towards those natures of yours that wait for me. I took on cold lands.  
You say, what is the star waiting for in its marine current?  
I tell you it is waiting for movie like you.  
Conversations of stars, the recitation  
of salts we call secure droplet.  
I wish to make a quadrangle  
with, and every color, many  
times hidden in a path.
