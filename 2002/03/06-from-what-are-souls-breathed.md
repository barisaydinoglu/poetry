From What Are Souls Breathed
----------------------------
Here I am, a pure mouth overflowed in the moonlight evening of maternity. You've asked me what the turkey is breathing there with his marine finger?  
I reply, the key knows this.  
And a guilt farm's sky will conduct you.  
  
Not the sunburst orange moment  
when the fortnight awakens the drops.  
A loaf of bread baked with clenched purity  
and salt.
