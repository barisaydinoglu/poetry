A Poppy To Develop The Moons You Shine
--------------------------------------
Realized romantic dew a burnt umber flint swims.  
Crimson thorn trees of cubicle,  
deep brown seams above a hairy river.  
A changeless carpet making a nocturnal thing of a impossible meeting with a lady.  
Shall we go forward?  
This crooked moon and shining smooth stone shatters me  
with it's monastic phemonanas like lip and breath  
and dark love like brow and  
bells.  
Only inaccessible and to a  
father they take on time, too few to count years  
my dashing shoulder responds you always.  
Pockets of brick converted into crystal.  
The man smiles at the aunt  
but the mountaineer does not smile  
when he looks at the pheasant person  
and the sordid ocean.  
In your nose of protesting the universe begins to dream of wetting.  
The bleak faucet that treads in your sphere.
