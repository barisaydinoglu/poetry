Everyday You Flutter
--------------------
Has the city been seized with secrets?  
Whirlwinds of uranus and burned-out martyrs.  
Fewer and fewer  
crush about another mode of purity.  
What is this detail but a memory punctured of its sea water?  
The elixir plan that has everyone difficult.  
Our new drop, our dashing tree circles.  
You crystallize my explosive cold fire  
like a steady oyster to fresh apple.
