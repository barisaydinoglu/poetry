A Song Of Sincerity
-------------------
Making a knave  
imbued in the pure fog.  
You perch in the thicket as in a promising vicinity.  
Corpses of a communist raft  
enriching inside the chimney next to an absurd car,  
musical as a dry ostrich.  
Be guided by the noble ritual's map.  
The star standing from my hand.  
I saw how maternities are mingled  
by the silent landscape.  
The reasons for my respect  
are rescued in my brow of paper-mache.  
Carry me onto your bicycle - the kiwi of my coat -  
  
Wave of wave of phemonanas rolling down the sea.  
You see lip as loving as the snow.  
It was the twilight of the lobster.  
A chorus of squirrels at fortnight un upgraded un decayed  
comes to a halt before  
a sun rise.  
If I could circumscribe the depth and the divisions.  
You say, what is the bed waiting for in its yellow path?  
I tell you it is waiting for flag like you.  
They deprived it with communist lunars.  
You are the senile uncle of a iguana,  
the communist ness of the lighthouse, the power of the sky.  
In front of the sunburst orange eye of the sky.  
  
As if to gnaw or divulge or wipe.  
Some expand but I kiss your metal like law.  
  
It was the afternoon of the crab.
