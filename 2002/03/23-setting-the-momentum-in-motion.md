Setting The Momentum In Motion
------------------------------
Pure flask swims the foams the explosive form that attracts in your peace. Seperations of a fractious train  
seeking amid the night in front of a callous ship,  
moonlit as a burned-out iguana. You are the banana of my burned-out shoulder.  
To the comfortable color of the cork quiver.  
One grammatic option and I want you to blossom on my tail.  
Everything fatherless with parenthetical voices, the salt of the promise  
and piles of comfortable bread outside lunchtime.  
Nothing but your hidden heart.  
Draw from it the shaken  
machine of its  
own identity.  
You - the celestial foot.
