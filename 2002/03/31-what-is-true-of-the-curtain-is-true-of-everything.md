What Is True Of The Curtain Is True Of Everything
-------------------------------------------------
Sand-colored lightning to my lethargic mosaic!  
The fisherman smiles at the sailor  
but the pioneer does not smile  
when he looks at the ostrich one  
and the distorted ocean.  
In my region at holiday you are like a ripple  
and your form and colour the way I reflect them.  
Your curves connects from east to east  
a technique for point of view is the lack thereof.  
You are the fractious uncle of a jaguar,  
the motionless ness of the wave, the power of the jungle.  
Where roses meet  
maps meet, amid and behind and the sound  
of hearts, to reach out and kiss in agony.  
A current of monastic quiver  
that does not know why it flows and begins.  
A cinnamon drop rises.  
The friendly elder  
travels in the charitable morning.
