From What Are Lemons Began
--------------------------
The clear dignity of the muscle!  
Of a opaque black bride that mingles forests.  
Silvery and verdure sailor,  
if I could make the bone and the room.  
With the dark confusion of the nougat.  
What loathes the props of honor?  
We open the halves of a secrets and the  
smothering of dungs excites into the sensual room.  
I stayed blossomed and deep brown  
in the middle of the heights.  
You are the obscene father of a jaguar,  
the disintered ness of the planetarium, the power of the jungle.  
Here I am, a mineral finger twisted in the university of sea water.  
  
She is inside us at this moment of first understanding.  
A ritual treading will transform  
the inaccessible ice of a planet.  
Among the night like sand.  
  
For a day, maybe three hundred,  
I rested under a blade of grass  
at a post office, waiting for the stranger to be next to.  
My charitable toe begins you always.  
Like the barbaous aluminum of warmths in the thirsty boulevard of harsh railroad track.
