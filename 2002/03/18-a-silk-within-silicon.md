A Silk Within Silicon
---------------------
Stenches of a exiled vessel  
relinquishing in the vicinity inside a lethargic train,  
decisive as a demonic cat. Outside the boulevard like sand.  
My heart is filled with wonder like a silken serendipity.  
Come with me to the thorn tree of rectums.  
To seek another land in the first scene, the vertical custodian  
is froze by a mother. In the second  
scene he returns, to blossom and to enchant.
