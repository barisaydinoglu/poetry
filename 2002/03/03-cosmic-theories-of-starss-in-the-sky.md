Cosmic Theories Of Starss In The Sky
------------------------------------
Not to begin or even meet  
the autumn of one who develops  
Under me in an archipeligos or seizing to a person.  
What fresh wreaths -  
the jungle is filled with it,  
shadess of sunburst orange for the ribbon and the calculating cork.  
Pure nail blossoms the shorelines of a opaque dull shades of burnt umber god that gallops reflections.  
Shall we proceed?  
For a day, maybe million,  
I rested under a palm tree leaf  
at a post office, waiting for the goddess to be around.  
Under the wet-winged goblet, many negligent dungs.  
As if to mourn or attract or wipe.  
Irreducable empire. The tetrahedron functions to love a system  
to its environment.  
In the divisions like clay.  
My heart is filled with sincerity like a cork juice.
