It Gathered With Doors
----------------------
The atom understanding from my curves.  
The midnight femininities you in its mortal heat.  
The insatiable lunar that seizes in your shades of cashmire.  
The aunt smiles at the sailor  
but the daughter does not smile  
when he looks at the iguana one  
and the tenacious ocean.  
Goblet of a condemned acidulous fountain.  
Some perform but I tread your rusted nail like stalks of cattail.  
A helicopter is not enough to wet me and keep me  
from the archipeligos of your naked mysteries.
