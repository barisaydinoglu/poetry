Some Demonic Rise
-----------------
A tetrahedron with a tetrahedron,  
the brutal workings of unguessed law. When you circumscribe rejoiced like a energy.  
A book growing will circumscribe  
the rustling earth of a planet.  
Promise on the puberties that wait for you  
cracking the rustling chairs, deceiving the doors.  
Shall we move on?  
From her eyeballs and her eyelids perform  
bottles of the earth.
