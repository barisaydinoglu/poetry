Faith As Complaints
-------------------
The salt drinking from my breath.  
Be guided by the cordial miracle's miracle.  
And you bristled in the embarassement and dawned a silencing trash barge.  
Went flowed in warmth of your body like shadows drowning with banners.  
Outside opaque sepia water and cinnamon magnoliums.  
In front of the crimson foot of the ice.  
From her eyelids and her nose carry  
jars of the earth.  
The lady smiles at the uncle  
but the custodian does not smile  
when he looks at the squirrel astronaut  
and the neon ocean.  
I'd do it for the splendor in which you chirp  
for the souls of green you've lighted.  
Only disintered and to a  
one they take on time, too many to count years  
I could reconcile oxide, abys, and billows of black smoke  
from windows and aromas  
with a red grace  
with self-productions in my nose.  
  
Everything hollow with somber voices, the salt of the laminated sign  
and piles of incredulous bread inside late afternoon.  
You've asked me what the toucan is pulsing there with his sand-colored lip?  
I reply, the apple knows this.  
In my archipeligos at day you are like a wave  
and your form and colour the way I chirp them.  
There are many granules with crooked events.  
Faint me and let my substance perform.  
Your nature is a tryst filled with lethargic warmth of your body.  
Multitude of souls!  
In and out of the green the deep brown and  
the blue
