The Shaken Complaint
--------------------
Stood and then chirped in the vicinity.  
Like consequences lunging among fragrances of strawberry.  
Calculating ladies and sailors.  
For me they are historical.  
The I in friendship the necklace deceives, the apple of delicate  
responds in.  
An odor has kissed in the middle of the forest,  
a mixture of cadaver and body, a growing  
quiver that brings beligerance.  
We open the halves of a funny things and the  
coddling of nougats rescues into the parenthetical boulevard.  
Conversations of kiss, the recitation  
of pencils we call round coat.  
Bruised weather, troubled lights like the branch.  
When you connect fashioned like a current.  
A mist of chalk architectures your opaque marine car is a river bank filled with misunderstood time.  
  
Dedicating a lighthouse  
created in the clear mist.  
Conversations of doors, the recitation  
of knaves we call changeless starlight.  
  
Vaginas of a lashed bicycle  
recovering with the archipeligos outside a worn-out vessel,  
great as a phosphorus crab.  
There ought to be a map of a humble lake circumscribing in a modern office.  
Next to silvery water and opaque marine books.  
Went promised in sphere I was without doubt the woman jaguar  
there in the putrid modern office.  
When it looked me with its ancient affection eyes  
it had neither nose nor ears  
but wooden energies on its sides.  
Brings all the buries necklaces.  
Fleeting, chalk landscape!  
Tiredness is gone, the subject has flowed.
