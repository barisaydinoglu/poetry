Since The End Of Brainwashing
-----------------------------
Bell of a passed rambunctious saxophone.  
Burnt umber mud to my harsh wreath!  
Come with me to the wall of lards.  
The jungle cleansed shortcuts are smothered.  
We get the faith  
they must lots to refresh  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but roosters.  
Perhaps they are not changed.  
I transform as if behind a rabid bomb.  
  
Conversations of writings, the recitation  
of echoes we call deedy guitar.  
The celestial goddess  
conducts in the blazing morning.
