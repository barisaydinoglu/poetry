Abstraction Is An Episode Of Ash
--------------------------------
A acidulous time day  
the ice equinoctial vortices are condemned.  
And so that its legless horses will overflow your mouth.  
The honest goblet gave it decency.  
It was the night of the lobster.  
A perfect rug making a resolute thing of a unlikely meeting with a person.  
Hairy ones and fishermen.  
For me they are slightest.  
And so that its nights will fall your foot.  
Conversations of manes, the recitation  
of magnoliums we call parsimonious nature.  
  
It was the midnight of the crab.  
He is behind us at this moment of first divulging.  
The praise twists, the fragrance of strawberry of eloquent  
promises in.  
Everything clotting with absent minded voices, the salt of the branch  
and piles of moonlit bread among night.  
A sunshine of grapes they abolished it with cheerless pastures.  
Transluscent sunburst orange jungle to my communist land!  
  
A computer for study is the lack thereof.
