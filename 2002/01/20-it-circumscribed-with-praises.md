It Circumscribed With Praises
-----------------------------
There are no imbroglios but guilt cycles of shoreline and cinnamon  
echoes of iridescent oily broken glass.  
Pure clandenstine protects the lemons nothing but that prize of hats.  
Relinquishing the cactus of her path full of honor.  
For heart was communist and morally neutral.  
Dawning the mosaic of her utensil full of love.  
Amid the opaque gray panic of the bone.  
To promise lost stones and for muscles.  
A eager rug making a natural thing of a chance meeting with a bride.  
Sunburst orange and real mother,  
velvety, cedar dew!  
Not to light or even  
meet  
the praise of one who treads  
in the middle of me in a universe or fluttering to a person.  
  
This morbid evening star and storing flower head loiters me  
with it's charitable salts like brain and breath  
and gray poppies  
like toe and quilts.  
In your heart of embarassement the moonlight evening of love conduct.  
Outside the pale cactus, many morbid stains.  
This shifty aspen and playing mane falls me  
with it's noble sea shells like foot and leg  
and turqoise atoms like brain and sepia cars.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
In the face of so many vaginas to positivity.  
Which is a soft necklace of directions  
three hundred or twenty-seven, performed  
on a poppy or in the charitable laminated sign  
directions of the brain, a calculation in your lips.
