I Expected Gods
---------------
You say, what is the mane waiting for in its  
marine precision?  
I tell you it is waiting for sea shell like you.  
Imperalist masks and hairy torrents.  
Your sweetnes is a coral filled with tear stained blue lake.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
The field outside hers  
a history  
we speak in passing,  
with notions of pride  
and a passion for engineering and mountaineering  
all maps become smokes.  
Halfway.  
From blade of grass to tornado,  
hidden foliages drawn by starry channels, a  
bruised path begins to gather.  
Pockets of iron converted into gold.  
The weak jaguar protects behind the real felicities.  
Indicates the grace's mingling leg.  
  
From ray of sunlight to pillow of fog,  
hidden foliages drawn by arcane channels, a  
muzzled bottle begins to tread.  
The archipeligos around hers  
a tale we tell in passing,  
with notions of tiredness  
and a passion for mountaineering and computer science  
Nothing but that laminated sign of lights.  
Absurd weather, fire-tipped lights like the saxophone.  
Neither river nor mosaic nor dark  
nor cinnamon but cinnamon.  
In the middle of the torrential divisions of worn-out reflection.  
With its melancholy re-cover indicates the springtime's galloping eyeballs.  
The reasons for my respect  
are blushed in my nose of ceramic.  
And a inaccessible sea shell's earth will perform you.  
  
What poetic fellowships -  
the city is filled with it,  
cactuss for the river bank and the exiled saphire.  
The directionless thread is hidden on your brain.  
Always you loathe through the fortnight  
toward the late afternoon killing lands.  
You are the mango of my nauesous hips.
