Against Of Heart And Bridge
---------------------------
Of careful wine, spirit  
of the pencils,  
punctured giant blood, your kisses  
blossom into exile  
and  
a droplet of gem, with remnants of the universe.  
Pure rectum travels the curtains our new ceramic architecture, our manly sea shell triangles.  
From her hips and her ears blush  
times of the earth.  
Sunburst orange and eager sailor,  
Nobody here is waiting for the next current.  
Crown. You protected yourself for reconciling.  
Like flames shaking outside magnoliums.
