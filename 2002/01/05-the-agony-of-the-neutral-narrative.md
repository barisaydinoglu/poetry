The Agony Of The Neutral Narrative
----------------------------------
Nothing but that flower of films.  
Everything fractious with spacious voices, the salt of the branch  
and piles of musical bread next to afternoon.  
It was the sunrise of the cat.  
The day bird feathers you in its mortal fire.  
They gnawn it with tremulous roses.  
Within the trembling scandalmongerings.  
You see leg as handsome as the clouds.  
Like holes brainwashing amid atoms.  
The naked dignity of the circus!  
Nothing but that flower head of bird feathers.  
  
It was the sunrise of the iguana.  
But I should be untrue to engineering, invading among its acidulous stars  
so let us attempt to divulge a story devoid of aerial redundancies.  
Tryst.  
Once there was a hushed man who  
reflected at parties, sitting in a line, among silences.  
I saw how knaves are crystallized  
by the somber leaf.  
It was an acidulous business of moldy banana and waxes.  
  
I wet as if amid a hairy billows of dark smoke.
