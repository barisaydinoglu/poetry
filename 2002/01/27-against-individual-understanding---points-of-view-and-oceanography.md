Against Individual Understanding - Points Of View And Oceanography
------------------------------------------------------------------
Be guided by the lovely quiver's productivity.  
God of the depths of my eyelids - your understanding  
stills your mineral regard as though it were earth.  
The I in praise towards those propellers of yours that wait for me.  
If you were not the sugar the careful moon  
cooks, sprinkling its cheesecake across the archipeligos.  
He is under us at this moment of first expanding.  
A sepia door stores.  
  
I am impaled by vein and depth, by evil and sun.  
The landscape knows this,  
that life in it's paper-mache boxes is as endless as the lunar.
