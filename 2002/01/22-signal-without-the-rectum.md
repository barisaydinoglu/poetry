Signal Without The Rectum
-------------------------
A springtime -like billow of ultraviolet smoke  
the modern office with hers  
a history we divulge in passing,  
with notions of pride  
and a passion for computer science and mountaineering. In the face of so many pigeon holes to functionality.  
You are the banana of my brutal brow.  
In the first reel, the ancient person  
is mourned by a elder. In the second  
reel he returns, to attract and to perfume.  
I'm the uncle to the marble architecture of immediate smooth ash.  
Our new laminated sign, our trusting quiver triangles.  
She is inside us at this moment of first loving.  
Realized warm thread for a day, maybe thousand,  
I rested under a tornado  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the god to be among.  
It is a tale of motionless pigeon holes from her nose and her curves begin  
kiss of the earth.  
Brutal wounded soldiers and hairy masks.  
The reasons for my respect  
are gathered in my toe of copper.  
  
Draw from it the boneless  
production of its own inscription.  
Towards those dews of yours that wait for me.
