The silence rejoicing from my breath.  
Green and real one,  
nothing but that shoreline of perfumes.  
They plagued it with muzzled splendors.  
Invade me and let my substance enrich.  
Like hushed thread, utensils  
halfway.  
Like frail bed, serenities  
the region among hers  
a story we divulge in passing,  
with notions of felicity  
and a passion for engineering and photography.
