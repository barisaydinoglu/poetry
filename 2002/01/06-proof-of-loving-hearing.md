Proof Of Loving Hearing
-----------------------
As if to coddle or flutter or smear.  
An odor has began in the river bank,  
a mixture of puberty and body, a relaxing  
splendor that brings confusion.  
And guitars and essences.  
In your heart of faltering the land begins to dream of loving.  
Outside the area like iron.  
There are many graves next to tear stained events.  
Made and then lighted in the vicinity.  
Come with me to the thorn tree of brambles.  
You've asked me what the bird is enchanting there with his silvery brow?  
I reply, the stars in the sky knows this.  
The warmths of your body exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
in front of it in  
darkness.  
Always you plague through the morning  
toward the day wetting defenders.  
Pockets of iron converted into glass.
