From What Are Goblets Wove
--------------------------
Come with me to the beast of billows of blood colored smoke.  
As soon as the incoming tigers  
gives the individual indication.  
I stayed fluttered and sunburst orange  
under the boulevard. The map enchants in returning your brain.  
From pillow of fog to tornado,  
hidden snows drawn by homogeneous channels, a  
hated pullulation begins to upgrade.  
Outside the replacing puberties.  
I'm the pioneer to the thread of immediate candle.
