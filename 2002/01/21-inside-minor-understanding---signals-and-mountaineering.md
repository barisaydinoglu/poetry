Inside Minor Understanding - Signals And Mountaineering
-------------------------------------------------------
There are no lightnings but burned-out cycles of prize and cashmire  
kiss of manly hollow aluminum. There ought  
to be a pencil of a poetic snow blossoming in a jungle.  
We get the color  
they must lots to tread  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but serections.  
Perhaps they are not filtered.  
  
Shall we recount?  
What passes the props of joy?  
Nothing but your unguessed hips.  
A eloquent mist of keys.  
The utensil knows this,  
that life in it's wooden boxes is as endless as the light.  
They are all gentlemen  
professional lineages in whose serene angels originate.  
One of them is  
lyrical,  
the other knows projections.  
Where is nobody  
she says, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?
