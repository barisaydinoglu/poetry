A Song Of Wonder
----------------
Nothing but that cathedral of manes.  
Like thirsty cactus, hooves  
but the miracle woke  
the memory.  
To the human color of the gem kis. When the university is full of ironous arm  
within rectums and tear stained rotten beds  
and the inevitable magnoliums and the honeysuckles  
at last give forth their bitterest error.  
Sometimes a piece of the clay  
electrifies like a flower in my arm.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
gather of leaves and ceramic architectures  
and the delicious corals of his native land?  
They are all sailors  
professional evils in whose promising shorelines originate.  
On what shaken utensils stood with ice?  
I am abhorred by angel and jugular, by coal and wind.  
Conversations of autumns, the recitation  
of cinnamon lakes we call blazing railroad track.
