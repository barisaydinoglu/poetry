I Expected Strangers
--------------------
Here I am, a delicious lip congealed in the archipeligos of dove.  
Writing of a cracked frightened energy.  
And meetings of putrid lip lewd cubicles and acidulous scandalmongerings.  
In my field at fortnight you are like a juice  
and your form and colour the way I relax them.  
You've asked me what the bird is perfuming there with his burnt umber eye?  
I reply, the stars in the sky knows this.  
In front of the dull shades of yellow embarassement of the bomb.  
Your hips recovers from north to east  
Grape was no longer below the transmission threshold.  
And the praise to its horse  
and among the manes the clear one  
the sailor covered with winged thread.  
Like calcerous tree, starss in the sky  
it is a tale of oily stalactites one of them is aromatic,  
the other knows techniques.  
Where is someone  
he exclaims, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
The propellers exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
outside it in darkness.  
They pampered it with fractious drops.
