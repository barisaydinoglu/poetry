Here I Understand You
---------------------
Shut out and shut out like a flag.  
They are all goddesses  
professional lightnings in whose absorbant acrobats originate.  
The early light of day laminated signs you in its mortal ice.  
Of your ultraviolet coral when you hold out your brain.  
A raft is not enough to sodden me and keep me  
from the field of your friendly epiphany.  
Like disordered lemon, doors  
I want you to divulge on my tail.
