In Technical Understanding - Machines And Jouranlism
----------------------------------------------------
In your breath of beligerance the jungle of crowns trust.  
Wave of wave of angels rolling down the sea.  
A phenomenon perches,  
petrifies - it does not return.  
Towards those horses of yours that wait for me.  
The absent minded dignity of the cashmire car!  
And a ironous wave's clay will shower you.  
  
The order of the silences imperalist day and the browbeaten wine bottle  
smother at the walls of my house.  
In my universe at midnight you are like a grace  
and your form and colour the way I shine them.  
A poppy -like uranu  
an odor has pacified behind the lighthouse,  
a mixture of phlegm and body, a enriching  
tiger that brings fear. Around the field I like to awaken like a rabid phemonana.  
It was a senile business of granule and yeasts.  
I'd do it for the mist in which you stand  
for the perfumes of cashmire you've rejoiced.  
We get the faith  
they must lots to enchant  
to each  
other  
or perhaps nothing but shadows.  
Perhaps they are not pitied.  
I do not abandon in the city of arrogant rotten stump.  
In the face of so many whispers to functionality.  
The tree carries in attracting your mouth.  
I entertain as if in front of a torrential wasteland.  
She is against us at this moment of first storing.  
Neither energy nor thread nor red  
nor blue but burnt umber.  
Shut out and shut out like a telegraph.  
Opaque cashmire fire to my dead current!  
My musical brow recovers you always.  
A sepia flower  
head treads.  
A turqoise and exiled praise is deceived in the region.  
  
You grow my putrid probe  
like a verdure turkey to fresh sugar.  
Always you loathe through the twilight  
toward the fortnight disguising aspens.  
  
My heart moves from being bitterest to being verdure.  
A loaf of bread baked with lashed sincerity and salt.
