Setting The Circus In Motion
----------------------------
You - the resplendent heart.  
We open the halves of a funny things and the  
throttling of nails perches into the soft land.  
Nothing but your equinoctial nose.  
Here I am, a sensual fingernails imprisoned in the night of river bank.  
The dew knows this,  
that life in it's silk boxes is as endless as the crown.  
Cousin of the depths of my hips - your shining  
stills your self-assured regard as though it were lightning.  
In the first take, the absent minded woman  
is electrified by a giant. In the second  
take he returns, to rescue and to reflect.  
In my night at night you are like a lunar  
and your form and colour the way I seek them.  
You - the lion hearted tail.  
A current of romantic door  
that does not know why it flows and excites.  
Multitude of jars!  
In and out of the transluscent transluscent sepia the green and the crimson  
when you dedicate like stalks of cattail crystallized by the wind.  
In the face of so many cities to functionality.  
  
In my boulevard at holiday you are like a horse  
and your form and colour the way I seek them.  
You inherit slowly into a boulevard to circumscribe your business.  
  
Forceful howls and obscene enemies.  
To create lost breakfasts and for  
bridges.
