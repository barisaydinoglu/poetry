Image With The Wounded Soldier
------------------------------
The curtain knows this,  
that life in it's diamond boxes is as endless as the sea shell.  
Once there was a exiled child who  
connected at  
parties, sitting in a triangle, among bells.  
What thick gardens -  
the night is filled with it,  
peaces for the salt and the rigid silicon.  
When you divulge performed like an angel.  
Some recover but I hear your salt like time.  
Like ghosts twisting in saxophones.  
Because I love you, love, among the jungle and in front of the lava.
