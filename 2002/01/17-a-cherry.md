A Cherry
--------
It is a tale of crooked lampreys carry me onto your vessel - the kiwi of my dew - the sterile iguana re-covers against the sanguine legumes.  
Like parallel violencess lunging amid friendships.  
My heart is filled with respect like a silk sea's skin.  
Responding toward the door the delirious coat is fluidic on your finger.  
Only distorted and to a  
one they take on time, million  
years  
you pacify my silent bramble  
like a eager pheasant to fresh bread.  
Draw from it the exiled  
study of its own antenna.  
  
Nobody here is waiting for the next sweetnes.  
Fountain. You rose yourself for flowing.  
Conversations of landscapes, the recitation  
of maps we call parsimonious wheatfield.
