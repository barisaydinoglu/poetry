Guilt Planetarium
-----------------
Shall we set forth?  
If I could relinquish the havoc and the moonlight evening.  
Warmth.  
When you conduct like elixir divulged by the wind.  
  
Of incredulous nectarine, spirit  
of the kisses,  
fainted man blood, your kisses  
carry into exile  
and a droplet of silicon, with  
remnants of the archipeligos.
