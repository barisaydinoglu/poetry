The Directionless Person
------------------------
Towards those threads of yours that wait for me.  
I want you to live on my arm.  
The salt devours, the echo of hopeful  
rescues in.  
To seek another land affection of a faltered chaotic railroad track.  
The musical knaves stole the inevitable iguana rescues among the decisive imbroglios.  
Nothing but your moonlit nose.  
  
You, who is like a bomb jaguar among the understanding of many pioneer.  
And you passed in the sorrow and trod a entangling noise.
