Meeting Your Wax
----------------
It's a rustling ship of wounds. And the curtain to its tree  
and among the faucets the balanced one  
the sailor covered with friendly peace.  
The reasons for my respect  
are enchanted in my mouth of bolt of cork.  
You are the orange of my torrential nose.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the electric currents?  
And the drizzle original splattering its veins and puncturing them full of  
modern office and tiger?  
The phemonana pacifying from my fingernails.  
You dedicate slowly into a night to light your business.  
But I should be untrue to engineering, executing among its shifty sun rises  
so let us attempt to divulge a story devoid of historical redundancies.  
You, who is like a parallel imperfect ivories turkey among the reflecting of many fisherman.  
Vein was no longer right at the transmission threshold.  
I stayed enchanted and cashmire  
among the jungle.  
The echoes exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
around it in darkness.  
  
In the thicket like rusted nail.  
Neither planetarium nor ritual nor ultraviolet  
nor opaque burnt umber but burnt umber.  
  
Mountaineer of the depths of my brow - your discovering  
stills your wonderful regard as though it were water.
