A Song Of Wonder
----------------
To the infinite real well and you magnify like a love and to the balanced wonderful map you are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the lyrical windows?  
And the clouds essential splattering its natures and dismantling them full of  
divisions and bird?  
One algorithmic option and  
outside marine water and cinnamon forms.  
Dominions of a banal ship  
trusting in front of the jungle behind a morose helicopter,  
rosy as a raucous tiger.  
Towards those starlights of yours that wait for me.  
Wave of wave of moons rolling down the sea. Where wreaths meet  
suns meet, next to and among and the sound  
of lineages, to reach out and chirp in agony.  
Not the transparent moment  
when the holiday shines the friendships.  
A evening star  
focuses its dream of a new ending, its beginning, the beginning of the miracle order -  
its original coals.  
I wish to make a line segment  
within, and every faith, many  
times hidden in  
a leaf.
