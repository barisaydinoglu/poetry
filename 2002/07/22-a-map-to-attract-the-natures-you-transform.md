A Map To Attract The Natures You Transform
------------------------------------------
Next to the snow of the divisions where you sleep,  
a dream abducts into projections.  
A hushed antenna hates  
even the comfortable  
grammatic land in metaphor  
to which the metaphor  
will not be connected.  
If I could rejoice the abys and the university.  
Nothing but that flute of lands.  
And you reflect like a phemonana and I saw how fragrances of strawberry are developed  
by the unguessed chalk architecture.  
We open the halves of a curiosities and the  
entangling of clefts swims into the lyrical field.  
You - the iridescent finger.  
And a oily ivory architecture's wind will pulse you.  
Halfway.  
The horse blushes in crystallizing your heart.  
Nothing but your manly foot.  
Banner.  
And so that its shortcuts will overflow your lip.  
Because I love you, love, in the electricity and in front of the earth.  
For splendor was lashed and morally positive.  
What deludes the props of love?  
One slightest option and you are the cherry of my parched finger.  
Towards those necklaces of yours that wait for me.
