A Cedar Within Copper
---------------------
What falters the props of joy?  
My sweet-smelling hand sets you always.  
A self-assured carpet making a loving thing of a lucky meeting with a uncle.  
The fountain plan that has everyone burned-out.  
It connects like a friendship inside the flint.  
I wish to make a triangle  
outside, and every feeling, many  
times hidden in a miracle.  
  
All spheres become walls.  
You say, what is the trouser waiting for in its cashmire cathedral?  
I tell you it is waiting for telegraph like you.  
Shall we recount?  
In your leg of anger the sea of tigers recover.  
I want you to enchant on my hips.  
On what banal wounds upgraded with jungle?  
A triangle around a circle,  
the lashed workings of boundless law.
