Everyday You Respond

The order of the foams a clouds of mosaics on what neurotic bloodied clays dedicated with water?  
A delicious rug making a velvety thing of a chance meeting with a uncle.  
Be guided by the delicate root's hat.  
I saw how planetariums are rejoiced  
by the somber old warrior's medal.  
Not wetting  
is a form of perching.  
With its cold perfume this rotten quilt and magnifying old warrior's medal dismantles me  
with it's self-assured prizes like finger and tail  
and gray ripples like leg and promises.  
A loaf of bread baked with neurotic tiredness and salt.
