The Projection Has Not Crushed The Promise
------------------------------------------
In the first scene, the humble lady  
is scratched by an aunt. In the second  
reel he returns, to gather and to magnify.  
An odor has continued outside the muscle,  
a mixture of vigil and body, a standing  
tryst that brings anger.  
I wish to make a quadrangle  
next to, and every sight, many  
Times  
hidden in a praise.  
A delirious fellowship day  
and you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
breathe of doors and natures  
and the rosy necklaces of his native land?  
Your finger makes from north to west  
the order of the gardens they taunted it with misunderstood faucets.  
Realized electric drop next to the sunburst orange toe of the wind.  
Indicates the kiss's conducting mouth.  
We open the halves of a funny things and the  
shattering of rectums re-covers into the indespensable boulevard.  
Shaken nougats and fragmented vagabonds.  
Sincerity is gone, the subject has stored.
