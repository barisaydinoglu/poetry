A Cork Within Fused Quartz
--------------------------
In the face of so many bloody feathers to functionality. Nothing but your naked eyeballs.  
A steady mist of alcoves.  
Neither ripple nor serendipity nor rust colored  
nor blue but transparent.  
Galloped and then dawned in the university.  
A bitten study plagues  
even the starry  
grammatic university in inscription  
to which the metaphor  
will not be carried.  
Not developing is a form of preserving.
