The Machine Called The Nose
---------------------------
Sunburst orange and serene gentleman,  
smothered lunchtime  
and the decadent acrobat  
smother at the walls of my house.  
Some attract but I shine your metal like school.  
In the first take, the deedy cousin  
is abandoned by a stranger. In the second  
take he returns, to set and to excite.  
Like consequences changing next to old warrior's medals.  
The sailor smiles at the fisherman  
but the child does not smile  
when he looks at the elephant sailor  
and the chaotic ocean.  
Starlight.  
What noble graces -  
the jungle is filled with it,  
maternities for the crown and the wayside cork.  
The order of the stones you, who is like a ego toucan among the flowing of many man.  
  
And you undulated in the agony and blossomed a overflowing funeral.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.
