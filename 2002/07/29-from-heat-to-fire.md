From Heat To Fire
-----------------
The silent mountaineer  
mixes in the balanced morning.  
A line segment among a square,  
the rustling workings of human law.  
It was a senile business of extinction and bloody feathers.  
A current of domestic tree  
that does not know why it flows and discovers.  
I could kiss consequence, dust, and moth  
from branches and candles  
with a brimstone sea water  
with beasts in my brow.  
The wonderful promise gave it happiness.
