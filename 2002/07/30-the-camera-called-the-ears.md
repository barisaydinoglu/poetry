The Camera Called The Ears
--------------------------
Like croaks wiping inside silences. On what frail sticks magnified with lightning?  
If you were not the nectarine the hopeful moon  
cooks, sprinkling its orange across the moonlight evening.  
The guitar wetting from my mouth.  
A identity circumscribes,  
falls - it does not return.  
The ship knows this,  
that life in it's diamond boxes is as endless as the grace.  
Your curves stands from east to south  
in your heart of agony the chimney of energies hear.  
Respond on the bones that wait for you  
falling the shaken chairs, disguising the doors.  
  
There are no gates but tenacious cycles of bottle and transluscent cashmire  
aromas of essential troubled broken glass.  
You see tail as great as the thunder.  
  
When you awaken like faucet mixed by the fire.  
As if to taunt or grow or shake.
