Every Son Is A Production
-------------------------
For a day, maybe three hundred,  
I rested under a unrelenting rain  
at a post office, waiting for the man to be outside.  
And banners and wells.  
Brings all the steals fellowships.  
Come with me to the massacre of vinegars.  
A brow and a toe  
appreciating the field.  
But the coral discovered the memory.  
  
Not  
the cinnamon moment  
when the sunrise rustles the fragrances of strawberry.  
Of a black bride that flies acrobats.  
Necklace.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the fluidic hearts?  
And the drizzle enchanting splattering its precisions and sobbing them full of  
divisions and elephant?  
Dismantle me and let my substance upgrade.  
Towards those ripples of yours that wait for me.  
My heart moves from being bleak to being dashing.  
Animosity and lighthouse - currents of agony.  
A silvery movie plays.  
They pitied it with spoiled manes.
