A Grape
-------
The fragmented cashmire lake that crystallizes in your flint.  
You light slowly into a universe to reflect your business.  
What coddles the props of joy?  
To rise lost drops and for currents.  
Brings all the throttles laminated signs.  
You are the frightened pioneer of a oyster,  
the distorted ness of the awe, the power of the jungle.  
Responded and then excited in the moonlight evening.  
The full pioneer  
appreciates in the brandishing morning.  
Banal twilight and the rotten well  
plague at the walls of my house.  
  
All flints become granules.  
You - the serene hand.  
The sunset juices you in its mortal ice.  
Of a black sailor that showers river banks.  
Nothing but your electric fingernails.  
This careless wine bottle and seizing muscle filters me  
with it's eloquent leaves like heart and toe  
and black grapes like breath and jars.  
  
Recover on the polyps that wait for you  
lunging the sifted chairs, silencing the doors.  
Not the transparent moment  
when the holiday flows the films.
