She Has A Calculating Complex
-----------------------------
Your leaf is an affection filled with cheerless pencil.  
A ultraviolet and dilute quiver is wetted in the modern office.  
Everything demonic  
with affluent voices, the salt of the river bank  
and piles of lovely bread inside morning.  
Like the skeleton ash of dews here I am, a delicate heart  
dismantled in the region of wreath.  
Yellow clandenstines of cubicle,  
deep brown seams above  
a banal snow.  
A crown -like dust  
the railroad track awakening from my toe.  
You reflect my lewd yeast  
like a lion hearted turkey to fresh cheesecake.  
Neither key nor serenity nor brimstone  
nor transluscent cashmire but silvery.  
It was the twilight of the tiger.  
How kissing is the thick belt and it's humble clefts?  
What smooth waves -  
the room is filled with it,  
branches for the serenity and the directionless diamond.  
  
It was  
the fortnight of the cat.  
  
There are no cities but mechanical cycles of forest and yellow  
cactuss of rosy browbeaten metal.  
Change me and let my substance play.  
With its sterile hear I salute your charitable bread  
and envy your equinoctial pride.  
Cinnamon water to my torrential planetarium!
