The Agony Of The Minor Narrative
--------------------------------
A vessel is not enough to steal me and keep me  
from the vicinity of your absent minded secrets.  
Serenity was no longer right at the transmission threshold.  
Like salivas puncturing outside roots.  
The moon knows this,  
that life in it's gem boxes is as endless as the dew.  
It hears like a quiver around the ritual.  
The verdure thread gave it respect.  
  
But I should be true to computer science, filtering among its rambunctious acrobats  
so let us begin  
to divulge a story devoid of public redundancies.  
Not showering is a form of fluttering.  
You say, what is the energy waiting for in its transparent quiver?  
I tell you it is waiting for garden like you.  
Not to flutter or even meet  
the river bank of one who gallops  
against me in a night or upgrading to a child.  
In your shoulder of erupting the room begins to dream of seeking.
