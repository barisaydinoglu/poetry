I Have Gone Growing
-------------------
In your fingernails of electrifying the region begins to dream of flying. The incredulous dignity of the flesh!  
Beginning toward the honeysuckle the hushed essence is hidden on your eye.  
What secrets does the cat contain?  
How little we rise and how much it flutters the curiosities of this universe.  
Re-covering from rotten silk.
