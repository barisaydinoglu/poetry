A Song Of Decency
-----------------
The order of the railroad tracks the electricity hidden complaints are condemned. Pockets of rusted nail converted into silicon.  
Negligent nights and wet-winged ashes.  
Full stop.  
You are the fruit of my directionless hips.  
Shall we proceed?  
The order of the laws from blade of grass  
to tornado,  
hidden flints drawn by perfect channels, a  
morbid goblet begins to swim.  
If you were not the orange the smooth moon  
cooks, sprinkling its lemon across the divisions.  
Full stop.  
A parenthetical sunshine of flutes.  
Shall we recount?  
If you were not the plum the lyrical moon  
cooks, sprinkling its lemon across the city.
