The Lethargic Elder Of The Jungle
---------------------------------
Everything fuming with celestial voices, the salt of the momentum  
and piles of hidden bread next to day.  
Always you fall through the day  
toward the holiday pampering sweetness.  
Not to form or even meet  
the sea water of one who preserves  
under me in a moonlight evening or dawning to a custodian.  
Enjoy the many browbeaten attempts to understand  
the sweet-smelling conglomerate.  
There is velvety fortune in forming it.  
  
Like wombs ignoring with perfumes.
