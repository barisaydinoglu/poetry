A Tomato
--------
To the resplendent color of the glass shades of cashmire. The order of the sweetness always you abolish through the sunrise  
toward the afternoon condemning peaces.  
Blossoming the time of her fused quartz architecture full of love.  
Cinnamon wind to my bleak flint!  
Brings all the soddens flags.  
I am petrified by sea water and wounded soldier, by viola and mist.  
As if to disguise or shower or fly.  
Which is a friendly sun rise of directions  
twenty-seven or million, blossomed  
on a crimson car or in the poetic lake  
directions of the fingernails, a calculation in your earss.  
Wave of wave of kiss rolling down the sea.  
  
In the face of so many lances to functionality.  
Closed off and shut out like a ribbon.  
  
I salute your cordial wine  
and envy your friendly pride.  
But I should be untrue to oceanography, changing among its fractious wine bottles  
so let us begin to divulge a story  
devoid of alphabetic redundancies.  
When you mix like coat grew by the jungle.  
And you love like a river bank and a sand-colored love blushes.  
When you crystallize like writing chirped by the ice.  
The jungle within hers  
a tale we divulge in passing,  
with notions of tiredness  
and a passion for science and jouranlism  
you say, what is the book waiting for in its sunburst orange umbrella?  
I tell you it is waiting for flint like you.
