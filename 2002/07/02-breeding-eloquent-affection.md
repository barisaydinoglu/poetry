Breeding Eloquent Affection
---------------------------
And you'll ask  
why doesn't his poetry  
grow of tigers and saxophones  
and the resolute sea's skins of his native land?  
And the tree to its grape  
and among the lemons the absorbant one  
the lady covered with lion hearted time.  
Nothing but your serendipidous ears.  
A honest thunder of aromas.  
Pockets of aluminum converted into chalk.  
Trusting the candle of her flesh full of wonder.  
You've asked me what the iguana is developing there with his yellow brain?  
I reply, the sea's skin knows this.  
A chorus of cats at lunchtime un attracted un twisted  
comes to a halt before a map.  
Where paths meet  
love meet, among and outside and the sound  
of cadavers, to reach out and gallop in sorrow.  
There ought to be a foam of a fresh necklace wetting in a room.  
It magnifies like a salt amid the pencil.  
  
One of them is  
infinite,  
the other knows images.  
Where is nobody  
she says, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
A helicopter is not enough to sodden me and keep me  
from the field of your somber mysteries.  
Full stop. Lineages of a boneless vessel  
discovering around the modern office within a negligent train,  
naked as a insatiable jaguar.  
From her brow and her toe respond  
smooth salts of the earth.  
What is this signal but a memory conquered of its phemonanas?  
A loaf of bread baked with mechanical  
honor and salt.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
Pure dominion magnifies the umbrellas your grace is a echo filled with molested droplet.  
You wet my ironous vagina  
like a friendly iguana to fresh lemon.
