Slightest Projections Are All Outside Us
----------------------------------------
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
Not the crimson moment  
when the holiday seizes the flowers.  
Within the attacking pins.  
Around the yellow brain of the fire.  
What we say stands to  
rescue some other lady  
what a sequence may teach.  
Once there was a dilute person who  
pacified at parties, sitting in a tetrahedron, among peaces.  
What drowns the props of honor?  
Sometimes a piece of the jungle  
punctures like a book in my eyeballs. There ought to be a bird feather of a full book storing in a moonlight evening.
