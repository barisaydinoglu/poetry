A Fellowship To Excite The Goblets You Mingle
---------------------------------------------
Full stop.  
Your fingernails transforms from  
south to east  
towards those fellowships of yours that wait for me.  
The reasons for my respect  
are lived in my eyeballs of crystal.  
Pockets of brick converted into cedar.  
We open the halves of a mysteries and the  
wetting of clocks perches into the serendipidous heights.  
  
The honest dignity of the pencil!  
You are the grape of my senile shoulder.  
I saw how kisses are conducted  
by the smooth sea's skin. It was the holiday of the oyster.  
The city with hers  
a tale we speak in passing,  
with notions of wonder  
and a passion for computer science and computer science  
in the face of so many bones to functionality.  
  
It was the fortnight  
of the oyster.  
To seek another land return to the homeland of the bells.  
Wetting the bell of her banner full of joy.  
Because I love you, love, next to the sky and within the ice.  
Hoove.  
I wish to make a circle  
around, and every abstraction, many  
times hidden in a horse.  
Indicates the sweetnes's rejoicing arm.
