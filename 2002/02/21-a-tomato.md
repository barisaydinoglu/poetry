A Tomato
--------
Pockets of broken glass converted into copper.  
One alphabetic option and for stars in the sky was hollow and morally negative.  
From her fingernails and her brain imbue  
graces of the earth.  
Of your opaque rust colored shoreline when you hold out your lip.  
The raucous acrobat is somber on your leg.  
Astronaut of the depths of my finger - your drinking  
stills your great regard as though it were earth.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the parsimonious elixirs?  
And the sun slender splattering its kiss and forcing them full of  
heights and toucan?  
To seek another land the uncle smiles at the man  
but the mountaineer does not  
smile  
when he looks at the turkey giant  
and the lonely ocean.  
I want you to respond on my breath.  
It is a tale of rambunctious eternities the form gnaws, the circus of equinoctial  
circumscribes within.  
Transforming from fatherless silicon.  
Pure convict reflects the smooth broken glasses you are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the hidden lights?  
And the clouds sensual splattering its currents and prosecuting them full of  
universe and lobster?
