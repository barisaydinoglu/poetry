A Angellic Substance
--------------------
Happiness is gone, the subject has responded.  
She is against us at this moment of first inheriting.  
When you tread enriched like a light.  
For sea's skin was morose and morally neutral.  
Noone here is waiting for the next forest.  
Forest. You drank yourself for entertaining.  
A loaf of bread baked with parched tiredness and salt.  
One overtone option and there ought to be a promise of a soft shoreline shining in a sea.  
Galloped and then grew in the divisions.  
Not mixing is a form of kissing.  
  
And you play like a dove and one alphabetic option and upgrading toward the drop my heart moves from being shifty to being profound.
