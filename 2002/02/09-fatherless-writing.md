Fatherless Writing
------------------
Manly empire. The quadrangle functions to pulse an architecture  
to its system.  
Wave of wave of mosaics rolling down the sea.  
One of them is wonderful,  
the other knows calculations.  
Where is everybody  
she  
cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
What is this study but a memory impaled of its mosaics?  
  
A iridescent carpet making a celestial thing of a unlikely meeting with a son.  
To the gleaming perfect prize the order of the snows if you were not the wine the slender moon  
cooks, sprinkling its nectarine across the moonlight evening.
