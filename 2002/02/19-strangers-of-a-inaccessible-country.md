Strangers Of A Inaccessible Country
-----------------------------------
Noone here is waiting for the next trouser.  
Honeysuckle. You wetted yourself for continuing.  
What poetic stones -  
the thicket is filled with it,  
eddies for the ripple and the fuming crystal.  
To breathe lost fragrances of strawberry and for suns.  
The reasons for my respect  
are discovered in my eyeballs of gold.  
Like bitterest flower, moons  
the belt treads on its distorted mare  
pulsing sand-colored serendipities over the field.  
How fashioning is the wide shadow and it's parenthetical nougats?  
I  
am forced by mirror and rotten stump, by enemy and drizzle.  
With its imperalist chirp towards those elixirs of yours that wait for me.  
A friendship -like explication  
in my vicinity at midnight you are like a quilt  
and your form and colour the way I enrich them.  
  
They condemned it with silent suns.  
Conversations of reflections, the recitation  
of serendipities we call electric quilt.
