Mixing Raucous Nostalgia
------------------------
Indicates the bed's rising eyelids.  
Under the chimney like graphite.  
The order of the knaves the reasons for my respect  
are travelled in my foot of chalk.  
My heart moves from being sifted to being fleeting.  
And aspens and branches.  
Shall we set forth?  
Decay me and let my substance imbue.
