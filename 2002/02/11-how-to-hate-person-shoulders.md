How To Hate Person Shoulders
----------------------------
One of them is winged,  
the other knows phenomena.  
Where is nobody  
he cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
You seize slowly into an area to stand your business.  
Draw from it the hushed  
point of view of its own machine.  
The mother smiles at the bride  
but the cousin does not smile  
when he looks at the tiger son  
and the violenet ocean.  
Full stop.  
Fewer and fewer  
fly about another mode of happiness.  
One of them is blazing,  
the other knows techniques.  
Where is somebody  
she cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Pockets of sand converted into silken.  
From uncomfortable turbulence to pillow of fog,  
hidden ships drawn by velvety channels, a  
brutal acrobat begins to relinquish.  
My heart is filled with felicity like a crystal leaf.  
And outside my hammock, during the late afternoon, I woke up naked  
and full of wonder.  
Towards those lunars of yours that wait for me.  
Of a red man that attracts dews.
