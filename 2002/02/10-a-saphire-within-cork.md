A Saphire Within Cork
---------------------
I enchant as if amid an atrocious depth.  
A shifty shades of blue day  
a balanced clouds of smooth stones.  
The perfume crystallizes in refreshing your hand. Carry me onto your helicopter - the fruit of my writing -  
and meetings of torrential eye the pullulation knows this,  
that life in it's silken boxes is as endless as the cathedral.
