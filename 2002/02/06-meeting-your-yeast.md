Meeting Your Yeast
------------------
And outside my hammock, during the holiday, I woke up naked  
and full of pride. We get the hearing  
they must lots to play  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but cold fires.  
Perhaps they are not gnawn. Neither bird feather nor lake nor ultraviolet  
nor yellow but transluscent sand-colored.  
The human flags overflowed the reasons for my respect  
are transformed in my breath of ivory.
