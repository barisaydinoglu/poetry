A Song Of Illusion
------------------
Once there was a frightened stranger who  
blushed at parties, sitting in a triangle, among prizes.  
Fear and mane - warmths of your body of beligerance.  
Around the universe I like to refresh like a chaotic mirror.  
So the dashing honor lives on in a fruit,  
the thick house of the affection,  
the profound serenity that is honest and balanced.  
What shakes the props of felicity?  
You say, what is the smooth aluminum waiting for in its deep brown juice?  
I tell you it is waiting for landscape like you.  
Went appreciated in starlight a production for image is the lack thereof.  
Which is a profound movie of directions  
million or million, pacified  
on a flag or in the loving door  
directions of the breath, a calculation in your brows.  
Nobody here is waiting for the next rose.  
Wave. You stood yourself for rescuing.  
A angellic wind of doors.  
Here I am, a hidden fingernails devoured in the sea of affection.  
Like the listless ash of souls and so that its legless horses will kill your toe.
