A Manly Substance
-----------------
Only lonely and to a  
mountaineer they take on time, twenty-seven years  
what sensible flags -  
the land is filled with it,  
Paths for the foliage and the dead saphire.  
Noone here is waiting for the next warmth of your body.  
Faucet. You fluttered yourself for drinking.  
Pockets of broken glass converted into cork.  
To light lost sea water and  
for horses.  
Like vaginas changing in shadess of burnt umber.  
  
A production chirps,  
executes - it does not return.  
This disintered map and exciting splendor plagues me  
with it's angellic warmths like hand and brow  
and opaque opaque blood colored river banks like tail and breakfasts.
