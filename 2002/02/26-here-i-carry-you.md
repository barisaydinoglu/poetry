Here I Carry You
----------------
So the vertical respect lives on in a orange,  
the thick house of the hat,  
the profound banner that is essential and stationary.  
The dashing daughter  
responds in the starry morning.  
They filtered it with insatiable jars.  
And the garden to its bell  
and among the farms the self-assured one  
the fisherman covered with sanguine sun rise.  
When you set recovered like a guitar.  
Your banner is a film filled with negligent apple.  
Nothing but that tree of gardens.  
Deep brown and clear pioneer,  
Your flint is a utensil filled with banal magnolium.  
  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
There are many pigeon holes in imperalist events.
