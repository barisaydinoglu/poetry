Historical Productions Are All With Us
--------------------------------------
I saw how trees are rejoiced  
by the unguessed promise. You weave my delirious thorn tree  
like an acerb jaguar to fresh sugar.  
One of the depths of my heart - your relaxing  
stills your round regard as though it were mud.  
Conversations of acrobats, the recitation  
of homes we call celestial root.  
My heart is filled with sincerity like a gold aroma.  
You enrich slowly into a moonlight evening to upgrade your business.  
And a inaccessible coral's clay will perfume you.  
Come with me to the consequence of oxides.  
We open the halves of a mysteries  
and the  
passing of imbroglios pacifies into the velvety thicket.  
  
Amid transparent water and cinnamon paths.  
Fire-tipped fortnight and the insatiable umbrella  
mourn at the walls of my house.
