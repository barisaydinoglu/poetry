He Has A Shaken Complex
-----------------------
Realized full planetarium like the whirlwinds of broken glass of femininities tiredness is gone, the subject has flew.  
Pulled out and shut out like a land.  
Pure utensil seizes the kiss conversations of apples, the recitation  
of maps we call thick law.  
Draw from it the insatiable  
projection of its own inscription.  
I wish to make a tetrahedron  
within, and every hearing, many  
times hidden in a elixir.  
A signal inherits,  
lunges - it does not return.  
Our new quilt, our equinoctial forest quadrangles.  
It's a flying stalks of cattail of masks.  
Sometimes a piece of the ice  
coagulates like a flag in my brain.  
As soon as the incoming manes  
gives the public indication.  
I am wiped by railroad track and serection, by noise and rain.
