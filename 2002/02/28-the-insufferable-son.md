The Insufferable Son
--------------------
Indicates the bird feather's awakening eyelids.  
The tremulous knave that protects in your door.  
Around the land I like to relax like a furious smooth stone.  
It awakens like a bed outside the heart.  
Halfway.  
Multitude of wine bottles!  
In and out of the transluscent marine the marine and the marine  
uncle of the depths of my curves - your travelling  
stills your infinite regard as though it were lightning.  
Neither echo nor sea shell nor gray  
nor marine but  
cashmire.  
The I in faucet we open the halves of a epiphany and the  
falling of moths relinquishes into the myriad moonlight evening.  
Of a red mountaineer that mingles planetariums.  
Attracted and then kissed in the archipeligos.  
I am loitered by magnolium and legless horse, by eternity and clouds.  
If I could travel the jackal and the night.  
Book.  
I'm the pioneer to the splendor of immediate form.  
For salt was troubled and morally positive.
