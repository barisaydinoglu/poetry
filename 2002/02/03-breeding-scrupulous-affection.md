Breeding Scrupulous Affection
-----------------------------
I was without doubt the mother oyster  
there in the directionless jungle.  
When it looked me with its aquatic ribbon eyes  
it had neither eyelids nor leg  
but saphire femininities  
on its sides.  
My heart moves from being fatherless to being resplendent.  
I want you to tread on my finger.  
Within the turqoise agony of the whisper.  
Like the neurotic metal of manes here I am, a sensual toe fainted in the room of phemonana.  
I saw how kisses are loved  
by the indespensable foliage.  
Of secure wine, spirit  
of the eddies,  
devoured father blood, your kisses  
rustle into exile  
and a droplet of ivory, with remnants of the field.  
Starry empire. The loop functions to protect a environment  
to its system.  
A signal returns,  
deceives - it does not return.  
  
Nothing but your promising curves.
