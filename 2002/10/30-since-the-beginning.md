Since The Beginning
-------------------
A musical thunder of landscapes. To the noble color of the gold nature.  
Where curtains meet  
lands meet, behind and among and the sound  
of masks, to reach out and recover in sorrow.  
In the cold sea of distorted branch.  
Nothing but that wreath of foams.  
Towards those gardens of yours that wait for me.  
From palm tree  
leaf to ray of sunlight,  
hidden trees drawn by slender channels, a  
decadent bell begins to pacify.
