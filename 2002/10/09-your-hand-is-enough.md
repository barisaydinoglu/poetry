Your Hand Is Enough
-------------------
Fluidic, bolt of ceramic stone! The wine bottle knows this,  
that life in it's gem boxes is as endless as the productivity.  
From blade of grass to tornado,  
hidden lakes drawn by boundless channels, a  
demonic snow begins to store.  
  
Shining  
a wreath  
created in the resolute thunder.  
In burnt umber water and blue laws.  
A pullulation focuses its dream of a new beginning, its beginning, the old ending of the serendipity order -  
its eloquent belts.  
A helicopter is not enough to deform  
me and keep me  
from the field of your serene epiphany.  
On what smothered blades carried with clay?  
The reasons for my respect  
are stood in my eyeballs of glass.  
Pure blade promises the pastures the kis imbues in rustling your eyeballs.
