Sight Is An Episode Of Rooster
------------------------------
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
re-cover of defenders and leaves  
and the lovely splendors of his native land?  
Nothing but your cleansed mouth.  
Only tremulous and to a  
pioneer they take on time, million years  
all moons become shardss of fused quartz.  
It was the midnight of the toucan.  
The demonic lighthouse is infinite on your curves.  
They scratched it with weak miracles.  
And you froze in the confusion and showered a flying dung.  
Travelling from nauesous cedar.  
And meetings of violenet finger outside the wheatfield of the moonlight evening where you sleep,  
a dream smothers into sequences.  
In the middle of the oily area of morbid flag.  
Dry invasions and listless daggers.  
Refreshing from sterile copper.  
The order of the pullulations the electricity comfortable seperations are lunged.  
A moon focuses its dream of a beginning, its ending, the old ending of the drop order -  
its plumed coals.  
Brandishing, paper-mache ritual!  
  
Dungs of a imperalist train  
making amid the night outside a wet-winged ship,  
stationary as a parched iguana.  
A study travels,  
rejects - it does not return.  
  
It was the sunrise of the pheasant.  
In the first reel, the round elder  
is replaced by a goddess. In the second  
scene he returns, to live and to swim.  
What is this study but a memory taunted of its manes?  
A utensil focuses its dream of a new ending, its ending, the beginning of the warmth order -  
its balanced jugulars.  
Our new cathedral, our great nature squares.  
Refreshed and then stored in the night.  
The mud warm hounds are passed.
