A Laminated Sign To Enchant The Prizes You Re-cover
---------------------------------------------------
Cashmire serections of evil,  
crimson seams above a delirious tree.  
In the face of so many traps to functionality.

historical universe in synonym  
to which the metaphor  
will not be upgraded.

so let us try to divulge a story without public redundancies.  
The comfortable coat gave it respect.
