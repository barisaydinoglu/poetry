The Death Fallen Into The Sea
-----------------------------
I am buried by light and blood, by acid and mist. Be guided by the wide star's candle.  
Thick, fused quartz umbrella!  
If  
you were not the apple the angellic moon  
cooks, sprinkling its sugar across the divisions.  
To upgrade lost trousers and for muscles.  
Deep brown shadows of extinction,  
sand-colored seams above a blood-stained aroma.  
On what inaccessible bloods loved with ice?  
The fleeting dignity of the flower!  
What stationary waves -  
the night is filled with it,  
fleshes for the warmth of your body and the insatiable bolt of fused quartz.  
My wonderful lip grows you always.
