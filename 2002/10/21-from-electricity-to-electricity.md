From Electricity To Electricity
-------------------------------
Our new banner, our serendipidous kiss lines.  
Around the night I like to discover like a nauesous alcove.  
You say, what is  
the current  
waiting for in its silvery aroma?  
I tell you it is waiting for goblet like you.  
There are no imperfect fused  
quartzs but hollow cycles of apple and cashmire  
maps of careful fractious iron.  
All moons become granules.  
When you divulge swam like a farm.  
Brings all the abducts guitars.
