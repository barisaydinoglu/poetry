Among Of Circus And Soul
------------------------
A synonym seeks,  
shakes - it does not return.  
Fewer and fewer  
entangle about another mode of tiredness.  
Amid marine water and marine precisions.  
I want you to chirp on my shoulder.  
My heart moves from being tear stained to being natural.  
Mingling from parched paper-mache.  
Everything morose with delicious voices, the salt of the shades of sepia  
and piles of real bread  
outside midnight.  
My heart moves from being hairy to being gleaming.  
You light my inevitable granule  
like a trusting ostrich to fresh sugar.  
On what weak billowss of rust colored smoke expanded with electricity?  
Halfway.  
I salute your rosy grape  
and envy your essential pride.  
  
From her nose and her fingernails discover  
serenities of the earth.  
Wave of wave of quilts rolling down the sea.  
  
Pure wax wakes the flags the moonlight evening with hers  
a story we speak in passing,  
with notions of sincerity  
and a passion for jouranlism and jouranlism  
I took on hated manes.  
  
A arm and an arm  
promising the universe.  
Pockets of metal converted into silicon.
