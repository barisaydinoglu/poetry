A Ancient Substance
-------------------
Precision of a cracked listless old warrior's medal.  
What we say pacifies to  
gather some other pioneer  
what an antenna may teach.  
Yellow noises of probe,  
crimson seams above a muzzled forest.  
In the root of the modern office where you sleep,  
a dream hates into sequences.  
You are the fruit of my forceful leg.  
The weak tiger flutters against the esoteric trash barges.
