A Chalk Within Fused Quartz
---------------------------
A language gathers,  
entangles - it does not return.  
Shall we keep going?  
Our new sphere, our ancient wave tetrahedrons.  
You inherit in the night as in a plumed universe.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
Outside the rust colored illusion of the trap.  
The starlight imprisons, the essence of real  
refreshes next to.
