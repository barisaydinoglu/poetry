Since The End
-------------
And the tree to its sphere  
and among the sweetness the irreducable one  
the god covered with perfect essence.  
Transparent water to my burned-out bottle!  
And trysts and defenders.  
Wave of wave of smooth stones rolling down the sea.  
I'd do it for the old warrior's medal in which you re-cover  
for the umbrellas of sand-colored you've connected.  
Some rustle but I recover your sand like starry sky.  
Multitude of films!  
In and out of the transparent the green and the transluscent burnt umber  
An odor has imbued in the middle of the maternity,  
a mixture of self-production and body, a storing  
opaque sand-colored car that brings fear.  
The horse knows this,  
that life in it's paper-mache boxes is as endless as the flesh.  
Your sea water is a productivity filled with senile key.
