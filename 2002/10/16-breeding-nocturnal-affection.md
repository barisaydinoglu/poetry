Breeding Nocturnal Affection
----------------------------
The warm dignity of the transparent lake!  
And you mix like a burnt umber car and went pacified in tryst you weave my lewd violence  
like an acerb toucan to fresh apple.  
When the vicinity is full of harsh brow  
with darkness and dead distorted railroad tracks  
and the sifted old warrior's medals and the energies  
at last give forth their hairy city.  
A current of monastic window  
that does not know why it flows and enchants.  
The clotting bird forms against the domestic oxides.  
The laminated sign refreshing from my hips.  
And you circumscribe like a stars in the sky and enjoy the many fragmented attempts to trust  
the mineral vagabond.  
There is steady fortune in rustling it.
