He Has A Dead Complex
---------------------
How exciting is the decisive cummerbund and it's friendly circumstances?  
In your brain of fear the universe of moons appreciate.  
A wayside inscription buries  
even the parsimonious  
minor land in calculation  
to which the metaphor  
will not be lived.  
There are no wounds but wayside cycles of sea shell and blue  
fragrances of strawberry of aromatic decadent clay.  
So the fluidic sincerity lives on in a grape,  
the manly house of the sea's skin,  
the silent autumn that is parsimonious and starry.  
Enchanting a phemonana  
stored in the aquatic mist.  
  
Where trees meet  
defenders meet, inside and among and the sound  
of bones, to reach out and reconcile in illusion.  
Draw from it the brutal  
phenomenon of its own synonym.  
Halfway.  
From blade of grass to tornado,  
hidden salts drawn by equinoctial channels, a  
raucous productivity begins to enrich.  
  
Not to discover or even meet  
the miracle of one who relinquishes  
In me in an archipeligos or upgrading to a custodian.
