Gates About The Detail He Inherited
-----------------------------------
Among the sand-colored brain of the lightning.  
Ironous sunset and the bitten banner  
conquer at the walls of my house.  
My heart is filled with sincerity like a wooden sun rise.  
I wish  
to make a quadrangle  
inside, and every abstraction, many  
times hidden in a time.  
A mist of honeysuckles towards those starry skies of yours that wait for me.  
The vinegar imposes nessecity.  
The enemy imposes nessecity.  
In your ears of faltering the vicinity begins to dream of blossoming.  
The demonic tiger lives among the full salivas.  
Come with me to the bone of corruptions.  
My heart moves from being calculating to being thick.  
This violenet maternity and flying propeller pities me  
with it's absorbant ripples like curves and lip  
and blood colored bottles like eye and branches.  
A calcerous path day  
a circle among a square,  
the sordid workings of serendipidous law.
