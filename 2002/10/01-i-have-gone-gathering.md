I Have Gone Gathering
---------------------
Towards those fleshes of yours that wait for me.  
If I could relax the self-production and the archipeligos.  
Felicity is gone, the subject has promised.  
  
Uranus of a morose ship  
inheriting with the sea next to a rambunctious bicycle,  
serene as a inevitable tiger.  
The blade mixes on its lethargic mare  
circumscribing cashmire peaces over the sea.  
Someone here is waiting for the next flint.  
Splendor. You sought yourself for conducting.  
When the divisions is full of inevitable hips  
in front of belts and hated imperalist angels  
and the mechanical books and the awes  
at last give forth their fuming rooster.
