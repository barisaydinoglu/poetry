The Metaphor Called The Shoulder
--------------------------------
And you deceived in the fear and breathed a twisting shrapnel. But I should be true to science, loitering among its atrocious landscapes  
so let us attempt to speak a story devoid of minor redundancies.  
And you soddened in the agony  
and mixed a devouring hound.  
The wounded grace is enduring on your hand.  
I wish to make a line  
around, and every sight, many  
times hidden in a lake.  
The starry coral gave it tiredness.  
What funny things does the jaguar contain?  
How little we pacify and how much it drinks the secrets of this computer simulation.  
  
Shall we recount?  
A black and inevitable root is erupted in the thicket.  
  
The clotting pencil that reconciles in your silence.  
For ribbon was shifty and morally negative.
