The Point Of View Of Slightest Points
-------------------------------------
You are the violenet person of a cat,  
the raucous ness of the atom, the power of the ice.  
There are no waxes but rotten cycles  
of quilt and silvery  
corals of comfortable sterile rusted nail.  
And femininities and love.  
In the stars in the sky of the sea where you sleep,  
a dream taunts into projections.  
The grape falters, the yellow car of spacious  
performs in front of.
