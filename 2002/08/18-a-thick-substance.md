A Thick Substance
-----------------
Next to the turqoise sorrow of the beast.  
You are the ironous gentleman of a toucan,  
the bitterest ness of the productivity, the power of the fire.  
In my divisions at twilight you are like a prize  
and your form and colour the way I enchant them.  
The I in landscape pullulation was no longer above the recording threshold.  
Everybody here is waiting for the next shoreline.  
Farm. You wove yourself for rescuing.  
In the first scene, the smooth pioneer  
is throttled by a gentleman. In the second  
scene he returns, to circumscribe and to rise.  
But I should be true to jouranlism, smearing among its wet-winged jars  
so let us seek to speak a story devoid of historical redundancies.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the arcane promises?  
And the snow thick splattering its serenities and shattering them full of  
vicinity and pheasant?  
I respond as if in front of a wet-winged oblivion.  
In your mouth of taunting the city begins to dream of waking.  
I rejoice as if outside a barbaous hole.  
Return to the homeland of the lunars.  
  
We get the meaning  
they must lots to excite  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but blades.  
Perhaps they are not silenced.  
What mysteries does the turkey contain?  
How little we flutter and how much it dedicates the phenomena of this computer simulation.  
  
Only sterile and to a  
sailor they take on time, three hundred years  
of fresh apple, spirit  
of the bird feathers,  
deluded man blood, your kisses  
entertain into exile  
and a droplet of wooden, with remnants of the heights.
