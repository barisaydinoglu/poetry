An Equally Promising Man
------------------------
The cosmic kisses dismantled some kiss but I grow your graphite like bird feather.  
Inside the jar of the chimney where you sleep,  
a dream attacks into images.  
In the smallest bolt of silken autumn in the smallest crystal droplet I rejoice as if amid a calcerous panic.  
And a senile echo's earth will dawn you.  
Respect is gone, the subject has stored.
