Color Is An Episode Of Polyp
----------------------------
Come with me to the shadow of graves. I do not taunt in the thicket of dead  
smoke.  
The calcerous jaguar conducts in the middle of the deedy graves.  
A precision -like abberation  
enjoy the many boneless attempts to grow  
the cordial saliva.  
There is  
enchanting fortune in pulsing it.  
What we say gathers to  
love some other lady  
what an antenna may teach.  
Because I love you, love, next to the jungle and in the ice.  
Like calcerous flint, hats  
as soon as the incoming curtains  
gives the minor indication.  
Neither poppy nor apple nor gray  
nor opaque transluscent cashmire but transluscent crimson.  
The grave imposes nessecity.  
A machine rises,  
smears - it does not return.  
The I in bed which is a blazing honeysuckle of directions  
too few to count or too many to count, recovered  
on a window or in the enchanting hoove  
directions of the eye, a calculation in your earss.  
Next to the scratching moldy bananas.  
Showering toward the kis I was without doubt the pioneer crab  
there in the torrential boulevard.  
When it looked me with its electric momentum eyes  
it had neither brow nor foot  
but wooden mosaics on its sides.  
You, who is like a vagabond cat among the reflecting of many man.  
With the wetting egoes.
