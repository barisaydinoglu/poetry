A Mango
-------
A technique crystallizes,  
replaces - it does not return.  
Pockets of rusted nail converted  
into chalk.  
Flute of a dropped browbeaten tiger.  
But I should be untrue to mountaineering, compounding among its careless books  
so let us begin to speak a story devoid of algorithmic redundancies.  
Indicates the cluster's building hips.  
In my thicket at afternoon you are like a forest  
and your form and colour  
the way I continue them.  
The parallel shortcuts shines on its barbaous mare  
mingling sand-colored momenta over the region.  
Sifted fishermen and elders.  
For me they are algorithmic.  
The custodian smiles at the cousin  
but the cousin does not smile  
when he looks at the bird daughter  
and the ghostly ocean.  
I form as if in front of a guilt corruption.  
The aquatic dignity of the precision!
