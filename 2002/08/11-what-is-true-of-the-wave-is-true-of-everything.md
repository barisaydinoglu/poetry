What Is True Of The Wave Is True Of Everything
----------------------------------------------
The sea's skin plan that has everyone crooked. In the first scene, the warm god  
is filtered by a man. In the second  
reel he returns, to understand and to tread.  
Under the sticky room of fire-tipped stalks of cattail.  
Everybody here is waiting for the next bed.  
Candle. You set yourself for transforming.  
Once there was a rusted son who  
entertained at parties, sitting in a tetrahedron, among evening stars.  
  
Where flower heads meet  
bottles meet, behind and in front of and the sound  
of utensils, to reach out and weave in embarassement.  
You - the unguessed finger.  
You are the fruit of my inevitable curves.  
An odor has dawned under the guitar,  
a mixture of ego and body, a kissing  
kiss that brings agony.
