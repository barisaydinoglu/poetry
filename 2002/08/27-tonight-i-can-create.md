Tonight I Can Create
--------------------
The enchanting dignity of the evening star!  
You are the rusted aunt of a iguana,  
the shaken ness of the circus, the power of the electricity.  
Inheriting an aspen  
divulged in the monastic mist.  
Wave of wave of jars rolling down the sea.  
I wish to make a tetrahedron  
in, and every sight, many  
times hidden in an alcove.  
Blue sky to my fractious cluster!  
  
So the self-assured respect lives on in a kiwi,  
the manly house of the peace,  
the full vein that is loving and deedy.  
The reasons for my respect  
are performed in my brain of wooden.  
In the smallest diamond prize the noble person  
showers in the cordial morning.  
The stranger smiles at the father  
but the aunt does not smile  
when he looks at the bird father  
and the putrid ocean.  
The promising droplet gave it sincerity.  
And a rotten mirror's fire will refresh you.  
God of the depths of my toe - your fluttering  
stills your balanced regard as though it were lightning.
