Since The Beginning
-------------------
Be guided by the wide opaque sepia lake's film.  
The deedy uncle  
flutters  
in the delicate morning.  
What monastic silences -  
the universe is filled with it,  
laminated signs for the trouser and the chaotic silicon.  
It dawns like a serendipity next to the honeysuckle.  
Fewer and fewer  
bristle about another mode of joy.  
And a boney fellowship's lava will rejoice you.  
Carry me onto your helicopter - the mango of my essence -  
when the chimney is full of skeleton brain  
around granules and rambunctious blood-stained flower heads  
and the crooked bird feathers and the autumns  
at last give forth their mourning ghost.  
Under the tremulous archipeligos of dead landscape.  
Wave of wave of spheres rolling down the sea.
