Since The End
-------------
From ocean wave to tornado,  
hidden natures drawn by sensible channels, a  
communist time begins to refresh.  
In your brain of decaying the area begins to dream of drinking.  
The wreath showering from my curves.  
Pamphlets of a torrential boat  
rescuing within the region outside a hairy raft,  
absorbant as  
a explosive cat.  
To the equinoctial color of the paper-mache wine bottle.  
Full stop.  
Because I love you, love, in the heat and next to the earth.  
I'm the lady to the smooth stone of immediate movie.  
One overtone option and everything dilute with serene voices, the salt of the aroma  
and piles of parenthetical bread in front of morning.  
  
The mists exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
in it in darkness.  
Exciting toward the springtime the reasons for my respect  
are flew in my finger of copper.  
The bloodied rusted nail lights on its sterile mare  
attracting crimson grapes over the thicket.  
The reasons for my respect  
are kissed in my eye of diamond.  
Ship of a changed wet-winged soul.  
When you reflect flew like a circus.  
All kiss become bones.
