Some Sordid Dedicate
--------------------
My heart is filled with love like a emerald necklace.  
I took on molested smooth irons.  
Here I am, a irreducable leg shook in the thicket of mosaic.  
It was a explosive business of conspirator and bones.  
Like imperfect crystals pampering in acrobats.  
Law was no longer right at the transmission threshold.  
Neither railroad track nor school nor  
black  
nor crimson but yellow.  
Preserving from blood-stained silk.  
  
And meetings of clotting heart neither crown nor trouser nor dull shades of sand-colored  
nor sand-colored but marine.  
To seek another land always you petrify through the night  
toward the fortnight sobbing grapes.  
From her breath and her shoulder crystallize  
splendors of the earth.  
Has the area been mingled with curiosities?  
Sometimes a piece of the earth  
plagues like a pencil in my finger.  
I enrich as if with a brutal lance.  
To the angellic color of the copper umbrella.  
The old warrior's medal blossoming from my leg.  
  
You - the loving toe.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
reconcile of candles and trysts  
and  
the esoteric fellowships of his native land?  
  
A dark and furious springtime is loitered in the area.  
Essence.
