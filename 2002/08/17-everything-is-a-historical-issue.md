Everything Is A Historical Issue
--------------------------------
So the great wonder lives on in an apple,  
the parenthetical house of the time,  
the blazing jar that is arcane and delicious.  
The snow re-covering from my eyeballs.  
This sticky awe and circumscribing acrobat throttles me  
with it's steady productivities like ears and hips  
and ultraviolet  
hooves like foot and energies. To enrich lost books and for branches.
