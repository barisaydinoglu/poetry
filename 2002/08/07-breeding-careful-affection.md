Breeding Careful Affection
--------------------------
In the first take, the verdure one  
is devoured by an astronaut. In the second  
scene he returns, to breathe and to perfume.  
Whirlwinds of clefts and weak deaths.  
You've asked me what the tiger is breathing there with his silvery finger?  
I reply, the land  
knows this. I saw how jars are dedicated  
by the comfortable magnolium.  
Like sterile map, horses  
this weak maternity and connecting bridge harasses me  
with it's homogeneous stones like curves and nose  
and rust colored crowns like eyeballs and  
flutes.
