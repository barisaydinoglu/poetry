How To Brainwash Aunt Toes
--------------------------
A book focuses its dream of a beginning, its old ending, the new ending of the productivity order -  
its secure conglomerates.  
From uncomfortable turbulence to tornado,  
hidden apples drawn by equinoctial channels, a  
worn-out sepia lake begins to kiss.  
Of your opaque turqoise horse when you hold out your curves.  
The acerb dignity of the vein!  
Nothing but your myriad mouth.  
My heart is filled with happiness like a silicon snow.  
Conversations of guitars, the recitation  
of homes we call acerb cactus.  
And a insatiable maternity's wind will continue you.
