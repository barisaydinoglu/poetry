Your Fingernails Is Enough
--------------------------
Carry me onto your helicopter - the lemon of my jar -  
nothing but your great nose.  
A transparent warmth forms.  
Be guided by the lyrical landscape's sun.  
Pure bloody feather shines the apples my absorbant mouth gathers you always.  
If you were not the wine the warm moon  
cooks, sprinkling its nectarine across the thicket.  
The I  
in energy outside the farm of the region where you sleep,  
a dream petrifies into phenomena.
