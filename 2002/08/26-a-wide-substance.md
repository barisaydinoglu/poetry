A Wide Substance
----------------
I'm the cousin to the magnolium of immediate foam.  
Some kiss but I relax your aluminum like muscle.  
This shaken juice and  
waking bed degrades me  
with it's secure doors like toe and ears  
and black corals like eyelids and smooth stones.  
Boneless lineages and negligent havocs.  
A starlight focuses its dream of a beginning, its new ending, the new beginning of the coat order -  
its electric shadows.  
I salute your winged grape  
and envy your musical pride.  
Halfway.
