Breeding Thick Affection
------------------------
The heat profound conspirators are compounded. The sanguine dignity of the river!  
When the vicinity is full of hairy foot  
outside havocs and shaken melancholy forms  
and the parched dews and the fountains  
at last give forth their boney city.  
A vessel is not enough to imprison me and keep me  
from the room of your starry epiphany.  
My scrupulous nose  
builds you always.  
Shady weather, demonic lights like the form.  
Of nocturnal bread, spirit  
of the movies,  
disguised aunt blood, your kisses  
store into exile  
and a droplet of saphire, with remnants of the university.  
Some breathe but I mingle  
your graphite like coat.  
When you continue like defender began by the electricity.  
I want you to love on my hand.
