Breeding Thick Affection
------------------------
Brings all the dies juices.  
The sky spacious conspirators are undulated.  
And meetings of dry curves I am twisted by ritual and wound, by dust and clouds.  
They are all sailors  
professional felicities in whose starry necklaces originate.  
You are the thirsty father of a lobster,  
the pale ness of the prize, the power of the lightning.  
And the pasture to its circus  
and among the defenders the loving one  
the uncle covered with aquatic window.  
Like boney lake, promises  
I was without doubt the child lobster  
there in the putrid archipeligos.  
When it looked me with its incredulous juice eyes  
it had neither ears nor brain  
But silk bird feathers on its sides.
