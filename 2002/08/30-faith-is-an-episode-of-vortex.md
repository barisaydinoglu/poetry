Faith Is An Episode Of Vortex
-----------------------------
In the face of so many stenches to positivity.  
Returned and then began in the night.  
A current of irreducable ripple  
that does not know why it flows and imbues.  
Respect is gone, the subject has reflected.  
Wave of wave of starlights rolling down the sea. And so that its stenches will brainwash your ears.  
The sun entangles, the droplet of cosmic  
enriches in.
