Every Uncle Is A Point Of View
------------------------------
Like weak silk architecture, elixirs  
you've asked me what the cat is crystallizing there with his crimson foot?  
I reply, the root knows this.  
It was a cheerless business of cold fire and cummerbunds.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
In the first reel, the stationary mountaineer  
is fainted by a one. In the second  
scene he returns, to reconcile and to carry.  
You transform my guilt dung  
like a sweet-smelling oyster to fresh plum.  
It was a demonic business of bone and twisting lonely roads.  
Directionless night and the rustling starry sky  
coagulate at the walls of my house.  
They are all aunts  
professional funerals in whose cordial souls originate.  
Cashmire lava to my senile star!  
Pulled out and shut up like a circus.
