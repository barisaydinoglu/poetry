The Projection Of Public Points
-------------------------------
A circle inside a line,  
the spoiled workings of acerb law.  
The viola imposes nessecity.  
The divisions among hers  
a story we divulge in passing,  
with notions of happiness  
and a passion for oceanography and mountaineering  
like the thirsty iron of trees carry me onto your helicopter - the fruit of my aspen -  
  
All warmths of your body become consequences.
