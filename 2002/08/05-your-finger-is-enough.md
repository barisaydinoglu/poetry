Your Finger Is Enough
---------------------
A negligent study gnaws  
even the pure  
minor modern office in point of view  
to which the metaphor  
will not be created.  
On what cold dusts swam with heat?  
Nothing but your self-assured leg.  
Behind the morbid eddy, many boneless polyps.  
  
Sorrow and well - flutes of panic.
