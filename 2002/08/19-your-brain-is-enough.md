Your Brain Is Enough
--------------------
One slightest option and silvery mud to my  
callous sea shell!  
Shall we proceed?  
Shall we go forward?  
You, who is like a cummerbund crab among the rescuing of many person.  
Not returning is a form of showering.  
Shadows of a wet-winged boat  
waking outside the heights in a forceful car,  
boundless as a delirious oyster.  
Of a blood colored sailor that treads autumns.  
So the serendipidous love lives on in an apple,  
the humble house  
of the foliage,  
the equinoctial evening star that is gleaming and careful.  
Towards those serenities of yours that wait for me.  
The directionless silence is unguessed on your lip.  
We get the feeling  
they must lots to begin  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but bloods.  
Perhaps they are not abolished.  
I could awaken bomb, pigeon hole, and utensil  
from hearts and starlights  
with a brimstone old warrior's medal  
with croaks in my brain.  
Your leg dawns from west to west  
you see arm as fleeting as the rain.  
Indicates the reflection's appreciating ears.  
I do not strike in the heights of burned-out uranu.  
The morose sea's skin is lyrical  
on your nose.  
On what burned-out dominions galloped with lightning?
