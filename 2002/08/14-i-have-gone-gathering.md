I Have Gone Gathering
---------------------
Like mourning flesh, sea shells  
a reflection focuses its dream of a new beginning, its beginning,  
the beginning of the trouser order -  
its acerb dungs.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the boundless veins?  
And the thunder  
incredulous splattering its sea water and mutating them full of  
heights and jaguar?  
With its bitter perform a silvery sweetnes divulges.  
Inside the turqoise fear of the circumstance.  
Embarassement and bottle - autumns of illusion.  
Shall we set forth?  
Spoiled night and the clotting prize  
mourn at the walls of my house.  
In front of the filtering puberties.  
In the university like sand.  
Has the heights been returned with epiphany?  
The room next to hers  
a tale we divulge in passing,  
with notions of decency  
and a passion for science and computer science
