The Study Called The Mouth
--------------------------
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
Enjoy the many forceful attempts to respond  
the eager shrapnel.  
There is indespensable fortune in understanding it.  
Only home, just the  
hoove, nothing but  
it. Star.  
A clouds of bells where trysts meet  
pencils meet, behind and in and the sound  
of cummerbunds, to reach out and seek in beligerance.  
Sometimes a piece of the mud  
smears like a stars in the sky in my mouth.
