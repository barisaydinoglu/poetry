A Ivory Within Silk
-------------------
It is a tale of banal violas pure lonely road relaxes the femininities I want you to breathe on my fingernails. You relax my fuming abys  
like a great oyster to fresh plum.  
Not re-covering is a form of breathing.  
Sailor of the depths of my shoulder - your swimming  
stills your original regard as though it were sky.  
From her arm and her eye understand  
waves of the earth.  
Your time is a pencil filled with sordid door.  
In my field at sunset you are like a sea water  
and your form and colour the way I build them.  
  
From blade of grass to palm tree leaf,  
hidden planetariums drawn by infinite channels, a  
crooked warmth begins to breathe.  
And you flutter like a coral and a loaf of bread baked with raucous wonder and salt.  
I am buried by lemon and martyr, by vagabond and rain.
