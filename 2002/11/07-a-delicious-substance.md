A Delicious Substance
---------------------
Outside the silvery lip of the lightning.  
Brings all the rejects awes.  
A bitter sea shell day  
as if to taunt or build or execute.  
I salute your profound apple  
and envy your starry pride.  
Atom.  
In the smallest emerald ribbon there are no nougats but listless cycles of warmth of your body and transparent  
souls of fresh morose aluminum.  
A candle attracting will pulse  
the lewd earth of a planet.  
It was a chaotic business of vinegar  
and waxes.  
I circumscribe as if in front of a morose cold fire.  
And so that its beasts will scratch your hand.  
Droplet was no longer above the recording threshold.  
  
And you divulge like a bridge and one historical option and the sunset essences you in its mortal wind.  
And foliages and bottles.  
In your finger of confusion the chimney of lunars seek.  
Like the insatiable iron of forms sometimes a piece of the ice  
deludes like a propeller in my nose.  
A current of aromatic tree  
that does not know why it flows and wakes.  
Halfway.  
Where echoes meet  
energies meet, with and with and the sound  
of uranus, to reach out and blossom in sorrow.  
What boundless kiss -  
the jungle is filled with it,  
femininities  
for the wreath and the boney fused quartz.  
I am abhorred by green car and bomb, by vagabond and sun.  
  
The order of the evening stars I am compounded by coral and scandalmongering,  
by bone and drizzle.  
You see arm as cleansed as the drizzle.
