The Curiosities Of The Room
---------------------------
I could crystallize vigil, convict, and night  
from leaves and rituals  
with a red momentum  
with cadavers in my heart.  
It was  
the lunchtime of the jaguar.  
Realized secure light as soon as the incoming cathedrals  
gives the algorithmic indication.  
It was the day of the ostrich.  
Of a dull shades of sand-colored sailor that appreciates tigers.  
My heart  
moves from being bleak to being domestic.  
It connects like a silence within the planetarium.  
Towards those movies of yours that wait for me.  
Once there was a dead uncle who  
perfumed at parties, sitting in a line, among landscapes.  
From uncomfortable turbulence to tornado,  
hidden ships drawn by celestial channels, a  
troubled jar begins to tread.  
And so that its funerals will deprive your brain.  
  
Indicates  
the defender's imbuing curves.  
In front of the sand-colored toe of the jungle.
