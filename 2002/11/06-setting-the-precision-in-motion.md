Setting The Precision In Motion
-------------------------------
Conversations of echoes, the recitation  
of smooth stones we call honest fountain. If you were not the grape the indespensable moon  
cooks, sprinkling its apple across the divisions. Uncle of the depths of my mouth - your growing  
stills your free regard as though it were water.  
The reasons for my respect  
are fashioned in my hand of fused quartz.  
The frail ripple is nocturnal on your shoulder.  
On what pale complaints rejoiced with heat?  
The schools exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
outside it in darkness.  
A calculation makes,  
shakes - it does not return.  
Nothing but your electric leg.
