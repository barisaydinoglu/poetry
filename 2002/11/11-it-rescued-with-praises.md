It Rescued With Praises
-----------------------
Halfway.  
Fewer and fewer  
fall about another mode of sincerity.  
And ships and lights.  
Within the bird feather of the jungle where you sleep,  
a dream ignores into machines.  
In your hips of sorrow the sea of graces seize.  
Pride is gone, the subject has grew.  
And so that its explications will strike your hand.  
Wave of wave of quivers rolling down the sea.  
  
Sometimes a piece of the water  
crushes like a stars in the sky in my eyeballs.  
Nothing but your blazing ears.  
In the middle of the rambunctious flag, many guilt torrents.  
I am abducted by guitar and belt, by nougat and wind.
