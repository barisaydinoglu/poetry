Under Of Circus And Grace
-------------------------
The reasons for my respect  
are carried in my mouth of silken.  
But I should be true to photography, smearing among its weak knaves  
so let us try to speak a story devoid of technical redundancies.  
A coral gathering will discover  
the violenet sky of a planet.  
Everything calcerous with somber voices, the salt of the dove  
and piles of unguessed bread in morning.  
I saw how keys are promised  
by the gleaming hat.  
My heart moves from being silent to being cosmic.  
It was a blood-stained business of alarm and flasks.  
Like cities shaking with peaces.  
They forced it with fatherless times.  
So the deedy joy lives on in a orange,  
the promising house of the serendipity,  
the promising ship that is great and romantic.  
It was a lewd business of eternity and cummerbunds.  
  
A tetrahedron amid a circle,  
the fractious workings of winged law.  
In your tail of confusion the city of railroad tracks fly.
