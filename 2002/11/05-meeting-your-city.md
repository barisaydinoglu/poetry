Meeting Your City
-----------------
Return to the homeland of the roses.  
In the first take, the real cousin  
is loathed by a daughter. In the second  
scene he returns, to set and to perform.  
The bleak drop is hidden on your shoulder.  
Purity is gone, the subject has swam.  
From her arm and her mouth expand  
ships of the earth.  
A sea's skin focuses its dream of a ending, its beginning, the old ending of the faucet order -  
its poetic hounds.  
Crimson and human sailor,  
Brings all the chains schools.  
Always you undulate through the night  
toward the afternoon compounding bells.  
A airplane is not enough to deform me and keep me  
from the vicinity of your acerb epiphany.  
  
The root knows this,  
that life in it's marble boxes is as endless as the foliage.  
Kill me and let my substance dedicate.
