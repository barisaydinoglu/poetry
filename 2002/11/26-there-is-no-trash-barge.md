There Is No Trash Barge
-----------------------
What cordial lands -  
the boulevard is filled with it,  
bridges for the friendship and the lewd saphire.  
The sweetnes expanding from my nose.  
I could conduct seperation, dung, and scandalmongering  
from deep brown cars and banners  
with a gray angel  
with holes in my fingernails.  
We open the halves of a curiosities and the  
ignoring of jackals swims into the handsome sea.  
Frail twilight and the melancholy trouser  
plague at the walls of my house.
