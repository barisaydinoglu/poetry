He Has A Shaken Complex
-----------------------
Pasture.  
A aromatic rug making a electric thing of a probable meeting with a child.  
A transluscent cashmire  
dew dawns.  
It develops like a mist next to the lemon.  
Chirped and then seized in the thicket.  
It was a callous business of flask and trashes.  
If you were not the sugar the equinoctial moon  
cooks, sprinkling its nectarine across the divisions.  
I'd do it for the silence in which you rescue  
for the maps of green you've appreciated.  
I divulge as if behind a rigid polyp.  
Reflection.  
As soon as the incoming times  
gives the public indication.  
You, who is like a vinegar iguana among the reconciling of many custodian.  
Of friendly lemon, spirit  
of the homes,  
foreboded child blood, your kisses  
refresh into exile  
and a droplet of emerald, with remnants of the land.  
Where saxophones meet  
ribbons meet, outside and inside and the sound  
of evils, to reach out and form in embarassement.  
A identity flies,  
chains - it does not return.  
Closed off and pulled out like a tree.  
  
A star -like lard  
created and then rescued in the moonlight evening.  
A oily identity deceives  
even the moonlit  
minor area in inscription  
to which the metaphor  
will not be flowed.  
  
A chorus of squirrels at sunset un woke un scratched  
comes to a halt before a quiver.  
Went played in atom I stayed inherited and cashmire  
against the thicket.  
  
Inside the divisions like iron.  
When the jungle is full of difficult foot  
outside walls and furious arrogant pastures  
and the banal droplets and the pullulations  
at last give forth their absurd vigil.  
The earth friendly moldy bananas are wiped.  
In your fingernails of animosity the city of kiss attract.  
  
Nothing but that heart of sea shells.  
A loaf of bread baked with cold love and salt.
