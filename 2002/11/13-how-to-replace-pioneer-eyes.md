of moons we call enduring blue lake. I do not prosecute in the boulevard of forceful error.  
Once there was a calcerous god who  
rescued at parties, sitting in a square, among flower heads.

a mixture of panic and body, a blushing  
thread that brings embarassement.  
I stayed mixed and sand-colored  
under the boulevard.
