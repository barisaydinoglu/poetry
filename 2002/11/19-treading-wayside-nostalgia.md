Treading Wayside Nostalgia
--------------------------
Distorted weather, phosphorus lights like the circus. Noone here is waiting for the next angel.  
Lunar. You protected yourself for connecting.  
It's a fashioning femininity of jackals.  
To seek another land the pencil plan  
that has everyone exiled.  
Of your turqoise hat when you hold out your lip.  
I saw how affections are showered  
by the honest shades of yellow.  
You - the full hand.  
  
Appreciated and then showered in the night.  
Wave of wave of pencils rolling down the sea.  
  
An odor has wove inside the vein,  
a mixture of cadaver and body, an attracting  
serenity that brings fear.  
Like the ghostly clay of pencils the sticky curtain is round on your ears.  
Here I am, a indespensable finger punctured in the vicinity of coral.  
A current of cordial  
sea shell  
that does not know why it flows and loves.  
The insatiable coral is winged on your finger.  
A sea's skin awakening will entertain  
the hairy mud of a planet.  
  
Multitude of curtains!  
In and out of the cashmire the opaque sunburst orange and the silvery  
to the plumed hidden kiss and the productivity to its sea's skin  
and among the love the enchanting one  
the elder covered with fluidic alcove.
