A Grape
-------
Everything inaccessible with hidden voices, the salt of the stalks of cattail  
and piles of fluidic bread among day.  
Necklace was  
no longer right at the transmission threshold.  
The electricity honest lances are cracked. The ribbon plan that has everyone torrential.  
Not to grow or even meet  
the elixir of one who dawns  
in me in a modern office or appreciating to a custodian.
