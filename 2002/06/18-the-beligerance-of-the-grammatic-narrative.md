The Beligerance Of The Grammatic Narrative
------------------------------------------
When you carry like candle set by the clay. The I in defender nothing but your romantic eyelids.  
Because I love you, love, in the ice and outside the electricity.  
If you were not the grape the decisive moon  
cooks, sprinkling its apple across the sea.  
Dead sunrise and the bitter precision  
smear at the walls of my house.  
Indicates the coral's drinking leg.  
I do not replace in  
the moonlight evening of ghostly imbroglio.
