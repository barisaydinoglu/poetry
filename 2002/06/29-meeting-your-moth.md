Meeting Your Moth
-----------------
Has the night been pulsed  
with phenomena?  
Some mingle but I gather your steel like bird feather.  
You've asked me what the toucan is understanding there with his cinnamon leg?  
I reply, the pasture knows this.  
For a day, maybe three hundred,  
I rested under a tornado  
at a bus stop, waiting for the person to be inside.  
  
Connecting the miracle of her light full of joy.  
A sweet-smelling sunshine of breakfasts.
