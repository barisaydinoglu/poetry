Feeling Is An Episode Of Viola
------------------------------
The affluent astronaut  
magnifies in the spacious morning.  
I took on troubled waves.  
To seek another land you, who is like a throat  
ostrich among the drinking of many man.  
In front of the shaking beasts.  
Understanding from burned-out saphire. And so that its flames will pity your curves.  
I took on dead hooves.
