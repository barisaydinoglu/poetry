Some Spoiled Divulge
--------------------
A study for signal is the lack thereof.  
Dilute weather, boney lights like the kis.  
Your breakfast is a warmth filled with fuming nature.  
Your hips perches from west to north  
Some promise but I refresh your broken glass like ritual.  
But I should be true to jouranlism, deluding among its dead fountains  
so let us seek to tell a story without technical redundancies.  
Always you twist through the late afternoon  
toward the midnight shaking coats.  
Among the mosaic of the room where you sleep,  
a dream lunges into machines.  
Full stop.

Sand-colored and ancient uncle,
