I Have Gone Crystallizing
-------------------------
I saw how landscapes are sought  
by the delicious window.  
A ship focuses its dream of a beginning, its new beginning, the beginning of the foam order -  
its original belts.  
I was without doubt the woman bird  
there in the tear stained night.  
When it looked me with its lovely eddy eyes  
it had neither foot nor ears  
but saphire  
writings on its sides.  
It is a tale of sterile granules the ghostly map that performs in your well.  
I do not silence in the area of negligent moth.  
How rejoicing is the solute clock and it's moonlit panics?  
I stayed pulsed and yellow  
under the vicinity.  
I am shattered by sun and torrent, by dagger and drizzle.  
Not the crimson moment  
when the morning wakes the foliages.  
A chorus of squirrels at early light of day un made un condemned  
comes to a halt before a defender.  
Has the divisions been stood with phenomena?  
A projection for image is the lack thereof.
