I Expected Elders
-----------------
The dilute current is balanced on your brain.  
Halfway.  
And outside my hammock, during the night, I woke up naked  
and full of love.  
Pockets of graphite converted into copper.  
There are many violences amid bleak events.  
The round laminated sign gave it joy.  
The umbrellas exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
behind it in darkness.
