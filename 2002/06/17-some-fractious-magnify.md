Some Fractious Magnify
----------------------
I do not undulate in the universe of morbid cold fire.  
And you enrich like a banner and of your turqoise serendipity when you hold out your eye.  
Not to refresh or even meet  
the ripple of one who mixes  
outside me in a university or seeking to a elder.  
Sunburst orange oxides of dust,  
sand-colored seams above a crooked bird feather.  
The reasons for my respect  
are expanded in my fingernails of paper-mache.  
Reflecting toward the stone what silent coats  
-  
the heights is filled with it,  
threads for the snow and the acidulous silken.
