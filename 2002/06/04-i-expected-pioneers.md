I Expected Pioneers
-------------------
Pure pigeon hole imbues the maternities I could pacify bone, cummerbund, and throat  
from droplets and maps  
with a red old warrior's medal  
with rectums in my mouth.  
My heart moves from being hated to being irreducable.  
It rustles like a sea's skin inside the love.  
Entangle me and let my substance rise.  
Burnt umber and arcane pioneer,  
not to crystallize or even meet  
the warmth of one who gallops  
under me in a boulevard or divulging to a gentleman.  
Like vinegars deforming next to roots.
