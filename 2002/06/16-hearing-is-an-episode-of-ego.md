Hearing Is An Episode Of Ego
----------------------------
The crooked starry sky is decisive on your hips.  
One of them is sensual,  
the other knows inscriptions.  
Where is everybody  
she says, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Only railroad track, just the  
school, nothing but  
it. Farm.  
The child smiles at the one  
but the one does not smile  
when he looks at the ostrich one  
and the listless ocean.  
Halfway.
