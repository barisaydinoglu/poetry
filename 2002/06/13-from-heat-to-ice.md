From Heat To Ice
----------------
A ultraviolet and rustling book  
is invaded in the region.  
Neither starlight nor  
sun nor rust colored  
nor green but sepia.  
Of a gray child that reconciles fellowships.  
Has the boulevard been circumscribed with curiosities?  
You tread slowly into a night to blossom your business.  
You flow in the field as in a dashing chimney.  
Nothing but your gleaming lip.
