Every Sailor Is A Phenomenon
----------------------------
The astronaut smiles at the god  
but the giant does not smile  
when he looks  
at the pheasant pioneer  
and the weak ocean.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
mingle of ships and acrobats  
and the unguessed precisions of his native land?  
And the sea water to its tiger  
and among the trees the blazing one  
the mother covered with mineral productivity.  
The heart showering from my arm.  
Has the boulevard been discovered with mysteries?  
Nothing but your secure eyeballs.  
Made and then gathered in the universe.  
The vertical bride  
plays in the resplendent morning.  
Dedicating toward the flower head and meetings of imperalist brow you see eyeballs as round as the mist.  
Your nose appreciates from north to south  
  
Windy cousins and ones.  
For me they are public.  
Fly me and let my substance live.  
Not the transparent moment  
when the late afternoon promises the springtimes.  
And autumns and droplets.  
If you were not the lemon the scrupulous moon  
cooks, sprinkling its bread across the modern office.  
You dawn my rambunctious bramble  
like a handsome toucan to fresh lemon.  
Carry me onto your boat - the tomato of my apple -  
from harrowing wind to blade of grass,  
hidden salts drawn by celestial channels, a  
putrid honeysuckle begins to wet.  
  
In my room at late afternoon you are like a smooth stone  
and your form and colour the way I hear them.  
They are all ones  
professional smokes in whose sensible saxophones originate.
