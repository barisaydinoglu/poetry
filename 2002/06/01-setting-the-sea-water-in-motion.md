Setting The Sea Water In Motion
-------------------------------
Abolish me and let my substance rise.  
The profound dignity  
of the mirror!  
Of your brimstone flower when you hold out your lip. Seizing a maternity  
Preserved in the delicate sun.  
Pure belt understands the smooth stones dawning the lunar of her bridge full of pride.  
You see eyeballs as handsome as the wind.  
Your eye flies from north to north  
It  
was a fuming business of grave and invasions.  
With the transparent mouth of the lightning.  
As soon as the incoming windows  
gives the neutral indication.
