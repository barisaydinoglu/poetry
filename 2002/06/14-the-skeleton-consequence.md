The Skeleton Consequence
------------------------
It was the fortnight of the bird.  
Conversations of serenities, the recitation  
of beds we call sanguine tiger.  
And meetings of blood-stained lip my  
heart moves from being shifty to being changeless.  
  
It  
was the holiday of the ostrich.
