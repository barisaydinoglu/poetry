Bloods About The Image He Inherited
-----------------------------------
In your leg of faltering the archipeligos begins to dream of rescuing. Kissed and then awakened in the boulevard.  
The decisive prize gave it purity.  
  
This tenacious ribbon and reflecting root compounds me  
with it's sensible tigers like eyelids and ears  
and dark movies like breath and river banks.  
And meetings of tenacious shoulder responding a old warrior's medal  
set in the acerb fog.
