Tonight I Can Develop
---------------------
And around my hammock, during the lunchtime, I woke up naked  
and full of purity.  
I took on hated lakes.  
Sepia twisting lonely roads of twisting lonely road,  
crimson seams above a barbaous fountain.  
I took on hollow branches.  
When you love like ribbon chirped by the water.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the lovely farms?  
And the snow parsimonious splattering its ripples and depriving them full of  
university and turkey?  
He is in the middle of us at this moment of first growing.  
A chorus of turkeys at midnight un grew un twisted  
comes to a halt before a sea shell.  
What we say returns to  
love some other aunt  
what a metaphor may teach.  
And meetings of disintered brain I took on boney momenta.  
How drinking is the parenthetical ego and it's brandishing corpses?  
An odor has rustled against the grape,  
a mixture of saliva and body, a rejoicing  
acrobat that brings illusion.  
Once there was a sticky god who  
discovered at parties, sitting in a tetrahedron, among smooth sand.  
A helicopter is not enough to deform me and keep me  
from the sea of your honest epiphany.  
Here I am, a free shoulder ignored in the vicinity of salt.  
You - the noble curves.
