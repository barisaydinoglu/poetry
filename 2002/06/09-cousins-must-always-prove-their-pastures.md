Cousins Must Always Prove Their Pastures
----------------------------------------
A language stands,  
disguises - it does  
not return.  
Once there was a rustling mountaineer who  
heard at parties, sitting in a square, among natures.  
In the middle of the rustling sweetnes, many sifted vortices.  
Which is a changeless femininity of directions  
too many to count or too many to count, flowed  
on a faucet or in the eloquent trouser  
directions of the leg, a calculation in your hearts.  
It's a exciting book of egoes.  
This tear stained maternity and hearing vein protests me  
with it's sensual wine bottles like tail and foot  
and gray books like brow and jars.
