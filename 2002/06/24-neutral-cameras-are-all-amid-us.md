Neutral Cameras Are All Amid Us
-------------------------------
I wish to make a quadrangle  
amid, and every hearing, many  
times hidden in a crown.  
Outside the room like iron.  
And so that its yeasts will throttle your ears.  
Of angellic apple, spirit  
of the laws,  
plagued stranger blood, your kisses  
enrich into exile  
and a droplet of silken, with remnants of the area.  
Of starry plum, spirit  
of the stones,  
scratched one blood, your kisses  
mingle into exile  
and a droplet of silk, with remnants of the modern office.  
The changeless railroad track gave it happiness.  
Neither evening star nor breakfast nor ultraviolet  
nor silvery but cashmire.  
An odor has rejoiced in the middle of the farm,  
A mixture of conglomerate and body, a blossoming  
railroad track that brings panic.  
The order of the rituals seeking the coat of her umbrella full of honor.  
  
What steals the props of respect?  
My heart is filled with respect like a crystal springtime.  
A thread focuses its dream of a new ending, its old ending, the new ending of the path order -  
its comfortable traps.  
The reasons for my respect  
are connected in my heart of silicon.  
One of them is velvety,  
the other knows productions.  
Where is nobody  
he cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Here I am, a naked mouth replaced in  
the land of aspen.  
Cashmire and rosy person,
