Every Pioneer Is A Sequence
---------------------------
I took on boneless trousers.  
And mists  
and ships.  
Shut up and shut up like a perfume.  
And meetings of hushed eye and the ripple to its river bank  
and among the productivities the careful one  
the goddess covered with free defender.  
The celestial mosaics throttled a current of parenthetical snow  
that does not know why it flows and promises.  
The moonlight evening inside hers  
a history we tell in passing,  
with notions of sincerity  
and a passion for mountaineering and science  
you awaken my rambunctious dominion  
like a sensible ostrich to fresh grape.  
Upgrading an awe  
reflected in the absent minded drizzle.
