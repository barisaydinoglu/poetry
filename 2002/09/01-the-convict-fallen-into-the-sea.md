The Convict Fallen Into The Sea
-------------------------------
Always you deform through the day  
toward the holiday harassing utensils. Wave of wave of foliages rolling down the sea. Draw from it the forceful  
production of its own camera.  
Everything bitter with original voices, the salt of the sun rise  
and piles of smooth bread outside fortnight.
