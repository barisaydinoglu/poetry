From What Are Cactuss Trod
--------------------------
Where laminated signs meet  
doves meet, in and inside and the sound  
of massacres, to reach out and hear in sorrow.  
I was without doubt the person crab  
there in the bitten modern office.  
When it looked me with its cleansed bird feather eyes  
it had neither lip nor shoulder  
but gem moons on its sides.  
The time magnifying from my tail.  
Come with me to the polyp of complaints.  
A tree -like seperation  
what is this antenna but a memory bristled of its utensils?  
I saw how wheatfields are crystallized  
by the myriad kiss.  
When the jungle is full of misunderstood foot  
inside pamphlets and clenched wayside trousers  
and the barbaous roses and the schools  
at last give forth their inevitable pin.  
A cheerless point of view attacks  
even the fresh  
grammatic field in synonym  
to which the metaphor  
will not be refreshed.  
So the changeless wonder lives on in a orange,  
the mineral house of the sea water,  
The starry stars in the sky that is careful and hidden.  
Realized delicious telegraph what seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
Behind the lashed peace, many communist waxes.
