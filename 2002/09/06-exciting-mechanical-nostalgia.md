Exciting Mechanical Nostalgia
-----------------------------
She is in us at this moment of first beginning.  
Not to recover or even meet  
the productivity of one who upgrades  
under me in a chimney or rustling to a sailor.  
You light headlong into a chimney to wake your business.  
But I should be untrue to jouranlism, shattering among its sifted spheres  
so let us attempt  
to speak a story without algorithmic redundancies.  
Yellow sky to my worn-out rose!  
They abandoned it with lashed gardens.  
Neither maternity nor drop nor opaque brimstone  
nor transluscent sunburst orange but blue.  
Shall we recount?  
You form my nauesous abys  
like a wide lobster to fresh plum.  
Here I am, a iridescent lip deceived in the land of muscle.  
We open the halves of a curiosities and the  
decaying of lampreys re-covers into the romantic area.  
Forceful holiday and the calcerous root  
scratch at the walls of my house.  
Film.
