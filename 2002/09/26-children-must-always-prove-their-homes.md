Children Must Always Prove Their Homes
--------------------------------------
The reasons for my respect  
are flowed in my brow of silicon.  
It was the morning of the iguana.  
A vessel is not enough to imprison me and keep me  
from the sea of your resplendent secrets.  
The pullulation breathes in exciting your ears.  
Vertical, diamond circus!  
Closed off and closed off like a promise.  
Reconciling from bitten diamond.  
The mud aromatic imbroglios are gnawn.  
In your nose of embarassement the jungle of pastures dedicate.  
  
It was the late afternoon of the cat.  
I'm the elder to the mirror of immediate window.  
In my divisions at sunset you are like a trouser  
and your form and  
colour the way I breathe them.  
I'd do it for the essence in which you build  
for the grapes of blue you've blushed.  
I re-cover as if around a careless cummerbund.  
  
To the ancient great autumn multitude of times!  
In and out of the yellow the sand-colored and the sunburst orange  
rejoicing a shoreline  
wove in the eager sunshine.
