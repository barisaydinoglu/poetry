Setting The Flag In Motion
--------------------------
Of dashing sugar, spirit  
of the leaves,  
dropped aunt blood, your kisses  
form into exile  
and a droplet of diamond, with remnants of the chimney.  
This nauesous form and attracting quilt abolishes me  
with it's sanguine river banks like fingernails and lip  
and dull shades of sunburst orange faucets like brain and wheatfields.  
I saw how friendships are preserved  
by the lion hearted school.  
Around the window of the universe where you sleep,  
a dream throttles into calculations.  
Man of the depths of my hand - your recovering  
stills your human regard as though it were mud.
