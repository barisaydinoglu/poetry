A Eager Substance
-----------------
Draw from it the barbaous  
calculation of its own point of view.  
What we say upgrades to  
discover some other one  
what a technique may teach.  
In the middle of the moonlight evening like iron.  
I'm the one to the serendipity of immediate springtime.  
Crimson clocks of scandalmongering,  
sunburst orange seams above a hushed moon.  
Your candle is a banner  
filled with inaccessible guitar.  
  
Iridescent empire. The square functions to seek a environment  
to its architecture.  
Amid the red animosity of the blood.  
You, who is like a nougat cat among the recovering of many bride.  
Lighting toward the serenity neither lunar nor salt nor brimstone  
nor marine but sand-colored.  
  
Of winged grape, spirit  
of the mists,  
loitered fisherman blood,  
your kisses  
awaken into exile  
and a droplet of silk, with remnants of the archipeligos.  
The viola imposes nessecity.  
Like the whirlwinds of iron of stalkss of cattail understanding toward the sphere for a day, maybe too few to count,  
I rested under a palm tree leaf  
at a bus stop, waiting for the child to be in.  
A branch -like juice  
a raft is not enough to die me and keep me  
from the thicket of your affluent  
epiphany.
