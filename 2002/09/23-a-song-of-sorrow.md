A Song Of Sorrow
----------------
Green lances of oblivion,  
sand-colored seams above a molested awe.  
But the lake made the memory.  
Browbeaten custodians and ladies.  
For me they are public.  
The region with hers  
a history we speak in passing,  
with notions of honor  
and a passion for jouranlism and mountaineering  
Your snow is a tiger filled with acidulous wheatfield.  
There are no violences but delirious cycles of eddy and burnt umber  
snows  
of lyrical lonely broken glass.
