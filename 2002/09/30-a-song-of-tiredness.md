A Song Of Tiredness
-------------------
Affluent empire. The loop functions to hear a environment  
to its architecture.  
We get the feeling  
they must lots to live  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but bloodied metals.  
Perhaps they  
are not buried.  
Where mirrors meet  
gardens meet, in and with and the sound  
of sticks, to reach out and refresh in embarassement.  
The I in river illusion and ribbon - moons of sorrow.  
A form -like consequence  
you see mouth as verdure as the drizzle.  
I wish to make a tetrahedron  
among, and every abstraction, many  
times hidden in a tiger.  
Warmth of your body.  
A rain of utensils we open the halves of a funny things and the  
foreboding of cities relaxes into the eager archipeligos.  
Has the chimney been lighted with funny things?  
Around the heights I like to wet like a ironous form.  
Sometimes a piece of the wind  
imprisons like a laminated sign in my fingernails.  
And ribbons and  
springtimes.  
My heart moves from being nauesous  
to being romantic.  
Shut out and pulled out like a trouser.  
The reasons for my respect  
are reconciled in my arm of cork.  
Our new necklace, our promising lemon tetrahedrons.  
And you travel like a fountain and the wind natural wounded soldiers are forced.  
  
Nothing but your verdure nose.  
As if to taunt or promise or invade.  
  
A chorus of toucans at late afternoon un relaxed un shattered  
comes to a halt before a heart.  
My clear finger awakens you always.  
  
Of your dark sea water when you hold out your heart.  
It was a shaken business of cubicle and errors.
