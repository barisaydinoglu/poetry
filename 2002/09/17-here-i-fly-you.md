Here I Fly You
--------------
A grace focuses its dream of a beginning, its ending, the ending of the phemonana order -  
its secure shadows.  
Halfway.  
Has the university been created with mysteries?  
Be guided by the sanguine stalks of cattail's window.  
Some awaken but I perch your salt like form.  
When the sea is full of hushed leg  
in front of juices and windy frightened kiss  
and the troubled warmths and the foliages  
at last give forth their arrogant vagabond.  
Under the bitter region of boney grape.  
You - the vertical curves.  
Like neurotic autumn, awes  
and roses and manes.  
The dry cathedral that dawns in your lighthouse.  
Your mouth continues from east to north  
set and then stored in the universe.  
I'd do it for the aroma in which you crystallize  
for the deep brown cars of deep brown you've set.  
Of resolute apple, spirit  
of the hearts,  
coddled bride blood, your kisses  
protect into exile  
and a droplet of gold, with remnants of the boulevard.  
Morbid early light of day and the dilute faucet  
shatter at the walls of my house.  
  
Realized fresh stalks of cattail the enduring fragrance of strawberry gave it love.  
Not continuing is a form of blossoming.  
  
In my moonlight evening at sunrise you are like a serenity  
and your form and colour the way I refresh them.  
To dawn lost manes and for springtimes.
