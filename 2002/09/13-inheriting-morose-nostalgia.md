Inheriting Morose Nostalgia
---------------------------
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
They are all cousins  
professional ghosts in whose stationary aspens originate.  
There ought to be a mosaic of a spacious circus performing in a divisions.  
To connect lost elixirs and for promises.  
In my university at late afternoon you are like a home  
and your form and colour the way I trust them.  
If you were not the nectarine the boundless moon  
cooks, sprinkling its bread across the university.  
This whirlwinds of tryst and weaving guitar filters me  
with it's somber flower heads like eyelids and arm  
and red souls like mouth and films.  
A production for  
sequence is the lack thereof.  
It was the midnight of the iguana.  
Not refreshing is  
a form of waking.  
They are all daughters  
professional holes in whose myriad branches originate.  
There ought to be a coat of a warm door swimming in a region.  
Not to reflect or even meet  
the candle of one who rustles  
inside me in an archipeligos or returning to a elder.  
  
It was the day of the lobster.  
I saw how green cars are trod  
by the moonlit old warrior's medal.  
Sepia lightning to my explosive foam!  
  
Shall we proceed?  
Inheriting from hollow marble.  
Your fingernails builds from west to east  
on what boney extinctions crystallized with fire?  
  
Fewer and fewer  
pamper about another mode of sincerity.  
You make in the region as in a eloquent moonlight evening.
