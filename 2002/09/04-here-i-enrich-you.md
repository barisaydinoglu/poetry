Here I Enrich You
-----------------
Sometimes a piece of the water  
shatters like a sea water in my nose. We get the sense  
they must lots  
to mix  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but depths.  
Perhaps they  
are not mutated.  
Halfway.  
A current of pure mirror  
that does not  
know why it flows and responds.  
Our new cathedral, our rosy forest squares.  
Multitude of rivers!  
In and out of the green the cinnamon and the cinnamon  
which is a moonlit sun of directions  
million or three hundred, recovered  
on a wine bottle or in the natural map  
directions of the hand, a calculation in your brows.
