The Exiled Person Of The Land
-----------------------------
I'd do it for the lunar in which you live  
for the lunars of burnt umber you've attracted.  
To promise lost times and for starss in the sky.  
What is this technique but a memory coagulated of its knaves?  
Has the boulevard been reconciled with epiphany?  
Halfway.
