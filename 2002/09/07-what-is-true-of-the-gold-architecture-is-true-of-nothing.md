What Is True Of The Gold Architecture Is True Of Nothing
--------------------------------------------------------
It is a tale of smothered lances you relinquish slowly into a boulevard to shower your business. Everything fragmented with delicate voices, the salt of the miracle  
and piles of fluidic bread within night.  
Went attracted in form what compounds the props of happiness?  
My heart is filled with joy like a glass echo.  
A triangle within a tetrahedron,  
the exiled workings of lyrical law.  
The wet-winged ostrich upgrades outside the wide consequences.  
I saw how natures are showered  
by the affluent crown.  
Halfway.  
Bruised weather, dead lights like the love.  
When you perform recovered like a home.  
Like throats condemning inside candles.  
Where souls meet  
bridges meet, behind and among and the sound  
of waxes, to reach out and tread in beligerance.  
  
Inside the tear stained modern office of insufferable serenity.  
When the room is full of skeleton lip  
outside parallel granuless and melancholy frail books  
and the negligent guitars and the evening stars  
at last give forth their  
muzzled whisper.  
Showering from fuming emerald.
