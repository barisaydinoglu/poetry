The Computer Of Technical Points

Set on the depths that wait for you  
taunting the muzzled chairs, fainting the doors. In your hand of imprisoning the region begins to dream of recovering.  
A train is not enough to smear me and keep me  
from the city of your enchanting curiosities.  
  
Wonder is gone, the subject has fashioned.  
Crimson traps of conglomerate,  
deep brown seams above a sterile promise.  
From her curves and her brow flutter  
acrobats of the earth.  
Within the abandoning panics.  
Silvery water to my atrocious burnt umber lake!  
Here I am, a sensual finger bristled in the universe of peace.  
The order of the serendipities there ought to be a mosaic of a careful evening star mixing in an area.
