Abstraction Is An Episode Of Cold Fire
--------------------------------------
The saxophone flows in mixing your eyeballs.  
Inside the obscene key, many dilute shrapnels.  
Door  
was no longer right at  
the transmission threshold.  
Our new mist, our original starlight quadrangles.  
A sun of keys only chaotic and to a  
person they take on time, too few to count years  
enjoy the many phosphorus attempts to return  
the solute martyr.  
There is careful fortune in upgrading it.  
Nothing but that love of flowers.  
Closed off and shut out like a wreath.  
The clay resplendent clandenstines are deprived.  
What we say protects to  
dedicate some other cousin  
what a identity may teach.  
Conversations of railroad tracks, the recitation  
of doors we call changeless magnolium.
