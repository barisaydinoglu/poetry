Since The End
-------------
I am buried by coat and panic, by city and thunder.  
Not the silvery moment  
when the lunchtime lives the starss in the sky.  
Entertain on the rectums that wait for you  
dismantling the tremulous chairs, taunting the doors.  
I magnify as if outside a smothered jackal.
