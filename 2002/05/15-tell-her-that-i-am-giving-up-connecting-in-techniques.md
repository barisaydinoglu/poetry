Tell Her That I Am Giving Up Connecting In Techniques
-----------------------------------------------------
Fewer and fewer  
puncture about another mode of purity.  
I salute your secure bread  
and envy your sensible pride.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
attract of droplets and smooth stones  
and the angellic ribbons of his native land?  
Negligent astronauts and ones.  
For me they are aerial.  
The I in aroma and so that its clandenstines will impale your hand.  
The cactus kisses in circumscribing your eyelids.  
The vertical paths brainwashed the delicate fleshes dropped inside the wheatfield of the modern office where you sleep,  
a dream compounds into signals.  
Not beginning is a form of connecting.  
The candle knows this,  
that life in it's fused quartz boxes is as endless as the trouser.  
Like dilute nature, banners  
an odor has dedicated in the middle of the river,  
a mixture of abberation and body, a reconciling  
dew that brings fear.  
Circumscribing toward the bottle my thick fingernails rustles you always.  
Perching a heart  
fluttered in the boundless clouds.  
A black and rigid productivity is loitered in the area.  
If I could shower the error and the sea.  
Multitude of windows!  
In and out of the blue the blue and the yellow  
it was the night of the pheasant.  
What curiosities does the iguana contain?  
How little we swim and how much it understands the epiphany of this galaxy.  
Not to tread or even meet  
the branch of one who rejoices  
in me in a sea or magnifying to a woman.  
  
It was the sunrise of the cat.
