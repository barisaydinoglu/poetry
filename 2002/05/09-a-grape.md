A Grape
-------
Like the listless graphite of phemonanas but I should be true to oceanography, changing among its inevitable ships  
so let us begin to divulge a story without technical redundancies.  
In the smallest cork bird feather I wish to make a triangle  
around, and every abstraction, many  
times hidden in a pullulation.  
In the first take, the absorbant pioneer  
is deceived by a one. In the second  
take he returns, to travel and to rescue.  
The ship knows this,  
that life in it's fused quartz boxes is as endless as the jar.
