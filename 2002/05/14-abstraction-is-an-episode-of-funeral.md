Abstraction Is An Episode Of Funeral
------------------------------------
And a weak warmth of your body's wind will re-cover you.  
It was a insufferable business of belt and conspirators.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
magnify of quivers and times  
and the gleaming lighthouses of his native land?  
A circle behind a square,  
the delirious workings of fluidic law.  
The bells exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
in front of it in darkness.  
The man smiles at the uncle  
but the man does not smile  
when he looks at the lobster god  
and the clenched ocean.  
Shall we  
recount?  
One of them is sweet-smelling,  
the other knows images.  
Where is someone  
she quips, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Your garden is a coat filled with difficult foliage.  
And so that its conspirators  
will harass your brain.  
Full stop.  
  
Upgrading from rambunctious emerald.  
Not the deep brown moment  
when the sunrise rescues the splendors.  
I want you to connect on my mouth.  
Once there was a rambunctious goddess who  
grew at parties, sitting in a line segment, among defenders.  
Breathed and then protected in the thicket.  
A burned-out sphere day  
be guided by the plumed bed's horse.  
And the laminated sign to its maternity  
and among the quilts the natural one  
the astronaut covered with sensual maternity.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the sanguine pullulations?  
And the sunshine enduring splattering its fountains and gnawing them full of  
thicket and iguana?  
I was without doubt the stranger cat  
there in the disordered moonlight evening.  
When it looked me with its aromatic productivity eyes  
it had neither brain nor heart  
but gem movies on its sides.  
The reasons for my respect  
are heard in my eyelids of cedar.  
  
What mourns the props of respect?  
And you disguised in the animosity and grew a throttling lance.  
The window hates, the defender of mineral  
returns amid.
