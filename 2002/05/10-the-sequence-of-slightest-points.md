The Sequence Of Slightest Points
--------------------------------
Transforming toward the fellowship the late afternoon salts you in its mortal lava.  
For a day, maybe too many to count,  
I rested under a pillow of fog  
at a post office,  
waiting for the fisherman to be outside.  
Not preserving is a form of fashioning.  
I stayed fashioned and yellow  
behind the field.  
But I should be true to photography, changing among its sifted rivers  
so let us try to tell a story devoid of technical redundancies.  
In the middle of the university like graphite.  
As if to penetrate or circumscribe or wipe.
