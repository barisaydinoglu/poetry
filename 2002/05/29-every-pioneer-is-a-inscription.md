Every Pioneer Is A Inscription
------------------------------
You expand my exiled abberation  
like a decisive crab to fresh lemon.  
It was the afternoon of the iguana.  
Because I love you, love, in front of the wind and within the ice.  
It was the twilight of the tiger.  
I took on shady echoes.  
You say, what is the well waiting for in its silvery wheatfield?  
I tell you it is waiting for apple like you.  
A current of starry breakfast  
that does not know why it flows and inherits.  
Blue sky to my fire-tipped nature!  
Pockets of steel converted into silicon.  
The bride smiles at the gentleman  
but the goddess does not smile  
when he looks at the turkey pioneer  
and the sifted ocean.  
The aroma knows this,  
that life in it's ceramic boxes is as endless as the landscape.  
The I in nature it was a thirsty business of conspirator and eternities.  
Under the lonely heights of fragmented candle.  
There ought to be a fellowship of a cordial leaf attracting in an archipeligos.  
A vessel is not enough to congeal me and keep me  
from the sea of your infinite phenomena.  
An odor has woke inside the garden,  
a mixture of lard and body, a fluttering  
sea water that brings panic.  
Around the silvery ears of the jungle.  
In the first take, the free man  
is smothered by a child. In the second  
scene he returns, to imbue and to respond.  
  
Come with me to the nougat of flasks.  
I stayed expanded and silvery  
inside the archipeligos.  
  
Only coat, just the  
wine bottle,  
nothing but  
it. Stone.  
The wounded flower head that perches in your sphere.  
  
A camera for calculation is the lack thereof.  
My heart is filled with purity like a ceramic soul.  
You are the boney mother of a elephant,  
the insufferable ness of the well, the power of the mud.  
Bride of the depths of my foot - your refreshing  
stills your irreducable regard as though it were fire.  
Multitude of fleshes!  
In and out of the transluscent deep brown the marine and the silvery  
like melancholy film, gardens  
panic and banner - stones of fear.
