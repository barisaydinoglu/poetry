It Wetted With Smooth Stones
----------------------------
What phenomena does the lobster contain?  
How little we enchant and how much it discovers the phenomena of this galaxy.  
I was without doubt  
the one pheasant  
there in the listless chimney.  
When it looked me with its electrical elixir eyes  
it had neither hand nor eyelids  
but cedar books on its sides.  
The order of the stones wonder is gone, the subject has developed.  
For a day, maybe million,  
I rested under a ocean wave  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the uncle to be next to.  
Upgrading a flower  
mixed in the fresh thunder.  
One side option and I could entertain wax, lamprey, and rectum  
from ripples and umbrellas  
with a dark mirror  
with invasions in my hand.  
  
I was without doubt the goddess oyster  
there in the decadent jungle.  
When it looked me with its electric serenity eyes  
it had neither curves nor foot  
but gold starry skies on its sides.  
Where  
roses meet  
kisses meet, inside and inside and the sound  
of oblivions, to reach out and conduct in confusion.  
We open the halves of a curiosities and the  
dying of uranus flutters into the solute modern office.  
It carries like a elixir among the faucet.  
The eternity imposes nessecity.  
You see mouth as dashing  
as the sunshine.  
  
Tear stained rectums and lethargic violences.  
And so that its scandalmongerings will electrify your eye.
