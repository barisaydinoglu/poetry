Since The End
-------------
They buried it with sordid graces.  
There are many stenches next to obscene events.  
You, who is like a mask tiger among the promising of many custodian.  
I could wet phlegm, shrapnel, and beast  
from silences and angels  
with a brimstone echo  
with gates in my ears.  
It's a breathing angel of smokes.  
Enjoy the many ironous attempts to refresh  
the trusting smoke.  
There is eloquent fortune in crystallizing it.  
Has the divisions been enriched with phenomena?  
Bitten acids and troubled clefts.  
Perfuming an aspen  
imbued in the parsimonious wind.  
And railroad tracks and salts.  
Sometimes a piece  
of the electricity  
wipes like a magnolium in my curves.  
Conversations of goblets, the recitation  
of pastures we call warm sea's  
skin.  
A humble wood paneling making an absorbant thing of a chance meeting with a goddess.  
To seek another land divulging the maternity of her cathedral full of happiness.  
Towards those flowers of yours that wait for me.  
Of esoteric apple, spirit  
of the faucets,  
ignored man blood, your kisses  
continue into exile  
and a droplet of cork, with remnants of the universe.  
  
To the real mineral reflection as if to bristle or perch or ignore.  
Neither flute nor kiss nor dark  
nor yellow but silvery.
