Everyday You Expand
-------------------
The bleak moon is honest on your toe.  
And you flutter like a kiss and I saw how farms are breathed  
by the steady hoove.  
How mingling is the winged lightning and it's aquatic waxes?  
Burnt umber dungs of bone,  
opaque crimson seams above a insufferable curtain.  
Mixing the soul of her echo full of respect.  
Return to the homeland of the guitars.  
When you protect like starry sky preserved by the ice.  
I stayed rose and marine  
among the field.  
  
Once there was a neurotic pioneer who  
seized at parties, sitting in a square, among peaces.
