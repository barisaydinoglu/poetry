Seeking Forceful Nostalgia
--------------------------
Only curtain, just the  
sea water, nothing but  
it. Lunar.  
In the smallest glass silence one of them is unguessed,  
the other knows points of view.  
Where is somebody  
he says, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
There are many oblivions in hollow events.  
The starry necklace gave it wonder.  
Always you smother through the late afternoon  
toward the lunchtime entangling river banks.  
Sailor of the depths of my eye - your wetting  
stills your manly regard as though it were lightning.  
But I should be untrue to oceanography, wiping among its exiled serenities  
so let us attempt to divulge a story devoid of slightest redundancies.  
My myriad fingernails promises you always.  
A rain of droplets the polyp imposes nessecity.  
  
Our new productivity,  
our boundless fountain loops.
