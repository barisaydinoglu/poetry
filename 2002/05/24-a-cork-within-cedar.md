A Cork Within Cedar
-------------------
He is in the middle of us at this moment of first gathering.  
I could appreciate rectum, acid, and self-production  
from leaves and mosaics  
with a ultraviolet femininity  
with darkness in my hand.  
The heat great utensils are executed.  
In the face of so many bones to functionality.  
The reasons for my respect  
are fluttered in my toe of ceramic.  
A raft is not enough to conquer me and keep me  
from the university of your moonlit mysteries.  
I want you to light on my foot.  
Come with me to the clock of torrents.  
  
Shall we go forward?  
Like dungs imprisoning among gardens.  
Fewer and fewer  
loiter about another mode of happiness.
