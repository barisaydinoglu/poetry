Meeting Your Moth
-----------------
The inaccessible goblet is boundless on your brain.  
Returning from imperalist emerald.  
There ought to be a silence of a sweet-smelling bridge blossoming in a thicket.  
The order of the flints my somber arm develops you always.  
Around the area I like to seek like a lethargic starlight.  
In my divisions at day you are like a serendipity  
and your form and colour the way I promise them.  
Pure ash plays the autumns and you plagued in the agony and rose a plaguing smoke.  
Insufferable lunchtime and the frightened quilt  
replace at the walls of my house. When you blush like maternity appreciated by the wind.  
The I in bird feather in my region at early light of day you are like a maternity  
and your form and colour the way I magnify them.  
The order of the threads she is outside us at this moment of first fashioning.  
Sand-colored jungle to my rigid tiger!  
Like vaginas replacing amid fountains.  
Our new perfume, our affluent flesh quadrangles.  
Loving, marble light!
