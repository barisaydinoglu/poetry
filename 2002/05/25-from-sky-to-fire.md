From Sky To Fire
----------------
A chorus of lobsters at holiday un inherited un ignored  
comes to a halt before a soul.  
I salute your natural sugar  
and envy your spacious pride.  
The reasons for my respect  
are preserved in my foot  
of gold.  
Pockets of aluminum converted into emerald.
