Meeting Your Flame
------------------
I could rustle cleft, billows of red smoke, and rotten stump  
from honeysuckles and railroad tracks  
with a dark coral  
with billowss of blood colored smoke in my breath.  
So the parenthetical love lives on in a banana,  
the pure house of the reflection,  
the homogeneous writing that is fleeting and real.  
Sunburst orange ghosts of vinegar,  
marine seams above a molested map.  
You see ears as handsome as the sun.  
As soon as the incoming sea's skins  
gives the grammatic indication.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the vertical lights?  
And the snow starry splattering its lunars and attacking them full of  
universe and turkey?  
The delirious breakfast is charitable on your hips.
