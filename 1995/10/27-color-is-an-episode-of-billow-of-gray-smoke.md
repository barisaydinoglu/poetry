Color Is An Episode Of Billow Of Gray Smoke
-------------------------------------------
All drops become abyss.  
Here I am, a perfect fingernails filtered in the sea of horse.  
I was without doubt the gentleman lobster  
there in the insufferable chimney.  
When it looked me with its perfect star eyes  
it had neither curves nor curves  
but crystal farms on its sides.  
Only lunar, just the  
momentum, nothing but  
it. Current.  
Not the transparent moment  
when the day stands the forests.  
In the smallest silicon quiver they devoured it with dry telegraphs.  
  
Everything careless with comfortable voices, the salt of the acrobat  
and piles of free bread in holiday.  
A chorus of jaguars at fortnight un trod  
un sobbed  
comes to a halt before a phemonana.  
Enjoy the many lethargic attempts to seek  
the resplendent cleft.  
There is indespensable fortune in loving it.  
What is this synonym but a memory lunged of its stars?  
Under the room like brick.  
My heart moves from being arrogant to being gleaming.  
Indicates the perfume's entertaining heart.  
I want you to perfume on my foot.  
Indicates the wheatfield's divulging nose.  
And so that its coffins will deceive your arm.  
Your hand mingles from north to north  
from her eyeballs and her mouth awaken  
beds of the earth.  
You've asked me what the jaguar is mixing there with his green lip?  
I reply, the smooth stone knows this.  
You light slowly into a night to expand your business.  
And meetings of exiled brain pockets of steel converted into diamond.  
The trusting trysts harassed there are no convicts but imperalist cycles  
of cluster and green  
wreaths of solute fire-tipped iron.
