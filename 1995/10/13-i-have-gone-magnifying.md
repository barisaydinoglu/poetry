I Have Gone Magnifying
----------------------
From palm tree leaf to ocean wave,  
hidden rituals drawn by winged channels, a  
melancholy fragrance of strawberry begins to connect.  
As soon as the incoming pencils  
gives the algorithmic indication.  
Not the transluscent sunburst orange moment  
when the afternoon develops the veins.  
From her hips and her hips perform  
moons of the earth.  
Has the modern office been understood with curiosities?  
The day magnoliums you in its mortal lava.  
You say, what is the bird feather waiting for in its sand-colored ripple?  
I tell you it is waiting for writing like you.  
Decency is gone, the subject has trusted.  
  
Fewer and fewer  
dismantle about another mode of felicity.  
The graces exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
outside it in darkness.  
Beligerance and fragrance of strawberry - saxophones of fear.  
You - the silent brow.  
Draw from it the callous  
phenomenon of its own production.  
With its wounded rescue here I am, an absent minded shoulder mourned in the heights of praise.  
For sphere was cold and morally positive.
