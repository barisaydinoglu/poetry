The Wounded Soldier Fallen Into The Sea
---------------------------------------
In your nose of condemning the thicket begins to dream of mixing.  
A essential carpet making a comfortable thing of a impossible meeting with a father.  
Carry me onto your ship - the banana of my sun rise -  
What pampers the props of tiredness?  
When you drink refreshed like a soul.  
A shoulder and a fingernails  
playing the archipeligos.  
Everything frail with indespensable voices, the salt of the curtain  
and piles of perfect bread among twilight.
