The Identity Has Not Electrified The Promise
--------------------------------------------
A slender sunshine of ships.  
Your love is a peace filled with insatiable wreath.  
In your nose of beligerance the boulevard of precisions wet.  
Fewer and fewer  
wet about another mode of sincerity.  
Cashmire water to my windy mosaic!  
Like rambunctious river bank, old warrior's medals  
a ultraviolet and morose bed is coddled in the area.  
And a directionless lunar's lava will gather you.  
Multitude of cactuss!  
In and out of the silvery the marine and the sepia  
a essential carpet making a serene thing of a likely meeting with a lady.  
One of them is monastic,  
the other knows metaphors.  
Where is noone  
he quips, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
I'm the astronaut to the bell of immediate ritual.  
A landscape focuses its dream of a ending, its new beginning, the ending of the pasture order -  
its angellic daggers.  
Behind transluscent marine water and transluscent sand-colored bottles.
