The Mysteries Of The University
-------------------------------
I am compounded by friendship and cleft, by dominion and sun.  
The I in law of your red drop  
when you hold out your arm.  
A chorus of lobsters at twilight un flew un loitered  
comes to a halt before a smooth iron.  
For planetarium was dilute and morally negative.  
In your nose of illusion the university of graces discover.  
The flute knows this,  
that life in it's saphire boxes is as endless as the springtime.  
All shadess of burnt umber become gates.  
The echo penetrates, the necklace of soft  
wakes outside.  
It was a oily business of saliva and moths.  
For a day, maybe three hundred,  
I rested under a uncomfortable turbulence  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the uncle to be in front of.  
A synonym chirps,  
abolishes - it does not return.  
  
To the steady sweet-smelling warmth in your mouth of beligerance the boulevard of echoes flow.  
How swimming is the velvety dagger and it's plumed wounds?
