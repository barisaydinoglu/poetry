The Detail Has Not Abolished The Promise
----------------------------------------
Pure bone blossoms the homes my parsimonious tail perfumes you always. As soon as the incoming sea's skins  
gives the neutral indication.  
For school was atrocious and morally positive.  
  
A shoulder and a nose  
attracting the chimney.  
And fragrances of strawberry and manes.  
The I in awe like lethargic crown, serendipities  
flint of a pitied lashed well.  
Noone here is waiting for the next star.  
Eddy. You set yourself for creating.  
And inside my hammock, during the early light of day, I woke up naked  
and full of love.  
Dilute weather, fragmented lights like the current.  
When the land is full of arrogant brow  
around abberations and hollow disordered smooth aluminums  
and the inaccessible evening stars and the shadess of crimson  
at last give forth their lewd lance.
