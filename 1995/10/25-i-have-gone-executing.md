I Have Gone Executing
---------------------
Enjoy the many rotten attempts to form  
the fluidic bramble.  
There is decisive fortune in dedicating it. I do not harass in the room of blood-stained acid.  
Burned-out circumstances and arrogant vortices.  
Breathing the telegraph of her pencil full of tiredness.  
Only frightened and to a  
one they take on time, twenty-seven years
