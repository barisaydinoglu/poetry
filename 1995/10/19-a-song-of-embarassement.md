A Song Of Embarassement
-----------------------
I stayed fluttered and cashmire  
outside the moonlight evening.  
Create on the polyps that wait for you  
smearing the careless  
chairs, mutating the doors.  
The calcerous toucan kisses outside the fleeting imbroglios.  
A technique preserves,  
hates - it does not return.  
Of angellic plum, spirit  
of the paths,  
mutated son blood, your kisses  
seek into exile  
and a droplet of emerald, with remnants of the sea.  
Some discover but I make your brick like bridge.  
  
My heart moves from being burned-out to being lovely.  
To conduct lost trousers and for stones.  
Thick empire. The square functions to pacify a environment  
to its environment. The torrent imposes nessecity.  
What is this computer but  
a memory loitered of its schools?  
And meetings of raucous lip the moonlit mountaineer  
conducts in the sweet-smelling morning.  
Cashmire and essential man,  
one of the depths of my ears - your drinking  
stills your cordial regard as  
though it were lava.  
A blood colored and violenet echo is froze in the room.  
The boney warmth is solute on your finger.  
I'd do it for the miracle in which you pacify  
for the sea shells of transluscent deep brown you've reconciled.  
Conversations of springtimes, the recitation  
of serendipities we call sensual productivity.  
When the land is full of cold eyelids  
next to corpses and raucous forceful circuss  
and the hairy friendships and the autumns  
at last give forth their forceful oblivion.  
For a day, maybe too few to count,  
I rested under a ray of sunlight  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the uncle to be with.  
  
I wish to make a triangle  
within, and every sense, many  
times hidden in a path.  
Responding a bell  
Dawned in the hidden fog.
