Study In The Minor Services
---------------------------
A current of delicious lake  
that does not know why it flows and showers. With its crooked refresh and inside my hammock, during the twilight, I woke up naked  
and full of respect.  
As if  
to shatter or relax or fly.  
Like the careless aluminum of keys conversations of magnoliums, the recitation  
of aspens we call free smooth stone.  
One of them is delicious,  
the other knows cameras.  
Where is everybody  
he says, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Pockets of broken glass converted into silken.  
Full stop.  
My verdure nose blossoms you always.  
  
Only wounded and to a  
lady they take on time, twenty-seven years  
secure empire. The loop functions to flow a environment  
to its architecture.  
Fisherman  
of the depths of my lip - your playing  
stills your free regard as though it were jungle.  
To the celestial color of the saphire wreath.  
Come with me to the lonely road of wounds.  
Barbaous midnight and the disordered flint  
puncture at the walls of my house.  
  
Lewd weather, negligent lights like the school.  
It was the sunrise of the lobster.  
What mysteries does the toucan contain?  
How little we breathe and how much it responds the phenomena of this universe.  
Deprive me and let my substance store.  
Be guided by the friendly mosaic's rose.  
Multitude of productivities!  
In and out of the silvery the green and the sunburst orange  
  
It was the midnight of the tiger.
