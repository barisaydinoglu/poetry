Setting The Sun In Motion
-------------------------
Wave of wave of essences rolling down the sea. And a hollow springtime's electricity will fashion you.  
The boneless squirrel wakes inside the delicious lards.  
  
Wave of wave of reflections rolling down the sea.  
You drink my nauesous abys  
like a soft pheasant to fresh sugar.
