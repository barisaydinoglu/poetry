A Song Of Anger
---------------
As soon as the incoming propellers  
gives the side indication.  
You say, what is the transluscent sepia car waiting for in its yellow utensil?  
I tell you it is waiting for femininity like you.  
Not to begin or even meet  
the flint of one who wakes  
inside me in a sea or seeking to a pioneer.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
  
Here I am, a trusting finger ignored in the city of aroma.  
The lake lives in loving your nose.  
Wave of wave of evening stars rolling down the sea.  
As soon as the incoming coats  
gives the slightest indication.  
Indicates the garden's setting mouth.  
Outside the circus of the area where you sleep,  
a dream pampers into languages.  
Carry me onto your raft - the apple of my telegraph -  
and so that its probes will wipe your hips.  
Shall we set forth?  
Sometimes a piece of the ice  
pampers like a path in my breath.  
Rustling from delirious ivory.  
  
A land kissing will protect  
the sticky sky of a planet.  
Went rejoiced in coat petrify me and let my  
substance mix.
