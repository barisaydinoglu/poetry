Proof Of Angellic Sense
-----------------------
Serenity.  
As soon as the incoming books  
gives the grammatic indication.  
What imprisons the props of purity?  
Growing from brutal silicon.  
Of a dark woman that circumscribes evening stars.  
And in front of my hammock, during the late afternoon, I woke up naked  
and full of pride.  
The starlight carrying from my hips.  
Form on the shadows that wait for you  
ignoring the hairy chairs, erupting the doors.  
The honeysuckle plan that has everyone shifty.  
  
A current of slender autumn  
that does not know why it flows and hears.  
Nothing but your fleeting shoulder.  
A morbid light day  
and so that its wastelands will coagulate your brain.  
Boneless early light of day and the imperalist quiver  
freeze at the walls of my house.  
You shower in the moonlight evening as in a handsome field.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the romantic trees?  
And the drizzle lyrical splattering its poppies and striking them  
full of  
thicket and toucan?  
The sailor smiles at the custodian  
but the custodian does not smile  
when he looks at the pheasant uncle  
and the rotten ocean.
