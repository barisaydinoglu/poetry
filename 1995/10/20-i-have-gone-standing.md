I Have Gone Standing
--------------------
A train is not enough to scratch  
me and keep me  
from the jungle of your changeless funny things.  
Against the barbaous field of wet-winged stars in the sky.  
A loaf of bread baked with exiled joy and salt.  
A neurotic synonym trembles  
even the equinoctial  
algorithmic archipeligos in image  
to which the metaphor  
will not be rejoiced.  
I want you to carry on my brain.  
A current of great peace  
that  
does not know why it flows and protects.  
Ship.
