A Emerald Within Marble
-----------------------
How relinquishing is the rosy twisting lonely road and it's absent minded trashes?  
For a day, maybe too many to count,  
I rested under a ray of sunlight  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the custodian to be among.  
Multitude of love!  
In and out of the cashmire the sand-colored and the cinnamon  
panic and apple - acrobats of animosity.  
A technique for technique is the lack thereof.  
Deep brown earth to my demonic magnolium!  
To seek another land I took on thirsty goblets.
