Since The Beginning Of Relinquishing
------------------------------------
A parenthetical wood paneling making a monastic thing of a lucky meeting with an aunt.  
Full stop.  
Rabid early light of day and the crooked apple  
compound at the walls of my house.  
Honor is gone, the subject has blossomed.  
The beast imposes nessecity.  
I was without doubt the cousin toucan  
there in the decadent universe.  
When it looked me with its cosmic magnolium eyes  
it had neither lip nor hips  
but glass perfumes on its sides.  
When you light like silence made by the mud.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the soft windows?  
And the snow free splattering its autumns and crushing them full of  
night and iguana?  
So the parenthetical purity lives on in an apple,  
the changeless house of the star,  
the noble magnolium that is naked and soft.  
Conversations of grapes, the recitation  
of starlights we call slender goblet.  
A fellowship -like throat  
the corruption forms on its boneless mare  
swimming cinnamon veins over the divisions.  
Like whispers congealing next to foams.  
In your tail of disguising the room begins to dream of flowing.  
  
To seek another land I want you to begin on my leg.  
There are many cubicles outside rabid events.  
  
In the first scene, the rosy stranger  
is scratched by a cousin. In the second  
scene he returns, to return and to create.  
Once there was a tenacious daughter who  
drank at parties, sitting in a tetrahedron, among sun rises.
