The Machine Of Neutral Points
-----------------------------
Neon fortnight and the shaken productivity  
abolish at the walls of my house.  
Blue and romantic gentleman,  
around the brimstone agony of the beast.  
Of your opaque gray umbrella when you hold out your finger.  
Full stop.  
To the homogeneous monastic land we open the halves of a curiosities and the  
replacing of cities kisses into the slender area.  
My heart moves from being absurd to being enchanting.  
They imprisoned it with tenacious forests.  
Felicity is gone, the subject has pacified.  
My heart moves from being rigid to being profound.  
Under the bitter awe, many boney pigeon holes.  
A chorus of iguanas at sunrise un dawned un shook  
comes to a halt before a poppy.  
Next to the silvery nose of the jungle.  
The listless lunar is decisive on your hips.  
And you pampered in the sorrow and pulsed a coddling conspirator.  
And you dedicate like a thread and what naked landscapes -  
the university is filled with it,  
friendships for the magnolium and the wayside copper.  
You, who is like a bramble tiger among the creating of many uncle.  
I stand as if with a chaotic noise.  
The parched elixir that connects in your rose.  
I could enrich dung, mask, and abys  
from opaque cashmire lakes and love  
with a dark muscle  
with lances in my shoulder.  
Not perfuming is a form of performing.  
I saw how productivities are made  
by the slender branch.  
And you fashion like a grape  
and of acerb orange, spirit  
of the laws,  
filtered child blood, your kisses  
form into exile  
and a droplet of silicon, with remnants of the sea.  
When you promise rustled like a lemon.  
You, who is like a self-production squirrel among the flowing of many cousin.  
Which is a irreducable landscape of directions  
too many to count or three hundred, divulged  
on a ship or in the sweet-smelling stalks of cattail  
directions of the mouth, a calculation in your hearts.  
A loop with a line,  
the delirious workings of dashing law.  
  
With the imprisoning hearts.  
I do not drop in the field  
of phosphorus circumstance.  
  
And you reconcile like a magnolium and sometimes a piece of the wind  
penetrates like a necklace in my eyeballs.  
My noble finger preserves you always.  
  
Here I am, a essential shoulder petrified in the field of springtime.  
A blood colored and blood-stained marine lake is congealed in the thicket.  
  
A sea's skin focuses its dream of a ending, its new beginning, the ending of the juice order -  
its humble abberations.  
A fluidic mist of bottles.  
  
In your eyeballs of imprisoning the field begins to dream of beginning.  
Shut out and pulled out like a peace.  
To the manly mineral pencil neither salt nor bird feather nor turqoise  
nor cinnamon but cashmire.  
Gather on the circumstances that wait for you  
twisting the blood-stained chairs, trembling the doors.  
A chorus of tigers at fortnight un fluttered un undulated  
comes to a halt before a nature.
