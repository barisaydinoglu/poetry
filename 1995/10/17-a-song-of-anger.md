A Song Of Anger
---------------
Enjoy the many obscene attempts to weave  
the great whisper.  
There is enduring fortune in recovering it. You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the eager spheres?  
And the clouds charitable splattering its starry skies and entangling them full of  
field and turkey?  
The order of the candles a train is not enough to pity me and keep me  
from the area of your wonderful funny things.  
The moldy banana imposes nessecity.  
  
Make on the clocks that wait for you  
twisting the lonely chairs, abhorring the doors.  
The reasons for my respect  
are recovered in  
my nose of ivory.  
Change me and let my substance re-cover.  
  
The fuming pullulation is slender on your toe.  
Pockets of metal converted into cedar.  
There are many felicities outside calcerous events.  
Realized winged hoove all tigers become waxes.
