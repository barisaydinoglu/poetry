Hearing As Hounds
-----------------
The flesh re-covers in chirping your breath. I'd do it for the window in which you mix  
for the pastures of silvery you've heard. A inscription for computer is the lack thereof.  
When you dedicate excited like a fragrance of strawberry.  
And meetings of tear stained toe a lewd camera congeals  
even the vertical  
technical universe in image  
to which the metaphor  
will not be lived.  
The land next to hers  
a history we tell in passing,  
with notions of love  
and a passion for engineering and mountaineering  
only door, just the  
dew, nothing but  
it. Precision.  
The coral knows this,  
that life in it's ivory boxes is as endless as the land.  
In the face of so many darkness to animosity.  
Multitude of utensils!  
In and out of the cashmire  
the cinnamon and the deep brown  
as soon as the incoming homes  
gives the minor indication.  
Fewer and fewer  
falter about another mode of honor.  
I am filtered by coral and cadaver, by violence and mist.  
A loaf of bread baked with dead purity and salt.  
Enjoy the many careless attempts to form  
the fleeting rotten stump.  
There is velvety fortune in blushing it.  
Towards those lemons of yours that wait for me.  
A calculating tree day  
we open the halves of a curiosities and the  
dismantling of seperations conducts into the electrical thicket.  
  
Has the night been transformed with phenomena?  
With its motionless wet closed off and shut up like a tiger.  
  
Our new star, our electrical quilt loops.  
Where defenders meet  
shadess of cinnamon meet, outside and outside and the sound  
of jackals, to reach out and upgrade in illusion.
