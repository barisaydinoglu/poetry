A Grape
-------
Panics of a hated vessel  
entertaining behind the room inside a brutal train,  
angellic as a clenched iguana. And so that its hearts will throttle your eye.  
The I in reflection the door knows this,  
that life in it's  
chalk boxes is as endless as the energy.  
  
I was without doubt the daughter iguana  
there in the chaotic chimney.  
When it looked me with its sweet-smelling smooth aluminum eyes  
it had neither brow nor eyeballs  
but saphire trysts on its sides.  
The custodian smiles at the gentleman  
but the elder does not smile  
when he looks at the iguana child  
and the shady ocean.
