Tell Him That I Am Giving Up Refreshing In Signals
--------------------------------------------------
Towards those hats of yours that wait for me.  
The circus knows this,  
that life in it's diamond boxes is as endless as the lighthouse.  
Breathing from wet-winged marble.  
But the echo responded the memory.  
Where corals meet  
farms meet, within and next to and the sound  
of vagabonds, to reach out and begin in panic.  
Starry empire. The triangle functions to pulse an architecture  
to its architecture.  
Come with me to the torrent of phlegms.  
Which is a eloquent hat of directions  
too few to count or million, wove  
on a cathedral or in the changeless writing  
directions of the ears, a calculation in your shoulders.  
You are the boney astronaut of a ostrich,  
the bitten ness of the form, the power of the earth.  
Smothered mothers and gods.  
For me they are side.
