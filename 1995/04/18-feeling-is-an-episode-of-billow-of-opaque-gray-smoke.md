Feeling Is An Episode Of Billow Of Opaque Gray Smoke
----------------------------------------------------
When you magnify awakened like a coral. Your hips pulses from west to east  
shall we move on?  
Multitude of windows!  
In and out of the sepia the deep brown and the opaque transparent  
enjoy the many explosive attempts to love  
the irreducable wounded soldier.  
There is plumed fortune in returning it.  
The moonlight evening behind hers  
a story we speak in passing,  
with notions of decency  
and a passion for mountaineering and computer science  
it was the sunrise of the crab.  
Because I love you, love, next to the water and with the fire.  
It was the day of the turkey.  
Of gleaming grape, spirit  
of the energies,  
trembled mother blood, your kisses  
trust into exile  
and a droplet of gem, with remnants of the archipeligos.  
I do not overflow in the moonlight evening of tear stained bloodied salt.  
Nothing but that guitar of sweetness.
