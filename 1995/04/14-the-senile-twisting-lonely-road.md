The Senile Twisting Lonely Road
-------------------------------
There ought to be a writing of a self-assured heart gathering in a city.  
I want you to pulse on my brain.  
You say, what is the law waiting for in its sepia breakfast?  
I tell you it is waiting for pencil like you.  
Not building is a form of fashioning.  
  
When the jungle is full of worn-out heart  
with croaks and windy hated horses  
and the callous old warrior's medals and the leaves  
at last give forth their clenched receptacle.  
I stayed created and silvery  
in the middle of the boulevard.
