A Banana
--------
My starry hips treads you always.  
And acrobats and bird feathers.  
Nothing but your fleeting nose.  
When the modern office is full of fuming breath  
in violas and calcerous fractious branches  
and the lonely flower heads  
and the fountains  
at last give forth their careless lamprey.
