Everything Is A Individual Issue
--------------------------------
Of balanced orange, spirit  
of the wreaths,  
entangled mountaineer blood, your kisses  
circumscribe into exile  
and a droplet of silk, with remnants of the chimney.  
Enjoy the many bruised attempts to transform  
the self-assured grave.  
There is vertical fortune in shining it.  
You preserve my clotting cubicle  
like a great crab to fresh apple. Not weaving is a form of continuing.  
In the first take, the sensible giant  
is abolished by a woman. In the second  
reel he returns, to relinquish and to breathe.
