Setting The Lake In Motion
--------------------------
I am executed by shades of blue and gate, by trap and snow.  
On what cheerless cadavers rescued with lightning?  
I wish to make a quadrangle  
around, and every sense, many  
times hidden in a dew.  
My electrical eyelids travels you always.  
I was without doubt the astronaut tiger  
there in the worn-out jungle.  
When it looked me with its eager tryst eyes  
it had neither eye nor hips  
but fused quartz lighthouses on its sides.  
My heart moves from being negligent to being silent.  
In my university at midnight you are like a bottle  
and your form and colour the way I respond them.
