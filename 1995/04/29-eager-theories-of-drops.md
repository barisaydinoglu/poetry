Eager Theories Of Drops
-----------------------
From her fingernails and her nose rise  
ribbons of the earth.  
My heart moves from being difficult to being delicious.  
Everything lethargic with enchanting voices, the salt of the warmth of your body  
and piles of self-assured bread with night.  
What brandishing guitars -  
the chimney is filled with it,  
apples for the miracle and the senile diamond.  
A loaf of bread baked with browbeaten happiness and salt. Showering a leaf  
reconciled in the nocturnal clouds.  
Book of an attacked disintered bird feather.
