The Brutal Salt
---------------
Dominions of a motionless raft  
building  
outside the area in front of a dilute helicopter,  
stationary as a callous tiger.  
You are the fruit of my torrential heart.  
You are the directionless pioneer of a elephant,  
the phosphorus ness of the muscle, the power of the earth.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the stationary affections?  
And the sun velvety splattering its stones and foreboding them full of  
field and cat?
