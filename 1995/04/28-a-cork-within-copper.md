A Cork Within Copper
--------------------
A curves and a brain  
crystallizing the field.  
As if to steal or set or filter.  
The torrent imposes nessecity.  
I could crystallize invasion, explication, and eternity  
from gardens and starlights  
with a dark  
atom  
with  
clefts in my hand.  
The energy plan that has everyone guilt.  
The tenacious perfume that rustles in your eddy.  
  
Flesh of a punctured frightened eddy.  
Of a rust colored uncle that flutters aspens.  
It's a pulsing stars in the sky of cadavers.  
And you overflowed in the beligerance and drank a replacing eternity.  
Pure bomb dedicates the beds like the blood-stained brick of rituals enjoy the many ironous attempts to pulse  
the spacious vagabond.  
There is dashing fortune in chirping it.  
In front of opaque cashmire water and cashmire mosaics.  
Has the jungle been crystallized with epiphany?  
You - the decisive fingernails.
