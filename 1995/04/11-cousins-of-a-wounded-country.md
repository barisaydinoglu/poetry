Cousins Of A Wounded Country
----------------------------
Outside the sordid well, many bitterest nights.  
Map was no longer right at the recording threshold.  
They are all  
uncles  
professional complaints in whose parenthetical kiss originate.  
In the first scene, the electric  
sailor  
is filtered by a one. In the second  
reel he returns, to live and to play.  
  
Conversations of flower heads, the recitation  
of bird feathers we call delicate vein.  
Only burned-out and to a  
sailor they take on time, million years  
nothing but your hidden foot.  
The order of the flutes the wide eddies scratched return to the homeland of the spheres.
