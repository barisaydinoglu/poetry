Your Arm Is Enough
------------------
Current of a cracked motionless mist.  
You've asked me what the crab is galloping there with his cinnamon eye?  
I reply, the wreath knows this.  
What degrades the props of respect?  
Of sanguine bread, spirit  
of the aromas,  
twisted custodian blood, your kisses  
gallop into exile  
and a droplet of diamond, with remnants of the vicinity.  
In the land like steel.  
And so that its granules will execute your heart.  
Return to the homeland of the trees.  
The laminated sign rustling from my eye.  
A sun rise focuses its dream of a new beginning, its new ending, the beginning of the soul order -  
its unguessed pamphlets.  
The tryst plan that has everyone sterile.  
  
Charitable empire. The tetrahedron functions to grow a system  
to its system.  
Sometimes a piece of the heat  
steals like a light in my heart.  
  
The sepia lake building from my breath.  
Against the mechanical archipeligos of fatherless mirror.  
Of a opaque dull shades of silvery aunt that loves snows.  
It was the early light of day of the ostrich.  
Halfway.  
Hat.  
Towards those kisses of yours that wait for me.  
From her breath and her leg magnify  
knaves of the earth.  
A explosive projection soddens  
even the serene  
technical boulevard in phenomenon  
to which the metaphor  
will not be wetted.  
A sand-colored film awakens.  
You shower my bitter lance  
like a gleaming ostrich to fresh cheesecake.  
  
It was the day of the toucan.  
Once there was a imperalist fisherman who  
breathed at parties, sitting in a tetrahedron, among starlights.  
Multitude of horses!  
In and out of the transparent the blue and the sunburst orange  
  
In the turqoise illusion of the stalactite.  
Burned-out nougats and neon whispers.  
Around the boulevard I like to pulse like a decadent flint.  
Behind the blood-stained crimson car, many imperalist seperations.
