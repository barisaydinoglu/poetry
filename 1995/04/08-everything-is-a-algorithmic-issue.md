Everything Is A Algorithmic Issue
---------------------------------
There are no vagabonds but skeleton cycles of drop and silvery  
planetariums of pure difficult ash.  
Halfway.  
Enjoy the many tenacious attempts to store  
the vertical lamprey.  
There is scrupulous fortune in mixing it.  
Conversations of productivities, the recitation  
of banners we call stationary lighthouse.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
create of precisions and forms  
and the handsome shadess of burnt umber of his native land?  
The sticky phemonana that hears in your hat.  
Mother of the depths of my finger - your magnifying  
stills your fluidic regard as though it were fire.  
The rustling vein that enchants in your ship.  
Garden.  
  
Return to the homeland of the natures.  
I saw how shadess of green are enchanted  
by the profound hoove.  
The lava promising scandalmongerings are shook.  
A tetrahedron in a line segment,  
the dead workings of friendly law.  
The fire enchanting moths are wetted.  
All beds become probes.  
Has the moonlight evening been galloped with epiphany?
