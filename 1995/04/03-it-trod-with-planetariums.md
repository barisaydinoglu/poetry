It Trod With Planetariums
-------------------------
Not to live or even meet  
the flint of one who returns  
outside me in a land or responding to a father.  
One of them is humble,  
the other knows identities.  
Where is noone  
he cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Exciting from morose silk.  
And so that its lances will force your brow.  
You continue my weak howl  
like a lyrical turkey to fresh grape.  
A chorus of turkeys at early light of day un rejoiced un harassed  
comes to a halt before a flesh.  
My musical hand forms you always.  
Ritual.  
All starss in the sky become alarms.  
You've asked me what the squirrel is flowing there with his sunburst orange arm?  
I reply, the snow knows this.  
From harrowing wind to uncomfortable turbulence,  
hidden shadess of burnt umber drawn by charitable channels, a  
ghostly rose begins to hear.
