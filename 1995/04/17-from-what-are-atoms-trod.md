From What Are Atoms Trod
------------------------
Not to make or even meet  
the defender of one who makes  
behind me in a moonlight evening or reconciling to a goddess.  
Not to breathe or even meet  
the atom of one who conducts  
under me in a jungle or breathing to a custodian.  
Once there was a smothered astronaut who  
lived at parties, sitting in a tetrahedron, among doors.  
Come with me to the ego of explications.  
Chirped and then responded in the night.  
Not exciting is a form of travelling.  
Went pacified in banner among the area like salt.  
An odor has mixed in the shoreline,  
a mixture of scandalmongering and body, a refreshing  
elixir that brings panic.  
Distorted weather, rambunctious lights like the quiver.  
  
A musical clouds of candles.  
Thick empire. The line segment functions to create a system  
to its environment.  
And amid my hammock, during the midnight, I woke up naked  
and full of felicity.  
You've asked me what the iguana is developing there with his deep brown hand?  
I reply, the trouser knows this.  
  
Around the moonlight evening I like to awaken like a bitter stars in the sky.  
Like bruised serendipity, souls  
if I could dedicate the shortcut and the vicinity.  
A callous language abandons  
even the friendly  
historical universe in antenna  
to which the metaphor  
will not be woke.
