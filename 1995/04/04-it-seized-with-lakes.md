It Seized With Lakes
--------------------
And meetings of bitten mouth only frail and to a  
elder they take on time, million years towards those stars  
of yours that wait for me.  
The atom knows this,  
that life in it's gold boxes is as endless as the sea water.  
  
The rosy dignity of the smooth stone!  
When you excite enriched like a ribbon.  
A dark and thirsty crown is died in the archipeligos.  
Around the miracle of the universe where you sleep,  
a dream passes into cameras.  
In your shoulder of puncturing the universe begins to dream of breathing.  
The rose developing from my hand.  
When you wake like lighthouse created by the wind.  
Behind the cathedral of the field where you sleep,  
a dream drowns into studies.  
  
Not standing is a form of waking.  
The order of the trousers you've asked me what the elephant is exciting there with his cashmire leg?  
I reply, the shades of cinnamon knows this.
