I Have Gone Mingling
--------------------
And behind my hammock, during the twilight, I woke up naked  
and full of joy.  
I'd do it for the coral in which you crystallize  
for the clusters of opaque crimson you've stored.  
Wave of wave of eddies rolling down the sea.  
And the film to its peace  
and among the lunars the steady one  
the astronaut covered with honest snow.  
In the vicinity like aluminum.  
A rain of times return to the homeland of the currents.  
Everything  
brutal with lyrical voices, the salt of the time  
and piles of great bread around early light of day.  
A brimstone and boneless grape is petrified in the universe.  
  
Everything brutal with romantic voices,  
the salt of the poppy  
and piles of smooth bread in front of twilight.  
Outside the yellow breath of the mud.  
Among the deforming hearts.
