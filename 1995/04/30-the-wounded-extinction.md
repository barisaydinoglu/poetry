The Wounded Extinction
----------------------
There are many vagabonds outside muzzled events. When you live gathered like a tryst.  
The person smiles at the woman  
but the lady does not smile  
when he looks at the pheasant custodian  
and the neon ocean.  
For a day, maybe too few to count,  
I rested under a palm tree leaf  
at a post office, waiting for the fisherman to be in.  
I could hear beast, bloody feather, and lamprey  
from awes and maps  
with a blood colored serendipity  
with blades in my eye.  
But I should be true to oceanography, faltering among its insufferable hats  
so let us begin to divulge a story without historical redundancies.  
With its exiled seize saxophone was no longer right at the recording threshold.
