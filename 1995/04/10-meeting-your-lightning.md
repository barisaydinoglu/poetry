Meeting Your Lightning
----------------------
I took on calcerous lunars.  
What secrets does the bird contain?  
How little we trust and how much it enriches the epiphany of this computer simulation.  
Carrying toward the honeysuckle careless weather, forceful lights like the atom.  
How dedicating is the equinoctial violence and it's handsome shadows?  
With the depriving trash barges.  
Brings all the loiters maternities.  
  
Like the sifted salt of springtimes among the starry sky of the region where you sleep,  
a dream abhors into antennae.  
Imperalist custodians and daughters.  
For me they are algorithmic.  
When the field is full of hairy mouth  
inside blades and shady hollow crowns  
and the forceful juices and the fellowships  
at last give forth their inevitable depth.  
Not preserving is a form of expanding.  
The femininities exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
amid it in darkness.
