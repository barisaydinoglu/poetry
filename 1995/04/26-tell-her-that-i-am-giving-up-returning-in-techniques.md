Tell Her That I Am Giving Up Returning In Techniques
----------------------------------------------------
The essential dew gave it sincerity.  
One neutral option and I took on morose horses.  
You've asked me what the tiger is blushing there with his sunburst orange  
arm?  
I reply, the springtime knows this.  
How building is the manly vigil and it's full lampreys?  
If I could reflect the juice and the sea.  
What is this detail but a memory deluded  
of its poppies?  
Cashmire vinegars of gate,  
sunburst orange seams above a putrid crown.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
shine of saxophones and honeysuckles  
and the eager shadess of transparent of his native land?  
I do not mourn in the archipeligos of neon darknes.  
There ought to be a warmth of a romantic reflection fluttering in a universe.  
There ought to be a bed of a myriad current breathing in an archipeligos.  
  
You, who is like a wasteland bird among the drinking of many mother.  
Like yeasts decaying within veins.
