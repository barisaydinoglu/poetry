An Equally Sanguine Astronaut
-----------------------------
All splendors become bloody feathers. Sunburst orange and resplendent gentleman,  
conversations of elixirs, the recitation  
of foliages we call  
moonlit peace.  
Some dawn but I relinquish  
your steel like lemon.  
Shall we go forward?  
Because I love you, love, in front of the water and next to the mud.  
On what bitten belts loved with lightning?  
  
The honest juices protested if you were not the cheesecake the scrupulous moon  
cooks, sprinkling its nectarine across the archipeligos.  
Where saxophones meet  
elixirs meet, outside and among and the sound  
of coffins, to reach out and build in beligerance.  
And so that its flasks will deceive your mouth.
