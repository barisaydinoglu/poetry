Synonym With The Beast
----------------------
I wish to make a circle  
in, and every feeling, many  
times hidden in a droplet. From blade of grass to palm tree leaf,  
hidden veins drawn by hidden channels, a  
hated candle begins to develop.  
It was the late afternoon of the toucan.  
Has the modern office been divulged with mysteries?  
A red and oily poppy is punctured in the area.  
  
It was the night of the turkey.  
To seek another land a map relinquishing will re-cover  
the sordid lightning of a planet.
