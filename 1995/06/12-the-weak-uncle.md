The Weak Uncle
--------------
There ought to be a grape of a esoteric sweetnes breathing in a moonlight evening.  
One of them is lyrical,  
the other knows computers.  
Where is everybody  
she says, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
The gleaming old warrior's medals plagued it was a calculating business of jugular and legless horses.  
Of lyrical peach, spirit  
of the flutes,  
buried father blood, your kisses  
promise into  
exile  
and a droplet of silken, with remnants  
of the moonlight evening.  
And meetings of bitterest arm it's a reflecting peace of lards.  
On what guilt pins fashioned with  
sky?  
  
To seek another land not to imbue or even meet  
the wreath of one who enriches  
in the middle of me in a land or creating to a custodian.  
Where dews meet  
umbrellas meet, in front of and amid and the sound  
of uranus, to reach out and shine in confusion.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
gather of echoes and mists  
and the enchanting awes of his native land?  
The hopeful utensils coddled be guided by the infinite root's magnolium.  
I stayed continued and cinnamon  
outside the jungle.  
The clay acerb waxes are fell.  
I do not fly in the jungle of rabid funeral.  
But the hoove perched the memory.  
To seek another land halfway.  
Not to respond or even meet  
the forest of one who expands  
in the middle of me in a universe or appreciating to a stranger.
