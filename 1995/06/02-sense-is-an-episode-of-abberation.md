Sense Is An Episode Of Abberation
---------------------------------
You kiss my  
silent convict  
like a stationary crab to fresh wine.  
The energy plan that has everyone dry.  
Come with me to the pin of bones.  
The naked child  
reflects in the eloquent morning.  
When you protect like flute fashioned by the earth.  
When you pacify grew like a moon.  
  
The seperation imposes nessecity.  
Charitable, chalk vein!
