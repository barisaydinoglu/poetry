Study With The Flask
--------------------
A wind of bird feathers scrupulous, bolt of diamond precision! And the miracle to its warmth  
and among the mosaics the electric one  
the lady covered with irreducable time.  
Nothing but your thick finger.  
  
Comfortable, cedar farm!  
On what morose shadows formed with lightning?  
Blushing a form  
excited in the warm sunshine.  
As soon as the incoming telegraphs  
gives the public indication.
