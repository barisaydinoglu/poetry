From What Are Shadess Of Transparent Rose
-----------------------------------------
The order of the threads I saw how shorelines are carried  
by the somber maternity.  
Shining from cold cork.  
A rotten study protests  
even the brandishing  
minor archipeligos in inscription  
to which the metaphor  
will not be created.  
Has the area been upgraded with secrets?  
In my region at night you are like a trouser  
and your form and colour the way I divulge them.  
To the eloquent color of the silken pullulation.  
Boney cold fires and crooked massacres.  
The electric roses killed tremble me and let my substance wake.  
Our new grape, our moonlit alcove circles.  
  
A quadrangle with a tetrahedron,  
the bleak workings of delicate law.  
This frightened garden and carrying current overflows me  
with it's essential magnoliums like hand and breath  
and rust colored essences like eyelids and leaves.  
What funny things does the tiger contain?  
How little we reconcile and how much it plays the secrets of this universe.  
I want you to seize on my shoulder.  
Indicates  
the guitar's upgrading shoulder.  
I'd do it for the apple in which you wet  
for the wine bottles of green you've transformed.  
Trusting, wooden banner!  
The phemonana plan that has everyone demonic.  
Indicates the evening star's appreciating hand.  
Sticks of a parched boat  
fashioning inside the moonlight evening with a dead train,  
serene as a skeleton pheasant.  
  
Pure shortcut creates the circuss to the stationary color of the silken banner.  
The stone plan that has everyone neurotic.  
  
Be guided by the steady sun's starry sky.  
The difficult jaguar mixes against the homogeneous utensils.
