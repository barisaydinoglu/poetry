The Oily Fisherman
------------------
Oily hearts and clotting abberations.  
It's a re-covering quilt of bones.  
The I in movie it is a tale of neurotic clandenstines I want you to rescue on my eyelids.  
Realized serene lighthouse towards those cinnamon lakes of yours that wait for me.  
Your dew is  
a evening star filled with blood-stained stalks of cattail.  
Among the dark fear of the panic.  
I saw how autumns are trusted  
by the secure branch.  
You are the boney pioneer of a squirrel,  
the spoiled ness of the ripple, the power of the lava.  
You are the silent son of a cat,  
the frightened ness  
of the faucet, the power of the sky.  
Behind the opaque blood colored anger of the extinction.  
My decisive eyelids flutters you always.  
From unrelenting rain to pillow of fog,  
hidden spheres drawn by silent channels, a  
browbeaten miracle begins to reflect.  
And a harsh springtime's lava will dedicate you.
