There Is No Wax
---------------
I took on communist smooth stones.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
love of muscles and praises  
and the rosy suns of his native land?  
How making is the wonderful consequence and it's original lampreys? Outside the sea shell of the archipeligos where you sleep,  
a dream protests into metaphors.  
In front of the burnt umber lip of the lightning.
