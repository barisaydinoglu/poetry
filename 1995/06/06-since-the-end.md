Since The End
-------------
The coats exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
in front of it in darkness. Be guided by the homogeneous droplet's awe.  
A chorus of oysters at fortnight un dedicated un throttled  
comes to a halt before a ripple.  
What mourns the props of love?  
A line in front of a triangle,  
the senile workings of noble law.  
Monastic, silicon banner!  
The cleft magnifies on its arrogant mare  
perfuming marine kisses over the divisions.  
And with my hammock, during the afternoon, I woke up naked  
and full of tiredness.  
  
The school exciting from my curves.  
Come with me to the pigeon hole of trashes.  
The juice imposes nessecity.  
Wave of wave of bridges rolling down the sea.  
Juices of a furious boat  
entertaining outside the thicket with a parched car,  
incredulous as a crooked tiger.  
I could discover thorn tree, havoc, and cadaver  
from paths and poppies  
with a gray serendipity  
with hounds in my eyelids.  
You light slowly into a room to stand your business.
