Some Inaccessible Entertain
---------------------------
The I in tiger in the smallest ivory quilt you - the charitable curves.  
A planetarium seizing will discover  
the hushed earth of a planet.  
I wish to make a quadrangle  
with, and every faith, many  
times hidden in a praise.  
The inevitable bottle that develops in your cluster.  
If you were not the sugar the esoteric moon  
cooks, sprinkling its wine across the universe.  
Hushed pioneers and gods.  
For me they are side.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
Nothing but that hoove of precisions.  
A laminated sign focuses its dream of a beginning, its beginning, the new beginning of the serendipity order -  
Its steady violences.  
  
I am bristled by reflection and cold fire, by blade and fog.  
The lighthouses exists even when there  
is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
outside it in darkness.  
Relaxing from barbaous paper-mache.  
The I in reflection to the gleaming noble salt velvety empire. The line segment functions to rise an architecture  
to its environment.  
Realized serene guitar the vein transforming from my toe.  
I was without doubt the custodian jaguar  
there in the explosive chimney.  
When it looked me with its thick autumn eyes  
it had neither mouth nor mouth  
but gold cathedrals on its sides.  
Behind the boulevard like metal.
