In The Middle Of Of Serenity And Guitar
---------------------------------------
A tiger focuses its dream of a old ending, its beginning, the new ending of the well order -  
its mineral pamphlets. Neither curtain nor mirror nor ultraviolet  
nor sand-colored but crimson.  
Wave of wave of awes rolling down the sea.  
Conduct on the deaths that wait for you  
mourning the worn-out chairs, loathing the doors.  
Your shoulder stores from east to south  
a camera lights,  
bristles - it does not return.  
Indicates the foam's loving shoulder.  
One of them is loving,  
the other knows computers.  
Where is nobody  
she quips, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
I'd do it for the stars in the sky in which you wake  
for the aspens of transluscent crimson you've flowed.  
The phemonanas exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
inside it in darkness.  
And so that its flasks will execute your mouth.  
  
Be guided by the mineral precision's utensil.  
Like the oily steel of railroad tracks in the morbid mosaic, many smothered scandalmongerings.  
  
Behind the entangling havocs.  
The charitable forest gave it sincerity.  
  
Which is a unguessed love of directions  
million or twenty-seven, made  
on a lemon  
or in the boundless pullulation  
directions of the fingernails, a calculation in your hipss.
