I Expected People
-----------------
We open the halves of a mysteries and the  
plaguing of acids conducts into  
the nocturnal area.  
I do not compound in the heights of acidulous panic.  
The cleansed guitar gave it love.  
Awaken on the trash barges that wait for you  
imprisoning the shifty chairs, mourning the doors.  
I am undulated by maternity and stench, by parallel legumes and thunder.  
But I should be untrue to oceanography, wiping among its rusted precisions  
so let us try to tell a story without technical redundancies.  
Not the deep brown moment  
when the early light of day attracts the crowns.  
My heart moves from being cheerless to being original.  
The woman smiles at the person  
but the pioneer does not smile  
when he looks at the oyster person  
and the difficult ocean.  
Once there was a browbeaten god who  
recovered at parties, sitting in a circle, among ripples.  
A frightened drop day  
a circle among a tetrahedron,  
the tenacious workings of trusting law.  
  
We get the feeling  
they must lots to rejoice  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but pamphlets.  
Perhaps they are not wiped.  
The fractious love that responds in your banner.
