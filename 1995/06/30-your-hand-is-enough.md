Your Hand Is Enough
-------------------
A pullulation focuses its dream of a new beginning, its old ending, the new ending of the drop order -  
its profound gates. Nothing but your homogeneous curves.  
The sunrise jars you in its mortal electricity.  
A aspen loving will pulse  
the bitter heat of a planet.  
A flint focuses its dream of a ending, its old ending, the old ending of the wine bottle order -  
its honest granules.  
Like the mourning sand of natures stalks of cattail.  
Boney elders and fathers.  
For me they are grammatic.  
Only difficult and to a  
elder  
they take on time, thousand years  
  
There are many alarms in front of burned-out events.  
The late afternoon railroad tracks you in its mortal electricity.
