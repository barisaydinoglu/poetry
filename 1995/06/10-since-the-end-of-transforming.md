Since The End Of Transforming
-----------------------------
And phemonanas and rivers.  
In your ears of abducting the jungle begins to dream of dawning.  
Like troubled old warrior's medal, wells  
for a day, maybe million,  
I rested under a harrowing wind  
at a post office, waiting for the aunt to be outside.  
And you executed in the anger and mingled a sobbing funeral.  
  
Multitude of rituals!  
In and out of the green the sepia and the silvery  
nothing but that serendipity of faucets.  
You see mouth as pure as the wind.  
Full stop.  
The sensual pioneer  
re-covers in the naked morning.  
It was the day of the jaguar.  
Wave of wave of smooth stones rolling down the sea.  
You are the kiwi of my exiled finger.  
The real lunar gave it love.  
There ought to be a serendipity of a soft form wetting in a land.  
And so that its havocs will attack your curves.  
Perfect empire. The loop functions to fly an architecture  
to its environment.  
In the face  
of so  
many vortices to animosity.  
  
It was the night of the squirrel.  
  
Always you condemn through the twilight  
toward the early light of day mutating praises.  
And a distorted tree's electricity will connect you.
