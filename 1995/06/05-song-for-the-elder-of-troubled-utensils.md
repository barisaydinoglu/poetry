Song For The Elder Of Troubled Utensils
---------------------------------------
In your mouth of erupting the room begins to dream of fluttering.  
On what frail legumes expanded with electricity?  
I rustle as if amid  
a violenet dung. Nothing but that movie of tigers.  
I saw how utensils are reflected  
by the secure nature.  
Preserved  
and then magnified in the archipeligos.  
There ought to be a flesh of a sensual trouser exciting in a chimney.
