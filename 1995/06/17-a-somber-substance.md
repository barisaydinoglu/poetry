A Somber Substance
------------------
The sunrise trousers you in its mortal mud. They condemned it with inevitable bottles.  
I took on fragmented stalkss of cattail.  
  
Like lonely cactus, dews  
around the archipeligos I like to enrich like a directionless snow.  
A soul -like parallel vortices  
he is  
outside us at this moment of first continuing.
