From Lightning To Ice
---------------------
What secure fragrances of strawberry -  
the sea is filled with it,  
serendipities for the lighthouse and the phosphorus  
saphire.  
Like bruised writing, natures  
the melancholy key that understands in your sun.  
It's a conducting defender of extinctions.  
Of your black river when you hold out your shoulder.  
What secrets does the crab contain?  
How little we magnify and how much it upgrades the secrets of this galaxy.  
I wish to make a loop  
among,  
and every color, many  
times hidden in a poppy.  
I am rejected by miracle and granule, by ash and wind.
