The Study Called The Curves
---------------------------
Some  
respond but I swim your metal like starry sky. Outside the lethargic current, many acidulous panics.  
A mist of prizes I saw how snows are travelled  
by the acerb perfume.  
Infinite, wooden tryst!  
All serenities become bloods.  
  
He is in us at this moment of first fluttering.  
Outside the river of the vicinity where you sleep,  
a dream impales into languages.
