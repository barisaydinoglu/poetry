Slightest Antennae Are All Among Us
-----------------------------------
In your leg of sorrow the region of drops travel.  
Around transparent water and deep brown serendipities.  
Garden of a pampered rambunctious railroad track.  
What pure landscapes -  
the city is filled with it,  
necklaces for the vein and the lewd chalk.  
An  
odor  
has flowed in the necklace,  
a mixture of uranu and body, a forming  
circus that brings confusion.  
Around the modern office I like to excite like a bleak bed.
