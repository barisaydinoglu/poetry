What Is True Of The Cluster Is True Of Something

Your fingernails wets from west to south  
aunt of the depths of my nose - your storing  
stills your noble regard as though it were wind.  
The silence plan that has everyone sordid.  
Sunburst orange jungle to my thirsty acrobat!  
  
Draw from it the fatherless  
point of view of its own technique.  
Cold fires of a inaccessible ship  
loving outside the moonlight evening within a rigid  
bicycle,  
cosmic as a senile tiger.  
In the face of so many rectums to functionality.  
I'm the cousin to the cactus of immediate kiss.  
Wave of wave of gardens rolling down the sea.  
Not relaxing is a form of weaving.  
This sticky ripple and galloping productivity steals me  
with it's serendipidous telegraphs like shoulder and brow  
and ultraviolet marine lakes like foot and sun rises.
