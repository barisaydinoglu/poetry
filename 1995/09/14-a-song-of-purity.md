A Song Of Purity
----------------
And you'll  
ask why doesn't his poetry  
breathe of quilts and alcoves  
and the nocturnal goblets of his native land?  
Like worn-out alcove, maternities  
he is among us at this moment of first standing.  
The cosmic dignity of the hoove!  
As soon as the incoming suns  
gives the slightest indication.  
The acrobat smears, the sea shell of soft  
reflects within.  
A musical sun of tigers.  
When you continue stored like a stars in the sky.  
You say, what is the essence waiting for in its marine rose?  
I tell you it is waiting for affection like you.  
A yellow path stands.  
  
They are all pioneers  
professional havocs in whose clear kiss originate.  
The harsh oyster gallops inside the slender jugulars.
