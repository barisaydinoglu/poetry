A Song Of Sincerity
-------------------
Pockets of aluminum converted into ivory.  
The sweet-smelling custodian  
plays in the ancient morning.  
The rivers exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
outside it in darkness.  
Vein of a passed neon salt.  
I took on harsh snows.  
And you abolished in the illusion and formed a shaking stick.  
  
An odor has set against the wreath,  
a mixture of complaint and body,  
a hearing  
landscape that brings anger.  
The decadent laminated sign is changeless on your fingernails.  
Come with me to the howl of imbroglios.  
A ship is not enough to die me and keep me  
from the modern office of your aromatic mysteries.  
Our new kiss, our mineral time lines.  
What we say relinquishes to  
magnify some other fisherman  
what a identity may teach.  
  
Here I am, a unguessed ears froze in the vicinity of land.  
Brings all the gnaws circuss.
