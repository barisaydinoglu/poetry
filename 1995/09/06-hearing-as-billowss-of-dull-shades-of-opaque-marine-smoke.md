Hearing As Billowss Of Dull Shades Of Opaque Marine Smoke
---------------------------------------------------------
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
Your eyelids grows from west to west  
the bramble imposes nessecity.  
Puncture me and let my substance wet.  
A chorus of turkeys at sunset un pacified un filtered  
comes to a halt before a guitar.  
Multitude of eddies!  
In and out of the sepia the transparent and the sunburst orange  
and you fainted in the animosity and sought a striking explication.  
Around the heights I like to begin  
like a morbid lighthouse.  
Only skeleton and to a  
lady they take on time, three hundred years  
nothing but your dashing eye.  
Marine sky to my mourning phemonana!  
A sunburst orange laminated sign grows.  
A drop -like seperation  
the mist shining from my arm.  
My heart moves  
from being hushed to being secure.  
A metaphor for detail is the lack thereof.  
Rescuing toward the pasture you rescue in the heights as  
in a domestic region.  
When you magnify  
like light formed by the ice.  
A muscle -like  
rectum  
here I am, a esoteric heart petrified in the thicket of smooth sand.  
  
It's a breathing femininity of rectums.  
You are the harsh giant of a squirrel,  
the cheerless ness of the magnolium, the power of the sky.  
  
You've asked me what the cat is pacifying there with his marine toe?  
I reply, the movie knows this.  
When the night is full of torrential tail  
outside lances and boney burned-out fountains  
and the cheerless essences and the essences  
at last give forth their thirsty trash.  
Draw from it the exiled  
metaphor of its own metaphor.  
Perching the fellowship of her kiss full of decency.  
What rejects the props of love?  
Discover  
on the salivas that wait for you  
loathing the muzzled chairs, condemning the doors.  
The reasons for my respect  
are pulsed in my arm of fused quartz.  
How enriching is the natural hound and it's balanced nails?  
It was the holiday of the pheasant.  
The warmth plan that has everyone forceful.  
Pity me and let my substance return.  
  
It was the twilight of the oyster.  
The serenity soddens, the flower head of plumed  
entertains in.  
Outside the chaotic moonlight evening of torrential starry sky.  
  
Violenet weather, whirlwinds of lights like the femininity.  
Within the opaque sepia leg of the jungle.
