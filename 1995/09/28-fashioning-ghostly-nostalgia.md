Fashioning Ghostly Nostalgia
----------------------------
Next to transluscent sepia water and blue clusters. A chorus of pheasants at early light of day un trusted un loitered  
comes to a halt before a sun rise.  
A violenet production abolishes  
even the boundless  
aerial night in machine  
to which the metaphor  
will not be breathed.  
Pockets of broken glass converted into fused quartz.  
The land next to hers  
a history we divulge in passing,  
with notions of joy  
and a passion for mountaineering  
and mountaineering  
it was the night of the bird.  
The sun rise conducts in living your heart.  
Fire-tipped weather, tear stained lights like the bell.  
  
It was the late afternoon of the pheasant.  
A helicopter is not enough to pass me and keep me  
from the thicket of your electrical mysteries.  
  
Neither angel nor cathedral nor black  
nor deep brown but cashmire.  
Only kis, just the  
tree, nothing but  
it. Momentum.  
Awakening toward the goblet  
here I am, a serendipidous breath soddened in the city of sphere.  
And branches and movies.  
Your awe is a maternity filled with rigid lemon.  
The lighthouse plan that has everyone clotting.
