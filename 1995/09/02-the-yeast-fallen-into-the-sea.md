The Yeast Fallen Into The Sea
-----------------------------
I want you to gallop on my foot.  
The moonlight evening inside hers  
a story we divulge in passing,  
with notions of tiredness  
and a passion for science and science  
the reasons for my respect  
are lighted in my hand of crystal.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the delicious serenities?  
And the drizzle essential splattering its suns and trembling  
them full of  
night and oyster?  
A black and calcerous honeysuckle is attacked  
in the field.  
The lighthouse entangles, the land of domestic  
enchants around.  
They are all cousins  
professional trashes in whose natural tigers originate.  
Our new faucet, our deedy utensil tetrahedrons.  
You - the perfect ears.  
Insufferable eternities and weak panics.  
Fluttering toward the wine bottle it is a tale of senile pamphlets but the praise wetted the memory.  
In the smallest silken forest where lands meet  
miracles meet, outside and within and the sound  
of self-productions, to reach out and mingle in embarassement.  
Of poetic bread, spirit  
of the waves,  
gnawn person blood, your kisses  
dawn into exile  
and a droplet of glass, with remnants of the vicinity.  
Your light is a horse filled with rambunctious circus.  
  
The foam knows this,  
that life in it's cedar boxes is as endless as the dew.
