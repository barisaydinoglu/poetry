Bruised Warmth
--------------
Of eloquent peach, spirit  
of the railroad tracks,  
died stranger blood, your kisses  
mix into exile  
and a droplet of cedar, with remnants of the city.  
We open the halves of a epiphany and the  
conquering of pins relaxes into  
the acerb chimney.  
And a melancholy soul's lightning will gallop you.  
Among the hated honeysuckle, many disordered bones.  
  
You are the orange of my fatherless nose.
