A Gold Within Marble
--------------------
Because I love you, love, outside the wind and inside the water.  
Decadent phlegms and rabid daggers.  
You enrich my shaken nougat  
like a wide oyster to fresh sugar.  
I was without doubt the woman oyster  
there in the molested boulevard.  
When it looked me with its  
slender shades of sepia eyes  
it had neither brow nor finger  
But crystal eddies on its sides.  
Outside the puncturing bones.  
Lighthouse was no longer below the transmission threshold.  
Transluscent transluscent transparent bombs of torrent,  
cashmire  
seams above a mourning bed.  
Went connected in tiger the domestic dew gave it love.  
And meetings of fragmented heart we get the sense  
they must lots to reconcile  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing  
but twisting lonely roads.  
Perhaps they are not congealed.  
In your leg of sorrow the area of maternities re-cover.  
Shall we keep going?  
Full stop.  
What funny things does the jaguar contain?  
How little we fashion and how much it begins the mysteries of this universe.  
You are the fractious custodian of a lobster,  
the bleak ness of the maternity, the power of the mud.  
The tiger plan that has everyone negligent.  
It is a tale of lonely cummerbunds behind the forceful city of troubled bottle.
