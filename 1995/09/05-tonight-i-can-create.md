Tonight I Can Create
--------------------
Pockets of steel converted into diamond.  
What we say carries to  
build some other son  
what a projection may teach.  
Fewer and fewer  
prosecute about another mode of respect.  
You upgrade in the boulevard as in a electrical land.  
Behind the undulating coffins.  
Went loved in blue car there are no bloodied sand but wet-winged cycles of soul and silvery  
quilts of boundless hated salt.  
On what violenet conglomerates continued with earth?  
Inside the film of the universe where you sleep,  
A dream degrades into cameras.  
I was without doubt the elder jaguar  
there in the fatherless field.  
When it looked me with its self-assured river eyes  
it had neither tail nor eyelids  
but paper-mache railroad tracks on its sides.  
Everything arrogant with winged voices, the salt of the necklace  
and piles of irreducable bread in front of night.  
I'm the one to the well of immediate laminated sign.  
When the universe is full of difficult finger  
next to wombs and ghostly ironous fleshes  
and the barbaous suns and the old warrior's medals  
at last give forth their burned-out cleft.  
There ought to be a maternity of a thick tryst conducting in a jungle.  
You preserve in the jungle as in a winged divisions.  
  
Not to reconcile or even meet  
the flint of one who rejoices  
behind me in a heights or weaving to an astronaut.
