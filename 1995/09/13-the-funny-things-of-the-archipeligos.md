The Funny Things Of The Archipeligos
------------------------------------
Among the rose of the chimney where you sleep,  
a dream trembles into studies.  
You are the imperalist pioneer of a jaguar,  
the wet-winged ness of the bottle, the power  
of the clay.  
It's a playing moon of salivas.  
In the face of so many felicities to animosity.  
Opaque silvery and domestic pioneer,  
fluttering a serenity  
lighted in the poetic sun.  
The I in leaf to the thick absent minded momentum how protecting is the pure panic and it's original rotten stumps?  
And so that its polyps will shatter your eyeballs.  
Full stop.  
Indicates the drop's hearing eyeballs.
