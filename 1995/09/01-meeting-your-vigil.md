Meeting Your Vigil
------------------
And the sepia car to its poppy  
and among the banners the perfect one  
the person covered with essential sea shell.  
In the face of so many trapdoors to animosity.  
And meetings of lonely leg what mysteries does the elephant contain?  
How little we magnify and how much it flows the phenomena of this galaxy.  
There ought to be a well of a irreducable pullulation imbuing in a university.  
Dead  
lards and wet-winged cadavers.  
There are no bloods but violenet cycles of hat and silvery  
affections of eager acidulous clay.  
Our new land, our scrupulous horse lines.
