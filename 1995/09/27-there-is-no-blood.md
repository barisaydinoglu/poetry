There Is No Blood
-----------------
But I should be true to computer science, mutating among its rabid smooth stones  
so let us attempt to divulge a story devoid of minor redundancies.  
The vertical dignity of the light!  
Like the difficult aluminum of flags you are the grape of my burned-out nose.  
Neither door nor garden nor dull shades of sunburst orange  
nor opaque cashmire but opaque sunburst orange.  
Attract on the pamphlets that wait for you  
degrading the banal chairs, deforming the doors.  
Love is gone, the subject has stood.  
In the first reel, the thick uncle  
is undulated by a father. In the second  
take he returns, to breathe and to dedicate.  
Neither light nor map nor black  
nor burnt umber but sepia.  
  
In the smallest emerald silvery car I saw how necklaces are pacified  
by the absorbant smooth clay.  
A nocturnal wind of kisses.  
Fear and foam - doors of fear. The moldy banana imposes nessecity.  
Fewer and fewer  
decay about another mode of purity.  
Carry me onto your bicycle - the orange of my pencil -  
It was a skeleton business of seperation and uranus.  
In your foot of soddening the night begins to dream of discovering.  
I'd do it for the springtime in which you rejoice  
for the laws of transluscent deep brown you've woke.  
  
Frightened vortices and dead belts.  
The banal hat that entertains in your silken architecture.
