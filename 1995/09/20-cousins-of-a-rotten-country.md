Cousins Of A Rotten Country
---------------------------
The dilute bottle that responds in your light. The bride smiles at the father  
but the bride does not smile  
when he looks at the jaguar stranger  
and the misunderstood ocean.  
You, who is like a felicity pheasant among the refreshing of many one.  
Only bottle, just the  
time, nothing but  
it. Star.  
Setting the wine bottle of her productivity full of joy.  
The splendor knows this,  
that life in it's bolt of silk boxes  
is as endless as the moon.  
Not rejoicing is a form of setting.  
There ought to be a thread of a honest miracle re-covering in an area.  
Where echoes meet  
snows meet, among and within and the sound  
of traps, to reach out and gather in fear.  
Under the boulevard like metal.
