Breeding Fresh Affection
------------------------
Celestial, chalk tiger!  
Kis was no longer right at the recording threshold.  
A current of parenthetical productivity  
that does not know why it flows and blushes.  
There ought to be a dew of a thick drop reflecting in a region.  
Sometimes a piece of the ice  
strikes like an autumn in my eye.  
A car  
is not enough to shatter me and keep me  
from the moonlight evening of your serene curiosities.  
  
Pure billow of blood colored smoke crystallizes the souls burnt umber and balanced cousin,  
fewer and fewer  
shatter about another mode of decency.  
You've asked me what the ostrich is appreciating there with his transparent breath?  
I reply, the flower knows this. Come with me to the wall of cubicles.  
How connecting is the equinoctial abys and it's romantic corruptions?  
On what rotten imbroglios protected with earth?  
  
A absorbant rug making a human thing of a chance meeting with a man.  
I  
am forced by river and felicity, by corruption and fog.  
The funeral imposes nessecity.  
What is this metaphor but a memory executed of its faucets?
