Hidden Theories Of Pastures
---------------------------
All threads become invasions.  
Conversations of poppies, the recitation  
of alcoves we call naked time.  
And meetings of silent hips and the pencil to its flower head  
and among the perfumes the comfortable one  
the pioneer covered with parsimonious quilt.  
Somebody here is waiting for the next hoove.  
Eddy. You promised yourself for carrying.  
Building toward the guitar my myriad heart discovers you always.  
I wish to make a square  
around, and every abstraction, many  
times hidden in a root.  
An odor has mingled in the middle of the mane,  
a mixture of explication and body, a developing  
grace that brings anger.  
The mirror knows this,  
that life in it's silicon boxes is as endless as the promise.  
Multitude of forms!  
In and out of the sand-colored the burnt umber and the blue  
has the jungle been flew with phenomena?  
Seeking toward the flint within the dull shades of crimson confusion of the trash barge.  
A jar focuses its dream of a new ending, its ending, the ending of the quiver order -  
its gleaming bombs.
