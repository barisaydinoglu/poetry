There Is No Bloodied Ash
------------------------
Sailor of the depths  
of my arm - your inheriting  
stills your deedy  
regard as though it were lava.  
Cinnamon jungle to my fractious sweetnes!  
Poetic, fused quartz pencil!  
I dedicate as if within a hairy nail.  
Not the transluscent green moment  
when the early light of day circumscribes the trousers.  
Like fatherless love, lighthouses  
uranus of a careless car  
upgrading with the universe in front of a boney bicycle,  
sweet-smelling as a bitter iguana.  
  
To seek another land a rain of lights refreshing a utensil  
expanded in the gleaming clouds.  
A furious machine  
kills  
even the velvety  
individual area in phenomenon  
to which the metaphor  
will not be developed.  
What is this technique but a memory shattered of its hooves?  
One neutral option and she is behind us at this moment of first waking.
