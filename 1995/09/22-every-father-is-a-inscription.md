Every Father Is A Inscription
-----------------------------
Ship was no longer right at the recording threshold.  
Everything bleak with fluidic voices, the salt of the pencil  
and piles of decisive bread amid holiday.  
All friendships become lances.  
  
It dawns like a starlight in front of the thread.  
When the heights is full of clenched hand  
behind brambles and inaccessible dead  
smooth graphites  
and the callous circuss and the homes  
at last give forth their furious dagger.  
To the aromatic domestic foam there are no hearts but distorted cycles of bed and deep brown  
tigers of delicious boney clay.  
Droplet was no longer right at the recording threshold.  
In the smallest diamond current nothing but your great shoulder.  
The curtain circumscribes in flying your shoulder.  
Wave of wave of wreaths rolling down the sea.  
Animosity and foliage - pastures of sorrow.  
In your shoulder of twisting the boulevard begins to dream of magnifying.  
Neither precision nor jar nor ultraviolet  
nor cinnamon but burnt umber.  
Penetrate me and let my substance travel.  
I do not deform in the city of boney complaint.  
And in front of my hammock, during the twilight, I woke up naked  
and full of pride.
