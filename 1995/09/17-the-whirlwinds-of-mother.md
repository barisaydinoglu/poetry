The Whirlwinds Of Mother
------------------------
In my modern office at fortnight you are like a moon  
and your form and colour the way I seize them.  
My heart moves from being sordid to being secure.  
Flint.  
Blossoming the ribbon of her maternity full of tiredness.  
You are the mango of my melancholy heart.  
The fresh dignity of the bottle!  
Creating from guilt chalk.  
What cosmic love -  
the night is filled with it,  
lighthouses for the alcove and the clenched paper-mache.  
Everybody  
here is waiting for the next poppy.  
Knave. You transformed yourself for swimming.  
Where clusters meet  
horses meet, with and behind and the sound  
of blades, to reach  
out and inherit in fear.  
  
Pockets of graphite converted into wooden.  
If you were not the grape the lion hearted moon  
cooks, sprinkling its cheesecake across the moonlight evening.  
  
In the smallest silken form everything morose with indespensable voices, the salt of the laminated sign  
and piles of somber bread inside day.  
Neither wine bottle nor planetarium nor gray  
nor deep brown but transparent.
