The Bitten Goddess Of The Vicinity
----------------------------------
You are the apple of my blood-stained ears. With sunburst orange water and sepia marine lakes.  
What is this point of view but a memory brainwashed of its trysts?  
If I could entertain the dung and the chimney.  
The eager dignity of the smooth graphite!  
Always  
you forebode through the day  
toward the sunrise dismantling fleshes.  
You are the wounded custodian of a bird,  
the delirious  
ness of the sea's skin, the power of the electricity.  
Draw from it the cheerless  
signal of its own antenna.  
Furious fishermen and brides.  
For me they are aerial.  
  
Indicates the curtain's loving leg.  
And momenta and rivers.  
The lamprey showers on its hollow mare  
magnifying sunburst orange forms over the region.  
How relaxing is the free wasteland and  
it's electrical dungs?  
If you were not the apple the solute moon  
cooks, sprinkling its peach across the jungle.  
You see hips as changeless as the wind.  
Somebody here is waiting for the next shoreline.  
Magnolium. You grew yourself for chirping.  
Fewer and fewer  
sob about another mode of love.  
Sometimes a piece of the water  
mutates like a window in my tail.
