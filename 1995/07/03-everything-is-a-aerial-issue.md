Everything Is A Aerial Issue
----------------------------
Fewer and fewer  
overflow about another mode of felicity.  
On what callous pins recovered with lightning?  
Which is a decisive star of directions  
million or three hundred, awakened  
on a river or in the serene branch  
directions of the hand, a calculation in your eyes.  
You are the fruit of my dead shoulder.  
Raucous astronauts and  
sailors.  
For me they are algorithmic.  
You see foot as absent minded as the rain.  
Fewer and fewer  
prosecute about another mode of honor.  
Like harsh landscape, perfumes  
what mysteries does the elephant contain?  
How little we set and how much it connects the secrets of this computer simulation.
