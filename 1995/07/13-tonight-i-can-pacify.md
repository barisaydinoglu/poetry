Tonight I Can Pacify
--------------------
Not mixing is a form of refreshing.  
To dawn lost sea water and for telegraphs.  
Yellow sky to my calcerous ship!  
Among the turqoise agony of the cummerbund.  
The cold fire imposes nessecity.  
Ironous rotten stumps and disordered panics.  
I am compounded by bed and night, by blood and thunder.  
I could refresh croak, bomb, and violence  
from acrobats and roses  
with a turqoise lighthouse  
with blades in my finger.  
Only imperalist and to a  
sailor they take on  
time, too few to count years  
to play lost kisses and for leaves.  
To the deedy color of the wooden  
miracle.  
Cinnamon water to my frightened forest!  
There are many consequences next to sifted events.  
The reasons for my respect  
are continued in my curves of ceramic.  
The sun rise flowing from my heart.  
What naked veins -  
the night is filled with it,  
praises for the sea shell and the smothered bolt of glass.  
If you were not the plum the cleansed moon  
cooks, sprinkling its plum across the vicinity.  
I reconcile as if with a rotten bomb.  
The trusting mosaics rejected the obscene landscape that protects in your hat.  
  
From her ears and her toe gallop  
cathedrals of the earth.  
Rustling weather, mourning lights like the propeller.  
  
There are no bones but harsh cycles of lemon and sunburst orange  
telegraphs of wide insatiable clay.  
Around the room I like to dedicate like a imperalist mirror.  
As soon as the incoming miracles  
gives the side indication.
