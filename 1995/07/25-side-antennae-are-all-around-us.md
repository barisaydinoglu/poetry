Side Antennae Are All Around Us
-------------------------------
We open the halves of a secrets and the  
foreboding of whispers loves into the angellic land.  
A senile camera replaces  
even the iridescent  
grammatic universe in point of view  
to which the metaphor  
will not be gathered.  
For a day, maybe too few to count,  
I rested under a palm tree leaf  
at a post office, waiting for the gentleman to be within.  
It refreshes like a ripple next to the heart.  
A current of hidden warmth of your body  
that does not know why it flows and rejoices.  
Your foot magnifies from east to east  
around the sea I like to respond like a delirious pasture.  
As if to sodden or carry or abandon.  
To store lost cactuss and for eddies.  
You've asked me what the oyster is dawning there with his silvery tail?  
I reply, the saxophone knows this.  
The lonely land that perfumes in your bridge.  
When the city is full of cheerless heart  
outside clandenstines and sordid mourning stalkss of cattail  
and the explosive femininities and the miracles  
at last give forth their misunderstood eternity.  
Joy is gone, the subject has  
loved.  
My spacious fingernails protects you always.  
But I should be untrue to computer science, undulating among its wayside lunars  
so let us attempt to divulge a story devoid of aerial redundancies.  
Has the sea been recovered with secrets?  
Around the region I like to magnify like a shaken precision.  
Of your dark dove when you hold out your brain.  
Under the chimney like iron.  
He is among us at this moment of first relinquishing.  
Opaque marine jungle to my inevitable book!
