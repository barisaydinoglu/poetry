Pioneers Must Always Prove Their Bridges
----------------------------------------
The reasons for my respect  
are protected in my eyelids of glass.  
Neither eddy nor candle nor ultraviolet  
nor cashmire but silvery.  
In front of the curtain of the divisions where you sleep,  
a dream drops into inscriptions.  
Realized natural foliage behind the field like rusted nail.  
Realized loving femininity like the bleak broken glass of mists there are many circumstances inside hated events.  
And you disguised in the fear and travelled a condemning yeast.  
You are the mango of my windy tail.
