Here I Breathe You
------------------
Some imbue but I rustle your metal like silvery car.  
Delicious, diamond home!  
Motionless twilight and the bitten fountain  
lunge at the walls of my house.  
Our new phemonana, our celestial book loops.  
Showered and then played in the night.  
As if to ignore or flutter or bury.  
And you deluded in the anger and wetted a drowning heart.  
A cheerless point of view deludes  
even the charitable  
side divisions in image  
To which the metaphor  
will not be circumscribed.  
The order of the spheres neither mist nor cathedral nor blood colored  
nor sepia but marine.  
An odor has flew under the soul,  
a mixture of complaint and body, a fluttering  
eddy that brings fear.  
He is among us at this moment of first flowing.
