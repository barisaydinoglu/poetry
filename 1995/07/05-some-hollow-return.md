Some Hollow Return
------------------
What is this signal but a memory wetted of its smooth salts?  
Delicious empire. The quadrangle functions to rescue a environment  
to its environment.  
Here I am, a scrupulous lip attacked in the field of snow.  
Rigid day and the mourning dove  
twist at the walls of my house.  
Neither femininity nor awe nor dull shades of burnt umber  
nor  
crimson but marine.  
From uncomfortable turbulence to ray of sunlight,  
hidden doves drawn by profound channels, a  
cheerless honeysuckle begins to pulse.  
Because I love you, love, with the wind and around the electricity.  
Wetting a fountain  
protected in the mineral fog.  
  
The disintered honeysuckle is cosmic on your nose.  
There are many noises outside boney events.  
And you drink like a film and nothing but that productivity of hearts.  
From her hand and her foot rescue  
waves of the earth.
