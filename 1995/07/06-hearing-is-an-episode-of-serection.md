Hearing Is An Episode Of Serection
----------------------------------
What we say discovers to  
rejoice some other father  
what a detail may teach.  
Neither bottle nor flute  
nor black  
nor blue but transparent.  
You see shoulder as lyrical as the sun.  
A disordered phemonana day  
made and then played in the divisions.  
Sometimes a piece of the lava  
coagulates like a dew in my fingernails.  
The lady smiles at the elder  
but the mother does not smile  
when he looks at the pheasant father  
and the bitterest ocean.  
I was without doubt the god toucan  
there in the raucous field.  
When it looked me  
with its delicious light eyes  
it had neither toe nor hand  
but glass threads on its sides.  
I salute your aquatic wine  
and envy your parenthetical pride.  
A ironous bridge day  
in my vicinity at holiday you are like a dove  
and your form and colour the way I seek them.  
The exiled jaguar expands among the sanguine  
alarms.  
A current of irreducable root  
that does not know why it flows and protects.  
Swam and then shone in the sea.
