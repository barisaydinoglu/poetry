The Misunderstood Gentleman Of The Area
---------------------------------------
There are no lards but smothered cycles of echo and burnt umber  
ribbons of pure atrocious  
sand.  
Wave of wave of mists rolling down the sea.  
A loaf of bread baked with dead  
wonder and salt.  
You discover my frail seperation  
like an absorbant cat to fresh cheesecake.  
Halfway.  
And so that its wastelands will tremble your curves.  
For a day, maybe million,  
I rested under a unrelenting rain  
at a post office, waiting for the aunt to be in.
