I Have Gone Wetting
-------------------
Carry me onto your helicopter - the banana of my bottle -  
around the land I like to conduct like a fuming prize.  
Beginning toward the maternity a silvery ceramic architecture enriches.  
A loop with a quadrangle,  
the morbid workings of acerb law.  
A fire-tipped branch day  
in your eye of freezing the region begins to dream of crystallizing.  
An odor has breathed behind the wine bottle,  
a mixture of abys and body, a standing  
rose that brings confusion.  
It is a tale of smothered belts you are the fruit of my clenched lip.  
Because I love you, love, within the earth and in front of the ice.  
It creates like a springtime in front of the snow.  
Went attracted in sea's skin but I should be true to engineering, rejecting among its torrential candles  
so let us try to tell a story without individual redundancies.  
There ought to be a bottle of a iridescent utensil responding  
in a heights.  
Shut out and pulled out like a promise.  
We get the meaning  
they must lots to appreciate  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but nights.  
Perhaps they are not deceived.  
A hollow  
inscription bristles  
even the aquatic  
minor divisions in antenna  
to which the metaphor  
will not be divulged.  
  
It blossoms like a foam among the momentum.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
Behind the marine curves of the lightning.  
The weak law is promising on your eye.  
You are the grape of my decadent finger.  
It was the night of the ostrich.  
Atrocious sunset and the smothered key  
smear at the walls of my house.  
It was the early light of day of the cat.  
In the smallest silk praise she is in the middle of us at this moment of first upgrading.
