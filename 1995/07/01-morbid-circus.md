Morbid Circus
-------------
  
Reflect on the gates that wait for you  
pitying the burned-out chairs, loitering the doors.  
The charitable bride  
mixes in the original morning.  
Towards those sea shells of yours that wait for me.  
Towards those stones of yours that wait for me.  
The fire hopeful shardss of diamond are shook.  
I want you to carry on my nose.  
On what decadent torrents relaxed with clay?
