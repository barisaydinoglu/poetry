A Coat To Fashion The Stones You Respond
----------------------------------------
Some rustle but I fly your ash like necklace.  
When you trust seized like a lighthouse.  
Not to rustle or even meet  
the goblet of one who loves  
against me in a heights or crystallizing to a stranger.  
And bells and souls.  
Once there was an acidulous daughter who  
woke at parties, sitting in a square, among crowns.  
She is inside us at this moment of first attracting.  
We get the sight  
they must lots to magnify  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but nails.  
Perhaps they are not fainted.  
Directionless wounds  
and shady nails.  
Opaque burnt umber and resolute god,  
next to the green fingernails of the sky.  
  
A ultraviolet and sterile branch is impaled in the sea.  
What we say fashions to  
preserve some other bride  
what a sequence may teach.  
  
The reasons for my respect  
are refreshed in my brain of copper.  
Towards those sea water of yours that wait for me.
