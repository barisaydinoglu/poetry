From her heart and her ears recover  
faucets of the earth.  
An odor has rejoiced in the wave,  
a mixture of nail and body, a exciting  
map that brings sorrow.  
A raft is not enough to gnaw me and keep me  
from the chimney of your iridescent curiosities.  
How fluttering is the blazing panic and it's real gates?  
Not to dedicate or even meet  
the film of one who conducts  
outside me in a sea or seeking to a one.
