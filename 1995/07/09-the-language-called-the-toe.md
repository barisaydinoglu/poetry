The Language Called The Toe
---------------------------
Of your dark fragrance of strawberry when you hold out your foot. Opaque sand-colored lances of coal,  
deep brown seams above  
a wayside kiss.  
This motionless poppy and reflecting leaf abhors me  
with it's unguessed starry skies like leg and finger  
and red books like foot and stones.  
Towards those leaves of yours that wait for me.  
Draw from it the wounded  
metaphor of its own calculation.  
But I should be true to mountaineering, congealing among its violenet productivities  
so let us attempt to divulge a story devoid of alphabetic redundancies.  
Protecting toward the moon nothing but that leaf of laws.  
Full stop.  
In the smallest fused quartz grace the enduring key gave it love.  
There are no seperations but hairy cycles of quilt and cashmire  
beds of celestial morose broken glass.  
I want you to imbue on my eyelids.  
  
I'd do it for the sun in which you imbue  
for the silences of sepia you've excited.  
Imbuing the leaf of her vein full of felicity.  
  
There are no bombs but frightened cycles of wheatfield and cinnamon  
Kiss of lion hearted torrential broken glass.  
Pockets of iron converted into crystal.  
On what nauesous  
stenches upgraded with electricity?  
What flies the props of decency?
