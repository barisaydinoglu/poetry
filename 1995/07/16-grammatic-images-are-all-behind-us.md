Grammatic Images Are All Behind Us
----------------------------------
You - the starry arm.  
The boney squirrel treads outside the slender howls.  
Fall me and let my substance return.  
And fountains and flowers.  
  
When the modern office is full of whirlwinds of brow  
amid vinegars and dry fire-tipped farms  
and the browbeaten drops and the pastures  
at last give forth their wet-winged nougat.  
To seek another land all saxophones become roosters.
