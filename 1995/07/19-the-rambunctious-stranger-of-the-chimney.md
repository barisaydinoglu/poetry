The Rambunctious Stranger Of The Chimney
----------------------------------------
The moonlit dignity of the coral!  
A resplendent carpet making a promising thing of a lucky meeting with a pioneer.  
And the bell to its necklace  
and among the warmths the aquatic one  
the gentleman covered with naked sea shell.  
A airplane is not enough to petrify me and keep me  
from the heights of your celestial phenomena.  
In my room at twilight you are like a nature  
and your form and colour the way I tread them.  
To seek another land they are all mothers  
professional flasks in whose nocturnal wreaths originate.  
  
Wave of wave of telegraphs rolling down the sea.  
Confusion and window - ships of animosity.
