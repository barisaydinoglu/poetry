The Inscription Of Algorithmic Points
-------------------------------------
It is a tale of careless violas as soon as the incoming ribbons  
gives the slightest indication.  
It was the day of the jaguar.  
Like crooked energy, peaces  
the browbeaten prize that recovers in your sphere.  
It was the day of the lobster.  
My heart moves from being harsh to being monastic.  
I stayed made and cashmire  
in the middle of the region.  
The darknes imposes nessecity.  
Sometimes a piece of the lightning  
imprisons like a magnolium in my mouth.  
  
In my sea at night you are like a essence  
and your form and colour the way I return them.  
Serendipidous, crystal sun rise!
