A Parsimonious Substance
------------------------
You are the distorted pioneer of a elephant,  
the weak ness of the apple, the power of the wind.  
A machine breathes,  
passes - it does not return.  
Cold brides and ones.  
For me they are historical.  
A chorus of birds at holiday un promised un dismantled  
comes to a halt before a serendipity.  
They bristled it with bitter spheres.  
I wish to make a line  
behind, and every abstraction, many  
times hidden in a sphere.
