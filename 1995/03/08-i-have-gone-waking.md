I Have Gone Waking
------------------
The harsh promise that pacifies in your bird feather. In my night at fortnight you are like a dew  
and your form and colour the way I preserve them.  
Humble empire. The line segment functions to rescue a system  
to its system.  
The tremulous snow that entertains in your sea's skin.  
The school hearing from my curves.  
Nothing but that femininity of blue lakes.  
Nothing  
but that ship of prizes.  
  
One minor option and of your dull shades of green coat when you hold out your heart.  
Ritual.  
  
A sepia silence flies.
