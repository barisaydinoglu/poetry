There Is No Dust
----------------
Which is a free foliage of directions  
million or too many to count, gathered  
on a pasture or in the wide map  
directions of the nose, a calculation in your breaths.  
As if to disguise or make or deceive.  
One neutral option and enduring, wooden lighthouse!  
Multitude of flutes!  
In and out of the crimson the sand-colored and the transparent  
Inside the sea like broken glass.  
You see hips as secure as the clouds.  
I  
want you to circumscribe on my arm.  
The reasons for my respect  
are crystallized in my lip of glass.  
In your nose of abandoning the archipeligos begins to dream of exciting.  
And you trust like a trouser and once there was a dead mother who  
rose at parties, sitting in a loop, among mirrors.  
I stayed dawned  
and burnt umber  
in the thicket.  
To the slender color of the silken writing.
