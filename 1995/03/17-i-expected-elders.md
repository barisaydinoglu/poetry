I Expected Elders
-----------------
It's a recovering fragrance of strawberry of complaints.  
To wet lost writings and for homes.  
What is this phenomenon but a memory abandoned of its forms?  
Not the blue moment  
when the midnight rescues the shadess of cinnamon.  
And you perfume like a soul and you create in the land as in a sensual sea.
