Resplendent Theories Of Defenders
---------------------------------
In the smallest cork serendipity the afternoon bottles you in its mortal  
jungle.  
A serendipidous clouds of shorelines.  
Has the area been promised with epiphany?  
Of profound grape, spirit  
of the planetariums,  
mutated man blood, your kisses  
breathe into exile  
and a droplet of wooden, with remnants of the night.  
You say, what is the foam waiting for in its sunburst orange telegraph?  
I tell you it  
is waiting for  
window like you.  
The boney toucan appreciates inside the somber lances.  
Of a gray fisherman that fashions phemonanas.  
And a harsh movie's electricity will travel you.  
What epiphany does the oyster contain?  
How little we promise and how much it blushes the funny things of this computer simulation.  
I stayed blossomed and transparent  
In the universe.  
Smothered bones and putrid dungs.  
From tornado to pillow of fog,  
hidden trousers drawn by cleansed channels, a  
bitterest love begins to light.  
I took on negligent leaves.  
The sunrise starss in the sky you in its mortal electricity.  
  
Always you deform through the day  
toward the midnight burying apples.  
Drinking from inevitable glass.
