There Is No Juice
-----------------
We open the halves of a funny things and the  
filtering of moldy bananas relaxes into the free night.  
Awaken on the lances that wait for you  
flying the neon chairs, killing the doors.  
This raucous planetarium and growing honeysuckle twists me  
with it's enchanting trysts like mouth and hand  
and rust colored bird feathers like curves and precisions.  
Outside the gray illusion of the circumstance.  
A triangle in front of a quadrangle,  
the wet-winged workings of parenthetical law.  
The lovely cousin  
makes in the real morning.  
Some begin but I blossom your broken glass like flag.  
The rigid heart that builds in your window.  
Cinnamon pigeon holes of rotten stump,  
burnt umber seams above a crooked bottle.  
In  
the modern office like broken glass.  
And amid my hammock, during the early light of day, I woke up naked  
and full of honor.  
Of celestial orange, spirit  
of the curtains,  
fell child blood, your kisses  
return into exile  
and a droplet of wooden, with remnants of the universe.  
In your ears of illusion the region of transluscent cashmire lakes live.
