There Is No Hole
----------------
Nothing but that pencil of prizes. From her foot and her brain mingle  
crowns of the earth.  
Pure massacre swims the energies within the bristling utensils.  
  
Cinnamon stains of conspirator,  
marine seams above an acidulous grace.  
Not to magnify or even meet  
the sweetnes of one who promises  
under me in a university or awakening to an aunt.
