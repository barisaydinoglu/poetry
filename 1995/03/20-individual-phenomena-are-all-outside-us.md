Individual Phenomena Are All Outside Us
---------------------------------------
I saw how muscles are breathed  
by the parsimonious guitar.  
Unguessed empire. The loop functions to circumscribe a system  
to its environment.  
Inside the windy flower head, many bruised conglomerates.  
Be guided by the promising phemonana's stone.  
A red and silent mist is undulated in the boulevard.  
Pockets of iron converted into silicon.  
Like lonely roads congealing next to coats.  
But the starry sky returned the memory.  
  
A bottle reflecting will travel  
the lashed earth of a planet.  
Violenet bombs and delirious egoes.
