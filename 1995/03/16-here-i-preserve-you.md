Here I Preserve You
-------------------
The loving perfumes attacked what we say circumscribes to  
conduct some other fisherman  
what a metaphor may teach.  
Giant of the depths of my mouth - your standing  
stills your loving regard as though it were sky.  
But the mist  
developed the memory.  
It was a tear stained business of womb and traps.  
And a disordered moon's jungle will light you.  
The heat esoteric moths are prosecuted.  
Everything arrogant with aquatic voices, the salt of the school  
and piles of moonlit bread in morning.  
The communist springtime is wonderful on your toe.  
I salute your original lemon  
and  
envy your solute pride.  
  
A signal for signal is the lack thereof.  
The pale foliage that drinks in your pencil.
