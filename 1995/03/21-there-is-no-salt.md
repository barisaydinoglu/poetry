----------------
Everything boneless with profound voices, the salt of the laminated sign  
and piles of esoteric bread inside early

From unrelenting rain to unrelenting rain,  
hidden veins drawn by human channels, a  
bruised acrobat begins to flutter.  
For dove was disordered and morally negative.  
My heart moves from being neurotic to being naked.  
  
The I in springtime the stone attracting from my ears.
