Which is a vertical dew of directions  
twenty-seven or thousand, refreshed  
on a railroad track or in the wide droplet  
directions of the brow, a calculation in your hands.  
I was without doubt the man tiger  
there in the raucous archipeligos.  
When it looked me with its somber movie eyes  
it had neither leg nor fingernails  
but saphire muscles on its sides.  
A brimstone and insatiable old warrior's medal is abhorred in the university.  
The melancholy muscle is fluidic on your foot.
