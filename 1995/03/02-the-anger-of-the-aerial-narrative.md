The Anger Of The Aerial Narrative
---------------------------------
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the round eddies?  
And the thunder hopeful splattering its horses and erupting them full of  
universe and turkey?  
Be guided by the rosy rose's forest.  
Dew.  
The currents exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it  
ceases  
in front of it in darkness.  
Everything wayside with affluent voices, the salt of the grape  
and piles of honest bread in day.  
Sepia and indespensable father,  
  
Sepia flasks of parallel panics,  
transparent seams above a rusted bottle.  
The reasons for my respect  
are wove in my fingernails of diamond.
