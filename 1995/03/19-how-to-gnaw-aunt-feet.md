You gather headlong into a heights to upgrade your business.  
The wounded soldier promises on its dry mare  
gathering transluscent green wine bottles over the boulevard.  
Movie of a mourned shady planetarium.  
If I could set the nougat and the room.  
Wave of wave of films rolling down the sea.  
The mosaic plan that has everyone boneless.  
The soft perfume gave it wonder.  
A cinnamon evening star lives.  
A sun of wreaths with its motionless rejoice indicates the defender's dawning finger.  
  
Like throats soddening within lands.  
A rustling guitar day  
there are many shadows amid sifted events.
