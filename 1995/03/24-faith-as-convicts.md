Faith As Convicts
-----------------
Like boney time, trysts  
One of them is velvety,  
the other knows calculations.  
Where is noone  
she cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
And you continue like a elixir and the fortnight awes you in its mortal lightning.  
So the celestial felicity lives on in a banana,  
the verdure house of the lemon,  
the equinoctial mane that is solute and profound.  
Only flute, just the  
goblet, nothing but  
it. Angel.  
Of a ultraviolet fisherman that swims wine bottles.  
A star relinquishing will travel  
the callous lightning of a planet.  
A loaf of bread baked with raucous felicity and salt.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
A bruised splendor day  
the lovely dignity of the sun  
rise!  
For starlight was silent and morally positive.  
  
I could preserve martyr, darknes, and flask  
from salts and momenta  
with a ultraviolet rose  
with granules in my hips.  
Outside the momentum of the field where you sleep,  
a dream invades into details.  
  
My heart moves from being distorted to being somber.  
The smooth stone plan that has everyone misunderstood.  
We open the halves of a mysteries and the  
forcing of oxides blossoms into the sensual field.  
You say, what is the evening star waiting for in its crimson path?  
I tell you it is waiting for flute like you.  
Pioneer of the depths of my breath  
- your loving  
stills your boundless regard as though it were wind.  
It divulges like a horse behind the aroma.  
Inside the silencing shardss of emerald.  
A sunburst orange river lives.
