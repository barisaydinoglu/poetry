Projection Without The Bone
---------------------------
And the map to its defender  
and among the guitars the wonderful one  
the gentleman covered with friendly coral.  
Built and then  
breathed in the jungle.  
Come with me to the wall of depths.  
My heart moves from being lashed to being handsome.  
Pure belt lives the natures around the deep brown  
curves of the lightning.  
Silvery jungle to my explosive sun!  
A nocturnal carpet making a plumed thing of a impossible meeting with a uncle.  
The sunrise trysts you in its mortal clay.  
The I in serendipity sand-colored lava to my boney stars in the sky!  
I'd do it for the flower in which you return  
for the gardens of yellow you've shone.  
Our new perfume, our electrical heart lines.
