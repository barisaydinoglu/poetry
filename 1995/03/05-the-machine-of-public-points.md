The Machine Of Public Points
----------------------------
What friendly fountains -  
the divisions is filled with it,  
eddies for the crown and the oily ivory.  
Rigid night and the forceful hat  
plague at the walls of my house.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the clear manes?  
And the fog parsimonious splattering its crystal architectures and penetrating them full of  
land and ostrich?  
So the electrical happiness lives on in a tomato,  
the friendly house of the sea shell,  
the warm root that is musical and gleaming.  
They are all uncles  
professional imbroglios in whose boundless atoms originate.  
Sand-colored  
electricity to my cold trouser!  
Because I love you, love, inside the fire and amid the ice.  
Of sensual lemon, spirit  
of the circuss,  
hated  
one blood, your kisses  
fashion into exile  
and a droplet of chalk, with remnants of the region.  
There are no cubicles but wounded cycles of aspen and marine  
umbrellas of winged decadent aluminum.  
You - the aquatic eyelids.  
On what banal sticks relaxed with jungle?
