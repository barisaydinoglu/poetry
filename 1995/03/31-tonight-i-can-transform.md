Tonight I Can Transform
-----------------------
All lighthouses become pamphlets.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
When you continue rescued like a ritual.  
My heart moves from being wounded to being brandishing.  
The shoreline plan that has everyone delirious.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the esoteric beds?  
And the fog parenthetical splattering its books and rejecting them full of  
moonlight evening  
and iguana?  
You rejoice headlong into a chimney to rustle your business.
