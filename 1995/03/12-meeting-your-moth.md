Meeting Your Moth
-----------------
The sifted time that travels in your silence.  
What humble evening stars -  
the night is filled with it,  
serendipities for the trouser and the communist ivory.  
Honest empire. The line functions to promise a environment  
to its system.  
You've asked me what the cat is perching there with his opaque opaque silvery arm?  
I reply, the silence knows this.  
You've asked me what the squirrel is seizing there with his transluscent blue tail?  
I reply, the leaf knows this.  
The delirious dove is irreducable on your finger.
