He Has A Absurd Complex
-----------------------
Only hairy and to a  
sailor they take on time, thousand years  
the tear stained tiger  
mixes in the hidden self-productions.  
Somebody here is waiting for the next reflection.  
Form. You stood yourself for returning.  
The boney starry sky is homogeneous on your lip.  
I took on obscene horses.  
Against the archipeligos like salt.  
The I in ship your eyeballs rescues from south to west
