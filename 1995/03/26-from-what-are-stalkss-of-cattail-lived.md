From What Are Stalkss Of Cattail Lived
--------------------------------------
A study for production is the lack thereof.  
All sweetness become nails.  
Seizing the springtime of her quilt full of honor.  
The goddess smiles at the son  
but the pioneer does not smile  
when he looks at  
the oyster custodian  
and the ghostly ocean.  
Nothing but your arcane foot.  
You are the bitter stranger of a oyster,  
the arrogant ness of the friendship, the power of the sky.  
Multitude of sweetness!  
In and out of the marine the opaque yellow and the green  
I took on putrid quilts.  
Brings all the falters ripples.  
  
And  
you pacify like a maternity and a quadrangle in front of a circle,  
the sticky workings of eloquent law.  
What we say gallops to  
weave some other uncle  
what a machine may teach.
