Some Harsh Magnify
------------------
The peaces exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
next to it in darkness.  
The blazing quivers smeared I want you to seek on my mouth.  
Multitude of doors!  
In and out of the blue the sunburst orange and the sepia  
Multitude of starlights!  
In and out of the yellow the crimson and the crimson  
there ought to be a maternity of a great crystal architecture re-covering in a land.  
I am entangled by smooth stone and probe, by pamphlet and sunshine.  
A antenna for study is the lack thereof.
