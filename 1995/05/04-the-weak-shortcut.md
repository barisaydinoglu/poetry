The Weak Shortcut
-----------------
In the face of so many conspirators to functionality.  
Your poppy is a knave filled with mourning circus.  
Fewer and fewer  
die about another mode of wonder.  
In the smallest chalk sphere multitude  
of candles!  
In and out of the sepia the cinnamon and the sepia  
I was without doubt the stranger tiger  
there in the nauesous city.  
When it looked me with its absorbant railroad track eyes  
it had neither curves nor eyelids  
but  
chalk pastures on its sides.  
Like pale root, productivities  
a loaf of bread baked with tear stained felicity and salt.  
Under the weak sea of shaken shades of transluscent blue.  
The moth rejoices on its thirsty mare  
perching cinnamon currents over the region.
