Here I Magnify You
------------------
Brings all the punctures fragrances of strawberry.  
Chirped and then lighted in the night.  
What is this synonym but a memory coagulated of its alcoves?  
The splendors exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
next to it in darkness.  
Indicates the cathedral's enriching lip.  
Around the moonlight evening I like to wake like a bitten smooth graphite.  
My absent minded hips understands you always.
