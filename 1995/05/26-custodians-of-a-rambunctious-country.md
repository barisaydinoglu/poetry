Custodians Of A Rambunctious Country
------------------------------------
A loaf of bread baked with morbid love and salt. Everything tenacious with promising voices, the salt of the awe  
and piles of rosy bread within fortnight.  
Sand-colored ashes of ash,  
silvery seams above a chaotic hoove.  
A poetic clouds of love.  
To the sensible  
perfect emerald architecture inside the furious mane, many smothered funerals.  
Like receptacles replacing behind suns.  
To the unguessed sensible writing like the calcerous broken glass of wine bottles our new perfume, our winged jar quadrangles.  
A frightened study coddles  
even the noble  
technical chimney in identity  
to which the metaphor  
will not be promised.  
The serenity knows this,  
that life  
in it's saphire boxes is as endless as the muscle.
