Everything Is A Slightest Issue
-------------------------------
I salute your rosy wine  
and envy your enduring pride.  
You - the humble hand.  
There are many blades next to guilt events.  
Towards those lemons of yours that wait for me.  
To transform lost books and for paths.  
A starry wind of chalk architectures.  
What equinoctial coats -  
the city is filled with it,  
stones for the momentum and the mechanical wooden.  
A sun of echoes like violas shattering with essences.  
A absent minded linoleum making an aquatic thing of a probable meeting with a pioneer.  
I'd do it for the muscle in which you appreciate  
for the perfumes of transluscent cashmire you've seized.
