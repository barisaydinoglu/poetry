The Inevitable Pioneer Of The Room
----------------------------------
You say, what is the wine bottle waiting for in its transluscent marine door?  
I tell you it is waiting for river bank like you. Like tenacious planetarium, fleshes  
conversations of dews, the recitation  
of precisions we call human promise.  
Neither ripple nor star nor opaque rust colored  
nor marine but sand-colored.  
Wave of wave of lemons rolling down the sea.  
My heart moves from being lethargic to being affluent.  
You live slowly into a field to tread your business.  
Fewer and fewer  
loiter about another mode of respect.
