Since The End
-------------
In your brow of beligerance the city of starss in the sky breathe. The plumed elder  
lights  
in the unguessed morning.  
The lightning homogeneous funerals are smeared.  
  
Like delirious wine bottle, farms  
but I should be true to mountaineering, filtering among its nauesous alcoves  
so let us try to tell a story without historical redundancies.  
Wave of wave of river banks rolling down the sea.
