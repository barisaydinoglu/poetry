Since The Beginning Of Dawning
------------------------------
Full stop.  
Inside the thicket like salt.  
Treading from silent cork.  
In the middle of the university like aluminum.  
Conversations of flints, the recitation  
of circuss we call pure well.  
It was the sunrise of the squirrel.  
Brings all the executes reflections.  
It was the early light of day of the cat.  
  
I saw how flower heads are stood  
by the sweet-smelling mirror.  
There ought to be a railroad track of an absorbant breakfast shining in a city.
