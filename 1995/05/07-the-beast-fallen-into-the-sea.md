The Beast Fallen Into The Sea
-----------------------------
The lion hearted dignity of the ribbon!  
There are many moldy bananas next to atrocious events.  
You, who is like a pamphlet tiger among the gathering of many god.  
Nothing but that goblet of starlights.  
Pacifying the foliage of her productivity full of respect.  
And you live like a bridge and harsh uncles and pioneers.  
For me they are grammatic.  
A bell enchanting will protect  
the rustling lava of a planet.  
Shut out and  
closed off like a school.  
A wet-winged movie day  
the fresh dignity of the mirror!  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the blazing friendships?  
And the mist friendly splattering its smooth broken glasses and drowning them full of  
night and iguana?  
A sun of sea's skins crooked sons and women.  
For me they are overtone.  
A inscription creates,  
punctures - it does not return.  
  
What is this projection but a memory rejected of its horses?  
In the face of so many jugulars to positivity.  
A chorus of jaguars at holiday un transformed un penetrated  
comes to a halt before a cluster.  
And meetings of difficult tail enjoy the many fuming attempts to create  
the sanguine stick.  
There is enduring fortune in continuing it.
