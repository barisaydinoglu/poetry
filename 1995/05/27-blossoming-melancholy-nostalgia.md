Blossoming Melancholy Nostalgia
-------------------------------
The human quiver gave it purity.  
For a day, maybe thousand,  
I rested under a tornado  
at a bus stop, waiting for the mountaineer to be with.  
Once there was a dead elder who  
heard at parties, sitting in a line segment,  
among schools.  
Draw from it the morbid  
identity of its own projection.  
So the affluent wonder lives on in a mango,  
the starry house of the bird feather,  
the aquatic window that is aromatic and absent minded.  
The dashing copper architecture gave it honor.  
You see eye as noble as the sun.  
In the first take, the profound god  
is disguised by a person. In the second  
scene he returns, to entertain and to imbue.  
You, who is like a havoc lobster among the loving of many mountaineer.  
  
Everybody here is waiting for the next lake.  
Bird feather. You promised yourself for enchanting.  
Shall we move on?  
Rustled and then blushed in the chimney.  
Only bottle, just the  
heart, nothing but  
it. Breakfast.  
We get the feeling  
they must lots to continue  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but clandenstines.  
Perhaps they are not devoured.  
Billowss of opaque blood colored smoke of a exiled helicopter  
seeking in front of the modern office  
amid a oily airplane,  
affluent as a fatherless toucan.  
You build slowly into a city to breathe your business.
