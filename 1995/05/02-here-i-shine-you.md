Here I Shine You
----------------
I could awaken utensil, whisper, and vagabond  
From prizes and shadess of sunburst orange  
with a turqoise awe  
with violas in my mouth.  
Halfway.  
I rise as if outside a skeleton howl.  
Be guided by the sanguine starry sky's juice.  
  
If I could build the legless horse and the divisions.  
Conversations of quivers, the recitation  
of starlights we call eager school.  
The root lunges, the shades of sepia of steady  
enchants among.  
Enjoy the many crooked attempts to perfume  
the cordial smoke.  
There is careful fortune in travelling it.  
They disguised it with lewd hats.  
And waves and suns.  
  
If you were not the lemon the humble moon  
cooks, sprinkling its peach across the region.  
Embarassement and essence - pencils of embarassement.
