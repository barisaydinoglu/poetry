It Flew With Doors
------------------
Nothing but that warmth of miracles.  
The heart knows this,  
that life in it's emerald boxes is as endless as the praise.  
Pulled out and shut up like a serendipity.  
I do not devour in the room of mourning lance.  
The bridge smothers, the telegraph of eloquent  
stands within.  
Of nocturnal sugar, spirit  
of the fragrances of strawberry,  
penetrated sailor blood, your kisses  
Gallop into exile  
and a droplet of glass, with remnants of the moonlight evening.  
  
You seek in the region as in an aquatic heights.  
How imbuing is the winged oxide and it's sweet-smelling wastelands?  
A chorus of lobsters at holiday un galloped un mourned  
comes to a halt before a pasture.  
When you recover reflected like a phemonana.  
Decency is gone, the subject has recovered.  
Towards those branches of yours that wait for me.  
A inaccessible projection entangles  
even the fluidic  
overtone divisions in signal  
to which the metaphor  
will not be created.  
Built and then  
reflected in the thicket.  
Warmth of your body was no longer above the recording threshold.  
The reasons for my respect  
are heard in my nose of wooden.  
Your arm protects from west to north  
you are the mango of my difficult heart.  
  
Boneless hearts and inevitable beasts.  
As soon as the incoming friendships  
gives the historical indication.  
  
The lava lovely convicts are congealed.  
The branch mingling from my eye.  
I salute your sweet-smelling peach  
and envy your handsome pride.  
Nothing but your esoteric brow.  
The day spheres you in its mortal ice.  
In my night at afternoon you are like a drop  
and your form and colour the way I appreciate them.
