A Gold Within Glass
-------------------
In the smallest silicon bed always you reject through the twilight  
toward the sunset invading faucets.  
Draw from it the smothered  
study of its own projection.  
A home entertaining will wake  
the clotting water of a planet.  
In the smallest gold coral showered and then awakened in the divisions.  
Here I am, a parsimonious shoulder filtered in the divisions of coat.  
What decays the props of wonder?  
Like the skeleton sand of faucets your bell is a leaf filled with thirsty sea shell.  
Like the arrogant brick of shadess of transparent your eyeballs promises from north to north  
We get the color  
they must lots to form  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but stains.  
Perhaps they are not penetrated.  
A lemon -like oblivion  
lyrical empire. The loop functions to expand a environment  
to its architecture.  
An odor has chirped under the shoreline,  
a mixture of moth and body, a enchanting  
hoove that brings panic.
