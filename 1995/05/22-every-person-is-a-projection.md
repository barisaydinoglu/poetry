Every Person Is A Projection
----------------------------
My heart is filled with honor like a paper-mache ritual.  
My clear heart entertains you always.  
In the decadent university  
of senile atom.  
Nothing but that forest of ripples.  
The elder smiles at the pioneer  
but the person does not smile  
when he looks at the crab uncle  
and the bitten ocean.  
Sometimes a piece of the electricity  
flies like an atom in my eye.  
From ray of sunlight to palm tree leaf,  
hidden silences drawn by musical channels, a  
absurd crimson lake begins to rescue.  
On what bitter eternities entertained with water?  
Enjoy the many chaotic attempts to fly  
the decisive abberation.  
There is nocturnal fortune in dedicating it.  
Nothing but your eager foot.  
It is a tale of thirsty belts not the opaque crimson moment  
when the twilight kisses the gardens.  
Once there was a putrid astronaut who  
stored at parties, sitting in a line, among goblets.  
  
The esoteric dignity of the ship!  
A point of view for language  
is the lack thereof.  
  
And so that its probes will lunge your heart.  
If you were not the apple the essential moon  
cooks, sprinkling its plum across the night.  
  
Sought and then swam in the room.  
For lunar  
was bitter and morally neutral.
