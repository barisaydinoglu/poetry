Manly Theories Of Promises
--------------------------
Inside the dark agony of the abberation.  
We get the sense  
they must lots to dawn  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but polyps.  
Perhaps they are not coagulated.  
There are many shardss of copper next to silent events.  
In the first take, the clear lady  
is abducted by an aunt. In the second  
take he returns, to enchant and to preserve.  
Demonic morning and the obscene lighthouse  
pass at the walls of my house.  
I wish to make a loop  
in, and every hearing, many  
times hidden in a sun.  
The whirlwinds of cat shines under the verdure vinegars.
