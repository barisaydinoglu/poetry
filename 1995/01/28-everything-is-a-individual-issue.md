Everything Is A Individual Issue
--------------------------------
As if to petrify or pulse or loathe.  
A sordid antenna crushes  
even the balanced  
neutral divisions in projection  
to which the metaphor  
will not be mixed.  
This melancholy silence and entertaining momentum wets me  
with it's serene droplets like lip and toe  
and gray foliages like eyeballs and writings.  
An odor has  
magnified in the middle of the juice,  
a mixture of pin and body, a blushing  
foam that brings sorrow.
