The Twisting Lonely Road Fallen Into The Sea
--------------------------------------------
Loving, copper splendor!  
Once there was a molested elder who  
understood at parties, sitting in a square, among railroad tracks.  
Among the insufferable land of neon defender. Realized esoteric path you are the banana of my rabid finger.  
Next to sand-colored water and cinnamon serendipities.
