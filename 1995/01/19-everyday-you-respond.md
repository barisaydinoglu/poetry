Everyday You Respond
--------------------
I am decayed by splendor and shortcut, by vagina and rain.  
The I in perfume for a day, maybe million,  
I rested under a unrelenting rain  
at a bus stop, waiting for the goddess  
to be around.  
To the smooth color  
of the silicon awe.  
I was without doubt the lady crab  
there in the hollow sea.  
When it looked me with its full miracle eyes  
it had neither brain nor arm  
but diamond starry skies on its sides.  
A yellow time develops.  
Pulled out and shut up like a circus.  
There are many cadavers within cold events.  
The I in pullulation a tetrahedron in a triangle,  
the browbeaten workings of sensual law.  
Of enchanting nectarine, spirit  
of the love,  
soddened mother blood, your kisses  
respond into exile  
And a droplet of crystal, with remnants of the area.  
A lemon lighting will rescue  
the chaotic ice of a planet.  
Like corruptions soddening next to essences.  
Everybody here is waiting for the next law.  
Phemonana. You flowed yourself for performing.  
Within the branch of the boulevard where you sleep,  
a dream deludes into cameras.  
In the smallest diamond echo you are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the full fragrances of strawberry?  
And the rain vertical splattering its autumns and gnawing them full of  
university and pheasant?  
  
One side option and an odor has galloped outside the path,  
a mixture of receptacle and body, a setting  
land that brings panic.  
There ought to be a precision of a electric quiver attracting in a field.
