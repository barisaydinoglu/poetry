In the electrifying massacres. So the parenthetical happiness lives on in a fruit,  
the parenthetical house of the law,  
the essential  
coat that is brandishing and gleaming.  
When you divulge like praise blushed by the water.  
Went rejoiced in film and  
the eddy to its stone  
and among the shadess of cashmire the eloquent one  
the gentleman covered with aromatic farm.  
Where banners meet  
crowns meet, outside and behind and the sound  
of shrapnels, to reach out and fly in confusion.  
I stayed fashioned and cinnamon  
among the land.
