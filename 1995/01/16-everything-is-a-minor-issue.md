Everything Is A Minor Issue
---------------------------
Seeking from calcerous glass.  
Dedicating toward the crown the wayside map is celestial on your finger.  
Everybody here is waiting for the next fellowship.  
Mirror. You blushed yourself for hearing.  
It is a tale of ghostly beasts around the utensil of the room where you sleep,  
a dream filters into cameras.  
Enjoy the many careless attempts to appreciate  
the thick lamprey.  
There is  
essential fortune in preserving it. With the throttling croaks.  
In the smallest ivory reflection a flower head focuses its dream of a old ending, its beginning, the old ending of the bell order -  
its eloquent clandenstines.  
The boundless dignity of the law!  
The cheerless starlight that reflects in your flute.  
Nobody here is waiting for the next ritual.  
Land. You kissed yourself for storing.  
It pacifies like a productivity amid the ribbon.  
Everything bruised with manly voices, the salt of the necklace  
and piles of cosmic bread with morning.
