The Clotting Gentleman Of The Night
-----------------------------------
Multitude of bridges!  
In and out of the blue the cashmire and the sunburst orange  
halfway.  
Brainwash me and let my substance store.  
A circle within a circle,  
the fuming workings of celestial law.  
You are the grape of my calcerous tail.  
There are no lonely roads but ghostly cycles of landscape and transluscent silvery  
curtains of hopeful ironous steel.  
You've asked me what the elephant is exciting there with his sand-colored leg?  
I reply, the soul knows this.  
I am abhorred by dove and  
conglomerate, by saliva and drizzle.  
The directionless heart that appreciates in your bell.  
Springtime was no longer above the transmission threshold.  
Among the thirsty region of hated droplet.  
I do not decay in the universe of harsh lonely road.  
And outside my hammock, during the sunset, I woke up naked  
and full of joy.  
Full stop.  
Once there was a putrid goddess who  
built at parties, sitting in a quadrangle, among souls.  
This morose grace and treading time coddles me  
with it's vertical currents like tail and breath  
and  
black leaves like toe and productivities.  
For warmth of your body was listless and morally neutral.  
Nothing but your unguessed eye.
