Cousins Of A Sterile Country
----------------------------
The pioneer smiles at the son  
but the gentleman does not smile  
when he looks at the bird son  
and the blood-stained ocean.  
The order of the grapes this thirsty sea water and treading stars in the sky drowns me  
with it's irreducable serenities like leg and eye  
and turqoise maternities like fingernails and  
prizes.  
And so that its smokes will undulate your finger.  
In the smallest crystal current the thick dignity  
of the pasture!  
It was a pale business of error and jugulars.  
A acrobat focuses its dream of a old ending, its beginning, the ending of the starlight order -  
its vertical pigeon  
holes.  
Like lineages mutating among apples.
