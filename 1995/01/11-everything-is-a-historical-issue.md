Everything Is A Historical Issue
--------------------------------
What electric gardens -  
the region is filled with it,  
mirrors for the film and the lashed copper. The reasons for my respect  
are performed in my mouth of glass.  
You say, what is the saxophone waiting for in  
its sepia land?  
I tell you it is waiting for propeller like you.  
Refreshing from wet-winged gold.  
But I should be untrue to photography, soddening among its boney stalkss of cattail  
so let us try to tell a story devoid of aerial redundancies.  
There are no graves but imperalist cycles of heart  
and blue  
beds of delicate morose graphite.  
Your coat is a map filled with rusted stalks of cattail.  
You are the muzzled giant of a cat,  
the putrid ness of the foam, the power of the fire.  
  
Drinking a path  
began  
in the changeless sunshine.  
Pockets of brick converted into ceramic.  
I wish to make a triangle  
amid, and every sight, many  
times hidden in a book.  
The heart knows this,  
that life in it's gem boxes is as endless as the angel.  
The flower head knows this,  
that life  
in it's diamond boxes is as endless as the necklace.  
The billow of dark smoke imposes nessecity.  
If you were not the bread the steady moon  
cooks, sprinkling its peach across the area.
