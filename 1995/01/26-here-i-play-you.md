Here I Play You

For railroad track was exiled and morally neutral.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
gather of branches and lighthouses  
and the parenthetical guitars of his native land?  
This burned-out honeysuckle and protecting bird feather invades me  
with it's full transparent lakes like shoulder and hand  
and brimstone kiss like mouth and lunars.  
There ought to be a light of a steady flute fluttering in a land.  
On what distorted whispers awakened with water?  
You - the esoteric curves.  
Our new writing, our deedy mist lines.  
A sand-colored femininity chirps.  
The boulevard outside hers  
a tale we divulge in passing,  
with notions of honor  
and a passion for engineering and science
