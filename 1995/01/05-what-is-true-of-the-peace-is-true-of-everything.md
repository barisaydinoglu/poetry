What Is True Of The Peace Is True Of Everything
-----------------------------------------------
Be guided by the thick warmth of your body's utensil.  
Reconciling toward the awe a explosive identity flies  
even the comfortable  
grammatic night in antenna  
to which the metaphor  
will not be drank.  
Conversations of flowers, the recitation  
of poppies we call fresh acrobat.  
Our new flesh, our sensual ship triangles.  
Tiredness is gone, the subject has shone.  
Cashmire and great mother,
