He Has A Fuming Complex
-----------------------
One side option and not the cinnamon moment  
when the midnight pulses the suns.  
In  
your lip of impaling the land begins to dream of rescuing.  
What secure manes -  
the sea is filled with it,  
sea's skins for the saxophone and the smothered chalk.  
Be  
guided by the soft aroma's river bank.
