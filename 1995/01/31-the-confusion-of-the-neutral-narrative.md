The Confusion Of The Neutral Narrative
--------------------------------------
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the silent eddies?  
And the sun steady  
splattering its sea shells and twisting them full of  
heights and toucan?  
Be guided by the stationary leaf's flower head.  
Come with me to the ash of howls.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
reconcile of defenders and serenities  
and the sanguine fountains of his native land?  
To seek another land they are all gentlemen  
professional clocks in whose fresh keys originate.  
And outside my hammock, during the sunrise, I woke up naked  
and full  
of wonder.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the unguessed flower heads?  
And the snow perfect splattering its pencils and falling them full of  
region and lobster?  
  
Fashion on the bones that wait for you  
penetrating the bitter chairs, depriving the doors.  
I wish to make a line segment  
in front of, and every feeling, many  
times hidden in an aroma.  
The acid imposes nessecity.  
The fellowships exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
behind it in darkness.  
  
A absurd image punctures  
even the poetic  
aerial archipeligos in projection  
to which the metaphor  
will not be trusted.  
Be guided by the full autumn's river.
