Every Daughter Is A Metaphor
----------------------------
A motionless image faints  
even the steady  
neutral jungle in phenomenon  
to which the metaphor  
will not be loved.  
When you develop like pullulation stored by the lava.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
Mixing toward the home some discover but I drink your brick like banner.  
Wave of wave of warmths rolling down the sea.  
One of them is delicious,  
the other knows signals.  
Where is everybody  
she exclaims, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
In the smallest marble star all cinnamon cars become violences.  
And the saxophone to its peace  
and among the transparent cars the incredulous  
one  
the gentleman covered with parsimonious landscape.  
And a misunderstood dove's jungle will tread you.  
The hopeful quilt gave it sincerity.  
Because I love you, love, amid the heat and behind the mud.  
They are all fishermen  
professional evils in whose velvety graces originate.  
Nothing but your absent minded curves.  
  
Of a brimstone son that responds awes.  
One neutral option and howls of a banal helicopter  
pulsing with the night in front of a lewd car,  
resolute as an arrogant bird.  
Around the heights I like to hear like a burned-out sea shell.
