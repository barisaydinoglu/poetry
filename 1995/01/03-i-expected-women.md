I Expected Women
----------------
Discovering the productivity of her reflection full of felicity.  
A old warrior's medal mingling will trust  
the rusted mud of a planet.  
A current of charitable wave  
that does not know why it flows and preserves.  
Callous rectums and mourning moths.  
A projection flows,  
gnaws - it does not return.  
I enrich as if among a molested granule.  
What abolishes the props of love?  
A language for sequence is the lack thereof.  
Yellow earth to my boney pencil!  
Went blushed in love on what oily vortices continued with fire?  
Among the crimson shoulder of the ice.  
  
In your brow of condemning the archipeligos begins to dream of growing.  
What is this inscription but a memory harassed of its spheres?
