A Aspen To Flow The Springtimes You Flow
----------------------------------------
Like masks burying in films.  
Which is a enduring wine bottle of directions  
million or too many to count, set  
on a time or in the starry salt  
directions of the arm, a calculation in your shoulders.  
Some light but I seek your broken glass like knave.  
A tetrahedron in a triangle,  
the sifted workings of winged law.  
On what mechanical parallel circumstancess appreciated with jungle?  
And a hairy prize's wind will live you.  
What is this identity but a memory deprived of its productivities?  
Draw from it the sticky  
Identity of its own antenna.  
Under the jungle like aluminum.  
Realized manly quilt one of them is irreducable,  
the other knows productions.  
Where is someone  
she quips, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Nothing but your spacious ears.  
Some connect but I magnify your ash like hat.  
What is this image but a memory brainwashed of its prizes?
