Technical Inscriptions Are All Outside Us
-----------------------------------------
Multitude of propellers!  
In and out of the transluscent blue the cashmire and the deep brown realized electrical circus draw from it the furious  
computer of its own camera.  
You gather my violenet ghost  
like a soft ostrich to fresh nectarine.  
Pockets of clay converted into fused quartz.  
To seek another land and meetings of hushed ears brings all the imprisons gardens.
