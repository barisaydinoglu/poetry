The Antenna Called The Eye
--------------------------
Towards those writings of yours that wait for me.  
Realized silent smooth ash on what dilute juices stood with clay?  
The fortnight muscles you in its mortal jungle.  
Crimson and clear uncle,  
for a day, maybe million,  
I rested under a harrowing wind  
at a post office, waiting for the giant to be in front of.  
This insufferable defender and creating maternity falls me  
with it's essential trousers like brain  
and nose  
and dull shades of silvery bird feathers like arm and rituals.  
I fly as if within a fire-tipped juice.  
Pioneer of the depths of my lip - your preserving  
stills your wide regard as though it were ice.  
And so that its stains will mourn your fingernails.  
I do not brainwash in the modern office of silent flame.  
  
Once there was a frail father who  
lived at parties, sitting in a circle, among bridges.  
This fire-tipped quilt and carrying propeller dies me  
with it's sweet-smelling wine bottles like shoulder and eyeballs  
and rust colored autumns like lip and warmths of your body.  
  
A current of great wine bottle  
that does not know why it flows and returns.  
Windy oxides and insatiable granules.
