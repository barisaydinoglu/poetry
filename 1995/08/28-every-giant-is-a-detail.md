Every Giant Is A Detail
-----------------------
There are many phlegms outside distorted events.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the thick horses?  
And the mist serene splattering its curtains and mourning them full of  
area and jaguar?  
On what blood-stained circumstances preserved with earth?  
Everything muzzled with decisive voices, the salt of the rose  
and piles of unguessed bread next to morning.  
How wetting is the charitable corpse and it's parsimonious corruptions?  
How perfuming is the lion hearted jugular and it's lion hearted lances?
