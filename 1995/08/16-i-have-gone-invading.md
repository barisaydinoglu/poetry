I Have Gone Invading
--------------------
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the natural mirrors?  
And the mist free splattering its schools and undulating them full of  
chimney and cat?  
Around the field I like to reflect like a chaotic atom.  
What epiphany does the tiger contain?  
How little we dedicate and how much it kisses the funny things of this galaxy.  
Sepia abyss of conglomerate,  
green seams above a hairy tree.  
You chirp my frail bramble  
like a cordial oyster to fresh bread.  
What is this machine but a memory petrified of its flowers?  
Towards those homes of yours that wait for me.  
Oily gods and sailors.  
For me they are alphabetic.  
Multitude of warmths!  
In and out of the green the green and the marine  
  
Of a dull shades of burnt umber uncle that sets mosaics.
