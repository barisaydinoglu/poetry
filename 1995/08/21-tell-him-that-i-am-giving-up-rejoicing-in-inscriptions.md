Tell Him That I Am Giving Up Rejoicing In Inscriptions
------------------------------------------------------
When you perform like writing imbued by the mud. Friendly, saphire essence!  
Among the hated land of lethargic saxophone.  
Of your brimstone door when you hold out your heart.  
I am bristled by coral and darknes, by violence and fog.
