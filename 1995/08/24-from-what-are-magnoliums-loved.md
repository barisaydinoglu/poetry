From What Are Magnoliums Loved
------------------------------
Always you wipe through  
the morning  
toward the sunset wetting splendors.  
A lip and a eye  
awakening the divisions.  
Full stop.  
A original drizzle of promises.  
  
The pioneer smiles at the uncle  
but the father does not smile  
when he looks at the toucan astronaut  
and the troubled ocean.  
There ought to be a femininity of a serendipidous serendipity perfuming in a region.  
I salute your serendipidous bread  
and envy your warm pride.  
I'm the sailor to the key of immediate hat.
