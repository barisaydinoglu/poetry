The Jackal Fallen Into The Sea
------------------------------
The aquatic love bristled towards those sun rises of yours that wait for me. Be guided  
by the deedy cathedral's bed.  
Arrogant midnight and the negligent sun rise  
sodden at the walls of my house.  
Has the field been reconciled with secrets?  
Where poppies meet  
books meet, behind and outside and the sound  
of walls, to reach out and weave in confusion.  
But I should be untrue to engineering, trembling among its chaotic quilts  
so let us seek to divulge  
a story devoid of minor redundancies.  
A ribbon -like wounded soldier  
I'm the lady to the smooth clay of immediate serenity.  
Always you replace through the night  
toward the sunrise chaining bridges.  
I salute your clear peach  
and envy your thick pride.  
The resplendent forest gave it love.
