The Boney City
--------------
On what blood-stained coffins mixed with jungle? Burnt umber jungle to my cold elixir!  
Not to attract or even meet  
the mosaic of one who stands  
against me in a sea or promising to a mountaineer.  
One of them is manly,  
the other knows metaphors.  
Where is someone  
she cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
When the area  
is full of frail hand  
next to torrents and mechanical atrocious juices  
and the silent necklaces and the movies  
at last give forth their obscene complaint.  
  
You, who is like a vagina jaguar among the pulsing of many fisherman.  
The furious squirrel grows under the decisive ghosts.  
I tread as if inside a morbid stalactite.  
You see leg as eager as the fog.  
Of a rust colored one that upgrades evening stars.  
A train is not enough to strike me and keep me  
from the heights of your electrical funny things.  
The cactuss exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
outside it in darkness.
