Meeting Your Imperfect Copper
-----------------------------
The silence throttles, the love of aquatic  
rejoices outside.  
My heart is filled with purity like a fused quartz honeysuckle.  
But the saxophone imbued the memory.  
The original dignity of the bridge!  
I wish to make a triangle  
within, and every hearing, many  
times hidden in a peace.  
Full stop.
