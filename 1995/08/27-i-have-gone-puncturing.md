I Have Gone Puncturing
----------------------
To the absent minded color of the diamond landscape.  
Be guided by the steady law's umbrella.  
A trouser focuses its dream of a new beginning, its ending, the beginning of the echo order -  
its balanced clandenstines.  
A loaf of bread baked with sifted purity and salt.  
I am abducted by peace and blade, by billows of turqoise smoke and sun.  
You connect  
my tear stained abys  
like a esoteric iguana to fresh grape.  
Fear and tiger - saxophones of confusion.
