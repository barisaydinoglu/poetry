I Have Gone Attracting
----------------------
Anger and umbrella - muscles of illusion.  
The smooth steel plan that has everyone rabid.  
She is inside us at this moment of first dedicating.  
There are many stains in front of lethargic events.  
If you were not the sugar the romantic moon  
cooks, sprinkling its sugar across the boulevard.  
The blazing aromas overflowed not the sepia moment  
when the early light of day hears the paper-mache architectures.  
In the face of so many throats to animosity.  
Come with me to the twisting lonely road of rectums.  
Not the marine moment  
when the midnight weaves the films.  
I am deceived by root and whisper, by corpse and sun.
