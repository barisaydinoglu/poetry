I Have Gone Connecting
----------------------
Torrents of a disintered wheel  
showering next to the city in front of a cold helicopter,  
esoteric as a frightened lobster.  
The circumstance upgrades on its nauesous mare  
divulging burnt umber banners over the archipeligos.  
A loaf of bread baked with shady love and salt.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the myriad muscles?  
And the thunder celestial splattering its apples and falling them full of  
field and tiger?  
A loaf of bread baked with neurotic wonder and salt.  
Because I love you, love, outside the electricity and  
outside the fire.  
  
Pure bloodied rusted nail rejoices the necklaces I saw how trousers are blushed  
by the human flute.  
My fresh mouth circumscribes you always.  
Towards those trysts of yours that wait for me. There are no holes but lethargic cycles of perfume and sunburst orange  
roses of electrical sterile brick.
