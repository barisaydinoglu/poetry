Since The End
-------------
You - the vertical heart.  
How relinquishing is the promising eternity and it's romantic felicities?  
On what sterile daggers circumscribed with mud?  
Enjoy the many explosive attempts to fly  
the sanguine error.  
There is musical fortune in exciting it.  
A technique for metaphor is the lack thereof.  
Towards those movies of yours that wait for me.  
You trust headlong into an area to promise your business.  
When the land is full of dead heart  
around violences and wounded cold jars  
and the guilt shorelines and the lakes  
at last give forth their sordid abys.  
From her lip and her eyeballs understand  
green cars of the earth.  
  
And you magnify like a poppy and behind the burned-out divisions of raucous star.
