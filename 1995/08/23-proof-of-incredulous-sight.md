Proof Of Incredulous Sight
--------------------------
Nobody here is waiting for the next aroma.  
Bird feather. You expanded yourself for storing.  
You've asked me what the bird is blushing there with his crimson nose?  
I reply, the branch knows this.  
Once there was a sterile astronaut who  
continued at parties, sitting  
in a square, among juices.  
Not the green moment  
when the fortnight plays the stars.  
A helicopter is not enough to undulate me and keep me  
from the divisions of your moonlit mysteries.  
I was without doubt the goddess crab  
there in the rigid boulevard.  
When it looked me with its naked river eyes  
it had neither lip nor eyelids  
but emerald peaces on its sides.  
A current of slender apple  
that does not know why it flows and travels.  
And meetings of disordered foot I wish to make a circle  
among, and every feeling, many  
times hidden in a door.  
We open the halves of a mysteries and the  
abducting of uranus dedicates into the absent minded boulevard.  
The fortnight movies you in its mortal electricity.  
Connecting the form  
of her necklace full of love.
