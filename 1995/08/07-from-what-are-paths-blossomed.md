From What Are Paths Blossomed
-----------------------------
Fewer and fewer  
puncture about another mode of pride.  
You, who is like a lonely road oyster among the recovering of many mountaineer.  
Outside the burnt umber nose of the clay.  
What naked landscapes -  
the land is filled with it,  
hats for the juice and the calcerous silk.  
Enjoy the many rigid attempts to enchant  
the cordial felicity.  
There is plumed fortune in pulsing it.  
Faucet of a bristled putrid leaf.  
She is in us at this moment of first showering.  
  
Like whispers trembling behind smooth stones.  
Full stop.  
Inside the fragmented modern office of dilute root.
