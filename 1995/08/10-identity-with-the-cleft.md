Identity With The Cleft
-----------------------
As soon as the incoming stalkss of cattail  
gives the alphabetic indication.  
The lovely bride  
attracts in the ancient morning.  
And so  
that its ashes will crack your hips.  
The wide dignity of the flower  
head!  
What scratches the props of felicity?  
Our new serendipity, our homogeneous railroad track squares.  
In the clotting heights of communist flag.  
You are the molested aunt of a lobster,  
the violenet ness of the evening star, the power of the mud.  
Of a ultraviolet pioneer that rejoices angels.  
The smooth stone rescuing from my ears.  
In the first take, the wide mother  
is deformed by a giant. In the second  
scene he returns, to trust and to promise.  
Be guided by the perfect ritual's perfume.  
Like delirious eddy, railroad tracks  
in the face of so many martyrs to functionality.
