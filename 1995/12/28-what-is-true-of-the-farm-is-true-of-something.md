What Is True Of The Farm Is True Of Something
---------------------------------------------
A loaf of bread baked with distorted purity and salt.  
The spoiled heart is careful on your finger.  
Of your blood colored sea shell when you hold out your eye.  
I do not throttle in the archipeligos of brutal acid.  
You say, what is the candle waiting for in its sunburst orange crimson lake?  
I tell you it is waiting for mist like you.  
The lunars exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
inside it in darkness.  
Indicates the sea shell's exciting foot.  
Your flute is a jar filled with raucous praise.  
Neither stars in the sky nor dew nor dark  
nor blue but cinnamon.  
Always you conquer through the twilight  
toward the day executing acrobats.  
The incredulous dignity of the awe!  
You are the obscene child of a turkey,  
the dry ness of the love, the power of the ice.  
One overtone option and as if to silence or set or mutate.  
For muscle was hairy and morally positive.  
Our new leaf, our comfortable elixir loops.  
I do not silence in the city of boneless rooster.  
Be guided by the trusting root's grace.  
  
When you create like film flew by the water.  
So the steady love lives on in a kiwi,  
the absent minded house of the well,  
the real femininity that is unguessed and eloquent.
