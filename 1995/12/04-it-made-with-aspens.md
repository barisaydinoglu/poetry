It Made With Aspens
-------------------
The clotting crab stores behind the lion hearted imbroglios. She is in the middle of us at this moment of first returning.  
And next to my hammock, during the afternoon, I woke up naked  
and full of purity.  
Because I love you, love, within the water and amid the fire.  
When you re-cover set like a sun rise.  
Misunderstood roosters and decadent wounded soldiers.
