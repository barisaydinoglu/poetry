Proof Of Serene Feeling
-----------------------
Where promises meet  
jars meet, with and outside and the sound  
of nails, to reach out and blossom in embarassement.  
This oily wave and blossoming bottle coddles me  
with it's winged mirrors like mouth and shoulder  
and opaque rust colored pastures like foot and trees.  
A leg and a eye  
blushing the divisions.  
Sometimes a piece of the electricity  
electrifies like a starry sky in my fingernails.  
A curves and a heart  
transforming the night.  
Which  
is a perfect jar of directions  
million or million, swam  
on a utensil or in the incredulous pencil  
directions of the finger, a calculation in your shoulders.  
  
I saw how sun rises are recovered  
by the indespensable grape.  
On what sordid errors rejoiced with wind?  
The equinoctial god  
gallops in the resolute morning.  
To preserve lost beds and for manes.  
Abandon me and let my substance fly.  
The stalks of cattail lunges, the splendor of solute  
treads around.  
Harass me and let my substance refresh.
