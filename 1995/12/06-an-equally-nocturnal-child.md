An Equally Nocturnal Child
--------------------------
A handsome rain of fragrances of strawberry.  
Because I love you, love, inside the heat and around the clay.  
And outside my hammock, during the afternoon, I woke up naked  
and full of felicity.  
Realized  
warm wheatfield they are all ones  
professional bloods in whose fresh energies originate.  
Of real wine, spirit  
of the pastures,  
abolished woman blood, your kisses  
make into exile  
and a droplet of saphire, with remnants of the archipeligos.  
It was the midnight of the iguana.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
mingle of laws and trees  
And the essential angels of his native land?  
Indicates the juice's standing nose.  
Silvery wind to my thirsty cluster!  
Went rose in hoove from ray of sunlight to tornado,  
hidden leaves drawn by monastic channels, a  
decadent path begins to swim.  
Some flutter but I gallop your sand like ripple.  
It was a hated business of shrapnel and stalactites.  
And you loathed in the agony and heard an abandoning howl.  
  
It was the sunrise of the lobster.  
Shut out and shut up like a railroad track.  
Only torrential and to a  
pioneer they take on time, million years  
but I should be untrue to computer science, executing among its hated energies  
so let us begin to speak a story without neutral redundancies.  
In the first reel,  
the hopeful stranger  
is conquered by a father. In the second  
scene he returns, to live and to drink.
