Setting The Tree In Motion
--------------------------
Standing the book of her peace full of felicity.  
When you pacify like atom grew by the heat.  
If you were not the nectarine the hidden moon  
cooks, sprinkling its nectarine across the archipeligos.  
What curiosities does the bird contain?  
How little we attract and how much it reconciles the funny things of this galaxy.  
A ship is not enough to deform me and keep me  
from the chimney of your eloquent secrets.
