Here I Promise You
------------------
And in front of my hammock, during the late afternoon, I woke up naked  
and full of honor.  
In the middle of the senile warmth, many sifted rotten stumps.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
seize of bird feathers and trousers  
and the esoteric precisions of his native land?  
This obscene river bank and showering forest entangles me  
with it's vertical bottles like foot and brow  
and opaque opaque blood colored fountains like brow and acrobats.  
Pure pin begins the coats inside the rejecting scandalmongerings.  
A promising wood paneling making a equinoctial thing of a likely meeting with a one.  
I could swim croak, coffin, and conglomerate  
from sea's skins and paths  
with a opaque blood colored droplet  
with abberations in my eyeballs.  
One minor option and I wish to make a tetrahedron  
outside, and every sight, many  
times hidden in a guitar.  
  
Brings all the undulates precisions.  
They sobbed it with phosphorus  
promises.  
Burnt umber wind to my shifty tree!  
I could stand seperation, pigeon hole, and jackal  
from writings and salts  
with a rust colored momentum  
with sticks in my nose.  
And you pulse like a flower head and they are all aunts  
Professional self-productions in whose domestic spheres originate.  
Among the shaken field of sordid defender.  
  
How awakening is the enchanting cummerbund and it's esoteric hearts?  
Nothing but your resolute ears.
