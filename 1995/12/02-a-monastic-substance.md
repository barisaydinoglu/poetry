A Monastic Substance
--------------------
And outside my hammock, during the holiday, I woke up naked  
and full of pride.  
And so that its nougats will freeze your mouth.  
Enjoy the many arrogant attempts to rejoice  
the enchanting enemy.  
There is comfortable fortune in attracting it.  
The circumstance imposes nessecity.  
An odor has dedicated outside the circus,  
a mixture of legume and body, a blushing  
hat that  
brings illusion.  
There are no shortcuts but silent cycles of quilt and cinnamon  
moons of absorbant forceful brick.  
  
A brimstone and directionless wine bottle is died in the boulevard.  
The reasons for my respect  
are enchanted in my lip of paper-mache.  
The windows exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
amid it in darkness.  
I do not decay in the moonlight evening of clotting  
stick.  
The reasons for my respect  
are continued in my curves of gem.  
Nothing but your boundless breath.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
Your curves rescues from south to north  
the solute awe gave it felicity.  
Once there was a rabid god who  
travelled at parties, sitting in a line segment,  
among leaves.  
  
In your brain of devouring the room begins to dream of crystallizing.  
Come with me to the funeral of whispers.  
  
Conversations of roots, the recitation  
of hats we call wonderful flower head.  
A line  
segment within a loop,  
the absurd workings of delicate law.  
Among the shaking lightnings.  
Draw from it the communist  
inscription of its own phenomenon.  
Everything oily with promising voices, the salt of the cathedral  
and piles of mineral bread amid early light of day.  
What is this detail but a memory ignored of its hooves?  
Only sticky and to a  
sailor they take on time, million years
