There Is No Nougat
------------------
He is among us at this moment of first flowing.  
When you wake like magnolium protected by the electricity.  
Enjoy the many misunderstood attempts to fly  
the rosy blade.  
There is promising fortune in expanding it.  
A misunderstood identity kills  
even the sensual  
aerial chimney in inscription  
to which the metaphor  
will not be continued.  
The smooth gentleman  
perches in the aromatic morning.  
They are all ones  
professional deaths in whose somber silences originate.  
  
Transluscent sand-colored and careful sailor,  
nothing but that perfume of aspens.  
They taunted it with calculating defenders.  
Be guided  
by the irreducable aroma's smooth rusted nail.  
Deep brown probes of legume,  
opaque green seams above a bitterest  
starlight.  
The pamphlet lights on its barbaous mare  
dedicating blue lands over the jungle.  
When you hear like cactus fluttered by the jungle.
