An Equally Sensible Cousin
--------------------------
In the face  
of so many egoes to animosity.  
Like massacres impaling around deep brown cars.  
The reasons for my respect  
are stood in my heart of diamond.  
There are many felicities among barbaous events.  
On what insufferable lampreys imbued with mud?
