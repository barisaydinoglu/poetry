An Equally Plumed Uncle
-----------------------
Around the archipeligos I like to weave like a bitten kis.  
A current of slender well  
that does not know why it flows and relaxes.  
Pockets of aluminum converted into crystal.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the full manes?  
And the fog serendipidous splattering its writings and wiping them full of  
jungle and elephant?  
To dedicate lost schools and for bolts of chalk architecture.  
The jungle inside hers  
a story we speak in passing,  
with notions of felicity  
and a passion for computer science and science  
I salute your ancient peach  
and envy your domestic pride.  
The hat refreshing from my eyeballs.  
  
Always you deprive through the day  
toward the afternoon penetrating wells.  
Of your dark sea  
shell when you hold out your nose.
