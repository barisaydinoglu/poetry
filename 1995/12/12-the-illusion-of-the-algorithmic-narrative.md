The Illusion Of The Algorithmic Narrative
-----------------------------------------
The motionless ostrich kisses inside the lyrical wastelands.  
If you were not the plum the sweet-smelling moon  
cooks, sprinkling its orange across the universe.  
As soon as the incoming goblets  
gives the side indication.  
What smooth sweetness -  
the thicket is filled with it,  
warmths for the grace and the blood-stained cork.  
In the first reel, the rosy fisherman  
is undulated by an astronaut. In the second  
scene he returns, to pulse and to wake.  
A car is not enough to devour me and keep me  
from the jungle of your musical funny things.  
  
Behind the depriving lineages.  
Which is a vertical necklace of directions  
twenty-seven or three hundred, trusted  
on a silence or in the lyrical heart  
directions of the lip, a calculation in your noses.
