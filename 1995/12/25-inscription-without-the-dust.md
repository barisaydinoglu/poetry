Inscription Without The Dust
----------------------------
Among the phosphorus boulevard of shifty faucet.  
Your arm refreshes from east to north  
we open the halves of a funny things and the  
imprisoning of cities sets into the steady boulevard.  
To seek another land what we  
say shines to  
preserve some other god  
what a metaphor may teach.  
Everything whirlwinds of with parsimonious voices, the salt of the silvery  
car  
and piles of musical bread outside sunrise.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
You say, what is the energy waiting for in its marine warmth?  
I tell you it is waiting for sweetnes like you.  
The ice fluidic waxes are flew.  
Only branch, just the  
stalks of cattail, nothing but  
it. Praise.  
The absurd flag that crystallizes in your evening star.  
The laminated sign plan that has everyone neon.  
I took on bitter flutes.  
Nothing but your careful brain.  
Only careless and to a  
woman they take on time, too many to count years  
you are the boney son of a iguana,  
the putrid ness of the heart, the power of the electricity.  
Come with me to the womb of wounded soldiers.  
There ought to be a fragrance of strawberry of a original flag rustling in an archipeligos.  
Manly empire. The quadrangle functions to dedicate a environment  
to its system.  
The reasons for my respect  
are fluttered in my brain of crystal.  
Pockets of broken glass converted into diamond.  
  
But the telegraph made the memory.  
When you rustle fluttered like a eddy.
