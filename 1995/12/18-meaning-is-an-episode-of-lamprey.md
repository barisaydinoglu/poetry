Meaning Is An Episode Of Lamprey
--------------------------------
Nothing but your fleeting toe.  
The I in autumn it was a torrential business of shortcut and seperations.  
You see eyelids as loving as the fog.  
Nothing but that sweetnes of bottles.  
What serendipidous friendships -  
the jungle is filled with it,  
sun rises for the affection and the rigid fused quartz.  
Fluttered and then excited in the vicinity.  
Mingling from  
boneless chalk.  
I want you to perch on my hand.  
Some form but I blossom your broken glass like laminated sign.  
A silence -like polyp  
when you travel showered like a bridge.  
Brings all the chains coats.  
I want you to flutter on my breath.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
dawn of honeysuckles and atoms  
and the ancient fragrances of strawberry  
of his native land?  
I wish  
to make a line  
outside, and every feeling, many  
times hidden in a film.  
  
Always you force through the day  
toward the early light of day condemning alcoves.  
Around marine water and cinnamon pastures.
