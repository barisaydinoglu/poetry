Some Atrocious Divulge
----------------------
Smooth stone was no longer below the transmission threshold.  
Pure darknes dedicates the corals the necklace knows this,  
that life in it's crystal boxes is as endless as the writing.  
The parenthetical honeysuckle gave it purity.  
You are the acidulous custodian of a turkey,  
the rabid ness of the autumn, the power of the lightning.  
Which is a cordial fountain of directions  
too few to count or million, chirped  
on a cactus or in the unguessed crown  
directions of the toe, a calculation in your arms.  
A tail and a lip  
galloping the chimney.  
The juice twists, the forest of winged  
fashions among.
