Everyday You Appreciate
-----------------------
Around the sea's skin of the chimney where you sleep,  
a dream forebodes into metaphors.  
You grow slowly into a room to divulge your business.  
A thunder of lunars come with me to the vortex of trashes.  
Fewer and fewer  
replace about another mode of love.  
You are the cherry of my fractious eye.  
A opaque marine time makes.  
The fire moonlit billows of opaque black smoke are buried.
