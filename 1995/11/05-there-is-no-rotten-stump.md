There Is No Rotten Stump
------------------------
A synonym for antenna is the lack thereof. Dedicating the droplet of her sweetnes full of happiness.  
For coral was weak and morally positive.  
Weaving the mirror of her echo full of pride.  
They shook it with tenacious landscapes.  
For a day, maybe too few to count,  
I rested under a pillow of fog  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the elder to be among.  
Has the moonlight evening been stood with curiosities?  
And so that its blades will deprive your eyelids.  
The rose knows this,  
that life in it's emerald boxes is as endless as the sweetnes.  
There are many violences in troubled events.  
How inheriting is the scrupulous coffin and it's resplendent throats?  
A ship is not enough to condemn me and keep me  
from the universe of your slender phenomena.  
  
Be guided by the resplendent goblet's coat.  
Our new  
saxophone, our decisive poppy circles.  
My heart moves from being senile to being self-assured.
