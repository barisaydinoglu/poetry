Goddesses Must Always Prove Their Fellowships
---------------------------------------------
The order of the river banks full stop. If I could drink the hound and the city.  
A identity for projection is the lack thereof.  
Once there was a lewd cousin who  
excited at parties, sitting in a triangle, among keys.  
It is a tale of misunderstood extinctions a reflection -like stick  
and flutes and jars.  
What is this machine but a memory lunged of its bird feathers?  
In your foot of agony the night of goblets build.  
The cordial dignity of the old warrior's medal!  
  
From her shoulder and her brain preserve  
promises of the earth.
