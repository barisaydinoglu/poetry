The Directionless Son Of The City
---------------------------------
Be guided by the celestial fellowship's necklace.  
A explosive river bank day  
your finger drinks from west to east  
Re-covering from torrential  
marble.  
Shall we proceed?  
Excite on the oblivions that wait for you  
petrifying the melancholy chairs, attacking the doors.  
Behind the delirious river bank, many silent  
smokes.  
Behind the lonely muscle, many brutal roosters.  
The fellowship wets, the landscape of stationary  
stands around.  
Sunburst orange bombs of heart,  
silvery seams above a muzzled railroad track.  
  
It's a protecting well of jackals.  
I salute your trusting sugar  
and envy your indespensable pride.  
The clear mosaic gave it honor.  
There are no stains  
but shady cycles of flesh and silvery  
leaves of angellic barbaous rusted nail.  
Some enrich but I protect your brick like hoove.  
A drizzle of sun rises of your brimstone lunar when you hold out your hips.  
When the room is full of difficult arm  
around beasts and hollow dead homes  
and the worn-out sweetness and the flowers  
at last give forth their rustling throat.  
The eager dignity of the friendship!  
  
Expanding toward the light yellow coals of rotten stump,  
cinnamon seams above a imperalist flower.  
River of a filtered fractious propeller.
