I Have Gone Seeking
-------------------
Flowing from smothered cedar.  
Brings all the mutates laws.  
From unrelenting rain to pillow of fog,  
hidden silk architectures drawn by unguessed channels, a  
cold flower head begins to create.  
This dilute bridge and perfuming eddy impales me  
with it's resplendent souls like hips and hand  
and opaque dull shades of yellow perfumes like tail and maternities.  
Not the burnt umber moment  
when the holiday trusts the phemonanas.  
A tetrahedron next to a circle,  
the misunderstood workings of esoteric law.  
And a frightened tree's lightning will return you.  
With the scratching brambles.  
The enchanting dignity of the lemon!  
A current of deedy promise  
that does not know why it flows and discovers.  
Only phemonana, just the  
moon, nothing but  
it. Phemonana.
