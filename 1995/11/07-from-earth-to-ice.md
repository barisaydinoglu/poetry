From Earth To Ice
-----------------
Carry me onto your bicycle - the orange of my starlight -  
full stop.  
Blue and sweet-smelling mountaineer,  
return to the homeland of the laws.  
The necklace forces, the snow of fresh  
stores next to.  
You see curves as esoteric as the wind.  
Our new ribbon, our cleansed nature tetrahedrons.
