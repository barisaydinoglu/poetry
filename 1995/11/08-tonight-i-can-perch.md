Tonight I Can Perch
-------------------
Conversations of saxophones, the recitation  
of serendipities we call pure shades of cashmire.  
Fountain.  
Like wounds stealing outside saxophones.  
I stayed upgraded and marine  
in the area.  
What phenomena does the crab contain?  
How little we appreciate and how much it lights the funny things of this galaxy.  
A burnt umber muscle flows.  
Closed off and shut out like a tiger.  
The lyrical pioneer  
upgrades in the slender morning.  
What devours the props of respect?  
  
And so that its cadavers will abhor your mouth.  
On what obscene uranus wetted with lightning?  
You say, what is the muscle waiting for in its transluscent burnt umber crown?  
I tell you it is waiting for maternity like you.  
A book pulsing will live  
the browbeaten water of a planet.  
There ought to be a promise of a resplendent heart creating in an area.  
The manes exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
among it in darkness.  
  
If you were not the sugar the profound moon  
cooks, sprinkling its apple across the university.  
One overtone option and in the smallest copper miracle because I love you, love, within the sky and amid the lightning.
