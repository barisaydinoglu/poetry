Lineages About The Metaphor He Inherited
----------------------------------------
Your hand swims from east to north  
all elixirs become nails.  
But I should be untrue to mountaineering, passing among its raucous grapes  
so let us attempt to divulge a story devoid of historical redundancies.  
We open the halves of a curiosities and the  
electrifying of invasions imbues into the parenthetical university.  
  
Dawning the bottle of her peace full of respect.  
The sweetness exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
around it in darkness.  
The clotting thread is noble on your nose.  
You love slowly into a region to wet your business.  
If you were not the cheesecake the original moon  
cooks, sprinkling its peach across the boulevard.  
Our new cathedral, our rosy garden squares.  
  
Only reflection, just the  
serenity, nothing but  
it. Love.  
In my area at twilight you are like a serenity  
and your form and colour the way I mix them.
