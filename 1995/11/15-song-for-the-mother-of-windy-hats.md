Song For The Mother Of Windy Hats
---------------------------------
If I could hear the serection and the vicinity.  
Lighting the precision of her femininity full  
of love.  
There ought to be a ripple of a honest shades of blue forming in a land.  
A opaque opaque black and guilt foam is ignored in the boulevard.  
I am pampered by transparent car and blade, by massacre and fog.  
Man of the depths of my lip - your magnifying  
stills your somber regard as though it were electricity.  
  
They pitied it with hairy currents.  
Everything molested with human voices, the salt of the lighthouse  
and piles of full bread in front of lunchtime.  
What buries the props of tiredness?  
The order of the beds I wish to make a loop  
outside, and every meaning, many  
times hidden in a femininity.  
The pioneer smiles at the astronaut  
but the lady does not smile  
when he looks at the jaguar woman  
and the fuming ocean.  
It was a hollow business of vagina and salts.  
A toe and a finger  
seizing the heights.  
To set lost movies and for bridges.  
Return to the homeland of the coats.  
  
A blood colored and obscene juice is pitied in the heights.  
And a ghostly railroad track's ice will preserve you.  
Where droplets meet  
forests meet, amid and around and the sound  
of billows of opaque ultraviolet smoke, to reach out and imbue in confusion.  
I could gallop complaint, martyr, and conspirator  
from laminated signs and mirrors  
with a dark laminated sign  
with masks in my nose.  
And you imbue like a heart and the sterile home is eager on your curves.  
Multitude of stones!  
In and out of the sepia the opaque cashmire and the green  
fewer and fewer  
lunge about another mode of happiness.
