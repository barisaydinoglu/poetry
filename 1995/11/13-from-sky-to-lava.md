From Sky To Lava
----------------
Parched weather, hushed lights like the planetarium. The morose toucan promises against the incredulous invasions.  
Nothing but your dashing leg.  
Only bleak and to a  
uncle they take on time, twenty-seven years  
our new tiger, our perfect bridge line segments.  
Misunderstood sons and pioneers.  
For me they are technical.  
The faucets exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
next to it in darkness.  
A chorus of oysters at midnight un reflected un cracked  
comes to a halt before a thread.  
Shut up and shut up like a necklace.  
I want you to respond on my lip.
