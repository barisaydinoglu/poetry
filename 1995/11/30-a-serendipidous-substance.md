A Serendipidous Substance
-------------------------
A mineral carpet making a celestial thing of a probable meeting with a sailor.  
Your shoulder imbues from south to west  
halfway.  
They are all gods  
professional pins in whose blazing fellowships originate.  
A moon blushing will gallop  
the phosphorus clay of a planet.  
Developing from acidulous gold.  
A dove focuses its dream of a old ending, its beginning, the beginning of the rose order -  
its cordial masks.  
Uncle of the depths of my nose - your making  
stills your human regard as though it were heat.  
Created and then fashioned in the boulevard.  
Only lunar, just the  
miracle, nothing but  
it. Wave.
