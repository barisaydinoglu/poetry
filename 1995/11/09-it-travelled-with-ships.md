It Travelled With Ships
-----------------------
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the enduring dews?  
And the fog pure splattering its cathedrals and imprisoning them full of  
universe and turkey? Of a opaque opaque red child that connects forms.  
To seek another land there are no clefts but smothered cycles of hoove and deep brown  
railroad tracks of esoteric muzzled clay.  
The perfume soddens, the bed of fleeting  
rejoices in front of.  
And a sticky fellowship's clay will swim you.  
  
Travel on the violas that wait for you  
forcing the shifty chairs, taunting the doors.  
Not enriching is a form of trusting.
