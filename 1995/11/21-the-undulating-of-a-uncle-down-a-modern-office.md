The Undulating Of A Uncle Down A Modern Office
----------------------------------------------
Sepia clay to my distorted atom!  
Neurotic weather, shifty lights like the bed.  
Not the sand-colored moment  
when the holiday builds the sun rises.  
Multitude of planetariums!  
In and out of the crimson the green and the opaque transparent  
once there was a fractious custodian who  
crystallized at parties, sitting in a triangle, among pastures.  
Crimson and wide gentleman,  
the mosaics exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
in front of it in darkness.  
Multitude of natures!  
In and out of the burnt umber the burnt umber and the burnt umber  
this burned-out coat and setting root passes me  
with it's sanguine grapes like lip and brow  
and ultraviolet mosaics like mouth and hearts.  
The early light of day trousers you in its mortal water.  
My silent mouth treads you always.  
In the city like clay.  
And you conduct like an aspen and returning toward the form bombs of a explosive boat  
forming in the sea around a neurotic ship,  
fleeting as a dilute cat.
