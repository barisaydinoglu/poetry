The Metaphor Has Not Smeared The Promise
----------------------------------------
In your eye of beligerance the land of homes swim.  
What we say rises to  
play some other one  
what a production may teach.  
One of them is blazing,  
the other knows machines.  
Where is everybody  
he cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
How entertaining is the parenthetical croak and it's lovely daggers?  
Only school, just the  
light, nothing but  
it. Defender.  
I wish to make a quadrangle  
outside, and every sense, many  
times hidden in a silence.  
Erupt me and let my substance upgrade.  
To the pure color of the saphire nature.  
  
Iridescent empire. The loop  
functions to rise an architecture  
to its architecture.  
Not the sand-colored moment  
when the day magnifies the foams.  
In your finger of scratching the jungle begins to dream of standing.  
You awaken in the sea as in a comfortable university.  
I wish to make a quadrangle  
in front of, and every meaning, many  
times hidden in an alcove.  
The irreducable roses changed nobody here is waiting for the next crystal architecture.  
Honeysuckle. You dawned yourself for wetting.  
Around the opaque marine leg of the ice.  
Wave of wave of bells rolling down the sea.  
Carry me onto your bicycle - the kiwi of my dew -  
  
To seek another land they are all ladies  
professional lightnings in whose original windows originate.  
There are no rectums but distorted cycles of lemon and transparent  
quivers of cosmic calculating clay.
