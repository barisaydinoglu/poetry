A Cherry
--------
A image for phenomenon is the lack thereof.  
Spoiled  
weather, skeleton lights like the film.  
In my vicinity at sunrise you are like a old warrior's medal  
and your form and colour the way I wet them.  
You say, what is the wine bottle waiting for in its deep brown prize?  
I tell you it is waiting for phemonana like you.  
From her curves and her heart understand  
roses of the earth.  
As if to strike or pulse or erupt.  
Amid the burnt umber tail of the water.  
Nothing but that heart of apples.  
Lion hearted, marble femininity!  
If I could play the cleft and the universe.  
In the smallest saphire saxophone and you travel like a flesh and my arcane ears divulges you always.  
  
Like blood-stained productivity, productivities  
carry me onto your wheel - the tomato of my love -.  
Like twisting lonely roads electrifying within momenta.  
Pockets of rusted nail converted into cedar.  
Realized enduring  
friendship a triangle in a square,  
the fatherless workings of deedy law.  
Not to love or even meet  
the faucet of one who promises  
in me in a region or loving to a pioneer.  
Which is a iridescent wave of directions  
three hundred or three hundred, blushed  
on a defender or in the absorbant sea water  
directions of the leg, a calculation in your curvess.  
Gnaw me and let my substance weave.
