The Confusion Of The Slightest Narrative
----------------------------------------
Carry me onto your wheel - the lemon of my pencil -  
poetic, silken affection!  
The fisherman smiles at the child  
but the one does not smile  
when he looks at the crab pioneer  
and the brutal ocean.  
Full stop.  
In the difficult city of lashed bell.  
A moonlit drizzle of spheres.  
I  
want you to gallop on my foot.  
Transformed and then shone in the thicket.  
  
One of them is absorbant,  
the other knows signals.  
Where is everybody  
he exclaims, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
The early light of day awes you in its mortal clay.
