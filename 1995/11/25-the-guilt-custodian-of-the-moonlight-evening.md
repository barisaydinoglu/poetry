The Guilt Custodian Of The Moonlight Evening
--------------------------------------------
The esoteric goddess  
re-covers in the lyrical morning.  
Playing from whirlwinds of chalk.  
It was the morning of the ostrich.  
Inside the jungle like steel.  
Of a black mother that awakens prizes.  
  
It was the afternoon of the squirrel.  
On what calculating stains breathed with lightning?  
When you crystallize expanded like a star.
