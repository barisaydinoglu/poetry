I Expected Custodians
---------------------
The universe outside hers  
a history we tell in passing,  
with notions of sincerity  
and a passion for computer science and engineering  
it mingles like a wheatfield in the autumn.  
Nothing but that leaf of prizes.  
If I could respond the bloody feather and the divisions.
