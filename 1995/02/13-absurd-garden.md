Absurd Garden
-------------
I conduct as if outside a thirsty imbroglio.  
Father of the depths of my mouth - your travelling  
stills your thick regard as though it were fire.  
Realized sensual quilt you are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the sanguine starlights?  
And the rain careful splattering its warmths and pitying them full of  
city and iguana?  
A loaf of bread baked with sterile felicity and salt.  
Flowed and then dawned in the universe.  
The circus knows this,  
that life in it's silk boxes is as endless as the propeller.  
Enjoy the many fire-tipped attempts to preserve  
the dashing depth.  
There is starry fortune in flowing it.
