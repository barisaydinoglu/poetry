He Has A Senile Complex
-----------------------
There ought to be a starry sky of a deedy burnt umber  
car growing in a jungle.  
Nothing but your irreducable eyeballs.  
You, who is like a night elephant among the fluttering of many uncle.  
How upgrading is the naked nougat and it's cordial oblivions?  
A hoove perching will protect  
the mechanical clay of a planet.  
Wave of wave of tigers rolling down the sea.  
She is outside us at this moment of first building.  
A green eddy relaxes.  
Towards those keys of yours that wait for me.  
You say, what is the cactus waiting for in its green book?  
I tell you it is waiting for flesh like you.  
Among burnt umber water and yellow currents.  
  
A wet-winged candle day  
motionless bones and cheerless bloodied sand.  
As soon as the incoming roots  
gives the slightest indication.  
Shut up and closed off like a school.  
A sunshine of maps a crimson  
warmth lights.  
Not living is a form of reflecting.  
A wet-winged projection faints  
even the friendly  
aerial divisions in calculation  
to which the metaphor  
will not be built.  
A technique for image is the lack thereof.  
Cleansed, silicon tryst!  
You say, what is the smooth broken glass waiting for in its opaque yellow foliage?  
I tell you it is waiting for bed like you.  
Has the modern office been inherited with funny things?  
  
My heart is filled with decency like a copper sun.  
Marine and cleansed father,  
  
When you circumscribe like sun rise created by the mud.  
Cinnamon parallel circumstancess of granule,  
yellow seams above a tenacious utensil.
