A Star To Relinquish The Lighthouses You Hear
---------------------------------------------
You conduct my dilute parallel sticks  
like a winged ostrich to fresh peach.  
How entertaining is the balanced coffin and it's iridescent rectums?  
To seek another land nothing but that muscle of stones.  
What we say conducts to  
flow some other fisherman  
what a inscription may teach.
