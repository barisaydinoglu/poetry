Inside Of Tiger And Wreath
--------------------------
Went dawned in goblet blushing the coral of her apple full  
of joy.  
What we say expands to  
fashion some other person  
what a detail may teach.  
A raft is not enough to sob me and keep me  
from the night of your brandishing curiosities.  
My heart is filled with tiredness like a chalk lunar.  
Everything rotten with sweet-smelling voices, the salt of the soul  
and piles of lyrical bread behind lunchtime.
