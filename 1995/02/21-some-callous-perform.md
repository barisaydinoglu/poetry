Some Callous Perform
--------------------
Like trapdoors brainwashing among moons. The velvety dignity of the guitar!  
I took on bitterest mists.  
The melancholy toucan forms outside the eloquent pins.  
A current of sanguine poppy  
that does not know why it flows and pulses.  
Disordered people and goddesses.  
For me they are grammatic.  
Pride is gone, the subject has loved.  
Because I love you, love, inside the water and outside the wind.  
If I could store the cubicle and the vicinity.  
I wish to make a quadrangle  
in front of, and every sense, many  
times hidden in a bell.
