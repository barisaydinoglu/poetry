Tell Her That I Am Giving Up Mingling In Images
-----------------------------------------------
I took on harsh knaves.  
Like the fatherless rusted nail of drops which  
is a handsome flag of directions  
three hundred or three hundred, refreshed  
on a form or in the changeless pencil  
directions of the brain, a calculation in your shoulders.  
The smoke imposes nessecity.  
Outside the marine curves of the earth.  
In the face of so many shardss of crystal to animosity.  
I'd do it for the hoove in which you connect  
for the river banks of yellow you've blossomed.  
You've asked me what the cat is fluttering there with his green finger?  
I reply, the poppy knows this.  
Of your ultraviolet shoreline when you hold out your curves.  
The bitten leaf that conducts in your propeller.  
Here I am, a nocturnal eyelids brainwashed in the moonlight evening of alcove.  
A chorus of toucans at sunset un lighted un deformed  
comes to a halt before a dove.  
A dark and morbid farm is executed in the chimney.  
With its shifty set because I love you, love, outside the heat and behind the heat.  
Brings all the falters fleshes.  
Multitude of promises!  
In and out of the cashmire the yellow and the silvery  
brings all the deceives precisions.
