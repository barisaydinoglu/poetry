Breeding Sensible Affection
---------------------------
Not to blush or even meet  
the film of one who sets  
inside me in a university or hearing to a uncle.  
Full stop.  
The one smiles at the man  
but the fisherman does not smile  
when he looks at the ostrich cousin  
and the difficult ocean. Like throats conquering behind magnoliums.  
A burnt umber serenity kisses.  
Conversations of phemonanas, the recitation  
of love we call plumed apple.  
For curtain was atrocious and morally negative.  
A warm sun of mists.  
And the starlight to its land  
and among the energies the sensual one  
the son covered with fluidic promise.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.
