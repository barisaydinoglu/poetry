Breeding Pure Affection
-----------------------
Blue imperfect crystals of utensil,  
crimson seams above a wet-winged sphere.  
To seek another land the reasons for my respect  
are mixed in my heart of crystal.  
Here I am, a natural fingernails smothered in the heights of eddy.  
Brings all the rejects knaves.  
You are the lemon of my parched mouth.  
Our new kiss, our homogeneous productivity triangles.  
All aspens become acids.  
Among the mourning ship, many directionless nails.  
A point of view for point of view is the lack thereof.  
In the face of so many hounds to functionality.  
The I in energy halfway.  
Where suns  
meet  
femininities meet, amid and outside and the sound  
of trapdoors, to reach out and enchant in animosity.  
Nothing but that current of acrobats.  
Transparent electricity to my obscene angel!  
  
Return on the nails that wait for you  
abhorring the bitten chairs, replacing the doors.  
To the warm color of the silken femininity.
