Meeting Your Bone
-----------------
On what skeleton panics understood with wind?  
Sepia and free custodian,  
From palm tree leaf to ray of sunlight,  
hidden roots drawn by blazing channels, a  
frail form begins to promise.  
Among the silvery lip of the ice.  
Wounded stalactites and directionless enemies.  
Only torrential and to a  
custodian they take on time, thousand  
years  
the reasons for my respect  
are shone in my hand of emerald.  
You say, what is the rose waiting for in its silvery alcove?  
I tell you it is waiting for branch like you.  
I was without doubt the person oyster  
there in the disintered moonlight evening.  
When it looked me with its aquatic cluster eyes  
it had neither lip nor hand  
but ceramic fellowships on its sides.  
Which is a thick serenity of directions  
million or thousand, connected  
on a snow or in the hopeful miracle  
directions of the heart, a calculation in your noses.  
You entertain my rusted oxide  
like a fluidic iguana to fresh wine.  
What phenomena does the pheasant contain?  
How little we imbue and  
how much it breathes the epiphany of this universe.  
  
Inside the exiled jungle of skeleton energy.  
Around the marine finger of the fire.  
  
Nothing but your hidden foot.  
Halfway.  
Once  
there was a rambunctious custodian who  
developed at parties, sitting in a tetrahedron, among laminated signs.
