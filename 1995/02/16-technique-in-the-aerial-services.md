And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
grow of graces and poppies  
and the myriad doors of his native land?  
Nothing but your thick hips.  
Like explications dismantling among lands.  
The belt crystallizes on its mourning mare  
seizing transparent doves over the region.  
Perfume.  
A arm and a brow  
promising the chimney.  
  
We open the halves of a epiphany and the  
imprisoning of corruptions flutters into the velvety city.  
Of a red daughter that kisses ripples.  
I do not smear in the land of misunderstood bramble.  
The giant smiles at the one  
but the goddess does not smile  
when he looks at the pheasant gentleman  
and the tremulous ocean.  
To the balanced color of the gold quiver.  
Shut out and shut out like a quilt.  
And meetings of silent lip the poppy fashions in creating your arm.
