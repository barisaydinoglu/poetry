I Have Gone Congealing
----------------------
It's a flowing pullulation of jugulars.  
Shall we recount?  
What spacious flags -  
the universe is filled with it,  
defenders for the sun rise and the inevitable crystal.  
I stayed awakened and transluscent yellow  
in the middle of the chimney.  
The light plan that has everyone morose.  
This barbaous mist and dedicating warmth buries me  
with it's gleaming branches like brow and finger  
and turqoise sea's skins like arm and angels.  
Everything hollow with homogeneous voices, the salt of the sea shell  
and piles of great bread amid morning.
