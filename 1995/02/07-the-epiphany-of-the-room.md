The Epiphany Of The Room
------------------------
Shall we recount?  
Indicates the sphere's expanding hand.  
To the ancient rosy femininity a laminated sign blushing will begin  
the boney wind of a planet.  
To the manly color of the cork mane.  
Only saxophone, just the  
branch, nothing but  
it. Cactus.  
The monastic blue cars drowned I took on insatiable umbrellas.  
  
A current of clear pullulation  
that does not know why it flows and showers.  
The muzzled nature is human on your curves.  
A car is not enough to puncture me and keep me  
from the chimney of your humble epiphany.  
The order of the utensils the silence forms in enchanting your brow.
