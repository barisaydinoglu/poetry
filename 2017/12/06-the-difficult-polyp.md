The Difficult Polyp
-------------------
It was the early light of day of the squirrel.  
Carry me onto your car - the mango of my landscape -  
you've asked me what the jaguar is pacifying there with his transluscent crimson shoulder?  
I  
reply, the propeller knows this.  
Our new splendor, our decisive aroma tetrahedrons.  
I'd do it for the thread in which you wake  
for the ribbons of green you've performed.  
A school  
focuses its dream of a beginning, its new ending, the new ending of the silvery lake order -  
its somber consequences.  
And a lonely moon's clay will protect you.  
But I should be untrue to computer science, brainwashing among its distorted times  
so let us try to divulge a story devoid of aerial redundancies.  
  
It was the day of the pheasant.  
They dismantled it with inaccessible umbrellas.  
Fluttering the wine bottle of her rose full of pride.  
Everything tenacious with musical voices, the salt of the tiger  
and piles of nocturnal bread inside lunchtime.  
Shall we recount?  
You dedicate my boneless shrapnel  
like an angellic elephant to fresh lemon.  
Shall we set forth?  
A warmth of your body enriching will store  
the bitten electricity of a planet.
