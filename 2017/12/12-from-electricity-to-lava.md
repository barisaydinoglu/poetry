From Electricity To Lava
------------------------
Refreshing toward the smooth iron my heart moves from being frightened to being  
angellic. In front of the key of the vicinity where you sleep,  
a dream chains into synonyms.  
Halfway.  
A yellow root begins.  
I salute your thick wine  
and envy your serendipidous pride.  
Of changeless nectarine, spirit  
of the rituals,  
deceived custodian blood, your kisses  
crystallize into exile  
and a droplet of saphire, with remnants of the night.
