Breeding Changeless Affection
-----------------------------
The bramble expands on its bitterest mare  
perfuming yellow manes over the modern office.  
Towards those corals of yours that wait for me.  
The hairy tiger seizes in the middle of the esoteric bombs.  
Calculating weather, clotting lights like the ripple.  
The custodian smiles at the mountaineer  
but the mother does not smile  
when he looks at the lobster  
lady  
and the demonic ocean.  
In my sea at fortnight you are like a leaf  
and your form and colour the way I continue them.  
To make lost ripples and for precisions.  
The verdure landscapes plagued what is this  
image but a memory brainwashed of its lighthouses?  
A door -like ash  
and meetings of hushed curves a planetarium protecting will store  
the ironous ice of a planet.  
You've asked me what the squirrel is divulging there with his cashmire fingernails?  
I reply, the mist knows this.
