A Song Of Sincerity
-------------------
  
Imbue on the brambles that wait for you  
drowning the sticky chairs, penetrating the doors.  
Conducting from skeleton paper-mache.  
A vessel is not enough to mutate me and keep me  
from the sea of your warm curiosities.  
Opaque transluscent transparent and slender mother,  
In your curves of confusion the modern office of smooth irons swim.  
Person of the depths of my fingernails - your waking  
stills your eager regard as though it were mud.  
Pockets of aluminum converted into wooden.  
Pure abberation perches the quilts but I should be true to science, loathing among its lewd railroad tracks  
so let us seek to divulge a story without minor redundancies.  
And meetings of harsh ears only wayside and to a  
sailor they take on time, twenty-seven years  
nothing but that sea shell of autumns.  
And snows and wreaths.  
Towards those momenta of yours that wait for  
me.  
Shut out and shut out like a flute.  
Silence me and let my substance appreciate.  
Connected and then entertained in the jungle.
