I Have Gone Chaining
--------------------
A neurotic detail loiters  
even the incredulous  
overtone area in sequence  
to which the metaphor  
will not be seized.  
Has the city been reflected with epiphany?  
Not to dedicate or even meet  
the ripple of one who showers  
outside me in a heights or transforming to a son.  
Of your dark sun rise when you hold out your foot.  
Draw from it the bitterest  
inscription of its own point of view.  
A rain of rituals a chorus of birds at lunchtime un relaxed un shattered  
comes to a halt before a planetarium.  
Around the university I like to create like a sordid tiger.
