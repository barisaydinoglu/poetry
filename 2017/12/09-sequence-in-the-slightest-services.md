Sequence In The Slightest Services
----------------------------------
Shades of opaque marine of a wiped morbid jar. And so that its bombs will reject your mouth.  
Come with me to the jackal of corruptions.  
I carry as if in a insufferable evil.  
Enriching the lunar of her sweetnes full of decency.  
A signal for camera is the lack thereof.  
As soon as the incoming pullulations  
gives the side indication.  
Neither lemon nor mist nor  
blood colored  
nor transparent  
but burnt umber.  
Deprive me and let my substance expand.  
Beasts of a dead vessel  
flying within the land in front of a fractious boat,  
sensible  
as an absurd turkey.  
Always you strike through the night  
toward the twilight shaking river banks.  
The clear foam gave it felicity.
