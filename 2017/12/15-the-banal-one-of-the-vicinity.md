The Banal One Of The Vicinity
-----------------------------
They are all goddesses  
professional evils in whose comfortable trysts originate.  
For springtime was calcerous and morally negative.  
But the muscle rustled the memory.  
Sepia electricity to my violenet necklace!  
The oily crab magnifies in the arcane ashes.  
My cosmic lip makes you always.  
Travelling a momentum  
circumscribed in the thick sunshine.  
As soon as the incoming guitars  
gives the side indication.  
As if to force or preserve or overflow.  
  
I am degraded by tree and thorn tree, by trash barge and drizzle.  
And so that its rotten stumps will abolish your hand.
