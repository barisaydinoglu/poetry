Tell Them That I Am Giving Up Conducting In Points Of View
----------------------------------------------------------
Fractious twilight and the blood-stained laminated sign  
force at the walls of my house. We get the color  
they must lots to awaken  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but corpses.  
Perhaps they are not foreboded.  
Conquer me and let my substance kiss.  
To circumscribe lost sea shells and for ribbons.  
A current of irreducable guitar  
that does not know why it flows and creates.  
Everything hushed with hidden voices, the salt of the autumn  
and piles of winged bread within midnight.
