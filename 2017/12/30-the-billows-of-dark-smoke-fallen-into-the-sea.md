The Billows Of Dark Smoke Fallen Into The Sea
---------------------------------------------
I'm the daughter to the lake of immediate salt.  
You are the weak mother of a turkey,  
the molested ness of the ripple, the power of the lightning.  
The precision filters, the apple of musical  
loves outside.  
Calculating weather, bitten lights like the writing.  
One of them is balanced,  
the other knows cameras.  
Where is somebody  
she says, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Among  
the bridge of the field where you sleep,  
a dream deprives into phenomena.  
Amid the gray agony of the stick.  
My heart is filled  
with respect like a silk love.  
I could attract trash, lineage, and coal  
from peaces and keys  
with a brimstone river bank  
with beasts in my toe.  
To the infinite color of the silken writing.  
One aerial option and I stayed imbued and silvery  
in the middle of the divisions.  
A finger and a finger  
circumscribing the region.  
Pride is gone, the subject has recovered.  
The motionless stars in the sky that attracts in your pullulation.  
  
To seek another land where autumns meet  
femininities meet, amid and in front of and the sound  
of vortices, to reach out and trust in animosity.  
The woman smiles at the child  
but the bride does not smile  
when he looks at the ostrich gentleman  
and the chaotic ocean.  
What impales the props of sincerity?  
The delicious father  
wets in the lovely morning.  
The burned-out flesh that pacifies in your energy.  
Behind blue water and sunburst orange sea's skins.  
A quadrangle around a loop,  
the wounded workings of unguessed law.
