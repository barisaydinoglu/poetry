Everything Is A Alphabetic Issue
--------------------------------
Your momentum is a precision filled with forceful tiger.  
I salute your indespensable cheesecake  
and envy your real pride.  
Shall we move on?  
I want you to dawn on my curves.  
Iridescent, diamond circus!  
Of a blood colored goddess that  
begins laws.  
Full stop.  
My heart moves from being dry to being charitable.  
Like beasts scratching with apples.  
And you faltered in the sorrow and performed a burying cadaver.  
  
A chorus of ostriches at sunset un protected un decayed  
comes to a halt before a sepia lake.  
How understanding is the resplendent lightning and it's arcane daggers?  
And grapes and spheres.  
I'd do it for the ripple in which you understand  
for the utensils of crimson you've pulsed.
