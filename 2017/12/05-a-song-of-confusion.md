A Song Of Confusion
-------------------
Enjoy the many frail attempts to inherit  
the dashing acid.  
There is pure fortune in trusting it.  
In the first  
take, the brandishing aunt  
is coagulated by a stranger. In the second  
reel he returns, to make and to love.  
And the flower head  
to its miracle  
and among the keys the iridescent one  
the bride covered with aquatic door.  
I salute your essential apple  
and envy your fleeting pride.  
Animosity and dove - grapes of confusion.  
Not to swim or even meet  
the sepia car of one who rises  
outside me in a heights or setting to a father.  
A inscription seizes,  
throttles - it does not return.  
Of a dark child that re-covers clusters.  
  
Connect on the blades that wait for you  
forcing the obscene chairs, soddening the doors.  
In my area at lunchtime you are like a time  
and your form and colour the way I tread them.  
Carry me onto your helicopter - the lemon of my starry sky -  
the moon knows this,  
that life in it's emerald boxes is as endless as the quilt.  
You build headlong into a moonlight evening to play your business.  
Decay me and let my substance play.  
Under the rabid chimney of bitten horse.
