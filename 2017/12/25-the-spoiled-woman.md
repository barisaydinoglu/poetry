The Spoiled Woman
-----------------
My heart is filled with wonder like a ivory vein.  
Always you bury through the lunchtime  
toward the lunchtime silencing farms.  
The railroad track plan that has everyone melancholy.  
The moonlit dignity of the femininity!  
Transluscent burnt umber martyrs of smoke,  
marine seams above a molested sun.  
A opaque turqoise and morose acrobat is dismantled in the night.  
I do not freeze in the archipeligos  
of nauesous trash.
