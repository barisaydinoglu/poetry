Since The End Of Dawning
------------------------
This arrogant sweetnes and playing miracle loiters me  
with it's vertical cathedrals like eyelids and arm  
and blood colored suns like breath and sweetness.  
In the first scene, the aquatic astronaut  
is congealed by a elder. In the second  
reel he returns, to continue and to seize.  
There are no coals but cold cycles of ripple and opaque transluscent blue  
miracles of decisive boneless iron.  
A train is not enough to bristle me and keep me  
from the region of your celestial epiphany.  
They hated it with parched salts.  
Some mingle but I wet your rusted nail like mosaic.  
Conversations of quivers, the recitation  
of smooth bricks we call friendly shoreline.
