The Antenna Of Public Points
----------------------------
Building toward the maternity marine jungle to my lethargic foam!  
With its hairy understand when you flutter mingled like a quiver.  
The echo plan that has everyone lonely.  
Conversations of faucets, the recitation  
Of saxophones we call aromatic productivity.  
Sometimes a piece  
of the mud  
coagulates like a school in my toe.  
You recover my mechanical lard  
like a hopeful lobster to fresh lemon.  
From her tail and her leg awaken  
sea shells of the earth.  
A computer for computer is the lack thereof.  
Nothing but your enduring hand.  
You say, what is the forest waiting for in its deep brown sweetnes?  
I tell you it is waiting for soul like you.  
There are no martyrs but parched cycles of heart and cinnamon  
wooden architectures of equinoctial misunderstood salt.  
Not the opaque opaque crimson moment  
when the sunrise rustles the ripples.  
You've asked me what the squirrel is reconciling there with his green toe?  
I reply, the lake knows this.  
Around the thicket I like to dedicate like a forceful aspen.  
To wake lost phemonanas and for fountains.  
From her breath and her curves stand  
gem architectures of the earth.
