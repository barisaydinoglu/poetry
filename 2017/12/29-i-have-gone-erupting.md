I Have Gone Erupting
--------------------
Divulging the quiver of her drop full of pride. Dead imbroglios and callous wounds.  
To the equinoctial pure root the honest sailor  
enchants in the sanguine morning.  
When the region is full of communist foot  
outside convicts and browbeaten imperalist sea's skins  
and the disordered flags and the lighthouses  
at last give forth their sordid twisting lonely road.  
If I could inherit the self-production and the area.  
But the lunar woke the memory.  
The law decays, the guitar of sensual  
swims with.  
In the smallest marble warmth  
and the star to its book  
and among the reflections the lovely one  
the giant covered with acerb springtime.  
  
The reasons for my respect  
are discovered in my ears of gem.  
In your brow of bristling the boulevard begins to dream of seeking.
