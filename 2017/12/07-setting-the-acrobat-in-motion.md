Setting The Acrobat In Motion
-----------------------------
Like the listless aluminum of coats with the rust colored animosity of the coffin.  
There are no wounds but sticky cycles of kis and cinnamon  
autumns of loving parched metal.  
Pulled out and pulled out like a soul.  
I took on dead moons.  
What is this technique but a memory died of its evening stars?  
Not trusting is a form of flowing.  
  
Fashion on the vigils that wait for you  
flying the silent chairs, ignoring the doors.
