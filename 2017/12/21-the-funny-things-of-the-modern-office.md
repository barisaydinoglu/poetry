The Funny Things Of The Modern Office
-------------------------------------
Outside the distorted stone, many worn-out wombs.  
Noone here is waiting for the next grace.  
Map. You circumscribed yourself for rejoicing.  
Nothing but that flint of tigers.  
A evening star focuses its dream of a ending, its new ending, the new beginning of the peace order -  
its manly scandalmongerings.  
  
Arrogant twilight and the lethargic nature  
hate at the walls of my house.  
With its tear stained pulse sepia walls of vortex,  
silvery seams above a hated foliage.  
Of a gray lady that relinquishes evening stars.  
Nothing but your fleeting eyelids.  
And laminated signs and goblets.  
Rise on the trashes that wait for you  
dropping the tear stained chairs, gnawing the doors.  
But the river returned the memory.
