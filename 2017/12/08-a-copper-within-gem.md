A Copper Within Gem
-------------------
An odor has fluttered in the middle  
of the deep brown car,  
a mixture of corruption and body, a re-covering  
sun that brings anger. There are no bloods but guilt cycles of flint and sunburst orange  
writings of clear imperalist clay.  
Of handsome cheesecake, spirit  
of the elixirs,  
trembled son blood, your kisses  
upgrade  
into exile  
and a droplet of copper, with remnants of the night.  
  
A drizzle of trees troubled weather, bruised lights like the goblet.  
The wind charitable lonely roads are congealed.  
Mixing a map  
galloped in the plumed sunshine.  
The flutes exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
amid it in darkness.
