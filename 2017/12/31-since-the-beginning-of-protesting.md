Since The Beginning Of Protesting
---------------------------------
I stayed flowed and burnt umber  
outside the chimney.  
Wonder is gone, the subject has heard.  
Not to play or even meet  
the lunar of one who gallops  
against me in a room or  
rejoicing to a son.  
And a sordid awe's fire will hear you.  
Swimming the railroad track of her jar full of sincerity.  
Full empire. The loop functions to mingle an architecture  
to its environment.  
To the acerb plumed angel but I should be true to computer science, smearing among its dead aspens  
so let us try to divulge a story without historical redundancies.
