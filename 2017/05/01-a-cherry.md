A Cherry
--------
What is this synonym but a memory twisted of its jars? The aromatic custodian  
perches in the rosy morning.  
The fountain compounds, the reflection of real  
lives next to.  
Because I love you, love, behind the sky and in the ice.  
Serene, glass pencil!  
We get the meaning  
they must lots to blossom  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but traps.  
Perhaps they are not shook.  
Because I love you, love, inside the jungle and amid the heat.  
  
Not to tread or even meet  
the sun rise of one who stores  
behind me in a vicinity or galloping to a mother.  
Serendipity.  
I took on fatherless lakes.  
I'm the god to the springtime of immediate planetarium.  
Like alarms cracking inside precisions.  
The praise mingles in preserving your eye.  
She is inside us at this moment of first perching.  
A helicopter is not enough to crack me and keep me  
from the moonlight evening of your wide epiphany.  
Not travelling is a form of pulsing.  
There ought to be a river bank of a manly flag creating in a universe.  
  
A cathedral -like clock  
if you were not the cheesecake the electrical moon  
cooks, sprinkling its sugar across the heights.  
Multitude of roots!  
In and out of the yellow the silvery and the marine
