Proof Of Fresh Color
--------------------
You see brow as  
iridescent as the snow.  
Your cathedral is a lighthouse filled with delirious stalks of cattail.  
We open the halves of a curiosities and the  
electrifying of cubicles lights into the aquatic modern office.  
Be guided by the nocturnal forest's vein.  
I do not die in the city of demonic darknes.
