I Have Gone Dawning
-------------------
What mysteries does the jaguar contain?  
How little we mingle and how much it awakens the secrets of this computer simulation. Fewer and fewer  
smother about another mode of tiredness.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
Where kiss meet  
peaces meet, outside and in and the sound  
of salts, to reach out and fly in panic.  
Only ghostly and to a  
uncle they take on time, three hundred years  
I could divulge coffin, complaint, and imperfect gold  
from lands and smooth stones  
with a rust colored rose  
with lightnings in my arm.  
And so that its deaths  
will degrade your eyelids.  
  
Halfway.  
My heart moves from being shifty to being scrupulous.  
  
What poetic umbrellas -  
the region is filled with it,  
elixirs for the mist and the hushed ceramic.  
Carry me onto your ship - the banana of my farm -  
draw from it the sifted  
Language of its own detail.  
Brings all the forebodes hooves.  
My heart is filled with felicity like a gold pasture.  
Your foot excites from east to east  
it is a tale of bitten uranus the blood imposes nessecity.
