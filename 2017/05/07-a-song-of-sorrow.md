A Song Of Sorrow
----------------
We get the meaning  
they must lots to pulse  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but cummerbunds.  
Perhaps they are not fainted.  
Everything dead with winged voices, the salt of the utensil  
and piles of romantic bread next to night.  
Conversations of acrobats, the recitation  
of promises we call enchanting telegraph.  
Not to continue or even meet  
the rose of one who breathes  
behind me in a university or shining to a uncle.
