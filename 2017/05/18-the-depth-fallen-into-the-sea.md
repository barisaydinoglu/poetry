The Depth Fallen Into The Sea
-----------------------------
In the face of so many havocs to positivity. When you travel swam like a coat.  
Return to the homeland of the lunars.  
Flowing from oily silicon.  
Come with me to the havoc of legumes.  
Fire-tipped weather, bitten lights like the cluster.
