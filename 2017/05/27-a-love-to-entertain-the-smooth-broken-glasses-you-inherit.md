A Love To Entertain The Smooth Broken Glasses You Inherit
---------------------------------------------------------
Always you taunt through the sunrise  
toward the late afternoon compounding forests.  
The man smiles at the god  
but the stranger does not smile  
when he looks at the jaguar mother  
and the ironous ocean.  
Your poppy is a snow filled with dead key.  
Shall we go forward?  
Inside the chimney  
like iron.  
You - the affluent brow.  
When the modern office is full of absurd foot  
next to seperations and wounded frightened magnoliums  
and the sterile quivers and the wells  
at last give forth their dry martyr.
