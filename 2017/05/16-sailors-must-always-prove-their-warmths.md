Sailors Must Always Prove Their Warmths
---------------------------------------
The yeast imposes nessecity.  
In the first reel, the brandishing elder  
is overflowed by a pioneer. In the second  
take he returns, to appreciate and to live.  
Multitude of laminated signs!  
In  
and out of the cashmire the marine and the transparent  
the harsh toucan grows in the middle of the eager puberties.  
  
This bitter momentum and recovering warmth scratches me  
with it's esoteric femininities like brow and brow  
and rust colored keys like fingernails  
and snows.  
I shower as if behind a neon pamphlet.  
Shall we move on?  
Realized myriad guitar I took on smothered phemonanas.  
Where knaves meet  
sea water meet, in front of and in and the sound  
of bloody feathers, to reach  
out and create in agony.  
What abandons the props of joy?  
A computer seeks,  
strikes - it does not return.
