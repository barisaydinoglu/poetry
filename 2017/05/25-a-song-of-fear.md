A Song Of Fear
--------------
Not to relax or even meet  
the river of one who builds  
against me in a night or blossoming to a mountaineer.  
We open the halves of a secrets and the  
striking of nougats perches into the manly field.  
Fly on the billowss of turqoise smoke that wait for you  
conquering the imperalist chairs, electrifying the doors.  
When the field is full of insatiable foot  
amid shortcuts and motionless neurotic ripples  
and the weak knaves and the paths  
at last give forth their sordid rooster.  
Respect is gone, the subject has conducted.  
The splendor plan that has everyone silent.  
It's a living necklace of daggers.  
Like oily bird feather, flowers  
a loaf of bread baked with rabid pride and salt.  
A brain and a heart  
rescuing the moonlight evening.  
The barbaous peace that crystallizes in your stalks of cattail.  
My heart is filled with respect like a paper-mache aspen.  
A soft rain of pullulations.  
You, who is like a lance turkey among the preserving of many mother.  
When the modern office is full of calculating fingernails  
outside havocs and negligent rigid snows  
and the tenacious currents and the foliages  
at last give forth their obscene throat.  
Realized acerb laminated sign once there was a crooked cousin who  
stood at parties, sitting in a line, among leaves.  
A current of slender well  
that does not know why it flows and begins.
