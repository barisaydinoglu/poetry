Rustling Distorted Nostalgia
----------------------------
Someone here is waiting for the next law.  
Candle. You connected yourself for chirping.  
Dedicating a peace  
trod in the serendipidous sunshine.  
The grace knows this,  
that life in it's silicon boxes is as endless as the love.  
I mix as if amid a molested yeast.  
Towards those forests of yours that wait for me.  
The honeysuckle transforms in transforming your heart.  
Chaotic lunchtime and the raucous sunburst orange car  
wet at the walls of my house.  
The yellow cars exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
amid it in darkness.  
Enriched and then returned in the vicinity.  
  
What incredulous acrobats -  
the divisions is filled with it,  
laws for the energy and the neurotic cedar.
