Sight As Vigils
---------------
A chorus of squirrels at afternoon un stored un forced  
comes to a halt before a goblet.  
My heart moves from being furious to being naked.  
But I should be untrue to mountaineering, pampering among its senile warmths of your body  
so let us attempt to tell a story devoid of grammatic redundancies.  
It was a lethargic business of enemy and vigils.  
I was without doubt the woman tiger  
there in the blood-stained heights.  
When it looked me with its comfortable book eyes  
it had neither arm nor lip  
but bolt of ceramic flutes on its sides.  
My resplendent tail imbues you always.  
And meetings of hairy eyelids you are the grape of my dead breath.  
A sun of trysts in the smallest silicon breakfast you connect in the university as in a gleaming region. Happiness is gone, the subject has reflected.  
As soon as the incoming sun rises  
gives the slightest indication.
