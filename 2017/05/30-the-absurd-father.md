The Absurd Father
-----------------
Went trusted in snow I salute your lion hearted wine  
and envy your absent minded pride.  
Thirsty bloodied ashes and obscene receptacles.  
The fire-tipped acrobat that seeks in your root. Attracting from molested cork.  
The lunar abolishes, the writing of noble  
plays within.
