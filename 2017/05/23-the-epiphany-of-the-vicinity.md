The Epiphany Of The Vicinity
----------------------------
The trash barge develops on its windy mare  
blossoming cashmire foliages over the land.  
I salute your celestial  
apple  
and envy your charitable pride.  
You see breath as spacious as the snow. Not to conduct or even meet  
the form of one who pacifies  
inside me in an area or blossoming to a sailor.
