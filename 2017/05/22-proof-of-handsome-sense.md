Proof Of Handsome Sense
-----------------------
I took on directionless  
starry skies.  
To the indespensable color of the gem muscle.  
The granule imposes nessecity.  
And you rise like an acrobat and taunt me and let my substance begin.  
Amid the silvery eyeballs of the electricity.  
And so that its shrapnels will coagulate your curves.  
For a day, maybe thousand,  
I rested under a blade of grass  
at a post office, waiting for the child to be among.
