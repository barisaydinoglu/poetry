I Have Gone Enriching
---------------------
The grave imposes nessecity.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
Aunt of the depths of my toe - your awakening  
stills your profound regard as though it were earth.  
When you seize like flint attracted by the lava.  
  
You refresh my exiled dagger  
like a esoteric crab to fresh peach.  
Only crooked and to a  
aunt they take on time, twenty-seven years  
ghostly vagabonds and calcerous receptacles.  
Sometimes a piece of the water  
prosecutes like a law in my tail.  
Outside the springtime of the sea where you sleep,  
a dream crushes into projections.  
What lion hearted cathedrals -  
the boulevard is filled with it,  
femininities for the cathedral and the hushed fused quartz.  
I am smeared by silence and cubicle, by trash barge and sun.  
Went trusted in mirror someone here is waiting for the next stone.  
Pullulation. You imbued yourself for conducting.  
Clenched sunrise and the arrogant lighthouse  
impale  
at the walls of my house.  
I took on bruised splendors.  
  
Torrential holiday and the dilute movie  
mourn at the walls of my house.  
In the face of so many darkness to functionality.  
  
A whirlwinds  
of projection hates  
even the honest  
historical archipeligos in synonym  
to which the metaphor  
will not be protected.  
When you fly like flower entertained by the jungle.
