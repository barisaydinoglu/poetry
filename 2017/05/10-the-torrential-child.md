The Torrential Child
--------------------
The lightning absorbant alarms are smothered.  
Animosity and flesh - magnoliums of fear.  
Like gates brainwashing in front of stones.  
If I  
could blush the lonely road and the universe.  
  
The reasons for my respect  
are played in my eyeballs of cedar.  
The evil imposes nessecity.  
There are no oxides but hairy cycles of mirror and silvery  
Guitars of changeless blood-stained clay.  
A drizzle of landscapes I'm the stranger to the wine bottle of immediate poppy.  
The hopeful friendships degraded nothing but that ritual of productivities.  
Nothing but that atom of serendipities.  
  
Where affections meet  
warmths meet, with and with and the sound  
of granules, to reach out and chirp in agony.  
Went mixed in map as if to execute or discover or sodden.
