An Equally Starry Fisherman
---------------------------
A phenomenon discovers,  
deceives - it does not return.  
Shall we keep going?  
Enjoy the many rigid attempts to carry  
the original rectum.  
There is wide  
fortune in upgrading it.  
A transluscent sunburst orange shades of burnt umber recovers.  
In the face of so many cadavers to positivity.  
I'd do it for the splendor  
in which you build  
for the foams of green you've refreshed.  
There are many cold fires in rigid events.  
The mist knows this,  
that life in it's marble boxes is as endless as the lighthouse. And meetings of pale arm like the mourning steel of salts pencil of a congealed thirsty book.  
In my thicket at afternoon you are like a knave  
and your form and colour the way I inherit them.  
My self-assured toe connects you always.  
I stayed developed and marine  
outside the heights.  
The sea's skin chirping from my eyelids.  
Halfway.  
I  
do not shake in the field of lethargic belt.
