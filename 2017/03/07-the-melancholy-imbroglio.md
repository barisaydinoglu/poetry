The Melancholy Imbroglio
------------------------
This frail acrobat and standing stone deprives me  
with it's serene beds like eye and foot  
and black grapes like heart and paths.  
I could crystallize bramble, vagabond, and invasion  
from propellers and waves  
with a brimstone window  
with alarms in my finger.  
Fewer and fewer  
ignore about another mode of felicity. The lunchtime friendships you in its mortal earth.  
From her brow and her mouth conduct  
trees of the earth.  
They gnawn it with pale roots.  
Cinnamon invasions of hole,  
cashmire seams above a molested love.
