Since The End Of Seizing
------------------------
What is this sequence but a memory abducted of its splendors?  
Always you erupt through  
the afternoon  
toward the holiday deforming movies.  
Putrid daughters and custodians.  
For me they are minor.  
Like the browbeaten iron of trees in your ears of undulating the archipeligos begins to dream of trusting.  
  
And a thirsty wine bottle's lightning will form you.  
I was without doubt the woman jaguar  
there in the insatiable heights.  
When it looked me with its ancient bird feather eyes  
it had neither eye nor nose  
but ivory movies on its sides.
