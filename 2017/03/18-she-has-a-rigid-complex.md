She Has A Rigid Complex
-----------------------
Of a rust colored elder that rustles fellowships.  
You see fingernails as cosmic as the fog.  
Sometimes a piece of the earth  
imprisons like a trouser in my nose.  
Because I love you, love, outside the lava and outside the jungle.  
Moths of a boneless boat  
magnifying in front of the modern office with a disordered wheel,  
enduring as a guilt iguana.
