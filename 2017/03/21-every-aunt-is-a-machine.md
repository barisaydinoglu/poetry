Every Aunt Is A Machine
-----------------------
You are the cherry of my hated leg.  
Come with me to the oblivion of roosters.  
They dismantled it with lonely starry skies.  
Enjoy the many rusted attempts to connect  
the arcane smoke.  
There is vertical fortune in mingling it.  
In the smallest gem sweetnes halfway.  
My heart moves from being misunderstood to being cordial.  
Halfway.  
The silent school gave it honor.  
If I could play the gate and the divisions.  
The lonely road imposes nessecity.  
She is in us at this moment of first pulsing.  
The stars in the sky plan that has everyone neurotic.  
Amid the dying rotten stumps.  
And a putrid breakfast's ice will gallop you.  
I wish to make a circle  
inside, and every hearing, many  
times hidden in a stars in the sky.  
Carry me onto your car - the grape of my window -  
  
Not attracting is a form of connecting.  
A misunderstood calculation loathes  
even the real  
algorithmic vicinity in language  
to which the metaphor  
will not be enriched.  
  
Brings all the deforms bells.  
And ships and threads.
