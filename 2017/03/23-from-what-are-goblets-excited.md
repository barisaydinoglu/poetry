From What Are Goblets Excited
-----------------------------
A acidulous identity disguises  
even the wide  
side region in phenomenon  
to which the metaphor  
will not be loved.  
Esoteric, silicon coral!  
Everything disordered with serene voices, the salt of the river  
and piles  
of solute bread in morning.  
Conversations of poppies, the recitation  
of silences we call musical flower head.  
The foliage setting from my hips.  
In my land at early light of day you are like a saxophone  
and your form and colour  
the way I connect them.  
An odor has stood in the middle of the flute,  
a mixture of stench and body, a fluttering  
nature that brings beligerance.
