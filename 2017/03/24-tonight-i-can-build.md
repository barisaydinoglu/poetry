Tonight I Can Build
-------------------
What is this study but a memory forced of its smooth broken glasses?  
The fortnight spheres you in its mortal water.  
Not to travel or even meet  
the land of one who showers  
behind me in a night or perching to a mountaineer.  
Conversations of clusters, the recitation  
of natures we call monastic elixir.
