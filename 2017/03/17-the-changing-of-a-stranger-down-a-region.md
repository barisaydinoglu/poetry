The Changing Of A Stranger Down A Region
----------------------------------------
Has the boulevard been enriched with funny things? Cashmire nights of cubicle,  
marine seams above a furious quiver.  
In the middle of the tremulous splendor, many difficult complaints.  
Multitude of wells!  
In and out of the silvery the transparent and the yellow  
Abandon me and let my substance begin.  
Where muscles meet  
spheres meet, in front of and behind and the sound  
of stains, to reach out and understand in beligerance.  
If I could recover the invasion and the land.  
A serenity focuses its dream of a ending, its new ending, the new beginning of the transparent lake order -  
its eloquent bombs.  
One grammatic option and a prize -like salt  
opaque sepia lava to my sifted movie!  
Indicates the hat's responding eyelids.  
Some mingle  
but I continue your aluminum like fellowship.  
Like thorn trees coddling next to grapes.  
  
In the first take, the thick mountaineer  
is invaded by a pioneer. In the second  
scene he returns, to seek and to excite.  
Seizing toward the curtain a ultraviolet and chaotic promise is brainwashed in the room.  
  
It's a perfuming law of flasks.  
I stayed relinquished and sand-colored  
behind the field.
