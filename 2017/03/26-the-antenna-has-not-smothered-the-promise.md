The Antenna Has Not Smothered The Promise
-----------------------------------------
All atoms become complaints.  
Outside deep brown water and crimson guitars.  
Of your turqoise form when you hold out your hips.  
If I could trust the uranu and the university.  
In your breath of confusion the field of love pacify.  
A sepia cactus upgrades.
