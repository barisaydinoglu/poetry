Public Languages Are All Amid Us
--------------------------------
My acerb lip entertains you always.  
I do not taunt in the area of callous grave.  
And evening stars and guitars.  
Wave of wave of warmths of your body rolling down the sea.  
A machine for identity is the lack thereof.  
But I should be true to computer science, conquering among its rusted laws  
so let us attempt to divulge a story devoid of aerial redundancies.  
Draw from it the callous  
language of its own computer.  
The violence chirps on its frail mare  
kissing transparent corals over  
the thicket.
