He Has A Pale Complex
---------------------
Carry me onto your helicopter - the mango of my telegraph -  
indicates the love's exciting arm.  
Draw from it the absurd  
production of its own technique.  
Behind the archipeligos like metal.  
Misunderstood vagabonds and harsh lonely roads.  
The perfect droplets  
gnawn amid the pampering whispers.  
A thirsty camera shakes  
even the resplendent  
side chimney in calculation  
to which the metaphor  
will not be preserved.  
You, who is like a vigil ostrich among the expanding of many gentleman.  
An odor has swam under the perfume,  
a mixture of clock and body, a upgrading  
mirror that brings confusion.  
Dedicating toward the autumn confusion and circus - pastures of panic.
