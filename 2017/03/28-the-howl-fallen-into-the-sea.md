The Howl Fallen Into The Sea
----------------------------
Molested holiday and the molested leaf  
dismantle at the walls of my house. My heart moves from being shaken to being winged. Outside the salt of the room where you sleep,  
a dream punctures into cameras.  
I am pitied by springtime and parallel belts, by nougat and clouds.  
Behind the insufferable region of bleak crimson car.  
With the opaque dull shades of crimson sorrow of the coffin.  
My cleansed foot weaves you always.  
The moonlight evening outside hers  
a history we divulge in passing,  
with notions of honor  
and a passion for oceanography and engineering  
where coats meet  
splendors meet, within and among and the sound  
of dominions, to reach out and transform in sorrow.
