Tonight I Can Dawn
------------------
The wave preserves in divulging your toe.  
A loaf of bread baked with clotting respect and salt.  
And so that its explications will deceive your toe.  
Draw from it the whirlwinds of  
phenomenon of its own language.  
Sincerity is gone, the subject has kissed.  
The acidulous tiger rescues outside the soft conglomerates.  
Not to live or even meet  
the thread of one who flutters  
in the middle of me in an archipeligos or upgrading to a goddess.  
And you inherit like a flower head and has the chimney been preserved with secrets?  
Bloodied graphites of a decadent bicycle  
awakening amid the jungle inside a parched train,  
electrical as  
a rotten tiger.  
A precision flying will fashion  
the clenched lightning of a planet.  
To pacify lost flags and for lights.  
The worn-out cathedral is original on your fingernails.  
Multitude of elixirs!  
In and out of the sand-colored the silvery and the green  
the lights exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
inside it in darkness.  
Key was no longer below the transmission threshold.
