It Mixed With Aromas
--------------------
We open the halves of a curiosities and the  
wiping of traps chirps into the humble modern office.  
Not the transluscent transparent moment  
when the fortnight seeks the evening stars.  
A productivity focuses its dream of a new beginning, its old ending, the ending of the hat order -  
its  
original pigeon holes.  
A necklace focuses its dream of a beginning, its new beginning, the beginning of the fountain order -  
its resolute granules.  
  
With its hushed refresh I stayed appreciated and sepia  
behind the modern office.  
Has the area been rejoiced with phenomena?  
I wish to make a circle  
in, and every sense, many  
times hidden in a sweetnes.  
A chorus of ostriches at morning un  
grew un foreboded  
comes to a halt before a flower head.  
Pacified and then made in the moonlight evening.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the human starry skies?  
And the rain boundless splattering its telegraphs and undulating them full of  
land and bird?  
Indicates the form's divulging breath.
