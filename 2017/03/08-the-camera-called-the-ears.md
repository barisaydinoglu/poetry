The Camera Called The Ears
--------------------------
A fire-tipped bird feather day  
our new time, our profound moon tetrahedrons.  
The fresh bride  
seeks in the round morning.  
I want you to return on my lip.  
Halfway.  
In the smallest fused quartz wheatfield to upgrade lost utensils and for praises.  
An odor has stood inside the tiger,  
a mixture of jugular and body, a continuing  
cathedral that brings fear.  
You are the raucous bride of a pheasant,  
the silent ness of the bottle, the power of the ice.  
The flutes exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
next to it in darkness.  
Halfway.  
Of a turqoise daughter that blossoms poppies.  
I am passed by bottle and wall, by legless  
horse and drizzle.
