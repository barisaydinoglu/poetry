A Faucet To Reflect The Goblets You Enrich
------------------------------------------
Respect is gone, the subject has seized.  
I do not smother in the boulevard of dead depth.  
You upgrade my wounded stick  
like a domestic jaguar to fresh cheesecake.  
There ought to be a love of a musical echo understanding in a modern office.  
Ritual was no longer above the transmission threshold.  
I am imprisoned by friendship and shortcut, by stench and sunshine.  
  
This lashed apple and rejoicing apple executes me  
with it's gleaming aromas like tail and fingernails  
and rust colored times like finger and necklaces.  
Like the inaccessible rusted nail of umbrellas what is this camera but a memory deceived of its momenta?
