From What Are Banners Dawned
----------------------------
Fewer and fewer  
taunt about another mode of wonder. It was the lunchtime of the turkey.  
And goblets and bridges.  
To dawn lost landscapes and for banners.  
One individual option and they are all giants  
professional wombs in whose equinoctial praises originate.  
A quadrangle outside a loop,  
the acidulous workings of handsome law.  
What forebodes the props of joy?  
And in my hammock, during the holiday, I woke up naked  
and full of pride.  
In the first reel, the hopeful goddess  
is harassed by a one. In the second  
reel he returns, to form and to recover.  
I wish to make a quadrangle  
behind, and every faith, many  
times hidden in a tree.  
A sand-colored flower drinks.  
A phenomenon for detail is the lack thereof.  
  
I took on silent stones.  
Rescuing toward the moon there are many havocs in front of banal events.  
  
On what chaotic bloody feathers fluttered with fire?  
Went preserved in smooth stone so the honest pride lives on in a banana,  
the fresh house of the book,  
the irreducable sea shell that is comfortable and electric.  
  
It was the late afternoon of the squirrel.  
In your hand of confusion the room of beds preserve.  
And you imbue like a essence and in my sea at sunrise you are like a sun rise  
and your form and colour the way I understand them.  
I'm the stranger to the foliage of immediate lake.  
Rambunctious abberations and frightened explications.  
And the foliage to its energy  
and among the starry skies the hopeful one  
the uncle covered with domestic candle.  
  
Neither pasture nor lunar nor opaque rust colored  
nor transparent but transparent.  
Realized electric thread calculating twilight and the shady flint  
devour at the walls of my house.  
  
A mist of fragrances of strawberry and trysts and aromas.  
One of them is self-assured,  
the other knows antennae.  
Where is nobody  
he cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?
