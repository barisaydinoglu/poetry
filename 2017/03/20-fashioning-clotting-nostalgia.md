Fashioning Clotting Nostalgia
-----------------------------
You blush in the sea as in a balanced land.  
Neither kis nor splendor nor turqoise  
nor sepia but transparent.  
The foliages exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
in it in darkness.  
My heart moves from being lethargic to being electric.  
Because I love you, love, outside the wind and outside the lava.  
Once there was a calcerous elder who  
imbued at parties, sitting in a triangle, among defenders.
