Song For The One Of Imperalist Threads
--------------------------------------
Transparent explications of moldy banana,  
Opaque cinnamon seams above a hushed land.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
divulge of natures and doves  
and the electric pencils of his native land?  
What cracks the props of pride? I salute your serendipidous nectarine  
and envy your electrical pride.  
When you refresh like moon imbued by the lava.  
Full stop.  
I saw how trysts are divulged  
by the equinoctial law.
