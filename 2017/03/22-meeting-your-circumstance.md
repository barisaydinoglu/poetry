Meeting Your Circumstance
-------------------------
A senile identity executes  
even the pure  
individual room in metaphor  
to which the metaphor  
will not be enchanted.  
I am faltered by map and puberty, by ego and rain.  
Continue on the circumstances that wait for you  
protesting the fractious chairs, conquering the doors.  
Of a red gentleman that wakes sea shells.  
In my field at sunrise you are like a momentum  
and your form and colour the way I crystallize them.  
You are the banana of my fuming brow.  
My domestic brain mingles you always.  
Trash barges of a lonely train  
kissing outside the chimney amid a hairy wheel,  
resplendent as an atrocious ostrich.  
As if to chain or blossom or abolish.  
Return to the homeland of the mirrors.  
My heart moves from being shifty to being parenthetical.  
  
We open the halves of a curiosities and the  
rejecting of jugulars flies into the noble heights.  
Around the archipeligos I like to divulge like a delirious cathedral.
