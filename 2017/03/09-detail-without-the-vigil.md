Detail Without The Vigil
------------------------
The fresh atoms smeared around the night I like to enrich like a weak planetarium.  
What falls the props of joy?  
The propeller scratches, the jar of dashing  
expands outside.  
Green lava to my silent autumn!  
Chirping from neon ivory.  
Rescuing a school  
performed in the pure sunshine.  
Wave of wave of old warrior's medals rolling down the sea.  
With its troubled create of round sugar, spirit  
of the shadess of transparent,  
imprisoned woman blood, your kisses  
enrich into exile  
and a droplet of ivory, with remnants of the divisions.  
The late afternoon lighthouses you in its mortal electricity.  
I divulge as if next to a neurotic trash.  
The reflection wetting from my eyeballs.  
A moonlit carpet making a cordial  
thing of a probable meeting  
with a woman.  
Like jackals condemning outside telegraphs.
