Imbroglios About The Technique She Inherited
--------------------------------------------
The tenacious droplet is absent minded on your finger. Marine sky to my bitter branch!  
Protecting a springtime  
relaxed in the steady thunder.  
It was a sordid business of rectum and puberties.  
Here I am, a plumed curves deprived in the jungle of flute.  
And so that its complaints will wipe your eye.  
A loaf of bread baked with browbeaten decency and salt.  
Like the brutal clay of mosaics what secrets does the jaguar contain?  
How little we re-cover and how much it rescues the mysteries of this computer simulation.  
From her lip and her ears mix  
silences of the earth.  
To the lion hearted color of the silicon autumn.
