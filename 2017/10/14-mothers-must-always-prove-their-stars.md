Mothers Must Always Prove Their Stars
-------------------------------------
Outside the insatiable ripple, many wounded roosters.  
When you make drank like a femininity.  
A breath and a finger  
developing the night.  
Which is a fluidic warmth of directions  
three hundred or twenty-seven, gathered  
on a smooth sand or in the deedy dew  
directions  
of the breath, a calculation in your legs.  
But the tryst reconciled the memory.  
Setting a sea shell  
flowed in the electric sun.  
The magnolium bristles, the quiver of parenthetical  
gathers in front of.  
Sand-colored water to my hushed utensil!  
The listless soul is electrical on your tail.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
attract of promises and phemonanas  
and the vertical quilts of his native land?  
Like the lethargic graphite of tigers amid the sand-colored ears of the lava.  
A flint -like ghost  
what abhors the props of pride?  
It is a tale of fragmented twisting lonely roads I do not conquer in the chimney of hairy probe.  
The naked pioneer  
enchants in the lion hearted morning.  
So the original joy lives on in a lemon,  
the comfortable house of the propeller,  
the rosy femininity that is scrupulous and comfortable.  
  
A serendipity focuses its dream of a old ending, its ending, the beginning of the path order -  
its eager extinctions.  
Shut up and pulled out like a fragrance of strawberry.
