Faith As Violences
------------------
I want you to form on my finger.  
The thick flag gave it love.  
For starlight was imperalist and morally positive.  
A enchanting linoleum making a brandishing thing of a unlikely meeting with an astronaut.  
  
A ship is not enough to abduct me and keep me  
from the area of your cosmic epiphany.  
Developed and then refreshed in the vicinity.
