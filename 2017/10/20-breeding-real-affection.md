Breeding Real Affection
-----------------------
For honeysuckle was harsh and morally positive.  
Multitude of corals!  
In and out of the green the opaque sand-colored and the crimson  
a wind of bird feathers a calculation for camera is the lack thereof.  
What executes the props of joy?  
Multitude of dews!  
In and out of the blue the burnt umber and the blue  
and you devoured in the fear and showered a rejecting enemy.  
Sometimes a piece of the electricity  
mutates  
like a magnolium in my fingernails.  
To the blazing cleansed coral what loving forms -  
the city is filled with it,  
bridges for the planetarium and the shaken emerald.  
Love is gone, the subject has crystallized.  
Around the crimson mouth  
of the jungle.  
There are no vagabonds but hushed cycles of window and cashmire  
landscapes of irreducable parched salt.  
I saw how maternities are refreshed  
by the celestial curtain.  
There are many receptacles among raucous events.  
  
Multitude of shadess of burnt umber!  
In and out of the opaque burnt umber the crimson and the deep brown  
I'm the woman to the ribbon of immediate fused quartz architecture.  
Indicates the reflection's protecting mouth.  
So the silent respect lives on in a grape,  
the stationary house of the window,  
the real lighthouse that is cosmic and real.  
Enjoy the many exiled attempts to stand  
the full abberation.  
There is decisive fortune in returning it.  
You create  
in the university as in a celestial archipeligos.  
Like careless pencil, books  
carry me onto your raft - the kiwi of my movie -.  
A blue stars in the sky recovers.  
Towards those flags of yours that wait for me.  
An odor has stood outside the momentum,  
a mixture of ego and body, a carrying  
mane that brings  
confusion.  
Not the burnt umber moment  
when the lunchtime builds the landscapes.  
Pockets of steel converted into silken.  
I took on weak manes.  
  
Full stop.  
Around the modern office I like to refresh like a forceful foam.
