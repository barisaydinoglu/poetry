The Signal Of Side Points
-------------------------
There are no roosters but rabid cycles of rose and transluscent silvery  
pastures of decisive distorted broken glass.  
A demonic planetarium day  
against the smothered night of skeleton light.  
How returning is the iridescent throat and it's indespensable felicities?  
Nothing but that wave of bird feathers.  
A current of self-assured law  
that does not know why it flows and showers.  
Everybody here is waiting for the next drop.  
Garden. You relinquished yourself for beginning.  
Make on the complaints that wait for you  
twisting the difficult chairs, silencing the doors.  
We open the halves of a secrets  
and the  
penetrating of complaints entertains into the original archipeligos.  
But I should be true to mountaineering, harassing among its browbeaten forests  
so let us try to speak a story without neutral redundancies.  
Fluidic empire. The circle functions to play an architecture  
to its environment.  
I do not crack in the jungle of decadent flask.  
Inside the marine brain  
of the heat.  
In the middle of the bitter chimney of dead drop.  
  
The law knows this,  
that life in it's paper-mache boxes is as endless as the prize.  
As soon as the incoming stones  
gives the slightest indication.  
  
I could respond bloodied sand, darknes, and explication  
from warmths of your body and laws  
with a ultraviolet mist  
with darkness in my breath.  
The shadess of deep brown exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
outside it in darkness.
