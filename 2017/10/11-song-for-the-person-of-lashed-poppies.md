Song For The Person Of Lashed Poppies
-------------------------------------
Realized gleaming essence realized  
fresh sea's skin a point of view  
for point of view is the lack thereof.  
Of a blood colored stranger that reflects starry skies.  
Because I love you, love, next to the ice and among the ice.  
A fog of bird feathers our new fellowship, our blazing ribbon quadrangles.  
In the middle of the senile modern office of morose jar.  
In the first reel, the charitable fisherman  
is compounded by a son. In  
the second  
take he returns, to gather and to store.  
And you promise like a warmth and the affection steals, the farm of secure  
upgrades in.  
Around the archipeligos I like to travel like a communist promise.  
This thirsty lake and standing angel crushes me  
with it's aquatic maternities like ears and ears  
and brimstone eddies like eye and splendors.  
A loaf of bread baked with morbid respect and salt.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
transform of films and saxophones  
and the brandishing books of his native land?
