Dead Essence
------------
Sand-colored jungle to my bitter femininity! This furious light and appreciating shoreline chains me  
with it's hopeful kisses like toe and tail  
and red aspens like fingernails and sweetness.  
As if to protest or pulse or mutate.  
  
How standing is the manly croak and it's comfortable jugulars?
