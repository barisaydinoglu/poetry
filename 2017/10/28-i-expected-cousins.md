I Expected Cousins
------------------
Come with me to the clock of clocks.  
On what fragmented vortices mixed with clay?  
My heart is filled with respect like a ceramic magnolium.  
You see lip as cleansed as the wind.  
And springtimes and maps.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
breathe of trousers and natures  
and the original stars of his native land?  
A deep brown sun rise entertains.
