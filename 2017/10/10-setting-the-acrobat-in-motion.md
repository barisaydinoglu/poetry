Setting The Acrobat In Motion
-----------------------------
The elder smiles at the custodian  
but the aunt does not smile  
when he looks at the jaguar aunt  
and the thirsty ocean. You see eye as vertical as the snow.  
Drop.  
You hear in the night as in a resplendent city.  
Come with me to the oxide of cold fires.
