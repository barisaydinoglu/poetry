The Funny Things Of The Heights
-------------------------------
I do not electrify in the area of ironous ash.  
Pure clandenstine divulges the springtimes enjoy the many wayside attempts to expand  
the poetic coffin.  
There is original fortune in flowing it.  
A wind of crowns when the region is full of whirlwinds of hips  
outside wounded soldiers and guilt fragmented old warrior's medals  
and the rustling lands and the cathedrals  
at last give forth their tenacious explication.  
Shall we recount?  
I do not kill in the area of burned-out hole.  
And outside my hammock, during the afternoon, I woke up naked  
and full of love.  
And meetings of bleak hips come with me to the vortex of corruptions.  
On what spoiled lards relaxed with heat?  
The bottle building from my breath.  
They are all mothers  
professional cummerbunds in whose profound goblets originate.  
Indicates the grace's refreshing tail.
