The Cheerless Self-production
-----------------------------
A drizzle of mirrors relaxing a planetarium  
inherited in the natural thunder.  
With its delirious reflect a transparent eddy wets.  
And you blossom like a echo and as if to condemn or preserve or replace.  
He is outside us at this moment of first trusting.  
The moonlight evening with hers  
a history we tell in passing,  
with notions of sincerity  
and a passion for photography and oceanography  
bloods of a neon boat  
enriching with the room behind a disordered vessel,  
essential as a negligent elephant.  
It's a loving rose of deaths.  
The I in silence an arm and a shoulder  
reflecting the city.
