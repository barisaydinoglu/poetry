The Anger Of The Technical Narrative
------------------------------------
With its lashed kiss they are all sailors  
professional bombs in whose  
real times originate. Wet-winged day and the torrential sea's skin  
fall at the walls of my house.  
To seek another land you've asked me what the tiger is  
carrying there with his opaque yellow shoulder?  
I reply, the elixir knows this.  
Hated coals and dead deaths.  
Decay me and let my substance refresh.
