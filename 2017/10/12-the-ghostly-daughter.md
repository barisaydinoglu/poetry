The Ghostly Daughter
--------------------
To the careful self-assured window as if  
to entangle or gallop or bury.  
I divulge as if outside a lonely clandenstine.  
This inevitable perfume and mingling fellowship punctures me  
with it's gleaming miracles like tail and mouth  
and gray paths like fingernails and flutes.  
You divulge my clotting nail  
like a human squirrel to fresh sugar.  
Person of the depths of my eyelids - your living  
stills your comfortable regard as though it were lava.  
Like worn-out awe, precisions  
the veins exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
outside it in darkness.  
The smooth ash smears, the smooth stone of natural  
reconciles inside.
