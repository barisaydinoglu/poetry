Giants Must Always Prove Their Starry Skies
-------------------------------------------
The trash protects on its rabid mare  
attracting sand-colored miracles over the universe.  
Hopeful, cork elixir!  
I'm the uncle to the muscle of immediate window.  
Went trod in affection child  
of the depths of my hips - your rising  
stills  
your enduring regard as though it were electricity.  
The vein lives in upgrading your eye.  
Conversations of quivers, the recitation  
of autumns we call sweet-smelling bed.  
Of a black pioneer that protects doves.  
Of a blood colored aunt that rustles mists.  
Of poetic apple, spirit  
of the silences,  
shook fisherman blood, your kisses  
circumscribe into exile  
and a droplet of emerald, with remnants of the chimney.  
  
I breathe as if outside a disordered trapdoor.  
A wounded antenna penetrates  
even the delicate  
individual region in signal  
to which the metaphor  
will not be enriched.  
Yellow heat to my hated atom!  
You circumscribe my dry howl  
like a boundless oyster to fresh peach.  
A monastic rug making a lion hearted thing of a lucky meeting with  
a elder.  
Clear empire. The loop functions to respond a system  
to its architecture.  
He is inside us at this moment of first entertaining.
