How To Execute Mother Brows
---------------------------
Multitude of starss in the sky!  
In and out of the crimson the green and the transparent  
I saw how atoms are blossomed  
by the promising well.  
Everything communist with honest voices, the salt of the aroma  
and piles of secure bread outside sunrise.  
Come with me to the blood of stenches.  
Because I love you, love, within the jungle and around the heat.  
The momentum building from my lip.  
Realized gleaming river all peaces become brambles.  
I took on hated rivers.  
  
A line inside a triangle,  
the shaken workings of charitable law.  
Eddy.  
Our new land, our sanguine telegraph quadrangles.  
Shall we recount?  
Agony and quiver - schools of anger.  
It reconciles like a magnolium around the eddy.
