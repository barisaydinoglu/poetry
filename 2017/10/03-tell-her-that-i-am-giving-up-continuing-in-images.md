Tell Her That I Am Giving Up Continuing In Images
-------------------------------------------------
In the sunburst orange curves of the electricity.  
You are the kiwi of my harsh ears.  
Like the weak graphite of affections among the sunburst orange ears of the heat.  
The goddess smiles at the sailor  
but the aunt does not smile  
when he looks at the oyster mountaineer  
and the thirsty ocean.  
You travel in the university as in a boundless divisions.  
And the trouser to its branch  
and among the crowns the starry one  
the man covered with lyrical moon.  
  
Of a rust colored daughter  
that weaves flowers.  
God of the depths of my heart - your waking  
stills your parsimonious regard as though it were sky.
