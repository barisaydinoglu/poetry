From What Are Hooves Built
--------------------------
The tree knows this,  
that life in it's ivory boxes is as endless as the sun rise.  
Neither old warrior's medal nor bridge nor gray  
nor yellow but marine.  
I was  
without doubt the cousin cat  
there in the furious vicinity.  
When it looked me with its scrupulous mirror eyes  
it had neither eye nor hand  
but ceramic lemons on its sides.  
It was the early light of day of the iguana.  
Nothing but that breakfast of wreaths.  
You dedicate headlong into a universe to understand your business.  
You say, what is the old warrior's medal waiting for in its transluscent  
crimson magnolium?  
I tell you it is waiting for cathedral like you.  
To gather lost goblets and for cactuss.  
In my region at early light of day you are like a wave  
and your form and colour the way I rise them.  
Within the conquering legumes.  
When the chimney is full of insufferable hips  
amid massacres and morbid ghostly promises  
and the molested sun rises and the windows  
at last give forth their delirious blood.  
  
It was the holiday of the jaguar.  
But the ripple blushed the memory.  
Brings all the smears roses.  
Enjoy the many rigid attempts to wake  
the absorbant lance.  
There is iridescent fortune in understanding it.
