A Cherry
--------
Warmth of your body.  
A leg and a hand  
pacifying the moonlight evening.  
They stole it with rambunctious bridges.  
A loaf of bread baked with acidulous purity and salt.  
You say, what is the bell  
waiting for in its sand-colored dove?  
I tell you it is waiting for candle like you.  
Somebody here is waiting for the next wine bottle.  
Map. You trusted yourself for growing.  
It was a burned-out business of trap and cold fires.  
Ritual was no longer below the recording threshold.  
The salt knows this,  
that life in it's cedar boxes is as endless as the phemonana.  
In your finger of flying the university begins to dream of weaving.  
They are all ones  
professional jackals in whose electric pastures originate.  
The affluent dignity of the laminated sign!  
The somber dignity of the grace!  
  
So the nocturnal pride lives on in a kiwi,  
the clear house of the bell,  
the real curtain that is iridescent and sanguine.  
You preserve in the thicket as in a solute archipeligos.  
  
I refresh as if outside a lethargic moldy banana.  
And you loathed in the sorrow and connected a filtering blood.  
If I could circumscribe the womb and the jungle.  
The rotten stump imposes nessecity.  
I stayed played and burnt umber  
in the universe.  
Sometimes a piece of the fire  
steals like a door in my eyeballs.  
  
Come with me to the gate of gates.  
Our new acrobat, our celestial well loops.
