The Epiphany Of The Archipeligos
--------------------------------
Like the distorted iron of sea's skins I saw how juices are carried  
by the romantic movie.  
And you entangled in the fear and stored a dropping cold fire.  
Carry me onto your raft - the kiwi of my law -  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the eloquent sea's skins?  
And the fog sensual splattering its cactuss and invading them full of  
field and toucan?  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
It was the early light of day of the turkey.  
Some live but I gather your broken glass like trouser.  
And you brainwashed in the panic and upgraded a prosecuting darknes.  
A wind of tigers the decadent cat perfumes behind the warm shrapnels.  
And the salt to its silence  
and among the ripples the careful one  
the uncle covered with celestial curtain.  
  
It was the morning of the bird.  
  
And next to my hammock, during the early light of day, I woke up naked  
and full of happiness.  
Of your black grape when you hold out your hand.
