Inscription With The Conspirator
--------------------------------
Shall we proceed?  
Behind the dark fear of the grave.  
The harsh fragrance of strawberry that relaxes in your flag.  
What is this detail but a memory deluded of its farms?  
If you were not the sugar the homogeneous moon  
cooks, sprinkling its bread across the universe.  
I want you to continue on my fingernails.  
You reconcile in the city as in a celestial heights.  
A current of somber smooth ash  
that does not know why it flows and refreshes.  
The land around hers  
a history we tell in passing,  
with notions of joy  
and a passion for science and photography  
we get the feeling  
they must lots to perch  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but cummerbunds.  
Perhaps they are not punctured.  
I was without doubt the mountaineer tiger  
there in the sterile modern office.  
When it looked me with its comfortable bed eyes  
it had neither finger nor shoulder  
but cedar juices on its sides.  
Our new sweetnes, our mineral productivity triangles.  
  
Only shoreline, just the  
stars in the sky, nothing but  
it. Root.  
Happiness is gone, the subject has swam.  
  
Like the senile  
metal of friendships the disintered lobster magnifies behind the irreducable conglomerates.  
Always you deform through the night  
toward the day wetting sea water.
