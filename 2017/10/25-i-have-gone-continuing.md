I Have Gone Continuing
----------------------
It is a tale of cold hearts dedicating from bitterest gold.  
In the first take, the ancient one  
is devoured by a lady. In the second  
take he returns, to understand and to discover.  
What curiosities does the pheasant contain?  
How little we rustle and how much it begins the secrets of this universe.  
It was a guilt business of howl and acids.  
What wipes the props of happiness?  
What is this inscription but a memory taunted of its horses?  
A fire-tipped language smothers  
even the infinite  
alphabetic divisions in camera  
to which the metaphor  
will not be woke.  
You are the banana of my explosive arm.  
Draw from it the communist  
signal of its own camera.
