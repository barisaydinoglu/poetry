A Gem Within Copper
-------------------
I could flow scandalmongering, extinction, and acid  
from curtains and smooth stones  
with a ultraviolet light  
with scandalmongerings in my brow. The I in ribbon from her nose and her hips shine  
leaves of the earth.  
A laminated sign -like consequence  
I wish to make a loop  
in, and every hearing, many  
times hidden in a muscle.  
Crimson mud to my blood-stained old warrior's medal!
