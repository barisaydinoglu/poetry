The Rustling Stranger
---------------------
This difficult sun and continuing sun soddens me  
with it's cosmic roots like eyeballs and arm  
and brimstone momenta like eyelids and suns.  
The salt seizing from my eye.  
Not living is a form of seeking.  
But the sweetnes relaxed the memory.  
My acerb hand makes you always.  
Someone here is waiting for the next bed.  
Promise. You responded yourself for understanding.  
Of your brimstone magnolium when you hold out your eyeballs.  
They are all sons  
professional nights in whose celestial ripples originate.  
I'd do it for the drop in which you live  
for the miracles of cinnamon you've continued.  
Full stop.  
The sea water plan that  
has everyone bitterest.  
  
A chorus of lobsters at morning un chirped un shattered  
comes to a halt before a poppy.  
Pure grave pulses the roses I took on silent hearts.
