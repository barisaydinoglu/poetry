The Obscene Sailor Of The Thicket
---------------------------------
The solute dignity of the momentum!  
A chorus of oysters at midnight un entertained un condemned  
comes to a halt before a saxophone.  
The reasons for my respect  
are appreciated  
in my eyeballs of diamond.  
I could chirp pin, rooster, and death  
from homes and kisses  
with a opaque turqoise apple  
with eternities in my brain.
