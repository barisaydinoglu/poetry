What Is True Of The Maternity Is True Of Everything
---------------------------------------------------
Carry me onto your train - the orange of my school -  
there are many bones inside clenched events.  
The trapdoor imposes nessecity.  
Abhor me and let my substance upgrade.  
You expand slowly into a land to stand your business.  
Neither bell nor farm nor brimstone  
nor transluscent green but crimson.  
Brings all the sobs sun rises.  
Agony and propeller - droplets of anger.  
  
Your atom is a goblet filled with wounded splendor.  
As soon as the incoming lemons  
gives the alphabetic indication.  
Always you harass through the day  
toward the sunrise killing starlights.  
Pockets of metal converted into silicon.  
Pure phlegm makes the mosaics conversations of suns, the recitation  
of writings we call steady ribbon.  
Shall we recount?
