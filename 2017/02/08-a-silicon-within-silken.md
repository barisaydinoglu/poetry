A Silicon Within Silken
-----------------------
You see eyeballs as lion hearted as the wind.  
What we say lights to  
rejoice some other giant  
what a phenomenon  
may teach.  
Sorrow and cathedral - umbrellas of panic.  
A bicycle is not enough to die me and keep me  
from the city of your sensible funny things.  
Towards those perfumes of yours that wait for me.  
When you perfume like propeller returned by the earth.  
Shining toward the banner responding a reflection  
swam in the electric sun.
