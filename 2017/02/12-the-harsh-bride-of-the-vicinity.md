The Harsh Bride Of The Vicinity
-------------------------------
One public option and I do not drown in the field of calcerous probe.  
From her breath and her nose grow  
bridges  
of the earth.  
But I should be  
untrue to science, filtering among its tenacious gardens  
so let us try to divulge a story without overtone redundancies.  
Among the wounded heights of disordered landscape.  
  
All umbrellas become masks.  
You relax my sticky corruption  
like a humble bird to fresh plum.
