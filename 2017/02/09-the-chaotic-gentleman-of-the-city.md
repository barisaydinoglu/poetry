The Chaotic Gentleman Of The City
---------------------------------
It is a tale of bitter vaginas and meetings of tremulous foot always you scratch through the holiday  
toward the late afternoon protesting doors. But I should be true to jouranlism, taunting among its hollow defenders  
so let us try to divulge a story without historical redundancies.  
Return to the homeland of the flints.  
What is this computer but a memory imprisoned of its autumns?  
If I could store the corruption and the field.
