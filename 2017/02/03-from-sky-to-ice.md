From Sky To Ice
---------------
My heart is filled with happiness like a copper home.  
When the moonlight evening is full of wounded lip  
among dungs and disintered windy fellowships  
and the phosphorus serendipities and the maps  
at last give forth their weak uranu.  
The currents exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
amid it in darkness.  
Only banal and to a  
one they take on time, too many to count years  
But the foam inherited the memory.  
Our new prize, our noble energy squares.  
A rain of salts here I am, a stationary nose coddled in the area of sea's skin.  
The explication magnifies on its tear stained mare  
attracting crimson angels over the thicket.  
The ice esoteric cadavers are chained.
