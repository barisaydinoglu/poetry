Proof Of Boundless Color
------------------------
Roosters of a bruised helicopter  
inheriting amid the divisions in a lethargic wheel,  
romantic as a violenet squirrel.  
Wave of wave of muscles rolling down the sea.  
Within  
the cashmire nose of the fire.  
There are many clandenstines within spoiled events.  
Towards those propellers of yours  
that wait for me.  
It was the early light of day of the oyster.  
In my field at day you are like a hat  
and your form and colour the way I perform them.  
It was the late afternoon of the lobster.  
If I could pulse the cummerbund and the vicinity.  
How growing is the profound wounded soldier and it's perfect pigeon holes?  
The child smiles at the elder  
but the child does not smile  
when he looks at the oyster lady  
and the browbeaten ocean.  
  
The dashing astronaut  
performs in the iridescent morning.
