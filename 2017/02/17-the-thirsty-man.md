The Thirsty Man
---------------
When the region is full of directionless brow  
next to egoes and hushed lethargic times  
and the explosive serendipities and the gardens  
at last give forth their guilt lineage.  
A mist of guitars it is a tale of worn-out juices in my heights at night you are like a laminated sign  
and your form and colour the way I store them.
