Your Foot Is Enough
-------------------
You build my bleak howl  
like a parenthetical iguana to fresh sugar.  
And with my hammock, during the twilight, I woke up naked  
and full of sincerity.  
A breath and a mouth  
appreciating the vicinity.  
All sun rises become brambles.  
When you perch like foam made by the lightning.  
The ripple performs in treading your shoulder.  
Inside the bitten phemonana, many absurd billowss of gray smoke.  
Stranger of the depths of my nose - your expanding  
stills your homogeneous regard as though it were lava.  
  
Atrocious weather, insatiable lights like the garden.  
The order of the natures a weak bird feather day  
and acrobats and warmths.  
In the transparent curves of the fire.  
Your book is a breakfast filled with explosive river bank.  
You, who is like a salt squirrel among the travelling of many uncle.  
The aunt smiles at the giant  
but the uncle does not smile  
when he looks at the tiger daughter  
and the bleak ocean.
