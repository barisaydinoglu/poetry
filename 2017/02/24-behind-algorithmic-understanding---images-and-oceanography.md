Behind Algorithmic Understanding - Images And Oceanography
----------------------------------------------------------
From pillow of fog to harrowing wind,  
hidden river banks drawn  
by balanced channels, a  
barbaous horse begins to begin.  
In my heights at day you are like a friendship  
and your form and colour the way I perfume them.  
Your crown is a cathedral filled with chaotic light.  
Demonic fishermen and goddesses.  
For me they are historical.  
And meetings of lashed eyelids I saw how breakfasts are relinquished  
by the honest sphere.  
Brings all the wipes warmths.  
When you wake like precision protected by the jungle.
