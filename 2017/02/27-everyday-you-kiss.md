Everyday You Kiss
-----------------
In your foot of deforming the land begins to dream of drinking.  
Breathed and then rescued in the jungle.  
But I should be untrue to photography, shattering among its ironous writings  
so let us attempt to divulge a story devoid of aerial redundancies.  
It is a tale of senile coffins we open the halves of a secrets and the  
chaining of lineages chirps into the monastic city.  
And so that its flasks will freeze your brow.  
A boneless inscription scratches  
even the velvety  
algorithmic room in phenomenon  
to which the metaphor  
will not be blossomed.  
  
Among the heights like steel.  
A boat is not enough to drop me and keep me  
from the land of your moonlit epiphany.  
Wave of wave of fragrances of strawberry rolling down the sea.  
The region next to hers  
a history we speak in passing,  
with notions of happiness  
and a passion for oceanography and mountaineering  
like nails degrading outside shadess of sepia.  
You - the plumed tail.  
An odor has reconciled in the mist,  
a mixture of yeast and body, a perching  
bridge that brings sorrow.  
So the unguessed love lives on in a banana,  
the absent minded house of the bottle,  
the absorbant ribbon that is irreducable and lovely.  
  
For a day, maybe too few to count,  
I rested under a uncomfortable turbulence  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the cousin to be in front of.  
The starlight knows this,  
that life in it's ivory boxes is as endless as the precision.  
A mist of goblets sand-colored and indespensable daughter,
