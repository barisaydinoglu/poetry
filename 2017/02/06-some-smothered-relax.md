Some Smothered Relax
--------------------
A grace focuses its dream of a new ending, its old ending, the ending of the sun rise order -  
its humble receptacles.  
Pockets of metal converted into copper.  
Enjoy the many sterile  
attempts to blossom  
the smooth stain.  
There is cosmic fortune in dawning it.  
The clotting fragrance of strawberry is natural on your curves.  
Full stop.  
In your tail of replacing the night begins to dream of responding.  
A melancholy sea water day  
an antenna lives,  
conquers - it does not return.  
Some flow but I reconcile your aluminum like land.  
Fire-tipped fortnight and the absurd dew  
tremble at the walls of my house.  
And the ribbon to its silicon architecture  
and among the river banks the sweet-smelling one  
the elder covered with spacious fellowship.
