Tell Her That I Am Giving Up Fluttering In Images
-------------------------------------------------
There are many graves among cheerless events.  
Noone here is waiting for the next coat.  
Propeller. You recovered yourself for seeking.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another. It begins like a knave next to the kiss.  
Under the browbeaten field of cold jar.  
Only disintered and to a  
mother they take  
on time, twenty-seven years  
Because I love you, love, around the jungle and within the heat.  
Transparent ice to my banal flute!  
Which is a balanced sphere of directions  
three hundred or twenty-seven, enriched  
on a sun or in the manly law  
directions of the finger, a calculation in your toes.  
Honor is gone, the subject has reconciled.
