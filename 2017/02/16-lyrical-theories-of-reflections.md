Lyrical Theories Of Reflections
-------------------------------
I blossom as if with a pale moldy banana.  
Like throats decaying next to hats.  
In your nose of panic the night of green lakes fly.  
They cracked it with molested salts.  
Your leg wakes from east to east  
draw from it the absurd  
inscription of its own synonym.  
  
In my universe at morning you are like a snow  
and your form and colour the way I attract them.  
A maternity focuses its dream of a beginning, its new beginning, the new ending of the door order -  
its pure vinegars.
