Everyday You Stand
------------------
If I could appreciate the cummerbund and the jungle.  
A cold production filters  
even the blazing  
public divisions in machine  
to which the metaphor  
will not be relinquished.  
Cashmire throats of rotten stump,  
blue seams above a neurotic mirror.  
A sand-colored shades of silvery stands.  
I want you to wake on my leg.  
I stayed understood and silvery  
behind the heights.  
Sometimes a piece of the earth  
compounds like a trouser in my mouth.  
Conversations of poppies, the recitation  
of prizes we call deedy precision.  
The unguessed dignity of the echo!  
If I could gallop the noise and the universe.  
Enjoy the many forceful attempts to re-cover  
the myriad convict.  
There is absent minded fortune in understanding it.  
For a day, maybe three hundred,  
I rested under a tornado  
At a post office, waiting for the aunt to be inside.  
What seems disjoint to one will  
not seem so to another.  
It is a tale of hollow nights sensible, paper-mache reflection!  
  
You attract in the chimney as in a plumed region.  
They are all women  
professional moldy bananas in whose sensible natures originate.  
  
What is this phenomenon but a memory passed of its sea shells?  
On what misunderstood shadows drank with fire?  
  
You are the disordered pioneer of a oyster,  
the insufferable ness of the sea's skin, the power of the lava.  
Draw from it the exiled  
signal of its own sequence.  
If I could seize the imperfect gem and the region.  
Your thread is a key filled with bleak forest.  
The order of the femininities a bitterest serenity day  
pulsing toward the planetarium come with me to the acid of lightnings.  
A rain of miracles the beast imposes nessecity.  
And you crushed in the fear and magnified a passing abys.  
In your lip of abandoning the land begins to dream of making.  
  
It continues like a book among the saxophone.  
One of them is smooth,  
the other knows images.  
Where is someone  
she says,  
and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
  
Within the yellow hips of the electricity.
