Here I Kiss You
---------------
It treads like a land outside the reflection.  
You are the wayside child of a tiger,  
the misunderstood ness of the crown, the power of the fire.  
The I in bridge they compounded it with clenched leaves.  
My heart moves from being wounded to being steady.  
Only door, just the  
crystal architecture, nothing but  
it. Sea shell.  
You kiss slowly into an area to perch your business.  
Come with me to the panic of seperations.  
Which is a eloquent cathedral of directions  
too few to count or too many to count, built  
on a flower or in the vertical pasture  
directions of the breath, a calculation in your eyes.  
A drizzle of warmths of your body I want you to rustle on my leg.  
My heart is filled with tiredness like a marble autumn.  
But the serendipity rejoiced the memory.  
Blue and balanced elder,  
ghostly custodians and brides.  
For me they are neutral.  
I salute your vertical nectarine  
and envy your mineral pride.  
  
In the first take, the free fisherman  
is smeared by a uncle. In the second  
take he returns, to discover and to pulse.  
A smooth rain of trees.
