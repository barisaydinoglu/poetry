Song For The Stranger Of Wet-winged Flints
------------------------------------------
What abhors the props of decency? Around the boulevard I like to refresh like a cold evening star.  
A blood colored and torrential kis is imprisoned in the universe.  
Outside the utensil of the land where you sleep,  
a dream degrades into  
details.  
Come with me to the conglomerate of puberties.  
What disguises the props of sincerity?  
A sunburst orange path hears.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
gallop of apples and silences  
and the noble poppies of his native land?  
But I should be true to engineering, drowning among its fractious circuss  
so let us begin to tell a story without grammatic redundancies.  
And meetings of wounded eyeballs always you strike through  
the day  
toward the holiday coagulating stones.
