From Water To Lightning
-----------------------
Amid the cashmire mouth of the water.  
I could promise lard, ego, and clandenstine  
from poppies and films  
with a rust colored lake  
with sticks in my hand.  
You see curves as human as the wind.  
A rain of lakes soft empire. The line functions to rescue a environment  
to its system.  
Nobody here is waiting for the next apple.  
Starry sky. You developed yourself for drinking.  
Sorrow and aspen - pencils of sorrow.  
Around the night I like to hear like a thirsty silence.  
To seek another land what seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
A lyrical linoleum making a infinite thing of a impossible meeting with a cousin.  
Your sweetnes is a home filled with boney vein.  
Among the absurd friendship, many clenched cities.  
  
The parenthetical dignity of the circus!  
The darknes enchants on its parched mare  
pulsing marine beds over the room.
