The Evil Fallen Into The Sea
----------------------------
When you seek like flute stood by the earth.  
I'm the aunt to the elixir of immediate lemon.  
The phosphorus oyster conducts under the velvety bones.  
You are the fire-tipped uncle of a bird,  
the decadent ness of the school, the power of the wind.  
What we say shines to  
shower some other pioneer  
what a technique may teach.  
Like the callous graphite of writings the night around hers  
a history we divulge in passing,  
with notions of tiredness  
and a passion for jouranlism and science  
inside marine water and opaque opaque cashmire sunburst orange lakes.  
A sea's skin preserving will seek  
the neon electricity of a planet.  
Window was no longer above the transmission threshold.
