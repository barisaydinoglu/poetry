Setting The Friendship In Motion
--------------------------------
In sand-colored water and sepia bird feathers.  
Inside the leaf of the university where you sleep,  
a dream penetrates into  
identities.  
Full stop.  
A defender focuses its dream of a new beginning, its new ending, the ending of the key order -  
its natural howls.  
The dominion rescues on its raucous mare  
conducting opaque yellow utensils over the night.  
Indicates the laminated sign's living heart.
