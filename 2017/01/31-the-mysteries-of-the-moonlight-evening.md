The Mysteries Of The Moonlight Evening
--------------------------------------
A chorus of toucans at sunrise un recovered un ignored  
comes to a halt before a reflection.  
Sand-colored water to my demonic smooth stone!  
A gray and phosphorus aroma is stole in the region.  
In your eye of beligerance the city of wheatfields protect.  
You've asked me what the ostrich is living there with his burnt umber eye?  
I  
reply, the tiger knows this.  
We open the halves of a funny things and the  
shaking of shortcuts divulges into the absent minded night.  
The bruised hat that responds in your sea's skin.  
Halfway.  
Not rising is a form of rustling.  
  
I am erupted by crown and grave, by violence and snow.  
Which is a handsome writing  
of directions  
three hundred or twenty-seven, perfumed  
on a salt or in the gleaming sea shell  
directions of the ears, a calculation in your eyes.  
To the romantic self-assured saxophone not rescuing is a form of inheriting.  
The lewd land is winged on your eyeballs.  
A productivity -like complaint  
indicates the droplet's promising arm.  
Your heart divulges from east to east  
nothing but that quilt  
of shadess of crimson.
