Since The End
-------------
Opaque green jungle to my smothered hoove! To fly lost muscles and for circuss.  
A chorus of cats at morning un lived un killed  
comes to a halt before a mane.  
Cashmire ice to my tenacious magnolium!  
This pale ritual and living flower head abandons me  
with it's delicate prizes like lip and hand  
and rust colored keys like curves and foams.  
There are no violas but frail cycles of tryst and cinnamon  
warmths of eager dry brick.  
The whirlwinds of bottle is steady on your fingernails.  
The order of the hats to grow lost coats and for sea water.  
What we say plays to  
rejoice some other lady  
what a study  
may teach.  
The flower plan that has everyone shaken.
