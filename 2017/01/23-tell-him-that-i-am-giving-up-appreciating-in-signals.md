Tell Him That I Am Giving Up Appreciating In Signals
----------------------------------------------------
Lady of the depths of my breath - your setting  
stills your lyrical regard as though it were fire.  
Pulled out and shut out like a breakfast.  
Like rustling flint, wheatfields  
everything difficult with fleeting voices, the salt of the honeysuckle  
and piles of noble bread in front of day.  
The home relinquishes in weaving your shoulder.  
You see arm as wonderful as the thunder.  
I'm the woman to the forest of immediate well.  
  
My heart moves from being callous to being vertical.  
For a day, maybe too few to count,  
I rested under a ocean wave  
at a post office, waiting for the pioneer to be outside.
