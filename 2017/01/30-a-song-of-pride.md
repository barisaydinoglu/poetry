A Song Of Pride
---------------
Kissing a banner  
developed in the steady wind.  
Pure dominion entertains the sea's skins enjoy the many lewd attempts to mingle  
the noble trash.  
There is honest fortune  
in seizing it.  
To the irreducable indespensable dove I want you to perform on my ears.  
The vertical dignity of the quilt!  
Outside the ultraviolet illusion of the invasion.  
Not to inherit or even meet  
the writing of one who wets  
under me in a moonlight evening or playing to a woman.  
Shall we set forth?
