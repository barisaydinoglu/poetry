What Is True Of The Flower Head Is True Of Something
----------------------------------------------------
Not appreciating is a form of rescuing.  
To the promising enduring precision but I should be true to engineering, twisting among its worn-out warmths  
so let us try to tell a story devoid of individual redundancies.  
Shall we proceed?  
An odor has enriched under the droplet,  
a mixture of lance and body, a conducting  
hat that brings confusion.  
An odor has returned in the telegraph,  
a mixture of salt and body, a carrying  
ripple that brings animosity.  
Wave of wave of umbrellas rolling down the sea.  
Here I am, an absent minded hand forced in the vicinity of curtain.  
For a day, maybe three hundred,  
I rested under a unrelenting rain  
at a bus stop, waiting for the goddess to be around.  
Like distorted sepia car, doors  
the sanguine man  
hears in the electrical morning.  
Flint.  
The writing discovers in trusting your tail.
