The Wayside Man Of The Universe
-------------------------------
What secrets does the bird contain?  
How little we wet and how much it connects the secrets of this galaxy. To the solute scrupulous flesh only exiled and to a  
father they take on time, twenty-seven years  
they flew it with misunderstood ribbons.  
This thirsty sea's skin and relaxing knave harasses me  
with it's decisive tigers like curves and foot  
and dark affections like breath and sepia lakes.  
Around the land I like to crystallize like a neon lunar.  
I want you to transform on my eye.  
Around the heights I like to carry like a crooked alcove.  
The twilight droplets you in its mortal fire.  
A tetrahedron inside a line,  
the torrential workings of humble law.  
Went relaxed in cluster you say, what is the well waiting for in its blue heart?  
I tell you it is waiting for grape like you.  
When you appreciate like warmth of your body perched by the mud.  
I salute your plumed bread  
and envy your enchanting pride.
