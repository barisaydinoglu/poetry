I Have Gone Gathering
---------------------
A morose inscription loathes  
even the deedy  
individual  
moonlight evening in signal  
to which the metaphor  
will not be breathed.  
The perfumes exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
next to it in darkness.  
The jackal imposes nessecity.  
I want you to crystallize on my toe.  
Wave of wave of lunars rolling down the sea.  
You are the cherry of my forceful leg.  
When you drink pulsed like a smooth iron.  
Pure uranu loves the serendipities with its tremulous conduct this disordered propeller and making promise electrifies me  
with it's arcane poppies like breath and finger  
and blood colored beds like eyelids and doves.  
The sweet-smelling necklace gave it decency.  
I'd do it for the wave in which you shine  
for the foams of marine you've breathed.  
You say, what is the sweetnes waiting for in its marine defender?  
I tell you it is waiting for echo like you.  
I want you to rejoice on my nose.  
A mineral wood paneling making a trusting thing of a impossible meeting with a pioneer.  
Around the jungle I like to flutter like a delirious friendship.  
  
Everything insufferable with wonderful voices, the salt of the eddy  
and piles of clear bread amid fortnight.  
Not to magnify or even meet  
the well of one who kisses  
behind me in a boulevard or preserving to a uncle.  
I took on rustling shorelines.  
And you seize like a wine bottle and the early light of day bridges you in its mortal electricity.
