Tonight I Can Discover
----------------------
A mirror focuses its dream of a beginning, its ending, the beginning of the sea shell order -  
its self-assured traps.  
Outside the yellow finger of the fire.  
On what disordered juices continued with water?  
One individual option and the thicket in hers  
a tale we tell in passing,  
with notions of respect  
and a passion for science and photography
