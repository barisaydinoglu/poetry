Here I Tread You
----------------
A fire-tipped laminated sign day  
of your rust colored warmth when you hold out your foot. Somebody here is waiting for the next muscle.  
Silence. You responded yourself for shining.  
I could love heart, dust, and martyr  
from forms and bird feathers  
with a dull shades of yellow window  
with abberations in my eyeballs.  
  
A chorus of squirrels at fortnight un flowed un undulated  
comes to a halt before a eddy.  
My blazing nose treads you always.  
Pockets of rusted nail converted into chalk.  
The wind absent minded wounds are replaced.  
Burnt umber utensils of seperation,  
opaque opaque sand-colored seams above a imperalist flint.  
Of your dark candle when you hold out your foot.  
  
Nothing but that old warrior's medal of rivers.  
My heart moves from being careless to being hidden.
