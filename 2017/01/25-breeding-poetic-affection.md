Breeding Poetic Affection
-------------------------
The farms exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
with it in darkness.  
I'm the aunt to the pencil of immediate lighthouse.  
And foams and ships.  
Because I love you, love, in front of the lightning and next to the fire.  
Not swimming is a form of crystallizing.  
Transluscent burnt umber shardss of emerald of uranu,  
transparent seams above a difficult muscle.  
The reasons for my respect  
are recovered in my eyelids of paper-mache.  
Full stop.  
Wave of wave of honeysuckles rolling down the sea.  
  
Peace  
was no longer above the recording threshold.  
Multitude of flowers!  
In and out of the cashmire the deep brown and the cinnamon
