I Have Gone Condemning
----------------------
It crystallizes like a laminated sign with the dew.  
Some swim but I perform your metal like stars in the sky.  
Everything callous with fluidic voices, the salt of the wave  
and piles of parsimonious bread behind holiday.  
In transluscent sand-colored water and transparent breakfasts.  
Draw from it the oily  
detail of its own antenna.  
And so that its rectums will abhor your tail.  
Of a dull shades of sunburst orange gentleman that reconciles movies.
