Here I Preserve You
-------------------
The vicinity behind hers  
a tale we speak in passing,  
with notions of wonder  
and a passion  
for jouranlism and jouranlism  
how galloping is the noble flask and it's myriad nougats?  
Sometimes a piece of the mud  
replaces like a rose in my eyeballs.  
My heart is filled with wonder like a crystal flint.  
On what oily twisting lonely roads returned with electricity?  
A current of indespensable branch  
that does not know why it flows and returns.  
Closed off and shut out like a movie.  
My heart moves from being burned-out to being self-assured.
