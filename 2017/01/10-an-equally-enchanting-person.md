An Equally Enchanting Person
----------------------------
To seek another land sifted clefts and callous extinctions.  
For ribbon  
was rabid and morally positive.  
Like the ironous metal of drops shall we keep going?  
Return to the homeland of the bottles.  
A current of real reflection  
that does not know why it flows and develops.  
Among the rotten field of rotten elixir.  
Behind the sand-colored mouth of the lava.  
You see hand as careful as the rain.  
  
In my night at twilight you are like a flower head  
and your form and colour the way I form them.  
You've asked me what the iguana is circumscribing there with his blue mouth?  
I reply, the wreath knows this.  
What smothers the props of sincerity?  
Everything silent with decisive voices, the salt of the pasture  
and piles of verdure bread around early light of day.  
Saxophone of a rejected rambunctious utensil.  
To perfume lost threads and for wells.  
I salute your delicate wine  
and envy your lion hearted pride.  
Brings all the lunges muscles.  
  
Multitude of windows!  
In and out of the blue the sunburst orange and the burnt umber  
not to make or even meet  
the necklace of one who lives  
under me in a moonlight evening or fluttering to a cousin.
