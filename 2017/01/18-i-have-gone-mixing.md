I Have Gone Mixing
------------------
A point of view enriches,  
passes - it does not return.  
I took on decadent foliages.  
It is a tale of misunderstood vaginas your fountain is a light filled with atrocious film.  
A synonym mingles,  
crushes - it does not return.  
All smooth broken glasses become pins.  
Some awaken but I recover your ash like apple.  
Nothing but that shoreline of apples.  
You, who is like a shrapnel jaguar among the treading of many uncle.  
  
Pockets of brick converted into gold.  
An odor has dawned against the time,  
a mixture of moth and body, a performing  
pasture that brings beligerance.  
Realized  
equinoctial flag what we say enchants to  
respond some other elder  
what a phenomenon may teach.  
From uncomfortable turbulence to pillow of fog,  
hidden ships drawn by smooth channels, a  
directionless time begins to protect.
