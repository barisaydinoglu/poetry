Proof Of Honest Feeling
-----------------------
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the great graces?  
And the drizzle eloquent splattering its warmths and coddling them full of  
field and turkey?  
You - the naked lip.  
The springtime drops, the phemonana of thick  
crystallizes outside.  
A production for antenna is the lack thereof.  
And you build like an aspen and fewer and fewer  
tremble about another mode of purity.  
The muzzled ribbon is plumed on your hand.  
From her ears and her breath relinquish  
wine bottles of the earth.  
They are all astronauts  
professional bloody feathers in whose moonlit river banks originate.  
And a wet-winged map's lightning will  
rustle you.  
And warmths and spheres.  
I could attract explication, mask, and imbroglio  
from rivers and flower heads  
with a red utensil  
with billows of ultraviolet smoke in my shoulder.
