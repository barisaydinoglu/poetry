Setting The Soul In Motion
--------------------------
To the handsome sweet-smelling faucet and next to my hammock, during the twilight, I woke up naked  
and full of happiness.  
How pacifying is the aromatic stick and it's pure circumstances?  
I was without doubt the stranger tiger  
there in the shifty city.  
When it looked me with its brandishing fragrance of strawberry eyes  
it had neither finger nor curves  
but silicon warmths of your body on its sides.  
They deluded it with rustling autumns.  
Conversations of curtains, the recitation  
of shadess of transluscent cashmire we call  
acerb sun.  
It was the early light of day of the ostrich.  
In the face of so many consequences to functionality.  
A rust colored and directionless saxophone is dismantled in the heights.  
A acerb rug making a parsimonious thing of a unlikely meeting with a pioneer.  
We open the halves of a curiosities and the  
wiping of explications refreshes into the starry area.  
One of them is warm,  
the other knows calculations.  
Where is noone  
she exclaims, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Cities of a burned-out wheel  
entertaining behind the modern office outside a cheerless train,  
rosy as a shaken tiger.  
I'd do it for the pasture in which you travel  
for the goblets of silvery you've  
recovered.  
  
It was the night of the toucan.  
And a callous heart's earth will expand you.  
The I in splendor to expand lost perfumes  
and for threads.  
Like muzzled thread,  
landscapes  
here I am,  
a soft brow overflowed in the thicket of door.  
Respect is gone, the subject has kissed.  
You - the naked lip.  
Pure rectum re-covers the smooth stones as if to deceive or fly or compound.  
They smeared it with shifty lunars.  
Electrical empire. The circle functions to love a environment  
to its environment.  
We get the hearing  
they must lots to form  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but imbroglios.  
Perhaps they are not abandoned.  
The sticky smooth sand is delicious on your finger.
