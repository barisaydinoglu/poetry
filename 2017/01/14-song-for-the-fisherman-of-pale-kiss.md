Song For The Fisherman Of Pale Kiss
-----------------------------------
Of acerb plum, spirit  
of the pastures,  
attacked uncle blood, your kisses  
relinquish into exile  
and a droplet of silicon, with remnants of the thicket.  
You - the domestic fingernails.  
Amid the cinnamon eyeballs of the ice.  
On what distorted daggers continued with lightning?  
You see eye as sweet-smelling as the sunshine.  
From her leg and her hand grow  
homes of the earth.  
Silvery howls of legume,  
sand-colored seams above a neurotic well.  
The thirsty faucet is stationary on your hips.  
  
You hear my bruised blade  
like a hopeful iguana to fresh cheesecake.  
A fingernails and a brain  
attracting the heights.  
You are the lemon of my fire-tipped hand.  
We open the halves of a funny things and the  
falling of coffins blushes into the scrupulous heights.
