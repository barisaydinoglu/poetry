A Fruit
-------
In the face of so many wounded soldiers to positivity.  
Amid the fainting vigils.  
Wave of wave of salts rolling down the sea.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the serene atoms?  
And the mist clear splattering its roots and compounding them full of  
moonlight evening and elephant?  
  
And so that its daggers will sob your hand.  
I could rescue wall,  
city, and complaint  
from starss in the sky and reflections  
with a opaque opaque rust colored salt  
with sticks in my eyeballs.
