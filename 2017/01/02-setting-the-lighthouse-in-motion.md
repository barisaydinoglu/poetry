Setting The Lighthouse In Motion
--------------------------------
With its wet-winged create like errors soddening amid lighthouses.  
A clenched language ignores  
even the balanced  
public region in inscription  
to which the metaphor  
will not be connected.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
But I should be untrue to mountaineering, foreboding among its muzzled roots  
so let us try to speak a story devoid of alphabetic redundancies.
