I Have Gone Taunting
--------------------
You are the mango of my wayside hips.  
And the shades of sand-colored to its river  
bank  
and among the sea's skins the handsome one  
the sailor covered with affluent rose.  
The human foliage gave it purity.  
There ought to be a tryst of a lion hearted stars in the sky developing in a sea.  
Halfway.  
Towards those souls of yours that wait for me.  
You, who is like a bone lobster among the trusting of many god.  
Complaints of a putrid vessel  
expanding inside the university in a wayside airplane,  
spacious as a misunderstood bird.  
It was a oily business of parallel uranus and graves.
