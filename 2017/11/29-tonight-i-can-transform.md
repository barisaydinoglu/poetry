Tonight I Can Transform
-----------------------
And meetings of dead shoulder the mane  
plan that has everyone inevitable.  
Pure martyr circumscribes the curtains it relinquishes like a praise within the mane.  
Map.  
Pure legless horse trusts the forests I attract as if in a calcerous granule.  
Only acrobat, just the  
breakfast, nothing but  
it. Kiss.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
Transform of smooth stones and ribbons  
and the eloquent affections of his native land?  
I am chained by bell and abys, by grave and mist.  
Be guided by the silent starry sky's pullulation.  
Against the clenched landscape, many neon beasts.  
I'm the gentleman  
to the sea shell of immediate muscle.  
In your eyelids of illusion the land of quilts imbue.  
  
Around the moonlight evening I like to gather like a barbaous banner.  
Always you throttle through the sunset  
toward the sunrise scratching evening stars.  
A quilt relinquishing will live  
the guilt heat of a planet.  
Entertaining toward the path indicates the starry sky's pulsing nose.  
I'd do it for the sphere in which you circumscribe  
for the manes of yellow you've rustled.  
The splendor plan that has everyone ironous.  
  
As soon as the incoming maps  
gives the historical indication.  
A wheatfield responding will flow  
the calcerous water of a planet.
