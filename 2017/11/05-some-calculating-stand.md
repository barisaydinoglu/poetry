Some Calculating Stand
----------------------
As if to change or protect or freeze.  
If I could live the croak and the divisions.  
It was the sunset of the elephant.  
My heart moves from being decadent to being fluidic.  
It was the sunrise of the pheasant.  
The electricity profound billows of rust colored smoke are executed.  
A fragrance of strawberry -like blood  
a current of hopeful telegraph  
that does not know why it flows and rescues.  
It was a dilute business of clock and violas.  
  
Reflected and then dawned in the sea.  
I wish to make a square  
among, and every faith, many  
times hidden in a bell.
