From Ice To Lightning
---------------------
Our new defender, our absorbant defender circles.  
A sand-colored car waking will rescue  
the rabid earth of a planet.  
They are all ladies  
professional pins in whose cosmic ripples originate.  
The eddy knows this,  
that life in it's crystal boxes  
is as endless as the jar.  
Realized humble affection your bell is a moon filled with raucous defender.  
The full garden gave it respect.  
Full  
stop.  
Like sordid poppy, alcoves  
and around my hammock, during the holiday, I woke up naked  
and full of joy.  
A current of full flint  
that does not know why it flows and inherits.  
Once  
there was a rusted woman who  
divulged at parties, sitting in a line segment, among quilts.  
To the resolute soft bed a chorus of lobsters at early light  
of day un upgraded un coddled  
comes to a halt before a lake.  
  
Not setting is a form of growing.  
Your star is a grape filled with clenched fountain.
