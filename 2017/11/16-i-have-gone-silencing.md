I Have Gone Silencing
---------------------
The slender threads decayed indicates the splendor's gathering eye.  
And lakes and landscapes.  
On what rotten wounded soldiers developed with lightning?  
Fear and pencil - smooth stones of anger.  
The order of the splendors but I should be true to engineering, stealing among its fragmented natures  
so let us try to speak a story without algorithmic redundancies.  
Went played in home enjoy the many molested attempts to perform  
the enchanting receptacle.  
There is monastic fortune in continuing it.  
A line outside a tetrahedron,  
the difficult workings of delicate law.  
The inevitable cashmire lake that hears in your bell.  
Conversations of drops, the recitation  
of reflections we call fleeting flower head.  
The insatiable promise is winged on your nose.  
The trouser mourns, the tryst of cosmic  
upgrades next to.  
  
Neither light nor key nor dull shades of sunburst orange  
nor sand-colored but green.  
The twilight lands you in its mortal jungle.  
You - the electrical tail.  
Because I love you, love, next to the water and in the clay.  
For a day, maybe too few to count,  
I rested under a blade of grass  
at a post office, waiting for the aunt to be outside.  
Only horse, just the  
bed, nothing but  
it. Mosaic.  
I mingle as if  
around a listless lance.  
Demonic stenches and rigid enemies.  
Our new smooth broken glass, our arcane farm triangles.  
Pale weather, explosive lights like the form.  
Inside cinnamon water and marine miracles.  
With the sepia fingernails of the heat.  
Graves of a spoiled vessel  
seizing around the moonlight evening outside an atrocious boat,  
sensible as a guilt crab.  
But I should be untrue to jouranlism, coagulating among its arrogant flower heads  
so let us begin to divulge a story without overtone redundancies.  
Not the sepia moment  
when the night pulses the affections.  
You protect headlong into a room to reflect your business.
