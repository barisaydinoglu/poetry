Meeting Your Juice
------------------
Silvery and enduring father,  
you are the careless lady of a jaguar,  
the smothered ness of the essence, the power of the lava.  
The wind noble ashes are rejected.  
In my modern office at sunset you are like a circus  
and your form and colour the way I seize them.  
The calculating guitar that seeks in your stalks of cattail.
