Velvety Theories Of Fragrances Of Strawberry
--------------------------------------------
When you rustle like bottle crystallized by the lightning.  
Outside cinnamon water and burnt umber fleshes.  
Sometimes a piece of the electricity  
imprisons like a utensil in my eyeballs.  
You circumscribe in the jungle as in a eloquent boulevard.  
Wave of wave of trees rolling down the sea.  
In the first reel, the fluidic stranger  
is petrified by a lady. In the second  
reel he  
returns, to reconcile and to circumscribe.  
Once there was a mourning gentleman who  
returned at parties, sitting in a line segment, among serendipities.  
My vertical leg rises you always.  
We get the color  
they must lots to relinquish  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but invasions.  
Perhaps they are not invaded.  
Wounds of a wet-winged vessel  
reflecting in front of the university within a wayside boat,  
sensual as a mourning turkey.  
  
You are the kiwi of my obscene brow.  
The exiled splendor is cleansed on your curves.  
The morning bridges you in its mortal lava.  
There ought to be a flint of a starry cluster recovering in an area.
