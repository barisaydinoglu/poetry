Secure Theories Of Books
------------------------
Cleansed empire. The line functions to dawn a system  
to its architecture.  
In the neurotic sea of shifty snow.  
A sunburst orange coral stands.  
You say, what is the poppy waiting for in its deep brown door?  
I tell you it is waiting for foliage like you.  
The reasons for my respect  
are refreshed in my brain of silken.  
Time was no longer right at the transmission threshold.  
As if to bristle or reflect or shatter.  
In the middle of the sticky starry sky, many clotting bloods.  
Chirp on the seperations that wait for you  
deforming the chaotic chairs, abducting the doors.  
  
And the jar to its tiger  
and among the veins the balanced one  
the one covered with solute ribbon.  
As soon as the incoming angels  
gives the public indication.
