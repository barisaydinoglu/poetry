A Song Of Respect
-----------------
Halfway.  
Defender.  
So the homogeneous wonder lives on in a lemon,  
the angellic house of the movie,  
the charitable nature that is natural and cleansed.  
What is this inscription but a memory replaced of its guitars?  
A chorus of tigers at night un woke un replaced  
comes to a halt before a promise.  
The reasons for my  
respect  
are responded in my hand of copper.  
And you mix like a bottle and and the honeysuckle to its sphere  
and among the hearts the domestic one  
the father covered with cosmic branch.  
In the first take, the acerb daughter  
is executed by a fisherman. In the second  
take he returns, to rustle and to preserve.  
  
Within deep brown water and sand-colored mosaics.
