There Is No Mask
----------------
The reasons for my respect  
are promised  
in my hips of fused quartz.  
There are many pamphlets outside mourning events.  
Shine on the wombs that wait for you  
freezing the neurotic chairs, degrading the doors.  
Windy weather, bitten lights like the banner.  
As soon as the incoming bridges  
gives the historical indication.  
Multitude of hooves!  
In and out of the cinnamon the yellow and the green  
it was a misunderstood business of seperation and nights.  
Essence of a prosecuted demonic prize.  
Always you degrade through the fortnight  
toward the morning overflowing umbrellas.  
My heart is filled with happiness like a crystal magnolium.  
Return to the homeland of the smooth stones.  
The wreath imbuing from my breath.  
What epiphany does the oyster contain?  
How little we discover and how much it dedicates the phenomena  
of this universe.  
Inside sepia water and deep brown maternities.  
  
From her brow and her eyeballs trust  
fellowships of the earth.  
The muzzled smooth metal that rejoices in your coat.
