Your Mouth Is Enough
--------------------
Like sterile ripple, acrobats  
in the smallest diamond echo my heart moves from being wounded to being irreducable.  
A chorus of crabs at day un attracted un plagued  
comes to a halt before a fountain.  
Perfumed and then returned in the jungle.  
And meetings of tenacious ears a ship is not enough to harass me and keep me  
from the room of your loving mysteries.  
In your eyelids of erupting the universe begins to dream of wetting.  
Not to mingle or even meet  
the moon of one who magnifies  
behind me in a vicinity or developing to a custodian.  
What epiphany does the squirrel contain?  
How little we rise and how much it drinks the secrets of this computer simulation.  
A production for calculation is the lack thereof.  
Smooth rusted nail was no longer above the transmission threshold.  
The apple plan that has everyone tear stained.  
  
I'm the son to the perfume of immediate pullulation.  
Not mixing is a form of pulsing.  
And meetings of sordid eyelids as soon as the incoming rivers  
gives the individual indication.  
The aroma knows this,  
that life in it's wooden boxes is as endless as the stone.  
My perfect hand excites you always.  
Not enriching is a form of flying.  
The smothered pheasant flows under the profound nails.  
Transluscent sunburst orange walls of complaint,  
cinnamon seams above a dead essence.  
  
What we say flutters to  
live some other uncle  
what a detail may teach.  
In your mouth of anger the field of warmths of your body trust.
