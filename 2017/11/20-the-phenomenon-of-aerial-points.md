The Phenomenon Of Aerial Points
-------------------------------
Of changeless grape, spirit  
of the kisses,  
condemned lady blood, your kisses  
enrich into exile  
and a droplet of copper, with remnants of the heights.  
And the awe to its smooth clay  
and among the branches the stationary one  
the uncle covered with promising sea water.  
In my university at morning you are like a movie  
and your form and colour the way I set them.  
Not the silvery moment  
when the holiday preserves the muscles.  
The shaken springtime that discovers in your goblet.  
When the chimney is full of rotten brow  
outside legless horses and pale boney maternities  
and the disordered banners and the currents  
at last give forth their wounded dagger.  
The coral swimming from my fingernails.  
A loaf of bread baked with troubled respect and salt.  
You perform slowly into a modern office to form your business.  
  
As soon as the incoming planetariums  
gives the algorithmic indication.  
And you relinquish like a hat and the stars in the sky continues in appreciating your hand.
