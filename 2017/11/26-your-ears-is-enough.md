Your Ears Is Enough
-------------------
Because I love you, love, outside the sky and amid the sky.  
The wide pioneer  
upgrades in the stationary morning.  
What is this image but a memory soddened of its sun rises?  
From ray of sunlight to harrowing wind,  
hidden spheres drawn by stationary channels, a  
explosive shades of sunburst orange begins to conduct.  
Where clusters meet  
sweetness meet, behind and in and the sound  
of bombs, to reach  
out and rescue in panic.  
It performs like a film outside the salt.  
  
Halfway.
