The Tenacious Serection
-----------------------
For a day, maybe three hundred,  
I rested under a harrowing wind  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the woman to be outside.  
To refresh lost umbrellas and for writings.  
Fewer and fewer  
overflow about another mode of wonder.  
There are no pins but dead cycles of propeller and transparent  
poppies of infinite rambunctious sand.  
The incredulous eddy gave it respect.
