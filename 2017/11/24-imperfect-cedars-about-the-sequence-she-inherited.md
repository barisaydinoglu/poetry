Imperfect Cedars About The Sequence She Inherited
-------------------------------------------------
I could shine imbroglio, massacre, and blade  
from wheatfields and fragrances of strawberry  
with a brimstone cluster  
with howls in my curves.  
Fewer and fewer  
decay about another mode of tiredness.  
The I in laminated sign for a day, maybe too many to count,  
I rested under a unrelenting rain  
at a post office, waiting for the pioneer to be outside.  
Playing a ripple  
awakened in the poetic snow.  
Which is a moonlit stars in  
the sky of directions  
thousand or too many to count, inherited  
on a bell or in the delicate stalks of cattail  
directions of the fingernails, a calculation in your feet.  
Our new railroad track, our honest springtime tetrahedrons.
