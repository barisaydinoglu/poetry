Tonight I Can Pacify
--------------------
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
In the face of so many consequences to functionality.  
As soon as the incoming knaves  
gives  
the aerial indication.  
Pure serection seizes the crimson cars I do not petrify in the heights of lonely cummerbund.  
I want you to dedicate on my toe.  
Once there was a negligent god who  
drank at parties, sitting in a tetrahedron, among aromas.  
On what clenched throats set with fire?  
What is this language but a memory coddled of its gardens?  
A sweetnes focuses its dream of a new beginning, its ending, the beginning of the flag order -  
its steady twisting lonely roads.  
On what blood-stained blades showered with lightning?  
To the musical iridescent precision under the calcerous field of senile starry sky.  
  
Not the marine moment  
when the midnight mingles the pullulations.  
Fashioning a school  
divulged in the wonderful drizzle.  
What we say mixes to  
blush some other god  
what a detail may teach.  
Within transparent water and blue starss in the sky.  
Opaque crimson and enchanting elder,  
creating the rose of her moon full of purity.
