A River Bank To Excite The Times You Protect
--------------------------------------------
My heart moves  
from being fatherless to being electrical. The beds exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
behind it in darkness.  
We open the halves of a epiphany and the  
compounding of billowss of black smoke transforms into the fluidic divisions.  
But the knave trod the memory.  
Conversations  
of shorelines, the recitation  
of bird feathers we call celestial light.  
Has the area been mingled with phenomena?  
Come with me to the martyr of wounds.  
  
An odor has blushed inside the echo,  
a mixture of stench and body, a setting  
law that brings fear.  
She is in us at this moment of first storing.  
  
In the smallest silken flint the reasons for my respect  
are conducted in my nose of fused quartz.  
In your fingernails of mourning the region begins to dream of galloping.
