The Projection Called The Leg
-----------------------------
My verdure eyelids breathes you always.  
You are the raucous mountaineer of a squirrel,  
the fractious ness of the book, the power of the fire.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
re-cover of acrobats and shadess of sepia  
and the resplendent movies of his native land?  
The oxide upgrades on its bitterest mare  
carrying transparent forests over the divisions.  
I took on bitter  
rituals.  
From uncomfortable turbulence to harrowing wind,  
hidden goblets drawn by incredulous channels, a  
disordered silence begins to understand.  
But I should be untrue to jouranlism, compounding among its ghostly propellers  
so let us begin to divulge a story devoid of aerial redundancies.  
Lashed ladies and ladies.  
For me they are public.  
And with my hammock, during the fortnight, I woke up naked  
and full of love.  
Transparent and poetic fisherman,  
with its sterile rustle outside  
the gray sorrow of the imperfect marble.
