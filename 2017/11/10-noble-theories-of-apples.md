Noble Theories Of Apples
------------------------
You preserve in the archipeligos as in a deedy boulevard. There are many panics around bitten events.  
A troubled smooth stone day  
Seek on the complaints that wait for you  
flying the absurd chairs, congealing the doors.  
I could rise legless horse, darknes, and corpse  
from kisses and wheatfields  
with a blood colored acrobat  
with self-productions in my eyeballs.  
When you trust like awe rescued by the earth.  
  
Because I love you, love, among the ice and amid the wind.
