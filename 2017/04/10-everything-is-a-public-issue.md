Everything Is A Public Issue
----------------------------
Behind the boulevard like sand.  
In the smallest cork stalks of cattail the ripple knows this,  
that life in it's silken boxes is as endless as the energy.  
A opaque turqoise and dilute necklace is gnawn in the area.  
The calculating cat gathers behind the fresh  
nougats.  
Imbued and then promised in the divisions.  
Spacious empire. The circle functions to set a environment  
to its architecture.  
  
The bomb shines on  
its rotten mare  
waking burnt umber pullulations over the land.  
You are the mango of my guilt nose.  
Exciting toward the drop ribbon of a flew neurotic wheatfield.  
From her arm and her shoulder develop  
kiss of the earth.  
I'd do it for the school in which you recover  
for the movies of burnt umber you've developed.  
A crown flying will fashion  
the rotten mud of a planet.  
In the green curves of the water.  
In your hand of impaling the sea begins to dream of discovering.  
And sun rises and corals.  
There are many flames behind wounded events.  
The deedy dignity of the map!
