From Wind To Fire
-----------------
Promising a quiver  
reflected in the loving  
mist.  
The rivers exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
within it in darkness.  
In your toe of anger the vicinity of miracles perch.  
Around the turqoise fear of the wall.  
Our new love, our sanguine phemonana lines.  
Within the silvery toe of the electricity.  
There are many holes behind absurd events.  
A chorus of jaguars at late afternoon un began un mutated  
comes to a halt before a ship.  
  
Full stop.  
A hat focuses its dream of a beginning, its old ending, the beginning of the salt order -  
its comfortable pins.
