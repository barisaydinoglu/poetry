Since The End Of Flying
-----------------------
Has the sea been began with secrets?  
You say, what is the sun waiting for in its sand-colored flower?  
I tell you it is waiting for kis like you.  
Some understand but I dedicate your iron like mirror.  
And next to my hammock, during the twilight, I woke up naked  
and full of purity.  
  
Neither burnt umber lake nor saxophone nor blood colored  
nor burnt umber but sunburst orange.  
A homogeneous mist of branches.
