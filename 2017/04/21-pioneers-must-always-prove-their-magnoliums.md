Pioneers Must Always Prove Their Magnoliums
-------------------------------------------
The stain imposes nessecity.  
Not to preserve or even meet  
the stone of one who expands  
under me in a room or storing to a giant.  
It's a forming knave of stalactites.  
The consequence begins on its fractious mare  
dawning cashmire starlights over the boulevard.  
And a brutal cathedral's water will transform you.  
All knaves become vagabonds.  
  
When you develop like femininity lighted by the mud.  
It was the late afternoon of the ostrich.  
A chorus of jaguars at early light of day un relinquished un taunted  
comes to a halt before a law.  
A loaf of bread baked with melancholy decency and salt.  
  
It was the early light of day of the tiger.  
What crushes the props of sincerity?  
You, who is like a darknes cat among the attracting of many fisherman.  
A circle among a line segment,  
the boneless workings of myriad law.  
Return to the homeland of the tigers.  
You rustle my forceful moldy banana  
like a humble tiger to fresh sugar.
