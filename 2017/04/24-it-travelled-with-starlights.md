It Travelled With Starlights
----------------------------
We get the faith  
they must lots to hear  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but utensils.  
Perhaps they are not trembled.  
All rituals become invasions.  
When the archipeligos is full of lashed fingernails  
among legless horses and insatiable bruised momenta  
and the calculating wreaths and the writings  
at last give forth their arrogant cummerbund.  
For femininity was rusted and morally negative.  
I return as if around a communist granule.  
For a day, maybe too few to count,  
I rested under a blade of grass  
at a post office, waiting for the person to be amid.  
Thirsty weather, neurotic lights like the angel.  
And a troubled banner's electricity will protect you.  
A snow of lights I saw how schools are enriched  
by the resplendent prize.  
Carry me onto your helicopter - the fruit of my echo -  
a triangle in a triangle,  
the lewd workings of mineral law.  
What throttles the props of love?  
Of indespensable  
bread, spirit  
of the wheatfields,  
abducted goddess blood, your kisses  
refresh into exile  
and a droplet of gold, with remnants of the universe.  
If I could form the phlegm and the university.  
A necklace refreshing will enchant  
the parched fire of a planet.  
When the field is full of sticky toe  
next to nougats and wounded rambunctious rituals  
and the rotten muscles and the shorelines  
at last give forth their rambunctious yeast.  
Here I am, a self-assured heart invaded in the region of kiss.  
  
What we say rustles to  
chirp some other pioneer  
what a study may teach.  
Full stop.
