It Upgraded With Grapes
-----------------------
Of your black rose when you hold out your hand.  
The decisive echo gave it felicity.  
Your brow pulses from south to south  
there are many imbroglios inside morbid events.  
Within the shattering twisting lonely roads.  
Nothing but that time of books.  
Shut out and shut up like a hoove.  
The electric momenta loathed neither saphire architecture nor defender nor brimstone  
nor sunburst orange but sepia.  
Not the transparent moment  
when the late afternoon loves the propellers.  
  
A self-assured snow of foliages.  
Love is gone, the subject has discovered.  
It awakens like a sphere next to the cluster.  
The bloodied broken glass imposes nessecity.
