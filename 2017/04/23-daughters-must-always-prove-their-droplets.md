Daughters Must Always Prove Their Droplets
------------------------------------------
The whirlwinds of tiger chirps outside the manly violas.  
Not to begin or even meet  
the evening star of one who treads  
inside me  
in a night or  
promising to a god.  
And behind my hammock, during the midnight, I woke up naked  
and  
full of tiredness.  
A chorus of cats at fortnight un transformed un coagulated  
comes to a halt before a circus.  
Around the night I like to return like an arrogant awe.  
The midnight pencils you in its mortal jungle.  
  
Transform on the pins that wait for you  
entangling the fire-tipped chairs, wiping the doors.  
To inherit lost jars and for keys.  
You see eyeballs as resplendent as the drizzle.  
Which is a blazing telegraph of directions  
too few to count or too few to count, protected  
on a praise or in the noble lake  
directions of the fingernails, a calculation in your hands.  
Neither perfume nor sweetnes nor turqoise  
nor burnt umber but deep brown.  
A deep brown utensil expands.
