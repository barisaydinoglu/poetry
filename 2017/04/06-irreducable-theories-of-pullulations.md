Irreducable Theories Of Pullulations
------------------------------------
In my modern office at afternoon you are like a cactus  
and your form and colour the way I crystallize them.  
A chorus of oysters at day un perched un deceived  
comes to a halt before a silence.  
Of your red foam when you hold out your eye.  
I was without doubt the daughter tiger  
there in the boney boulevard.  
When it looked me with its silent saxophone eyes  
it had neither toe nor foot  
but cork hooves on its sides.  
The curtain develops in lighting your breath.  
The reasons for my respect  
are wetted in my eyeballs of ivory.  
  
You, who is like a martyr oyster among the loving of many gentleman.  
Draw from it the oily  
study of its own identity.  
Promising empire. The triangle functions to hear a system  
to its environment.  
A current of cleansed flute  
that does not know why it flows and rustles.  
Outside the divisions like clay.  
The arrogant springtime is eloquent on your eye.  
Next to the opaque gray animosity of the oblivion.  
Where kiss meet  
prizes meet, among and among and the sound  
of explications, to reach out and discover  
in sorrow.  
It was a sordid business of bloodied broken glass and corpses.  
  
They prosecuted it with hairy writings.
