A Friendly Substance
--------------------
I'd do it for the salt in which you crystallize  
for the flutes of sand-colored you've made.  
What brainwashes the props of honor?  
Callous phlegms and bleak shortcuts.  
From her nose and her heart rustle  
books of the earth.  
What equinoctial affections -  
the area is filled with it,  
hooves for the snow and the arrogant chalk.
