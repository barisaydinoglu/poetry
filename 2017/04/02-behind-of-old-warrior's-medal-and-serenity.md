Behind Of Old Warrior's Medal And Serenity
------------------------------------------
The I in phemonana sand-colored flasks of rotten stump,  
deep brown seams above a inaccessible praise.  
Jar was no longer above the transmission threshold.  
Neither sweetnes nor mane nor opaque gray  
nor sepia but blue.  
An odor has swam outside the angel,  
a mixture of invasion and body, a blushing  
candle that brings fear.  
You are the hairy son of a tiger,  
the worn-out ness of the ripple, the power of the electricity.  
On what demonic coffins appreciated with lava?  
Love is gone, the subject has trusted.  
Of full nectarine, spirit  
of the evening stars,  
rejected pioneer blood, your kisses  
wet into exile  
and a droplet of glass, with remnants of the divisions.  
Our new guitar, our balanced ritual triangles.  
  
A tetrahedron in front of a quadrangle,  
the negligent workings of secure law.  
To the profound color of the silk fellowship.
