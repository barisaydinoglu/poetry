I Have Gone Changing
--------------------
And you dedicate like an aspen and the custodian smiles at the one  
but the man does not smile  
when he looks at the toucan cousin  
and  
the skeleton ocean.  
A banal production kills  
even the deedy  
slightest city in antenna  
to which the metaphor  
will not be protected.  
Wide empire. The loop functions to protect an architecture  
to its system.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
live of bells and smooth stones  
and the wide leaves of his native land?  
I took on acidulous circuss.  
In your curves of anger the region of springtimes create.  
And meetings of neurotic hips so the wonderful happiness lives on in an apple,  
the nocturnal house of the cathedral,  
the pure circus that is wonderful and indespensable.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
refresh of love and sun rises  
and the resplendent angels of his native land?  
Once there was a burned-out god who  
relaxed at parties, sitting in a circle, among umbrellas.  
Animosity and cactus - warmths of your body of confusion.
