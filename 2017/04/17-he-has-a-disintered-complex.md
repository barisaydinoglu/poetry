He Has A Disintered Complex
---------------------------
Not preserving is a form of crystallizing.  
The misunderstood sea shell is monastic on your heart.  
Only peace, just the  
wave, nothing but  
it. Faucet.  
A loaf of bread baked with skeleton felicity and salt.  
  
A bicycle is not enough to penetrate me and keep me  
from the vicinity of your acerb funny things.  
I could magnify vagina, shards of gem, and gate  
from honeysuckles and smooth stones  
with a blood colored promise  
with havocs in my heart.
