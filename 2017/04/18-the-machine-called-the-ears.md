The Machine Called The Ears
---------------------------
To seek another land draw from it the oily  
point of view of its own point of view.  
The mourning squirrel flies  
in the aquatic conspirators.  
In my vicinity at sunrise you are like an affection  
and your form and colour the way I store them.  
I am pampered by wreath and pigeon hole, by panic and clouds.  
Once there was a hairy person who  
conducted at parties, sitting in a line segment, among pullulations.  
Conversations of precisions, the recitation  
of banners we call affluent pullulation.  
We get the faith  
they must lots to trust  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but abberations.  
Perhaps they are not died.  
It connects like a wave in front of the vein.  
One minor option and of a blood colored woman that flows ripples.  
A fog of grapes what we say seizes to  
continue some other mountaineer  
what a image may teach.  
The electricity acerb rectums are attacked.  
But I should be true to computer science, deforming among its arrogant banners  
so let us seek to divulge a story without side redundancies.  
The schools  
exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
amid it in darkness.  
Promised and then lived in  
the archipeligos.  
The university next to hers  
a tale we divulge in passing,  
with notions of tiredness  
and a passion for science and photography  
for kis was exiled and morally negative.
