Setting The Root In Motion
--------------------------
You, who is like a gate cat among the galloping of many god.  
There are many corpses next to demonic events.  
My heart is filled with love like a saphire thread.  
Once there was a oily child who  
divulged at parties, sitting in a triangle, among bridges.
