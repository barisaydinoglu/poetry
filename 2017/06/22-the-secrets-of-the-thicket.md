The Secrets Of The Thicket
--------------------------
Not perching is a form of developing.  
Your bed is a shades of cinnamon filled with blood-stained writing.  
Outside the sand-colored toe of the jungle.  
A heart and a foot  
understanding the thicket.  
Around the moonlight evening I like to re-cover like a difficult maternity.  
Profound empire. The line segment functions to enchant an architecture  
to its system.  
And you ignored in the fear and attracted a trembling stain.
