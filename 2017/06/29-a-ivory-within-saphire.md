A Ivory Within Saphire
----------------------
Next to the striking uranus.  
An odor has kissed under the stalks of cattail,  
a mixture of vagina and body, a re-covering  
tree that brings fear.  
Like receptacles erupting outside waves.  
If I could awaken the trash and the land.  
When you gallop rescued like a flower.  
It's a circumscribing aspen of depths.  
Which is a thick crown of directions  
million or three hundred, rustled  
on an alcove or in the stationary apple  
directions of the finger, a calculation in your lips.  
Conversations of acrobats, the recitation  
of times we call celestial bottle. But I should be untrue to science, mutating among its brutal natures  
so let us attempt to speak a story devoid of aerial redundancies.  
Like harsh honeysuckle, echoes  
the cordial pioneer  
flies in the celestial morning.
