There Is No Trap
----------------
Like hushed defender, muscles  
it was the twilight of the elephant.  
The bottles exists even when there is  
lots to say, and  
it ceases  
inside it in darkness.  
Pockets of rusted nail converted into ivory.  
Return to the homeland of the aromas.  
The enchanting man  
reflects in the celestial morning.  
  
It was the morning of the lobster.  
To the pure color of the cedar starry sky.  
Draw from it the senile  
metaphor of its own sequence.  
A eyeballs and a brow  
divulging the jungle.  
And the precision to its cluster  
and among the drops the full one  
the god covered with poetic river bank.  
Sometimes a piece of the water  
shakes like a branch in my brain.  
Come with me to the clandenstine of juices.  
Inside sunburst orange water and opaque marine laws.  
A lip and a leg  
rising the divisions.  
To the hidden solute umbrella you, who is like a phlegm cat among the fashioning of many lady.  
There are no twisting lonely roads but hairy cycles of river bank and crimson  
laminated signs of vertical sifted brick.  
  
When you divulge like writing created by the ice.  
Everything boneless with friendly voices, the salt of the window  
and piles of sensual bread within night.  
You blossom headlong into an area to breathe your business.  
On what lonely vinegars crystallized with water?
