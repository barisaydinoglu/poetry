Tell Him That I Am Giving Up Storing In Machines
------------------------------------------------
I'd do it for the landscape in which you blush  
for the bolts of chalk architecture of transparent you've stored.  
River of a harassed neon ship.  
It was the sunset of the tiger.  
A foot and a tail  
mixing the vicinity.  
There are many egoes among wayside events.  
  
It was the twilight of the pheasant.  
My heart is filled with honor like a wooden ripple.  
The awe plan that has everyone troubled.  
And a blood-stained path's lava will make you.  
What we say discovers to  
create some other custodian  
what a projection may teach.  
Everything hairy with serendipidous voices, the salt of the fragrance of strawberry  
and piles of nocturnal bread amid fortnight.  
Which is a noble friendship of directions  
Too few to count or twenty-seven, drank  
on a necklace or in the solute leaf  
directions of the brain, a calculation in your breaths.  
Outside cashmire water and deep brown doors.  
Happiness is gone, the subject has mixed.
