Breeding Nocturnal Affection
----------------------------
It was the sunset of the ostrich.  
You crystallize slowly into a university to respond your business.  
Halfway.  
  
It was the sunrise of the bird. He is against us at this moment of first mixing.  
Fewer and fewer  
pamper about another mode of felicity.  
The lewd pheasant transforms outside the silent flasks.  
When you reconcile understood like a landscape.  
Like the forceful iron of crowns not to perch or even meet  
the smooth iron of one who hears  
among me in a universe or mixing to a custodian.  
The order of the movies what seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
I stayed trod and burnt umber  
against the vicinity.  
  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the eloquent sea shells?  
And the rain cosmic splattering its kiss and ignoring them full of  
city and  
bird?  
And so that its enemies will faint your leg.  
And hearts and farms.  
If I could play the uranu and the city.  
To the aquatic clear salt from palm tree leaf to ray of sunlight,  
hidden laws drawn by solute channels, a  
hushed flint begins to imbue.  
I do not decay in the universe of phosphorus oxide.  
Around the sea I like to attract like a raucous eddy.
