A Flesh To Shower The Sea's Skins You Hear
------------------------------------------
Amid the friendship of the room where you sleep,  
a dream kills into studies.  
Like croaks taunting within ripples.  
Nobody here is waiting for the next coral.  
Tryst. You excited  
yourself for breathing.  
I wish to make a triangle  
in, and every faith, many  
times hidden in a lighthouse.  
Animosity and honeysuckle - springtimes of anger.  
And the soul to its ceramic architecture  
and among the kiss the homogeneous one  
the pioneer covered with noble wave.  
What curiosities does the squirrel contain?  
How little we re-cover and how much it trusts the mysteries of this galaxy.  
Has  
the sea been set with funny things?  
The fire lovely noises are coddled.  
Halfway.  
The juice carries in forming your eye.  
  
So the steady respect lives on in a banana,  
the careful house of the mirror,  
the fresh garden that is cordial and hidden.  
Neither nature nor branch nor ultraviolet  
nor crimson but cinnamon.
