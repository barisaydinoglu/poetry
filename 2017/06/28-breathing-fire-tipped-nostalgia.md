Breathing Fire-tipped Nostalgia
-------------------------------
Sometimes a piece of the fire  
filters like a hoove in my hips.  
Come with me to the night of felicities.  
Somebody here is waiting for the next hat.  
Flag. You mingled yourself for living.  
Full stop.  
From harrowing wind to harrowing wind,  
hidden faucets drawn by hidden channels, a  
sordid wheatfield begins to tread.  
Wetting the echo of her fragrance of strawberry full of decency.  
There are no stains but tremulous cycles of movie and transluscent cashmire  
souls of lion hearted arrogant aluminum.  
The mirror knows this,  
that life in it's silken boxes is as endless as the perfume.  
A current of rosy affection  
that does not know why it flows and imbues.  
The error imposes nessecity.  
A spoiled projection twists  
even the angellic  
algorithmic divisions in synonym  
to which the metaphor  
will not be stored.  
Our new phemonana, our romantic alcove triangles.  
The clear candle gave it sincerity.  
The waves exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
behind it in darkness.  
  
So the equinoctial sincerity lives on in a grape,  
the enchanting house of the quiver,  
the stationary soul that is dashing and aromatic.  
You say, what is the stars in the sky waiting for in its sepia heart?  
I tell you it is waiting for atom like you.
