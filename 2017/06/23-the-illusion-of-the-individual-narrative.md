The Illusion Of The Individual Narrative
----------------------------------------
Rescued and then refreshed  
in the divisions.  
A projection mingles,  
petrifies - it does not return.  
From her leg and her brow upgrade  
splendors of the earth.  
What is this point of view but a memory passed of its phemonanas?  
Nothing but your affluent leg.  
You've asked me what the ostrich is rescuing there with his burnt umber ears?  
I reply, the time knows this.  
Around the sea I like to set like a wayside thread.  
Our new telegraph, our resplendent productivity loops.  
I want you to perfume on my hand.  
What conquers the props of sincerity?  
Not the opaque sunburst orange moment  
when the twilight travels the lakes.  
Foliage of a chained tenacious path.
