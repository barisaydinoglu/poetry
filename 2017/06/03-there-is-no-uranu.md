There Is No Uranu
-----------------
Everybody here is waiting for the next current.  
Garden. You excited yourself for pulsing.  
Some circumscribe but I chirp your brick like apple.  
A loaf of bread baked with rustling felicity and salt.  
Circus was no longer above the transmission threshold.  
My heart is filled with purity like a emerald sea water.  
What aquatic moons -  
the region is filled with it,  
doors for the foliage and the cheerless glass.  
Carry me onto your boat - the apple of my home -
