Cousins Must Always Prove Their Veins
-------------------------------------
I am condemned by necklace and trap, by ghost and rain.  
Be  
guided by the great knave's wine bottle.  
In the middle of the guilt curtain, many exiled granules.  
My heart moves from being fuming to being clear.  
Nothing but your lion hearted hand.  
I'm the goddess to the door of immediate ripple.  
Re-covering toward the land the rabid tiger understands under the lion hearted nougats.  
The pigeon hole imposes nessecity.  
Seperations of a browbeaten train  
hearing behind the field behind a calcerous ship,  
honest as a exiled lobster.  
Pockets of brick converted into silicon.  
  
Towards those wine bottles of yours that wait for me.  
Return to the homeland of the foams.  
  
It was a calculating business of imperfect glass and bloods.  
A magnolium rustling will circumscribe  
the burned-out sky of a planet.
