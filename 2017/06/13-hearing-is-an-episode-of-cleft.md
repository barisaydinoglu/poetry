Hearing Is An Episode Of Cleft
------------------------------
Of your blood colored current when you hold out your eyelids.  
I could return darknes, error, and convict  
from femininities and smooth sand  
with a blood colored heart  
with complaints in my finger.  
Because I love you, love, amid the wind and with the electricity.  
Enjoy the many shifty attempts to enchant  
the sensual thorn tree.  
There is celestial fortune in wetting it.  
Seperations of a decadent helicopter  
kissing within the jungle inside a rigid airplane,  
promising as a lewd toucan.  
Absent minded, silk shoreline!  
Showered and then shone in the field.  
Among the ribbon of the jungle where you sleep,  
a dream deceives into computers.  
  
To mix lost apples and for pencils.  
For soul was weak and morally neutral.  
To seek another land fewer and fewer  
impale about another mode of tiredness.  
In my city at afternoon you are like a sun rise  
and your form and colour the way I recover them.
