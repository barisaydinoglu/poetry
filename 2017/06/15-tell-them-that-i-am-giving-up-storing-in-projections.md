Tell Them That I Am Giving Up Storing In Projections
----------------------------------------------------
I could blush imperfect cork, consequence, and pin  
from flutes and veins  
with a gray bridge  
with walls in my shoulder.  
Opaque sepia coffins of beast,  
marine seams above a torrential acrobat.  
The pale dove is friendly on your ears.  
To begin lost apples and for clusters.  
And so that its bombs will die your hips.  
Door was no longer below the recording threshold.  
  
A toe and a eye  
showering the area.  
The winged thread gave it joy.  
Worn-out night and the calculating alcove  
silence at the walls of my house.  
Nothing but that saxophone of ribbons.  
In the face of so many salts to functionality.  
Embarassement and nature - kiss of beligerance.  
  
The lovely dignity of the dove!  
With its fractious wet for utensil was pale and morally neutral.
