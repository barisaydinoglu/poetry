I Have Gone Loving
------------------
My heart is filled with respect like a paper-mache ribbon.  
Be guided by the arcane flint  
's garden.  
Blue gates of ego,  
burnt umber seams above a barbaous warmth of your body.  
The candle knows this,  
that life in it's cork boxes is as endless as the trouser.
