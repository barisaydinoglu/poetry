Since The End Of Coagulating
----------------------------
Sorrow and land - saxophones of embarassement. And you stand like a fragrance of strawberry and the dew dedicating from my arm. One of them is brandishing,  
the other knows details.  
Where is somebody  
he says, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
The river plan that has everyone sticky.
