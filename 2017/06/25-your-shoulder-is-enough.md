Your Shoulder Is Enough
-----------------------
The one smiles at the mountaineer  
but the person does not smile  
when he looks at the bird bride  
and the fractious ocean. The eloquent dignity of the goblet!  
In the disintered ribbon, many hated  
dusts.  
  
Erupt me and let my substance attract.
