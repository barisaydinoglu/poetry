Since The End Of Fashioning
---------------------------
Some recover but I perfume your metal like river. And meetings of cold ears here I am, a clear brow cracked in the area of yellow car.  
Outside sepia water and cinnamon umbrellas.  
The order of the maternities recovered and then wove in the field.  
In the face of so many eternities to positivity.  
On what calcerous oxides chirped with earth?  
But I should be true to science, mutating among its browbeaten schools  
so let us seek to speak a story without alphabetic redundancies.  
I could create martyr, evil, and abys  
from wheatfields and flutes  
with a ultraviolet fragrance of strawberry  
with enemies in my arm.  
Here I am, a somber eyeballs imprisoned in the thicket of poppy.  
You fly slowly into a vicinity to crystallize your business.  
  
Transforming from inaccessible cork.  
A shoulder and a hips  
swimming the region.
