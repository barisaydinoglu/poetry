The Deluding Of A Sailor Down A University
------------------------------------------
Only cactus, just the  
splendor, nothing but  
it. Garden.  
Here I am, a gleaming tail passed in the archipeligos of mirror.  
Fewer and fewer  
throttle about another mode of love.  
And a fuming horse's water will hear you.  
  
The hound wets on its brutal mare  
recovering marine apples over the jungle.  
To seek another land your mist is a salt filled with cold propeller.  
Pure grave enchants the faucets elder of the depths of my hand - your pulsing  
stills your eager regard as  
though it were fire.  
I stayed shone and cinnamon  
inside the moonlight evening.
