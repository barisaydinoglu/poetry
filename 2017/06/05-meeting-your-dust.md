Meeting Your Dust
-----------------
Agony and lunar - acrobats of beligerance.  
Come with me to the stain of thorn trees.  
  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
Next to the opaque gray agony of the phlegm.  
  
My heart is filled with purity like a ivory perfume.  
On what bitterest trashes recovered with electricity?  
The barbaous nature that shines in your starlight.  
Shall we recount?  
And you relinquish like a energy and on what molested bloody feathers transformed with mud?  
In the face of so many bloodied ashes to animosity.  
Of a red sailor that swims necklaces.
