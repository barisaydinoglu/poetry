Your Lip Is Enough
------------------
The lethargic old warrior's medal that attracts in your cactus.  
To the steady color of the bolt of silk shades of sand-colored.  
Happiness is gone, the subject has wetted.  
Outside the sepia nose of the lava.  
A square inside a quadrangle,  
the harsh workings of human law.
