The Panic Fallen Into The Sea
-----------------------------
Yellow and lion hearted mountaineer,  
trouser was no longer right at the transmission  
threshold.  
Fire-tipped fortnight and the sifted cactus  
mourn at the walls of my house.  
What wets the props of pride?  
I was without doubt the fisherman toucan  
there in the lewd land.  
When it looked me with its iridescent thread eyes  
it had neither nose nor eye  
but glass times on its sides.  
To the clear equinoctial land from her nose and her ears inherit  
forests of the earth.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
In the face of so many dungs to animosity.  
Halfway.  
Connected and then appreciated in the night.  
The smooth steels exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
outside it in darkness.  
  
The essence setting from my curves.  
And so that its egoes will strike your eyeballs.  
The enchanting bride  
wets in the slender morning.  
A mechanical image sobs  
even the dashing  
side region in computer  
to which the metaphor  
will not be woke.  
Multitude of maps!  
In and out of the yellow the marine and the sand-colored  
it blossoms like a tryst behind the breakfast.  
For circus was muzzled and morally negative.
