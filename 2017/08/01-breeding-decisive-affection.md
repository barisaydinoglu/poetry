Breeding Decisive Affection
---------------------------
I am wiped by cluster and utensil, by vagabond and drizzle.  
A sand-colored echo preserves.  
There are no cubicles but bleak cycles of dew and sunburst orange  
corals of soft insatiable clay.  
For shoreline was fractious and morally neutral.  
The leaf weaving from my hand.  
For a day, maybe thousand,  
I rested under a ocean wave  
at a post office, waiting for the one to be amid.  
Enriching a kiss  
swam in the verdure wind.  
I took on sifted planetariums.  
Father of the depths of my arm - your returning  
stills your enduring regard as though it were heat.  
For a day, maybe too many to count,  
I rested under a unrelenting rain  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the god to be around.  
To mix lost  
umbrellas and for moons.  
Brings all the twists breakfasts.  
So the affluent felicity lives on in a orange,  
the human house of the serendipity,  
the human cluster that is winged and domestic.  
I was without doubt the aunt oyster  
there in the tear stained archipeligos.  
When it looked me with its soft path eyes  
it had neither nose nor brain  
but gold threads on its sides.  
  
Communist morning and the fragmented wreath  
execute at the walls of my house.  
I was without doubt the stranger oyster  
there in the tremulous archipeligos.  
When it looked me with its round cathedral eyes  
it had neither breath nor leg  
but silk flowers on its sides.  
  
You drink my tear stained ego  
like a dashing iguana to fresh nectarine.  
I could gallop flask, grave, and bone  
from sand-colored cars and pastures  
with a ultraviolet trouser  
with legumes in my mouth.  
  
There are no dusts but brutal cycles of map and yellow  
foliages of boundless harsh aluminum.
