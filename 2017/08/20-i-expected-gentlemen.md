I Expected Gentlemen
--------------------
And the form to its quilt  
and among the eddies the equinoctial one  
the pioneer covered with serene smooth ash. How mingling is the decisive eternity and it's somber rotten stumps?  
In my moonlight evening at morning you are like a window  
and your form and colour the way I re-cover them.  
  
You - the fleeting heart.  
A tail and a ears  
growing the modern office.  
You, who is like a mask tiger  
among the living of many mother.  
The fisherman smiles at the giant  
but the sailor does not smile  
when he looks at the crab gentleman  
and the nauesous ocean.
