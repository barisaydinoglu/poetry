It Lighted With Waves
---------------------
When the jungle is full of directionless nose  
with havocs and phosphorus senile evening stars  
and the crooked acrobats and the peaces  
at last give forth their inaccessible conspirator.  
The wasteland transforms on its bitterest mare  
making sunburst orange sea's skins over the heights.  
The wide mother  
gathers in the electrical morning.  
Embarassement and shades of sepia - starss in the sky of panic.  
Not blushing is a form of growing.  
You are the apple of my rustling heart.  
  
For branch was troubled and morally neutral.  
You are the apple of my hated mouth.  
A silvery fellowship lives.  
It was a lethargic business of oblivion and lonely roads.  
With its silent enrich and so that its moths will force your eyelids.
