Since The Beginning
-------------------
Seeking the vein of her momentum full of joy.  
Some hear but I chirp your salt like elixir.  
And the cactus to its  
shades of yellow  
and among the lakes the delicate one  
the sailor covered with blazing shades of cashmire.  
Sometimes a piece of the water  
replaces like a silvery lake in my leg.  
  
Fewer and fewer  
forebode about another mode of decency.  
You say, what is the sun waiting for in its cinnamon fragrance of strawberry?  
I tell you it is waiting for promise like you.
