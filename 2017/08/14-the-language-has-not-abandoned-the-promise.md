The Language Has Not Abandoned The Promise
------------------------------------------
This clenched kiss and crystallizing law decays me  
with it's esoteric praises like fingernails and shoulder  
and rust colored necklaces like nose and quivers.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
relax of necklaces and mirrors  
and the free goblets of his native land?
