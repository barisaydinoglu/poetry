It Developed With Candles
-------------------------
To create lost lunars and for saxophones.  
I'd do it for the quilt in which you hear  
for the doors of burnt umber you've swam.  
Nothing but your human brain.  
A loaf of bread baked with banal sincerity and salt.  
  
Circumscribing a form  
conducted in the changeless drizzle.  
Of charitable apple, spirit  
of the juices,  
fell pioneer blood, your kisses  
crystallize into exile  
and a droplet of paper-mache, with  
remnants of the region.
