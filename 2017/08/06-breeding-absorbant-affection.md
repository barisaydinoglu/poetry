Breeding Absorbant Affection
----------------------------
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
fly of lights and flutes  
and the naked trysts of his native land?  
Of balanced lemon, spirit  
of the green cars,  
throttled child blood, your kisses  
appreciate into exile  
and a droplet  
of marble, with remnants of the modern office.  
Carry me onto your raft - the mango of my hat -  
once there was a harsh mother who  
awakened at parties, sitting in a circle, among times.
