The Sobbing Of A Goddess Down A City
------------------------------------
For a day, maybe too many to count,  
I rested under a palm tree leaf  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the daughter to be in front  
of.  
A snow of grapes one of them is lion hearted,  
the other knows machines.  
Where is someone  
she exclaims, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?
