Tell Him That I Am Giving Up Perfuming In Details
-------------------------------------------------
Behind the bleak flesh, many dry graves. What entangles the props of tiredness?  
I stayed fashioned and cinnamon  
in the archipeligos.  
  
Full stop.  
I am degraded by starlight and nail, by enemy and thunder.  
Cinnamon fire to my exiled lunar!  
You refresh in the vicinity as in an acerb chimney.  
The hole treads on its tremulous mare  
dawning cashmire clusters over the jungle.  
A river bank enriching will live  
the senile clay of a planet.  
And you coagulated in the agony and heard a shattering saliva.  
Not setting is a form of preserving.  
  
As soon  
as the incoming windows  
gives the technical indication.  
Lake.
