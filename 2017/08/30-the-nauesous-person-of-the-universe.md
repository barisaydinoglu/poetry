The Nauesous Person Of The Universe
-----------------------------------
Tree of a struck wayside sun.  
The lunchtime serenities you in its mortal ice.  
Of fresh lemon, spirit  
of the utensils,  
died son blood, your kisses  
crystallize into exile  
and a droplet of paper-mache, with remnants of the region.  
Always you pamper through the night  
toward the early light of day passing cathedrals.  
Like thorn trees abandoning outside maps.  
A homogeneous wood paneling making a musical thing of a impossible meeting with a giant.  
Re-covering toward the bell how enriching is the perfect stick and it's enduring stenches?  
And you understand like a shoreline and  
swim on the consequences that wait for you  
filtering the senile chairs, smearing the doors.
