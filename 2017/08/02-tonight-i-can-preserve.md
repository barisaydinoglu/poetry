Tonight I Can Preserve
----------------------
As soon as the incoming rivers  
gives the alphabetic indication.  
In the smallest chalk mist a solute carpet making a humble thing of a chance meeting with a custodian.  
Your miracle is a lighthouse filled with oily light.  
Deep brown imbroglios of enemy,  
deep brown  
seams above a rigid wheatfield.  
You - the stationary curves.  
To enrich lost fountains and for manes.  
The early light of day essences you in its mortal ice.  
A detail builds,  
invades - it does not return.  
What we say travels to  
reconcile some other mountaineer  
what a identity may teach.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
appreciate of springtimes and guitars  
and the incredulous lakes of his native land?  
There are many walls inside wet-winged events.  
The hole entertains on its putrid mare  
living burnt umber awes over the city.  
Behind the city like rusted nail.  
  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
Arcane, silken muscle!  
Enjoy the many weak attempts to perform  
the decisive yeast.  
.  
There is rosy fortune in reconciling it.  
One overtone option and went conducted in snow in your toe of illusion the night of reflections circumscribe.
