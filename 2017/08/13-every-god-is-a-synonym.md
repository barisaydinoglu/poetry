Every God Is A Synonym
----------------------
Only phemonana, just the  
atom, nothing but  
it. Lighthouse.  
It's a seeking sea shell of trashes.  
You are the muzzled one of a bird,  
the misunderstood ness of the time, the power of the lava.  
Showering the sea's skin of her friendship full of joy.  
Shall we keep going?  
Disordered weather, fragmented lights like the dove.  
To rise lost dews and for fragrances of strawberry.  
A sepia mist magnifies.  
What manly leaves -  
the universe is filled with it,  
waves for the warmth of your body and the cold fused quartz.
