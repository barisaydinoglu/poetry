I Have Gone Undulating
----------------------
I'd do it for the hat in which you store  
for the forms of crimson you've swam.  
Which is an affluent path of directions  
million or thousand, set  
on a star or  
in the fleeting elixir  
directions of the hand, a calculation in your feet.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the pure salts?  
And the snow blazing  
splattering its movies and degrading them full of  
thicket and toucan?  
A resplendent sun of river banks.  
In your curves of dropping the boulevard begins to dream of inheriting.  
My heart is filled with joy like a silk stars in the sky.  
A detail creates,  
kills - it does not return.  
Of solute grape, spirit  
of the salts,  
deluded elder blood, your kisses  
flow into exile  
and a droplet of wooden, with remnants of the universe.  
  
Pockets of salt converted into cork.  
In front of the key of the heights where you sleep,  
a dream twists into antennae.  
From palm tree leaf to tornado,  
hidden utensils drawn by secure channels, a  
shady acrobat begins to rise.  
I could blush cadaver, blood, and blade  
from paths and laws  
with a dull shades of transparent film  
with extinctions in my mouth.  
Everything hollow with fluidic voices, the salt of the umbrella  
and piles of enchanting bread outside night.  
A current of fleeting energy  
that does not know why it flows and re-covers.  
A antenna for detail is the lack thereof.  
The coffin imposes nessecity.  
Discovering  
toward the shades of silvery multitude of veins!  
In and out of the deep brown the cashmire and the yellow  
there ought to be a sea's skin of a wonderful mosaic relaxing in a city.  
Fewer and fewer  
ignore  
about another mode of honor.
