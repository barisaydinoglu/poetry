Men Of A Browbeaten Country
---------------------------
Like violenet flute, promises  
and you shook in the sorrow and promised a freezing cleft.  
In front of sand-colored water and opaque marine sun rises.  
When the university is full of molested brow  
outside cities and lonely hated railroad tracks  
and the lethargic quilts and the reflections  
at last give forth their muzzled pin.  
There are no panics but whirlwinds of cycles of serendipity and transluscent transparent  
pullulations of human distorted clay.  
Behind the lighthouse of the heights where you sleep,  
a dream imprisons into synonyms.  
Nothing but your gleaming breath.  
  
Return to the homeland of the foams.  
It is a tale of oily throats the star plan that has  
everyone wounded.  
The lewd map is myriad on your leg.  
A camera discovers,  
faints -  
it does not return.  
They are all mothers  
professional graves in whose perfect trysts originate.  
I'd do it for the bell in which you enrich  
for the kisses of yellow you've performed.  
  
Among the sepia foot of the wind.  
Indicates the curtain's blossoming  
finger.
