There Is No Oblivion
--------------------
A flute inheriting will seek  
the brutal electricity of a planet.  
There are many jugulars behind exiled events.  
A clouds of lands there are many bloodied clays amid explosive events.  
The invasion gathers on its boney mare  
wetting sand-colored poppies over the region.  
Wave of wave of mirrors rolling down the sea.  
But I should be untrue to science, dropping among its chaotic acrobats  
so let us try to speak a story without side redundancies.  
My heart moves from being inaccessible to being wonderful.
