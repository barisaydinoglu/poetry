Song For The Father Of Directionless Phemonanas
-----------------------------------------------
Went dawned in starlight on what hated conspirators rustled with ice? The water slender receptacles are wiped.  
The clotting honeysuckle is infinite on your breath.  
Conversations of doors, the recitation  
of flags we call  
comfortable well.  
I wish to make a square  
around, and every abstraction, many  
times hidden in a bottle.  
And you magnify like a warmth and your tail mixes from south to east  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
My boundless ears blossoms you always.  
And you form like an affection and enjoy the many exiled attempts to circumscribe  
the blazing ash.  
There is equinoctial fortune in treading it.  
  
Sometimes a piece of the sky  
bristles like a landscape in my leg.  
Ghostly weather, dry lights like the sun.
