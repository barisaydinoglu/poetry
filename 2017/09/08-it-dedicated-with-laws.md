It Dedicated With Laws
----------------------
For a day, maybe too few to count,  
I rested under a unrelenting rain  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the daughter to be amid.  
Like the molested aluminum of fleshes when you dawn like flower wove by the electricity.  
Where praises meet  
utensils meet, around and around and the sound  
of blades, to reach out and rescue in sorrow.  
As if to faint or perform or attack.  
Dead weather, putrid lights like the starlight.  
Agony and sweetnes - bridges of agony.  
Pockets of metal converted into silk.
