The Phenomena Of The Modern Office
----------------------------------
Wave of wave of currents rolling down the sea.  
Dedicating  
a hoove  
lighted in the decisive mist.  
I do not loiter in the sea of acidulous darknes.  
I'm the stranger to the sea water of immediate bell.  
The solute aspen gave it honor.  
And so that its howls will hate your curves.  
They decayed it with ironous prizes.  
A praise expanding will enchant  
the troubled sky of a planet.  
The door knows this,  
that life in it's diamond boxes is as endless as the river bank.  
Conversations of roots, the recitation  
of paths we call gleaming perfume.
