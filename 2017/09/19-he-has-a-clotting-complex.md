He Has A Clotting Complex
-------------------------
As soon as the incoming sea water  
gives the slightest indication. I want you to attract on my fingernails.  
Everything clotting with mineral voices, the salt of the star  
and piles of real bread in front of night.  
A hairy soul day  
shall we go forward?  
Our new tree, our handsome form quadrangles.  
The lunchtime banners you in its mortal lava.  
Building from decadent bolt of paper-mache.  
But the window protected the memory.  
In the smallest copper writing lion hearted empire. The line functions to promise a system  
to its system.  
  
To seek another land a projection for study is the lack thereof.  
Brings all the forebodes maps.  
  
Cinnamon ice to my phosphorus thread!  
To enchant lost dews and for juices.  
A current of electric mirror  
that does not know why it flows and swims.  
A brimstone and pale land is attacked in the archipeligos.
