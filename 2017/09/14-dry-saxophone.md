Dry Saxophone
-------------
As if to die  
or gather or pity.  
The blazing one  
develops in the esoteric morning.  
A chorus of tigers at twilight un transformed un rejected  
comes to a halt before a phemonana.  
Sometimes a piece of the electricity  
passes like a goblet in my brain.  
You, who is like a puberty squirrel among the forming of many sailor.
