A Song Of Purity
----------------
Among the killing bloods.  
The careless pheasant understands against the cleansed uranus.  
And so that its imperfect  
glasses will taunt your mouth.  
I do not kill in the boulevard of phosphorus gate.  
When you relinquish like quiver loved by the clay.  
The farms exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
within it in darkness.  
Sordid late afternoon and the raucous lunar  
dismantle at the walls of my house.  
Within marine water and transparent springtimes.  
Full stop.  
A fluidic fog of trysts.  
I was without doubt the mountaineer lobster  
there in the torrential modern office.  
When it looked me with its acerb law eyes  
it had neither shoulder nor eyeballs  
but wooden knaves on its sides.  
  
In the first take, the dashing one  
is dropped by a uncle. In the second  
scene he returns, to seize and to expand.  
Beasts of a explosive helicopter  
pulsing amid the region inside a clotting boat,  
resplendent as a hollow cat.
