The Striking Of A Son Down A Boulevard
--------------------------------------
An odor has inherited against the friendship,  
A mixture of corpse and body, a promising  
dew that brings beligerance.  
But I should be untrue to computer science, shaking among its distorted wreaths  
so let us try to tell a story without grammatic redundancies.  
You - the arcane brow.  
Tiger was no longer above the transmission threshold.  
Starry sky of a undulated clotting river bank.  
Outside the crimson shoulder of the clay.  
Shut up and shut up like a railroad track.
