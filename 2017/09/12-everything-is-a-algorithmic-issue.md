Everything Is A Algorithmic Issue
---------------------------------
From her breath and her eyelids grow  
spheres of the earth.  
A chorus of cats at afternoon un recovered un coagulated  
comes to a halt before a echo.  
You are the skeleton giant of a cat,  
the rotten ness of the path, the power of the earth.  
Inside the gray sorrow of the coffin.  
A camera perches,  
forebodes - it does not return.  
I stayed mixed and blue  
inside the city.  
  
This thirsty flower and promising sphere crushes me  
with it's aromatic river banks like eye and tail  
and turqoise salts like curves and defenders.  
There ought to be a propeller of a serendipidous fragrance of strawberry promising in a boulevard.  
Closed off and pulled out like a splendor.  
A rotten point of view deceives  
even the comfortable  
public city in identity  
to which the metaphor  
will not be perfumed.  
Amid the transparent arm of the water.  
Only senile and to a  
son they take on time, million years  
once there was a blood-stained goddess who  
blushed at parties, sitting in a line, among alcoves.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
transform of apples and angels  
and the parenthetical pastures of his native land?  
I'd do it for the school in which you perch  
for the mists of blue you've divulged.  
  
Inside transparent water and transparent mosaics.  
Protected and then promised in the boulevard.  
There are no circumstances but difficult cycles of mist and deep brown  
forests of changeless burned-out ash.  
I stayed mixed and transluscent  
green  
under the university.  
When the thicket is full of wet-winged nose  
amid coffins and callous hollow flowers  
and the mourning flints and the circuss  
at last give forth their dead bramble.  
A hopeful sun of writings.  
When you reconcile like alcove stored by the lightning.
