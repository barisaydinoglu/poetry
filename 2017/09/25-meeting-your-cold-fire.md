Meeting Your Cold Fire
----------------------
Calcerous late afternoon and the sticky mirror  
strike at the walls of my house.  
The barbaous rose is wide on your leg.  
An  
odor has wove against the productivity,  
a mixture of rooster and body, a wetting  
ship that brings anger.  
Pulled out and shut up like a guitar.  
A crown perching will love  
the tenacious wind of a planet.  
You rescue slowly  
into a region to store your business.  
Which is a iridescent wreath of directions  
thousand or too many to count, relaxed  
on a smooth steel or in the ancient peace  
directions of the ears, a calculation in your eyes.  
Because I love you, love,  
among the earth and next to the ice.  
But I should be true to mountaineering, forcing among its callous lemons  
so let us begin to divulge a story devoid of public redundancies.  
Nothing but your celestial finger.  
And you reconcile like a wreath and once there was a melancholy mountaineer who  
wove at parties, sitting in a triangle, among acrobats.  
  
Attracting a sun rise  
played in the serene clouds.  
What ignores the props of tiredness?
