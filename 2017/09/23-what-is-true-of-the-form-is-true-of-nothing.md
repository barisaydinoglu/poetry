What Is True Of The Form Is True Of Nothing
-------------------------------------------
The heat smooth shrapnels are dismantled.  
And the precision to its sphere  
and among the warmths the profound one  
the bride covered with loving mosaic.  
With the flying complaints.  
Conversations of farms, the recitation  
of spheres we call unguessed energy.  
Pure croak  
mingles the sea shells they  
are all brides  
professional conglomerates in whose brandishing aromas originate.  
Sometimes a piece of the fire  
pampers like a springtime in my mouth.  
Pockets of aluminum converted into silken.  
Law.  
To the hidden color of the marble soul.  
  
From her mouth and her hips weave  
currents of the earth.
