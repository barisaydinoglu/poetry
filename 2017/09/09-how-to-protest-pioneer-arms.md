How To Protest Pioneer Arms
---------------------------
  
Excite on the cummerbunds that wait for you  
dying the troubled chairs, killing the doors.  
Fewer and fewer  
loiter about another mode of pride.  
Listless women and pioneers.  
For me they are individual.  
Around the thicket I like to stand like a rusted poppy.  
You say, what is the writing waiting for in its cashmire telegraph?  
I tell you it is waiting for echo like you.  
Carry me onto your airplane - the banana of my starlight -  
a phenomenon re-covers,  
wipes - it does not return.  
Full stop.  
I am foreboded by atom and trapdoor, by stench and clouds.  
Splendor was no longer below the transmission threshold.  
Saxophone was no longer right at the recording threshold.  
Wine bottle.  
Fire-tipped people and uncles.  
For me they are neutral.  
A dry grace day  
of your opaque ultraviolet bell when you hold out your hips.  
  
To seek another land of your brimstone fountain when you hold out your arm.  
The delicious maps coddled draw from it the sticky  
camera of its own image.  
From ocean wave to blade of grass,  
hidden juices drawn by enchanting channels, a  
dead wave begins to carry.  
Be guided by the affluent kis's hoove.  
Sordid custodians and strangers.  
For me they are algorithmic.  
You are the banana of my tear stained breath.  
I am disguised by utensil and wounded soldier, by moth and sun.
