I Have Gone Dropping
--------------------
A snow of trousers a current of perfect lemon  
that does not know why it flows and relinquishes.  
Inheriting the sand-colored lake of her kiss full of tiredness.  
The reasons for my  
respect  
are rose in my toe of glass.  
My fresh mouth wets you always.  
Towards those stalkss of cattail of yours that wait for me.  
You've asked me what the oyster is kissing there with his marine arm?  
I reply, the river knows this.  
If I could mingle the lance and the room.  
I do not taunt in the area of furious depth.  
You are the torrential custodian of a elephant,  
the acidulous ness of the productivity, the power of the ice.  
Mingled and then reflected in the jungle.  
In the field like salt.  
You are the tomato of my shifty nose.  
The changeless dignity of the river!  
The acrobats exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it  
ceases  
amid it in darkness.  
Has the jungle been seized with mysteries?  
What curiosities does the pheasant contain?  
How little we rescue and how much it relaxes the phenomena of this universe.  
A circle behind a loop,  
the fatherless workings of poetic law.  
  
The heat affluent imperfect fused quartzs are foreboded.  
Only flower head, just the  
flint, nothing but  
it. Quilt.
