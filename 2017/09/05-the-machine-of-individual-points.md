The Machine Of Individual Points
--------------------------------
Everything arrogant with absent minded voices, the salt of the promise  
and piles of spacious bread around  
afternoon.  
Not to travel  
or even meet  
the acrobat of one who dawns  
in the middle of me  
in a field or trusting to a sailor.  
I salute your electric apple  
and envy your thick pride.  
Breathe on the jugulars that wait for you  
protesting the sterile chairs, congealing the doors.  
  
Key of a struck acidulous snow.  
Inevitable evils and cheerless dominions.
