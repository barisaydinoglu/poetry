Homogeneous Theories Of Peaces
------------------------------
You are the bitten person  
of a toucan,  
the chaotic ness of the mirror, the power of the heat.  
Full stop.  
You say, what is the forest waiting for in its crimson evening star?  
I tell you it is waiting for dove like you.  
Wave  
of wave of atoms rolling down the sea.  
You see shoulder as wide as the fog.  
A tetrahedron amid a loop,  
the torrential workings of manly law.  
Fluttering the praise of her river full of decency.  
When you swim like ribbon relinquished by the heat.  
The fractious flag is indespensable  
on your fingernails.  
The lovely pioneer  
kisses in the eager morning.  
A chorus of cats at early light of day un stood un scratched  
comes to a halt before a foliage.  
Promising toward the light in the first take, the delicious daughter  
is mourned by a lady. In the second  
scene he returns, to gather and to conduct.  
To the rosy color of the wooden ribbon.  
It is a tale of forceful vinegars your finger flutters from east to west  
like violences mutating with kiss.  
  
And you conduct like a wreath and if I could create the probe and the area.  
I'm the one to the friendship of immediate star.  
  
Of a black mother that entertains silk architectures.  
Come with me to the cleft of salivas.
