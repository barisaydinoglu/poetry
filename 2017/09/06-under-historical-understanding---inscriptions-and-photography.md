Under Historical Understanding - Inscriptions And Photography
-------------------------------------------------------------
In the blood colored embarassement of the blade.  
The sunrise landscapes you in its mortal clay.  
Only sticky and to a  
elder they take  
on time, too many to count years  
the order of the honeysuckles because I love you, love, inside the water and outside the mud.  
A blood colored and sticky cathedral is erupted in the divisions.  
In my sea at fortnight you are like a telegraph  
and your form and colour the way I trust them.  
When you connect like fountain shone by the mud.  
I relax as if amid a neurotic thorn tree.  
  
And so that its torrents will delude your nose.  
Somebody here is waiting for the next poppy.  
Grace. You mingled yourself for mingling.  
I was without doubt the cousin lobster  
there in the lewd sea.  
When it looked me with its careful planetarium eyes  
it had neither shoulder nor shoulder  
but ivory wheatfields on its sides.  
I do not silence in  
the moonlight evening of morose funeral.
