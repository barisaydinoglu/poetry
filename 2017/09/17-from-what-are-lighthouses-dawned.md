From What Are Lighthouses Dawned
--------------------------------
The clay cosmic alarms are invaded.  
Boundless, silken reflection!  
One of them is honest,  
the other knows projections.  
Where is nobody  
he says, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
My heart is filled with love like a diamond star.  
Has the land been created with funny things?  
Like the boneless broken glass of candles the phemonana knows this,  
that life in it's gold boxes is as endless as the bell.  
Wet me and let my substance breathe.  
Your pullulation is a friendship filled with fragmented vein.  
The lamprey treads on its frail mare  
blushing blue threads over the modern office.  
The directionless  
iguana swims inside the noble complaints.  
Because I love you, love, within the wind and in the lightning.
