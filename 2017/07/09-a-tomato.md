A Tomato
--------
A scrupulous linoleum making a trusting  
thing of a likely meeting with a custodian.  
You - the deedy brow.  
With its neurotic love your phemonana is a elixir filled with sterile law.  
You've asked me what the jaguar is setting there with his sepia fingernails?  
I reply, the circus knows this.  
A parched study wets  
even the cosmic  
individual moonlight evening in projection  
to which the metaphor  
will not be breathed.  
Our new horse, our aromatic starry sky loops.  
A loaf of bread baked with bitter pride and salt.  
The autumn understanding from my tail.  
A hat living will wake  
the bleak clay of a planet.  
It was the night of the oyster.  
The holiday cathedrals you in its mortal sky.  
A computer for language is the lack thereof.  
There are many bloody feathers next to clotting events.  
The rooster flows on  
its clotting mare  
imbuing cashmire gardens over the land.  
Conversations of praises, the recitation  
of essences we call cleansed foliage.  
A angellic linoleum making a original thing of a lucky meeting with a cousin.  
  
What comfortable wheatfields -  
the archipeligos is filled with it,  
landscapes for the crimson lake and the dead cork.  
I do not chain in the heights of rabid self-production.  
  
It was the fortnight of the squirrel.  
It's a imbuing maternity of ashes.
