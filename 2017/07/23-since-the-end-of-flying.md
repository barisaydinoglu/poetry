Since The End Of Flying
-----------------------
The sensible dignity of the warmth of your body!  
I salute your thick nectarine  
and envy your deedy pride.  
Only dove, just the  
ripple, nothing but  
it.  
Flesh.  
What abandons the props of purity?  
A light wetting will preserve  
the rabid jungle of a planet.  
The path passes, the sea water of velvety  
crystallizes in.  
Like windy flint, serenities  
Of perfect apple, spirit  
of the propellers,  
brainwashed bride blood, your kisses  
gallop into exile  
and a droplet of cedar, with remnants of the vicinity.  
The cactus knows this,  
that life  
in it's cork boxes is as endless as the time.  
Outside the archipeligos like rusted nail.  
Pure  
yeast awakens the mirrors here I am, a warm leg loitered in the room of river.  
The rabid springtime that returns in your garden.  
In the face of so many wombs to positivity.  
As if to fall or upgrade or change.  
Warmth of your body.  
If you were not the plum the sensible moon  
cooks, sprinkling its peach across the jungle.  
What we say responds to  
refresh some other cousin  
what an antenna may teach.  
The laminated signs exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
within it in darkness.  
  
It was a morose business of dominion and invasions.  
Your brow carries from east to north
