Tonight I Can Appreciate
------------------------
Wave of wave of manes rolling down the sea.  
The somber dignity of the current!  
You tread in the region as in a monastic area.  
Amid the propeller of the boulevard where you sleep,  
a dream steals into computers.  
  
Inside the room like rusted nail.
