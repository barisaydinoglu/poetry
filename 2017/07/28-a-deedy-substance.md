A Deedy Substance
-----------------
Reconciling a vein  
relinquished in the fleeting clouds.  
In the face of so many acids to functionality.  
The pioneer smiles at the pioneer  
but the lady does not smile  
when he looks at the oyster son  
and the blood-stained ocean.  
Against the rambunctious university of listless landscape.  
One of them is sweet-smelling,  
the other knows machines.  
Where is everybody  
she cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
In my thicket at sunset you are like a silicon architecture  
And your form and colour the way I kiss them.  
Of a ultraviolet lady that circumscribes flowers.  
My pure shoulder wets you always.
