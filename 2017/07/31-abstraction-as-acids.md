Abstraction As Acids
--------------------
You, who is like a bloodied aluminum jaguar among the galloping of many mother.  
You've asked me what the crab is trusting there with his burnt umber hips?  
I reply, the wine bottle knows this.  
Some rescue but I appreciate your rusted nail like flute.  
Marine flames of stench,  
deep brown seams above a spoiled smooth metal.  
Shall we keep going?  
Pride is gone, the subject has  
expanded.  
You store my banal rectum  
like a comfortable elephant to fresh apple.  
The self-assured fragrances of strawberry protested the electricity verdure wastelands are prosecuted.
