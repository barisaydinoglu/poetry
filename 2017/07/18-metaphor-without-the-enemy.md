Metaphor Without The Enemy
--------------------------
A brow and a eyeballs  
seeking the chimney.  
Realized acerb lunar you - the fluidic eye.  
It wets like a magnolium among the kiss.  
For dew was rotten and morally neutral.  
Returning a promise  
performed in the hidden sun.  
Against the vicinity like sand.  
Like weak kiss, farms  
what seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.
