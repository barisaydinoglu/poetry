Tonight I Can Build
-------------------
Which is a smooth laminated sign of directions  
million or twenty-seven, stored  
on a energy or in the lovely faucet  
directions of the brain, a calculation in your hearts. Some develop but I fly your sand like tiger.  
You are the exiled sailor of a cat,  
the guilt ness of the film, the power of the sky.  
  
Where homes meet  
spheres meet, behind and with and the sound  
of howls, to reach out and create in sorrow.  
Pockets of metal converted into marble.
