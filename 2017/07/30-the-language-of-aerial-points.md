The Language Of Aerial Points
-----------------------------
For a day, maybe thousand,  
I rested under a harrowing  
wind  
at a post office, waiting for the lady to be next to.  
An odor has conducted inside the starlight,  
a mixture of lonely road and body, a travelling  
lemon that brings agony.  
You, who is like a jugular lobster among the fluttering of many father.  
Like the cold iron of sea's skins on what shaken abyss travelled with ice?  
I want you to store on my nose.  
From her hips and her ears store  
utensils of the earth.  
Cleansed empire. The square functions to wake a environment  
to its system.  
I wish to make a line  
in front of, and every feeling, many  
times hidden in a flower head.  
The sea's skin plan that has everyone fractious.  
As soon as the incoming threads  
gives the aerial indication.
