Since The Beginning Of Drinking
-------------------------------
Because I love you, love, in front of the ice and inside the clay. A current of self-assured acrobat  
that does not know why it flows and attracts. It's a playing sweetnes of bloody feathers.  
We open the halves of a secrets and the  
devouring of gates flutters into the natural sea.
