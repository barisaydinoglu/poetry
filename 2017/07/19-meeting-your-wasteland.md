Meeting Your Wasteland
----------------------
A sun of bells around the universe I like to conduct like a lashed kis.  
Once there was a dead child who  
relaxed at parties, sitting in a circle, among sun rises.  
Conversations of forests, the recitation  
of prizes we call original bell.  
One of them is natural,  
the other knows projections.  
Where is nobody  
she says, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
But the ribbon entertained the memory.  
A rust colored and harsh precision is silenced in the sea.  
  
Rustling weather, absurd lights like the shades of yellow.  
Where rituals meet  
stalkss of cattail meet, around and inside and the sound  
of beasts, to reach out and pacify in sorrow.
