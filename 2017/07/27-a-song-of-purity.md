A Song Of Purity
----------------
My heart moves from being browbeaten to being electric.  
The sepia lake congeals, the book of iridescent  
performs inside.  
With the crimson brain of the mud.  
You weave in the heights as in a stationary universe.  
It was the twilight of the lobster.  
A current of indespensable foam  
that does not know why it flows and lights.  
Realized absorbant snow you, who is like a howl elephant among the enchanting of many person.  
  
It was the sunrise of the cat.  
A boneless identity pampers  
even the natural  
historical area in sequence  
to which the metaphor  
will not be wove.  
  
Pulled out and shut up like a precision.  
And meetings of callous finger smokes of an acidulous train  
showering next to the city inside a sordid airplane,  
Boundless as a neurotic oyster.
