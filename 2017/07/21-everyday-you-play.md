Everyday You Play
-----------------
Halfway. I took on absurd moons.  
Of humble plum, spirit  
of the aspens,  
shook giant blood, your kisses  
relinquish into exile  
and a droplet of silicon, with remnants of the thicket.  
  
I'd do it for the springtime in which you love  
for the hearts of green you've pacified.
