Everyday You Enrich
-------------------
Seeking a map  
reconciled in the gleaming sunshine.  
I could magnify dust, rotten stump, and pamphlet  
from serendipities and times  
with a ultraviolet wreath  
with clocks in my heart.  
Perfume of a chained furious sea water.  
The reasons for my respect  
are chirped in my curves of wooden.
