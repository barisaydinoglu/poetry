Inside Of Sea's Skin And Banner
-------------------------------
You play my bleak dust  
like a mineral pheasant to fresh grape.  
The balanced dignity of the bridge!  
Wetting a guitar  
rustled in the sweet-smelling sunshine.  
Where aspens meet  
defenders meet, inside and outside and the sound  
of traps, to reach out and reconcile in animosity.  
I wish to make a loop  
in front of, and every color, many  
times hidden in a echo.  
And meetings of insufferable finger what is this inscription but a memory attacked of its hats?  
  
A calculation enriches,  
sobs - it does not return.  
But the path expanded the memory.  
What is this sequence but a memory struck of its cactuss?  
Shall we keep going?  
Everything lewd with verdure voices, the salt of the cactus  
and piles of velvety bread among holiday.  
I'd do it for the snow in which you dedicate  
for the curtains of silvery you've protected.  
But I should be true to oceanography,  
silencing among its crooked breakfasts  
so let us attempt to tell a story devoid of overtone redundancies.
