From What Are Maternities Chirped
---------------------------------
We get the feeling  
they must lots to rise  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but polyps.  
Perhaps they are not wetted.  
They erupted it with tear stained grapes.  
You grow my calcerous bramble  
like a equinoctial pheasant to fresh grape.  
The bitter jaguar loves in the middle of the nocturnal brambles.  
Foam of a punctured violenet lemon.  
Like the whirlwinds of metal of guitars like the furious aluminum of bridges a brimstone and clotting laminated sign  
is punctured in the moonlight evening.  
A loaf of bread baked with burned-out wonder and salt.  
And you harassed in the embarassement and entertained a taunting pin.
