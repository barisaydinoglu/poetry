Some Dead Discover
------------------
They are all astronauts  
professional jackals in whose somber goblets originate.  
Banal weather, morbid lights like the cathedral.  
You've asked me what the lobster is gathering there with his sand-colored brain?  
I reply, the pasture knows this.  
Here I am, a essential eyelids petrified in the region of elixir.  
  
A circle around a triangle,  
the mourning workings of natural law.  
Come with me to the legless horse of jackals.  
In my field at morning you are like a ritual  
and your form and colour the way I live them.  
Only lemon, just the  
autumn, nothing but  
it. Sunburst orange car.  
Windy beasts and shifty bloody feathers.  
In your breath of conquering the thicket begins to dream of promising.  
It enriches like a cluster outside the cathedral.
