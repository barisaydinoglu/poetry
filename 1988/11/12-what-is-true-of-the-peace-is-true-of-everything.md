What Is True Of The Peace Is True Of Everything
-----------------------------------------------
You hear my disordered howl  
like a musical iguana to fresh plum.  
A brain and a toe  
seeking the city.  
It's a rejoicing coat of depths.  
I'd do it for the root in which you trust  
for the elixirs of marine you've circumscribed.  
Nothing but that productivity of wells.  
You are the fuming goddess of a oyster,  
the arrogant ness of the vein, the power of the ice.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
upgrade of dews and trousers  
and the plumed dews of his native land?
