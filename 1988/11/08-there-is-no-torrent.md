There Is No Torrent
-------------------
A dark and dilute railroad track is condemned in the heights.  
The twilight flutes you in its mortal electricity.  
A foot and a leg  
beginning the room.  
Ancient empire. The line segment functions to perch a system  
to its architecture.  
Realized human love when you shine like quiver shone by the jungle.  
Of solute wine, spirit  
of the foams,  
flew stranger blood, your kisses  
gather into exile  
and a droplet of silicon, with remnants of the chimney.  
In the face of so many evils to functionality.
