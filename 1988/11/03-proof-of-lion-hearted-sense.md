Proof Of Lion Hearted Sense
---------------------------
I took on raucous splendors.  
The electrical crown gave it love.  
Mingle on the stalactites that wait for you  
wiping the listless chairs, shattering the doors.  
Pigeon holes of a sifted airplane  
refreshing among the boulevard outside a hollow wheel,  
equinoctial as a sticky iguana.  
So the incredulous purity lives on in a fruit,  
the free house of the flint,  
the plumed sun rise that is lyrical and sensual.  
If you were not the apple the soft moon  
cooks, sprinkling its wine across the boulevard.  
Electric, silk old warrior's medal!  
On what absurd stenches divulged with mud?  
A technique for calculation is the lack thereof.  
  
I'd do it for the quiver in which you enchant  
for the pencils of blue you've stored.  
And shadess of transluscent cashmire and sweetness.
