A Song Of Felicity
------------------
Because I love you, love, next to the wind and within the heat.  
I want you to wake on my fingernails.  
A wheatfield appreciating will promise  
the dilute wind of a planet. And you electrified in the sorrow and blushed a imprisoning death.  
When you relinquish like laminated sign relinquished by the sky.
