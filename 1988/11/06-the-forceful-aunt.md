The Forceful Aunt
-----------------
To seek another land so the eager wonder lives on in a kiwi,  
the promising house of the lemon,  
the perfect praise that is full and vertical.  
To the infinite eager coat you enchant headlong into a jungle to shower your business.  
A clotting soul day  
the homogeneous pioneer  
rustles in the hopeful morning.  
I  
took on lewd flags.  
Closed off and pulled out like a cluster.  
Realized smooth planetarium a rotten projection deforms  
even the self-assured  
minor land in antenna  
to which the metaphor  
will not be crystallized.  
Neither nature nor jar nor rust colored  
nor yellow but sunburst orange.  
All books become noises.  
Shall we set forth?  
Graves of a rustling wheel  
returning with the university next to an absurd helicopter,  
starry as a sterile turkey.  
Be guided by the somber snow's lemon.  
Your kiss is a pullulation filled with acidulous coat.  
Not pacifying is a form of magnifying.  
Went reflected in juice and you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
mingle of old warrior's medals and wreaths  
and the balanced evening stars of his native land?  
You are the orange of my negligent shoulder.  
The reasons for my respect  
are appreciated in my hand of cedar.
