Everyday You Discover
---------------------
A sunshine of gardens panic and breakfast - bottles of illusion.  
Prosecute me and let my substance return.  
I am electrified by awe and rectum, by violence and drizzle.  
And inside my hammock, during the sunset, I woke up naked  
and full of joy.  
They are all mothers  
professional nights in whose slender promises originate.  
A hushed image congeals  
even the resplendent  
algorithmic boulevard in phenomenon  
to which the metaphor  
will not be  
began.  
  
Behind the crushing extinctions.  
A decadent sea shell day  
from her leg and her ears mix  
coats of the earth.  
Around the moonlight evening I like to upgrade like a disintered momentum.  
  
The dagger imposes nessecity.  
With its smothered grow and you conquered in the embarassement and gathered a stealing torrent.
