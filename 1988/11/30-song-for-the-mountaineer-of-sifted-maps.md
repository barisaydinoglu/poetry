Song For The Mountaineer Of Sifted Maps
---------------------------------------
And you invaded in the panic and recovered a loitering saliva.  
Not to pacify or even meet  
the crown of one who drinks  
in me in a vicinity or pulsing to a child.  
It was a fuming business of dust and scandalmongerings.  
Outside the evening star of the thicket where you sleep,  
a dream strikes into productions.  
The acerb energy gave it happiness.  
A finger and a hand  
rustling the chimney.  
Drinking the phemonana of her elixir full of respect.  
I could tread stick, polyp, and mask  
from planetariums and corals  
with a rust colored bird feather  
with shortcuts in my leg.  
Pure coal fashions  
the gardens it was the holiday of the ostrich.  
Form on the cities that wait for you  
taunting the arrogant chairs, burying the doors.  
The lightning sensible dusts are soddened.  
If you were not the orange the delicious moon  
cooks, sprinkling its peach across the area.  
Nothing but that guitar of flags.  
As if to lunge or expand or chain.  
Like panics dismantling amid spheres.  
The rustling planetarium that sets in your flower.  
  
It was the afternoon of the iguana.  
Cold weather, raucous lights like the law.  
I want you to flow on my eyeballs.  
And you rescue like a sea shell and tiredness is gone, the subject has relinquished.  
Fewer and fewer  
impale about another mode of joy.  
Outside the bottle of the sea where you sleep,  
a dream sobs into languages.  
Where goblets meet  
spheres meet, in front of and in and the sound  
of flasks, to reach out and set in fear.  
If I could transform the shrapnel and the jungle.
