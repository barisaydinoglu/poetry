The Violenet Sailor Of The Archipeligos
---------------------------------------
Multitude of maps!  
In and out of the silvery the blue and the cashmire  
a momentum focuses its dream of a old ending, its beginning, the new beginning of the stone order -  
its sweet-smelling polyps.  
Where schools meet  
pastures meet, among and in and the sound  
of cold fires, to reach out and set in confusion.  
And you congealed in the panic and imbued a scratching consequence.  
Carry me onto your raft - the cherry of my hat -  
your curves rises from east to south  
your nose protects from  
south  
to east  
A red and chaotic bed is deformed in the field.  
The fluidic sea's skin gave it joy.  
Galloping a quiver  
played in the esoteric clouds.  
Enjoy the many bitten attempts to divulge  
the infinite wax.  
There is slender fortune in shining it.  
Draw from it the windy  
sequence of its own machine.  
Behind the thirsty archipeligos of forceful branch.  
In front of marine water and green rivers.  
In your ears of depriving the area begins to dream of dawning.  
The wind electrical holes are devoured.  
Inside the river of the land where you sleep,  
a dream undulates into projections.  
Not to build or even  
meet  
the law of one who enriches  
in me in a heights or enchanting to a man.  
Always you gnaw through the holiday  
toward the late afternoon smothering shadess of cashmire.  
  
I am prosecuted by current and flame, by juice and drizzle.  
A nauesous calculation deprives  
even the wide  
aerial region in phenomenon  
to which the metaphor  
will not be stood.  
  
Promise on the lonely roads that wait for you  
faltering the banal chairs, brainwashing the doors.  
Animosity and essence - railroad tracks of fear.  
  
Behind the tremulous kis, many burned-out granules.
