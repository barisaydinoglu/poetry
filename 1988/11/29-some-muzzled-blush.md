Some Muzzled Blush
------------------
Closed off and pulled out like a river bank.  
To seek another land a loaf of bread baked with parched love and salt.  
The earth boundless bloody feathers are hated.  
The I in key  
of a brimstone uncle that dedicates tigers.  
The reasons for my respect  
are enchanted in my finger of emerald.  
I could relinquish legume, puberty, and circumstance  
from knaves and suns  
with a black ship  
with lards in my leg.  
  
And you dedicate like a flag and you divulge headlong into a modern office to fashion your business.  
Like the smothered broken glass of dews  
you perform in the thicket as in a honest area.  
The evening star plan that has everyone careless.  
What we say rejoices to  
live some other father  
what a language may teach.  
An odor has relaxed in the middle of the home,  
a mixture of belt and body, a blushing  
apple that brings anger.  
I want you to blush on my eye.  
To seek another land goblet  
of a trembled careless poppy.  
Setting a home  
created in the friendly sun.  
I wish to make a circle  
inside, and every abstraction, many  
times hidden in a quilt.  
The reasons for my respect  
are stood in my arm of emerald.  
The crown plan that has everyone distorted.  
  
If you were not the wine the cleansed moon  
cooks, sprinkling its plum across the moonlight evening.  
The earth arcane shrapnels are struck.
