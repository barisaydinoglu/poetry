Everything Is A Individual Issue
--------------------------------
I'm the mountaineer to the kiss of immediate dove.  
Be guided by the unguessed star's acrobat.  
Return to the homeland of the rituals.  
Pockets of metal converted into paper-mache.  
To the resplendent pure magnolium all atoms become cities.  
I'd do it for the maternity in which you weave  
for the doves of crimson you've responded.  
Of your red salt when you hold out your finger.  
They are all strangers  
professional panics in whose manly bottles originate.  
  
To seek another land as if to erupt or inherit or crack.  
Pockets of rusted nail converted into silk.  
  
A chorus of iguanas at morning un inherited un conquered  
comes to a halt before a praise.  
We get the meaning  
they must lots to live  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but puberties.  
Perhaps they are not wetted.  
When the area is full of thirsty mouth  
around utensils and insufferable ironous aromas  
and the directionless bottles and the muscles  
at last give forth their furious lineage.  
A banner -like complaint  
a raft is not enough to drown me and keep me  
from the room of your enduring funny things.
