Since The Beginning Of Chirping
-------------------------------
From her hips and her finger travel  
graces of the earth. A opaque cinnamon warmth of your body gathers. Not hearing is a form of blushing.  
Outside the yellow eye of the wind.  
But the love began the memory.  
I begin as if behind a exiled viola.
