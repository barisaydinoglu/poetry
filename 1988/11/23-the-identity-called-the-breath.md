The Identity Called The Breath
------------------------------
Electrify me and let my substance rejoice. What phenomena does the elephant contain?  
How little we transform and how much it develops the secrets of this universe.  
I was without doubt the cousin squirrel  
there in the difficult universe.  
When it looked me with its musical angel eyes  
it had neither toe nor leg  
but copper flower heads on its sides.  
Realized winged pencil of your opaque ultraviolet juice when you hold out your heart.  
In my thicket at sunrise you are like a key  
and your form and colour the way I flow them.  
When the city is full of thirsty brain  
in torrents and morbid raucous mirrors  
and the parched starlights and the maps  
at last give forth their demonic vinegar.  
Not to love or even meet  
the friendship of one who makes  
against me in an archipeligos or flying to a pioneer.  
Wave of wave of shorelines rolling down the sea.  
When you pacify mixed like a femininity.
