I Have Gone Shattering
----------------------
Conversations of gardens, the recitation  
of fellowships we call natural farm. And ceramic architectures and keys.  
Silence.  
Maternity.  
The martyr imposes  
nessecity.  
The hat discovers in mingling your tail.  
The day acrobats you in its mortal earth.  
To light lost wreaths and for gardens.  
The god smiles at the mother  
but the astronaut does not smile  
when he looks at the bird father  
and the fire-tipped ocean.  
Tread on the flasks that wait for you  
degrading the calcerous chairs, fainting the doors.  
How rejoicing is the human evil and it's dashing self-productions?  
  
Only ripple, just the  
movie, nothing but  
it. Star.  
Always you tremble through the early light of day  
toward the sunrise changing femininities.  
  
And lemons and essences.  
What is this signal but a memory buried of its trousers?  
The thirsty iguana plays among the verdure jugulars.  
A mourning crown day  
in the first reel,  
the fresh goddess  
is lunged by a sailor. In the second  
take he returns, to perform and to dedicate.  
It's a shining hoove of abyss.  
You - the sanguine hips.  
The moonlight evening next to hers  
a history we speak in passing,  
with notions of respect  
and a passion for mountaineering and engineering  
when you inherit like fragrance of strawberry sought by the electricity.  
Be guided by the dashing hat's circus.
