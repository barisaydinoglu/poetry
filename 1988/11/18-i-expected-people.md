I Expected People
-----------------
One grammatic option and not to shower or even meet  
the maternity of one who dedicates  
under me in an area or blushing to a man.  
For a day, maybe too many to count,  
I rested under a uncomfortable turbulence  
at a post office, waiting for the elder to be outside.  
Wave of wave of schools rolling down the sea.  
But the cathedral rose the memory.  
Because I love you, love, in the mud and behind the sky.  
You - the delicate brain.  
It was a smothered business of granule and alarms.
