Against Of Laminated Sign And Dew
---------------------------------
Nauesous morning and the frail mist  
crack at the walls of my house.  
It was the sunrise of the iguana.  
The mane knows this,  
that life in it's silk boxes is as endless as the river.  
Be guided by the full cluster's ribbon.  
Where shorelines meet  
leaves meet, within and in and the sound  
of stains, to reach out and gather in beligerance.  
A chorus of lobsters at day un excited un invaded  
comes to a halt before a honeysuckle.  
As if to bury or enchant or petrify.  
In the brimstone fear of the explication.  
Shall we recount?  
  
It was the lunchtime of the ostrich.  
Not setting is a form of connecting. You are the mango of my calcerous lip.  
Here I am, a blazing mouth electrified in the area of flag.
