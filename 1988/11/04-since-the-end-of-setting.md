Since The End Of Setting
------------------------
In the boulevard like broken glass.  
And the angel to its eddy  
and  
among the splendors  
the essential one  
the aunt covered with velvety juice.  
Realized acerb goblet the child smiles at the goddess  
but the person does not smile  
when he looks at the oyster custodian  
and the hated ocean.  
Of a gray uncle that drinks sea water.  
When the chimney is full of wounded finger  
next to bloody feathers and inaccessible mourning evening stars  
and the bitterest horses and the schools  
at last give forth their inaccessible noise.  
My starry toe performs you always.  
As if to loathe or gather or lunge.  
  
If you were not the nectarine the gleaming moon  
cooks, sprinkling its plum across the universe.  
Steady empire. The loop functions to respond a environment  
to its system.  
The silences exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
next to it in darkness.  
Here I am, a myriad arm deceived in the city of lunar.
