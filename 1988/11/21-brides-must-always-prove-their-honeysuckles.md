Brides Must Always Prove Their Honeysuckles
-------------------------------------------
A bird feather focuses its dream of a new beginning, its beginning, the new ending of the cactus order -  
its winged pigeon holes.  
You've asked me what the toucan is showering there with his transluscent sepia eyelids?  
I reply,  
the productivity knows this.  
Freeze me and let my substance refresh.  
What we say divulges to  
flutter some other child  
what a camera may teach.
