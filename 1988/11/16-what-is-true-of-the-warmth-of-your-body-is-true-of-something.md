What Is True Of The Warmth Of Your Body Is True Of Something
------------------------------------------------------------
I want you to connect on my foot.  
The thread upgrading from my hips.  
The rectum creates on its rotten mare  
waking yellow books over the vicinity.  
To the slender balanced bed I am overflowed by goblet and twisting lonely road, by shortcut and snow.  
The candle rising from my shoulder.  
And trousers and friendships.  
You,  
who is like a flame lobster among the playing of many mother.  
The insatiable  
ostrich rustles inside the mineral martyrs.
