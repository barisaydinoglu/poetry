Setting The Light In Motion
---------------------------
I'd do it for the atom in which you swim  
for the planetariums of marine you've conducted.  
Cousin of the depths of my breath - your loving  
stills your plumed regard as though it were ice.  
On what neon shortcuts seized with electricity?  
I stayed continued and blue  
under the sea.  
It's a rising wreath of coffins.  
I stayed trod and green  
inside the sea.  
  
Realized blazing bell with its decadent preserve divulging  
toward the lunar I'm the woman to the film of immediate law.
