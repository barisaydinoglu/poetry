The Beligerance Of The Technical Narrative
------------------------------------------
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
circumscribe of telegraphs and hearts  
and the brandishing roots of his native land?  
Silvery fire to my shady sunburst orange lake!  
What we say promises to  
mix some other lady  
what a technique may teach.  
Carry me onto your airplane - the lemon of my breakfast -  
  
I salute your vertical grape  
and envy your monastic pride.  
Has the field been dedicated with epiphany?  
A current of friendly prize  
that does not know why it flows and grows.  
I wake as if in front of a barbaous cadaver.  
Somebody here is waiting for the next forest.  
Map. You recovered yourself for perfuming.  
There are no thorn trees but dilute cycles of laminated sign and transluscent sunburst orange  
wells of naked lethargic sand.  
  
Sometimes a piece of the sky  
disguises like a planetarium in my hand.  
Your foot pulses from west to south
