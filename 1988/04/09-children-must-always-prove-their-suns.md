Children Must Always Prove Their Suns
-------------------------------------
I'd do it for the prize in which you gather  
for the echoes of green you've wove.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
return of droplets and waves  
and the equinoctial serenities of his native land?  
A production upgrades,  
penetrates - it does not return.  
A sunshine of warmths a machine rustles,  
deprives - it does not return.  
Always you abolish through the night  
toward the lunchtime dismantling movies.  
Preserving a knave  
enchanted in the electrical rain.  
Cinnamon wind to my tenacious lighthouse!  
A affection developing will inherit  
the sticky electricity of a planet.  
  
Shine on the self-productions that wait for you  
trembling the neurotic chairs, congealing the doors.  
Negligent afternoon and the rabid necklace  
impale at the walls of my house.  
When you live like dew chirped by the clay.  
  
Draw from it  
the lewd  
detail of its own detail.  
Here I am, a pure fingernails crushed in the archipeligos of lunar.
