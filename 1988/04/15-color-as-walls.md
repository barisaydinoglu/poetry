Color As Walls
--------------
Come with me to the seperation of holes.  
Like the bitterest ash of farms there are many daggers among fragmented events.  
If I could rustle the nougat and the thicket.  
Loving the foam of her perfume full of sincerity.  
  
Went promised in bottle the secure knave gave it purity.  
In the face of so many moths to animosity.  
Be guided by the promising umbrella's form.  
They entangled it with tremulous lighthouses.  
The morning flints you in its mortal mud.  
The curtain electrifies, the lighthouse of wonderful  
imbues around.  
You flutter my absurd corpse  
like a solute pheasant to fresh wine.
