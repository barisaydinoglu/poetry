An Equally Absent Minded God
----------------------------
I was without doubt the fisherman squirrel  
there in the fractious region.  
When it looked me with its solute soul eyes  
it had neither fingernails nor shoulder  
but diamond cactuss on its sides.  
In front of the opaque gray anger of the wound.  
Morose morning and the thirsty tiger  
devour at the walls of my house.  
The reasons for my respect  
are stored in my leg of crystal.  
It breathes like a railroad track outside the horse.  
In the face of so many vigils to functionality.
