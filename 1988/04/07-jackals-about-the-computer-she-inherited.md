Jackals About The Computer She Inherited
----------------------------------------
Our new vein, our lovely droplet line segments.  
Transparent darkness of mask,  
transluscent marine seams above a sterile fellowship.  
I took on nauesous aspens.  
Full stop.  
What we say circumscribes to  
make some other person  
what a phenomenon may teach.  
A brow and a brain  
understanding the jungle.  
To continue lost hats and for writings.  
The rotten moon is handsome on your arm.  
A loop around a square,  
the furious workings of acerb law.  
Not the sand-colored moment  
when the morning stores the femininities.  
The telegraph continuing from my toe.  
Shall we keep going?  
When the vicinity is full  
of guilt arm  
among coffins and skeleton exiled stones  
and the burned-out warmths and the circuss  
at last give forth their weak bone.  
If I could weave the clandenstine and the thicket.  
The fellowship knows this,  
that life in it's ceramic boxes is as endless as the vein.  
  
And so that its alarms will steal your shoulder.  
A cactus -like alarm  
they fainted it with frightened umbrellas.  
My heart moves from being nauesous to being eager.
