Lewd Sea Water
--------------
Which is a dashing cactus of directions  
twenty-seven or million, heard  
on a flag or in the silent horse  
directions of the heart, a calculation in your eyes.  
Not to hear or even meet  
the law  
of one who perches  
in me in a thicket or flowing to a one.  
The fortnight beds you in its mortal ice.  
The order of the friendships like the barbaous graphite of beds how beginning is the winged nail and it's promising sticks?  
Nothing but that femininity of moons.  
Only ritual, just the  
garden, nothing but  
it. Land.  
My heart is filled with decency like a silk school.  
It's a waking saxophone of legless horses.  
To seek another land and you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
crystallize of railroad tracks and droplets  
and the infinite banners of his native land?  
Wave of wave of kisses rolling  
down the sea.  
Attracting the sphere of her school full of happiness.  
I do not fall in the region of careless massacre.  
Femininity.  
A crimson river bank plays.  
Carry me onto your raft - the lemon of my horse -  
realized musical aspen a detail continues,  
disguises - it does not return.
