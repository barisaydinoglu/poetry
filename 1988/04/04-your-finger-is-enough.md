Your Finger Is Enough
---------------------
Ashes of a difficult boat  
pulsing in front of the region next to a torrential boat,  
warm as a dead cat.  
A line next to a triangle,  
the shifty workings of nocturnal law.  
Fragmented jugulars and explosive stalactites.  
I salute your steady nectarine  
and envy your electrical pride.  
  
The clay sanguine circumstances are bristled.
