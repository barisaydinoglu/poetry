There Is No Billows Of Blood Colored Smoke
------------------------------------------
A tenacious identity lunges  
even the stationary  
alphabetic modern office in projection  
to which the metaphor  
will not be awakened.  
I'd do it for the reflection in which you make  
for the flower heads of marine you've protected.  
Of a turqoise elder that continues forms.  
An odor has understood among the current,  
a mixture of cold fire and body, a hearing  
sun rise that brings panic.  
My heart is filled with tiredness like a crystal splendor.  
I'm the daughter to the knave of immediate autumn.  
A quadrangle among a triangle,  
the sifted workings of sensible law.
