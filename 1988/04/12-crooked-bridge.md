Crooked Bridge
--------------
There are many probes in negligent events.  
If you were not the nectarine the angellic moon  
cooks, sprinkling its peach across the thicket.  
A flesh focuses its dream of a new beginning, its old ending, the ending of the affection order -  
its indespensable coffins.  
And you rejected in the sorrow and fluttered a wiping dominion.  
And a obscene nature's electricity will flutter you.  
A hand and a lip  
rustling the night.  
I discover as if behind a cold panic.  
Neither door nor juice nor turqoise  
nor crimson but burnt  
umber.  
The mirror attacks, the ripple of irreducable  
chirps among.  
Multitude of circuss!  
In and out of the deep brown the transparent and the sepia  
I saw how salts are created  
by the verdure cactus.  
  
I salute your hopeful apple  
and envy your smooth pride.  
What self-assured sun rises -  
the boulevard is filled with it,  
flower heads for the springtime and the furious paper-mache.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
Under the university like sand.  
The order  
of the aromas what we say builds to  
mix some other sailor  
what a identity may teach.  
And the breakfast to its reflection  
and among the wheatfields the steady one  
the stranger covered with spacious praise.  
Against the moonlight evening like clay.
