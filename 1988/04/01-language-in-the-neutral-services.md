In the first reel, the angellic custodian  
is impaled by a goddess. In the second  
reel he returns, to trust and to tread.  
We get the color  
they must lots to begin  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but stenches.  
Perhaps they are not drowned.  
And the flower head to its quiver  
and among the perfumes the original one  
the goddess covered with indespensable prize.  
The one smiles at the goddess  
but the goddess does not smile  
when he looks at the squirrel giant  
and the browbeaten ocean.  
I stayed travelled and cashmire  
under the night.  
Draw from it the shaken  
detail of its own study.  
You've asked me what the crab is rising there with his silvery eye?  
I reply, the heart knows this.
