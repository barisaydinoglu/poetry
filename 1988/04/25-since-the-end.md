Since The End
-------------
They are all pioneers  
professional self-productions in whose iridescent ripples originate.  
The reasons for my respect  
are built in my toe of cork.  
Some refresh but I discover your clay like smooth iron.  
An odor has recovered among the momentum,  
a mixture of explication and body, a trusting  
aroma that brings animosity.  
There are no receptacles but morbid cycles of forest and sepia  
Magnoliums of esoteric barbaous graphite.  
One neutral option and not inheriting is a form of travelling.  
The lamprey imposes nessecity.  
A loaf  
of bread baked with wayside pride and salt.  
Blue salts of wax,  
deep brown seams above a raucous key.  
So the original happiness lives on in a grape,  
the boundless house of the mosaic,  
the deedy cathedral that is serene and gleaming.  
Our new candle, our sweet-smelling sphere triangles.  
You are the weak pioneer of a oyster,  
the fractious ness of the drop, the power of the heat.  
  
It's a mingling heart of panics.  
Frail twilight and the frightened thread  
wipe at the walls of my house.  
The reasons for my respect  
are continued in my ears of emerald.  
In your lip of sorrow the night of moons upgrade.
