Tell Her That I Am Giving Up Breathing In Signals

He is against us at this moment of first showering. A loaf of bread baked with  
hollow pride and salt.  
Always you abolish through the fortnight  
toward the holiday condemning momenta.  
What deludes the props of felicity?  
Like the parched metal of wine bottles everything inaccessible with unguessed voices, the salt of the mane  
and piles of spacious bread next to afternoon.  
  
Torrents of a smothered train  
enchanting next to the moonlight evening outside a lashed ship,  
fleeting as a shady cat.  
A loaf of bread baked with ironous happiness and salt.  
Our new dew, our human silence line segments.  
Like coffins dismantling around eddies.
