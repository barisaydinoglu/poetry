Overtone Phenomena Are All Inside Us
------------------------------------
Like rotten stumps smearing inside lighthouses. Like serections faltering amid sun rises.  
Fewer and fewer  
drop about another mode of joy.  
A changeless mist of aspens.  
Nothing but that elixir of faucets.  
My heart moves from being exiled to being thick.  
When you imbue like stone excited by the mud.  
  
Opaque opaque burnt umber and promising woman,  
my winged leg pacifies you always.  
  
Pockets of ash converted into wooden.  
Waxes of a hollow vessel  
discovering inside the jungle outside a chaotic vessel,  
slender as a troubled iguana.
