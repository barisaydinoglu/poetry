The Funny Things Of The Sea
---------------------------
Brings all the devours maternities. Only dew, just the  
branch, nothing but  
it. Hoove. The thread magnifying from my breath.  
Evening star of a entangled chaotic lunar.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
He is in the middle of us at this moment of first chirping.  
The lightning naked vagabonds are taunted.  
Here I am, a naked lip lunged  
in the sea of defender.  
  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
wet of trysts and leaves  
and the domestic natures of his native land?  
With the deep brown brain of the jungle.
