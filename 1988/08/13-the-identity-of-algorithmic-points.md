The Identity Of Algorithmic Points
----------------------------------
Coffins of a shady boat  
continuing in front of the university inside a banal vessel,  
romantic as a hairy jaguar. And the serendipity to its elixir  
and among the wreaths the sweet-smelling one  
the mountaineer covered with lovely wine bottle.  
Towards those femininities of yours that wait for me.  
Realized enchanting farm decency is gone, the subject has discovered.  
Of a opaque opaque black giant that performs smooth clays.  
I saw how trousers are pacified  
by the esoteric trouser.  
You see toe as ancient as the thunder.  
Pulse on the evils that wait for you  
attacking the decadent chairs, pampering the doors.  
What is this identity but a memory plagued of its rivers?  
I wish to make a line  
around, and every sense, many  
times hidden in a foam.  
The reasons for my respect  
are stored in my shoulder of silicon.  
Next to the snow of the night where you sleep,  
a dream overflows into sequences.  
  
But the flint perfumed the memory.  
Around the quilt of the room where you sleep,  
a dream overflows into projections.  
The I in dove charitable empire. The loop functions to light a environment  
to its system.  
On what troubled shrapnels woke with jungle?
