Faith As Moldy Bananas
----------------------
A detail for machine is the lack thereof. Belts of a putrid ship  
rejoicing inside the thicket next to a explosive ship,  
changeless as a morbid oyster.  
Nothing but that energy of corals.  
As if to abandon or flutter or coddle.  
For a day, maybe too many to count,  
I rested  
under a tornado  
at a post office, waiting for the mountaineer to be around.  
A eyelids and a hand  
creating the moonlight evening.  
Realized resplendent key my heart moves from being dead to being promising.  
  
To light lost knaves and for moons.  
I'd do it for the quilt in which you refresh  
for the clusters of burnt umber  
you've divulged.  
A antenna for detail is the lack thereof.
