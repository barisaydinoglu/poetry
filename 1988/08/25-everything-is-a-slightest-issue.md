Everything Is A Slightest Issue
-------------------------------
I stayed responded and silvery  
in the middle of the boulevard. When the universe is full of rotten brow  
among ashes and frightened directionless cathedrals  
and the dry  
natures and the wheatfields  
at last give forth their sordid panic. I'd do it for the map in which you mix  
for the umbrellas of transluscent opaque silvery you've excited.  
A loaf of bread baked with lewd wonder and salt.  
And meetings of wet-winged curves your aroma is a sphere filled with sterile flower head.  
Treading toward the light this tremulous autumn and dawning path rejects me  
with it's clear lights like finger and shoulder  
and dull shades of cinnamon curtains like eyeballs and hooves.  
Pure complaint reconciles the sun rises an antenna returns,  
strikes - it does not return.  
How reconciling is the nocturnal moth and it's parenthetical lampreys?  
Not the marine moment  
when the midnight grows the guitars.
