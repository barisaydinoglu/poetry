There Is No Enemy
-----------------
The child smiles at the sailor  
but the god does not smile  
when he looks at the ostrich goddess  
and the molested ocean.  
I stayed seized and cashmire  
under the room.  
In your curves of passing the field begins to dream of showering.  
Has the chimney been mixed with secrets?  
  
Halfway.  
Not performing is a form of trusting.
