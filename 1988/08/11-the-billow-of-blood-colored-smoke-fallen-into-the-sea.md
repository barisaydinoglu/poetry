The Billow Of Blood Colored Smoke Fallen Into The Sea
-----------------------------------------------------
The jungle among hers  
a tale we speak in passing,  
with notions of tiredness  
and a passion for engineering and photography  
closed off and pulled out like a film.  
I took on fragmented mists.  
Multitude of lunars!  
In and out of the blue the marine and the opaque cashmire  
So the naked wonder lives on in a mango,  
the solute house of the umbrella,  
The electrical movie that is secure and moonlit.  
Congeal me and let my substance reflect.  
Not growing is a form of waking.
