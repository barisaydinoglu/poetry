Carrying Muzzled Nostalgia
--------------------------
A leg and a mouth  
protecting the sea.  
I salute your infinite plum  
and envy your serendipidous pride.  
On what worn-out beasts divulged with clay?  
What deludes the props of tiredness?  
A camera preserves,  
invades - it does not return.  
A brimstone and insatiable branch is degraded in the sea.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the decisive films?  
And the thunder monastic splattering its phemonanas and petrifying them full of  
land and jaguar?
