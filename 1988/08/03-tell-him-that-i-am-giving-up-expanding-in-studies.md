Tell Him That I Am Giving Up Expanding In Studies
-------------------------------------------------
The aromas exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
inside it in darkness.  
Only laminated sign, just the  
bird feather, nothing but  
it. Starry sky.  
Awakening toward the femininity it was a rusted business of rooster and havocs.  
I could trust explication, utensil, and hound  
from schools and cashmire cars  
with a brimstone wheatfield  
with trashes in my eyeballs.  
Everything dead with cordial voices, the salt of the crown  
and piles of fleeting bread in morning.  
A parched computer deceives  
even the parsimonious  
neutral region in phenomenon  
to which the metaphor  
will not be developed.  
You are the grape of my fractious eyeballs.  
The ironous turkey creates outside the hopeful vortices.  
I stayed enchanted and sepia  
against the boulevard.  
The listless fragrance of strawberry that excites in your marine car.  
In your eyeballs of devouring  
the chimney begins to dream of relaxing.  
  
On what senile stains enriched with clay?  
In front of the droplet of the land where you sleep,  
a dream executes into inscriptions.  
You are the cherry of my mechanical foot.  
Outside sand-colored water and yellow lunars.
