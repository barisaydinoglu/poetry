What Is True Of The Flower Head Is True Of Everything
-----------------------------------------------------
What loathes the props of love? What human windows -  
the archipeligos is filled with it,  
keys for the starlight and the mourning emerald.  
Carry me onto your airplane - the lemon of my ship -  
  
And so that its imbroglios will delude your eye.  
I stayed blushed and deep brown  
under the university.
