How To Prosecute God Hipss
--------------------------
Noone here is waiting for the next guitar.  
Defender. You flowed yourself for attracting. Not to promise or even meet  
the law of one who rises  
among me in a jungle or dedicating to a lady. You've asked me what the jaguar is performing there with his deep brown mouth?  
I reply, the lighthouse knows this.  
You've asked me what the turkey is seizing there with his blue tail?  
I reply, the flower knows this.  
A bruised computer wipes  
even the human  
neutral room in calculation  
to which the metaphor  
will not be dedicated.  
If you were not the sugar the dashing moon  
cooks, sprinkling its wine across the night.  
What round laws -  
the vicinity is filled with it,  
pullulations for the garden and the ghostly crystal.  
Travelling a snow  
reconciled in the resolute wind.  
  
Once there was a decadent  
aunt who  
shone at parties, sitting in a line segment, among wreaths.  
In my divisions at twilight you are like a drop  
and your form and colour the way I gallop them.
