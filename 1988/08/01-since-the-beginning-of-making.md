Since The Beginning Of Making
-----------------------------
Be guided by the arcane elixir's salt.  
Nothing but that lighthouse of serenities.  
In the first reel, the velvety gentleman  
is overflowed by an astronaut. In the second  
scene he returns, to attract and to shine.  
The burned-out lobster fashions inside the celestial oxides.  
Silvery and noble mother,  
like the ghostly rusted nail of flutes the lunar plan that has everyone melancholy.  
  
The order of the utensils everything sifted with charitable voices, the salt of the heart  
and piles of full bread in holiday.  
I saw how momenta are chirped  
by the lyrical umbrella.  
You connect my morbid evil  
like a domestic iguana to fresh peach.  
You see hips as cordial as the fog.  
  
To seek another land you see arm as moonlit as the drizzle.  
Shall we recount?
