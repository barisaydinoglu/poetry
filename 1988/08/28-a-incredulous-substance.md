A Incredulous Substance
-----------------------
Not to pulse or even meet  
the aspen of one who begins  
among me in a university or entertaining to a man.  
Connect on the bombs that wait for you  
plaguing the tenacious chairs, erupting the doors. And you decayed in the embarassement and returned a replacing extinction.  
The morbid snow is secure on your lip.  
Come with me to the clandenstine of twisting lonely roads.  
It's  
a setting fragrance of strawberry of moths.  
  
Gallop on the parallel ashess that wait for you  
ignoring the whirlwinds of chairs, mourning the doors.  
Like chaotic flower, keys  
a sunshine of stones full stop.  
Torrential sunset and the chaotic tryst  
freeze at the walls of my house.
