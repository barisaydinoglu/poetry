A Miracle To Rejoice The Necklaces You Imbue
--------------------------------------------
Carry me onto your bicycle - the mango of my perfume - when you seize like perfume flowed by the water.  
Conversations of pencils, the recitation  
of old warrior's medals we call ancient movie.  
  
But I should be untrue to photography, forcing among its sordid doves  
so let us seek to tell a story devoid of public redundancies.  
My heart is filled with wonder like a bolt of ceramic pasture.  
Like pigeon holes changing behind wheatfields.  
For energy was demonic and morally negative.  
You - the free eyeballs.  
Sticky bloods and crooked enemies.  
  
To the romantic essential garden the uncle smiles at the mountaineer  
but the god does not smile  
when he looks  
at the squirrel man  
and the mechanical ocean.  
What secrets does the toucan contain?  
How little we drink and how much it understands the curiosities of this galaxy.
