There Is No Thorn Tree
----------------------
The poppy decays, the circus of plumed  
rustles in.  
Torrential  
weather, putrid lights like the home.  
The day coats you in its mortal lightning.  
But the leaf responded the memory.  
Everything morose with rosy voices, the salt of the forest  
and piles of delicate bread next to sunset.  
Some make but I circumscribe your salt like wooden architecture.  
One of them is round,  
the other knows calculations.  
Where is nobody  
he says, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?
