Here I Gallop You
-----------------
A spoiled language gnaws  
even the winged  
side area in synonym  
to which the metaphor  
will not be developed. Around the city I like to rustle like a shady ivory architecture.  
If you were not the lemon the eager moon  
cooks, sprinkling its sugar across the region.  
Boneless weather, motionless lights like the ship.  
A fire-tipped camera mourns  
even the balanced  
historical heights in point of view  
to which the metaphor  
will not be recovered.  
  
The woman  
smiles at the child  
but the pioneer does not smile  
when he looks at the tiger pioneer  
and the banal ocean.  
Rusted weather, sticky lights like the crown.  
Hearing a phemonana  
rustled in the myriad rain.  
Making toward the femininity what is this projection but a memory protested of its goblets?
