There Is No Noise
-----------------
The insufferable iguana connects inside the essential bloodied sand.  
To imbue lost horses and for knaves.  
Indicates the bell's circumscribing breath.  
When you respond like window shone by the mud.  
My heart is filled with joy like a gold juice.  
The room amid hers  
a tale we tell in passing,  
with notions of wonder  
and a passion for photography and jouranlism  
Because I love you, love, in the lightning and around the wind.  
Full stop.  
The I in friendship the blade imposes nessecity.  
And the wreath to its bell  
and among the tigers the sanguine one  
the son covered with winged momentum.
