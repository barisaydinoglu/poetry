Fathers Of A Hated Country
--------------------------
Awakening from dead wooden.  
If I could understand the trash barge and the modern office.  
The night angels you in its mortal wind.  
He is inside us at this moment of first living.  
A boat is not enough to decay me and keep me  
from the vicinity of your domestic phenomena.
