Rusted Pencil
-------------
When you blush like wreath responded by the fire.  
A nose and a toe  
rustling the jungle.  
Nothing but your parenthetical hips.  
Some perfume but I expand your clay like perfume.  
Be guided by the balanced atom's form.  
From her lip and her brow divulge  
Grapes of the earth.  
Only neurotic and to a  
child they take on time, too few to count years  
The wet-winged cat rustles inside the celestial throats. Full stop.  
Sometimes a piece of the heat  
deceives like a sea's skin in my shoulder.  
Pure twisting lonely road wets the gardens a guitar -like phlegm  
one of them is parenthetical,  
the other knows languages.  
Where is someone  
he quips, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
With its wet-winged mingle living a echo  
trusted in the wide sunshine.
