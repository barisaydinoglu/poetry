A Song Of Happiness
-------------------
You build slowly into a moonlight evening to mingle your business.  
Rabid pigeon holes and insatiable dungs.  
Around the boulevard I like to appreciate like an absurd serenity.  
What phenomena does the bird contain?  
How little we re-cover and how much it rejoices the mysteries of this galaxy.  
I stayed sought and sand-colored  
in the middle of the land.  
I took on blood-stained rivers.  
Carry me onto your bicycle - the lemon of my heart -  
some pulse but I relinquish your sand like foam.  
  
The fragrances of strawberry exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
within it in darkness.  
You travel in the vicinity as in a steady modern office.  
Like the raucous salt of atoms I'd do it for the miracle in which you perform  
for the branches of opaque sepia you've refreshed.  
Laminated sign.
