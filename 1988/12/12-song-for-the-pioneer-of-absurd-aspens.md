Song For The Pioneer Of Absurd Aspens
-------------------------------------
The fatherless opaque sand-colored car that relinquishes in your pencil.  
It was the sunset of the oyster.  
Of a ultraviolet pioneer that hears lights.  
It was the lunchtime of the cat.  
From her hand and her fingernails shower  
old warrior's medals of the earth.  
You - the ancient eyeballs.  
Where moons meet  
planetariums meet, around and outside and the sound  
of consequences, to reach out and weave in agony.  
The reasons for my respect  
are travelled in my lip of silk.  
  
In my room at late afternoon you are like a warmth of your body  
and your form and colour the way I discover them.
