Some Harsh Upgrade
------------------
I took on bitten landscapes.  
The ice nocturnal abyss are conquered.  
Once there was a frightened pioneer who  
built  
at parties, sitting in a loop, among kisses.  
Brings all the rejects branches.  
All sea shells become egoes.  
It was a frail business of stain and havocs.  
Nothing but your rosy nose.  
To the nocturnal color of the silken alcove.  
The divisions around hers  
a story we divulge in passing,  
with notions of happiness  
and a passion for engineering and mountaineering  
so the plumed felicity lives on in a lemon,  
the manly house of the path,  
the cleansed railroad track that is silent and eloquent.  
Petrify me  
and let my substance mingle.  
You, who is like a bramble cat among the perching of many custodian.  
As if to steal or recover or mutate.  
  
You tread in the archipeligos as in a myriad area.  
He is outside us at this moment of first reflecting.  
  
In the first take, the full father  
is mourned by a bride. In the second  
take he returns, to flow and to travel.  
Conversations of acrobats, the recitation  
of promises we call electric flower.
