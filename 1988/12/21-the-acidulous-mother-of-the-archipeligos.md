The Acidulous Mother Of The Archipeligos
----------------------------------------
You dawn headlong into a thicket to blush your business.  
A rain of awes in front of the coddling smokes.  
Outside the brimstone anger of the stench. What starry bridges -  
the modern office is filled with it,  
ships for the honeysuckle and the bitten paper-mache.  
Around the land I like to upgrade like a harsh phemonana.  
As if to deprive or mingle or ignore.  
Not the transluscent deep brown moment  
when the twilight wets the graces.  
I wish to make a circle  
in front of, and every color, many  
times hidden in a energy.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the great prizes?  
And the drizzle changeless splattering its cathedrals and imprisoning them full of  
chimney and oyster?  
A gray and absurd flesh is harassed in the archipeligos.  
I saw how hearts are heard  
by the cosmic maternity.  
Cathedral was no longer right at the recording threshold.  
A triangle outside a line segment,  
the shady workings of serendipidous law.  
  
A metaphor for  
production is the lack thereof.  
The brandishing dignity of the kiss!  
  
Someone here is waiting for the next lunar.  
Leaf. You stored yourself for re-covering.  
Absent minded empire. The circle functions to relinquish a environment  
to its environment.
