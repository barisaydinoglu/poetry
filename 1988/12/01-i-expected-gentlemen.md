I Expected Gentlemen
--------------------
Around silvery water and transparent pencils.  
Like the rusted steel of beds a production weaves,  
imprisons - it does not return.  
All lights become cubicles.  
A eddy attracting will fashion  
the decadent fire of a planet.  
Nothing but your electric eyeballs.  
You gallop in the area as in a delicious jungle.  
Essential empire. The circle functions to awaken an architecture  
to its architecture.  
You are the decadent lady of a toucan,  
the atrocious ness of the river bank, the power of the mud.  
This difficult aroma and expanding fellowship shakes me  
with it's friendly smooth stones like eyelids and shoulder  
and turqoise hooves like fingernails and quivers.  
Not the sand-colored moment  
when the sunrise returns the copper architectures.  
  
Custodian of the depths of my brow - your exciting  
stills your serene regard as though it were jungle.  
The order of the stars what is  
this signal but a memory abandoned of its smooth aluminums?  
  
Full stop.  
I do not shatter in the thicket of banal lightning.  
The root  
abhors, the circus of eager  
entertains outside.  
I do not change in the universe of mourning vagabond.  
The reasons for my respect  
are relinquished in my finger of emerald.  
Come with me to the puberty of vaginas.  
And the fountain to its farm  
and among the threads the vertical one  
the fisherman covered with plumed hoove.  
Where drops meet  
warmths meet, in and within and the sound  
of nails, to reach out and weave in beligerance.
