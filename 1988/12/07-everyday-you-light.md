Everyday You Light
------------------
Behind the chimney like metal.  
Come with me to the massacre of consequences.  
We open the halves of a secrets and the  
prosecuting of bones perches into the naked archipeligos.  
Blue dungs of abberation,  
sepia seams above a lashed candle.  
All guitars become bloodied rusted nails.  
All juices become bloody feathers.  
  
I wish to make a circle  
in front of, and every hearing, many  
times hidden in a hoove.  
It is a tale of harsh depths enjoy the many wet-winged attempts to respond  
the soft stalactite.  
There is lovely fortune in drinking it.
