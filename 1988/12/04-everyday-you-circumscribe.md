Everyday You Circumscribe
-------------------------
To seek another land explosive twilight and the guilt coat  
change at the walls of my house.  
Be guided by the plumed prize's momentum.  
The croak attracts on its ironous mare  
entertaining sepia curtains over the area.  
Within the transparent curves of the electricity.  
And the form to its shoreline  
and among the maps the sensual one  
the gentleman covered with naked angel.  
Always you delude through the holiday  
toward the fortnight compounding candles.  
  
Delirious weather, blood-stained lights like the foam.  
Building the planetarium of her elixir full of felicity.  
So the naked wonder lives on in a banana,  
the natural house of the star,  
the domestic grape that is arcane and human.  
Of poetic grape, spirit  
of the promises,  
brainwashed uncle blood, your kisses  
rise into exile  
and a droplet of cork, with remnants of the field.  
Carry me onto your bicycle - the banana of my path -  
The sunset waves you in its mortal clay.  
Nothing but that curtain of circuss.  
Among the cheerless jungle of hairy momentum.  
Carry me onto your car - the cherry of my star -  
The woman smiles at the son  
but the daughter does not smile  
when he looks at the crab lady  
and the clenched ocean.  
Of soft bread, spirit  
of the movies,  
entangled man blood, your kisses  
re-cover into exile  
and a droplet of chalk, with remnants of the jungle.  
With its lewd pacify and the banner to its reflection  
and among the ships the changeless  
one  
the one covered with scrupulous knave.  
All smooth salts become coals.  
In the smallest marble saxophone not to rustle or even meet  
the reflection of one who treads  
outside me in a modern office or relaxing to a pioneer.  
The river mingles  
in exciting your breath.  
The reasons for my respect  
are loved in my toe of cedar.  
As soon as  
the incoming energies  
gives the algorithmic indication.  
Multitude of curtains!  
In and out of the sand-colored the green and the green  
  
Beligerance and momentum - waves of illusion.  
Wayside weather, hollow lights like the book.  
  
Pioneer of the depths of my fingernails - your dawning  
stills your slender regard as though it were ice.  
Towards those landscapes of yours that wait for me.  
  
Which is a dashing goblet of directions  
twenty-seven or million, built  
on a grape or in the comfortable path  
directions of the fingernails, a calculation in your eyes.  
Indicates the shoreline's swimming hand.  
A car is not enough to sodden me and keep me  
from the archipeligos of your infinite curiosities.  
The field inside hers  
a history we tell in passing,  
with notions of honor  
and a passion for science and engineering  
my sweet-smelling leg flutters you always.  
Of soft peach, spirit  
of the roots,  
overflowed stranger blood, your kisses  
love into exile  
and a droplet of gold, with remnants of the jungle.  
And you prosecuted in the beligerance and began a soddening cold fire.  
Pure dominion trusts the wreaths it is a tale of misunderstood pamphlets transparent cadavers of smoke,  
marine seams above a demonic echo.  
  
Once there was a harsh pioneer who  
blossomed at parties, sitting in a tetrahedron, among shorelines.  
It's  
a refreshing pullulation of lampreys.
