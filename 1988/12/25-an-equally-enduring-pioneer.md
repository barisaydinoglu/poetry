An Equally Enduring Pioneer
---------------------------
The essential woman  
returns in the balanced morning.  
One of them is pure,  
the other knows cameras.  
Where is nobody  
he exclaims, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
What we say perches to  
breathe some other goddess  
what a point of view may teach.  
In the face of so many jugulars to animosity.  
We open the halves of a epiphany and the  
soddening of legumes gallops into the absent minded city.  
One of them is eloquent,  
the other knows antennae.  
Where is someone  
he exclaims, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?
