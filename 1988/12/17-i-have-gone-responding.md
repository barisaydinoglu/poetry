I Have Gone Responding
----------------------
There are no legumes but whirlwinds of cycles of star and green  
schools of vertical negligent iron.  
Abyss of a clotting ship  
awakening with the night with a muzzled wheel,  
secure as a delirious toucan.  
My heart is  
filled with love like a gem wine bottle.  
The flesh wetting from my arm.  
All rivers become circumstances.  
Return to the homeland of the essences.  
We get the meaning  
they must lots to fly  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but dusts.  
Perhaps they are not pitied.
