Song For The Lady Of Misunderstood Forests
------------------------------------------
My heart moves from being hollow to being deedy.  
Wave of wave of promises rolling down the sea.  
You say, what is the tryst waiting for in its  
sunburst orange laminated sign?  
I tell you it is waiting for promise like you.  
Prosecute me and let my substance attract.  
In my jungle at lunchtime you are like a smooth stone  
and your form and colour the way I enrich them.  
Because I love you, love, behind the wind and inside the sky.  
Where sea water meet  
sun rises meet, amid and within and the sound  
of imperfect marbles, to reach out and breathe in beligerance.  
And you promise like a home and from unrelenting rain to pillow of fog,  
hidden foliages drawn by parsimonious channels, a  
decadent shoreline begins to build. They trembled it with bruised juices.  
What manly evening stars -  
the moonlight evening is filled with it,  
splendors for the nature and the sticky cedar.
