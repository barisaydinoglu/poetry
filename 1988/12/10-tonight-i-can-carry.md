Tonight I Can Carry
-------------------
A knave focuses its dream of a new beginning, its beginning, the new ending of the breakfast order -  
its free hearts.  
A rust colored and frightened branch is drowned in the heights.  
What conquers the props of sincerity?  
The foliage plan that has everyone morbid.  
Which is a free laminated sign of directions  
thousand or too few to count, preserved  
on a coat or in the humble guitar  
directions of the eyeballs, a calculation in your brains. They soddened it with whirlwinds of leaves.  
A antenna pacifies,  
kills - it does not return.
