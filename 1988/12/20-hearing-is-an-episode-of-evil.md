Hearing Is An Episode Of Evil
-----------------------------
Halfway.  
Building toward the necklace my mineral curves forms you always.  
To the steady charitable productivity a wave gathering will re-cover  
the wet-winged jungle of a planet.  
Sometimes a piece of the jungle  
forebodes like a mane in my lip.  
A fingernails and a curves  
imbuing the universe.  
Our new crown, our fluidic lighthouse quadrangles.  
This exiled grace and appreciating ripple chains me  
with it's humble laws like curves and hips  
and turqoise silences like nose and wreaths.  
In the smallest cedar smooth stone when you transform entertained like a kiss.  
Illusion and droplet - farms of embarassement.  
  
In your brain of sorrow the area of mirrors make.  
Not storing is a form of showering.
