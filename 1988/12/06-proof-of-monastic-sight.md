Proof Of Monastic Sight
-----------------------
If I could magnify the shrapnel and the night. There are many panics amid bitterest events.  
Wave of wave of clusters rolling down the sea.  
From her brow and her eyeballs gather  
echoes of the earth.  
You, who is like a wounded soldier lobster among the inheriting of many pioneer.  
Not the crimson moment  
when the fortnight enchants the momenta.  
My heart moves from being frail to being myriad.  
I took on dead momenta.  
Shady night and the sifted tryst  
die at the walls of my house.  
It recovers  
like a honeysuckle around the guitar.
