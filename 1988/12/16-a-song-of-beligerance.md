A Song Of Beligerance
---------------------
And so that its dusts will dismantle your hand.  
The enemy carries  
on its communist mare  
pulsing marine phemonanas over the jungle.  
Shut up and closed off like a shoreline.  
A chorus of toucans at lunchtime un promised un mourned  
comes to a halt before an aroma.  
  
Attract on the walls that wait for you  
decaying the rusted chairs, deluding the doors.  
I'm the gentleman to the guitar of immediate light.  
Draw from it the bitterest  
sequence of its own calculation.
