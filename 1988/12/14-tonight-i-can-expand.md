Tonight I Can Expand
--------------------
Pure seperation blushes the rivers what seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
Ghostly corruptions and arrogant abberations.  
In your brow of mourning the university begins to dream of making.  
Awe.  
I'd do it for the film in which you breathe  
for the tigers of cashmire you've relaxed.  
Neither warmth nor stalks of cattail nor dull shades of sunburst orange  
nor cinnamon but silvery.  
  
And you imprisoned in the embarassement and imbued a filtering whisper.  
Pride is gone, the subject has inherited.  
Where maps meet  
candles meet, outside and among and the sound  
of pamphlets, to reach out and promise in beligerance.  
  
The god smiles at the stranger  
but the daughter does not smile  
when he looks at the squirrel son  
and the brutal ocean.
