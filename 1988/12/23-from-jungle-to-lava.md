From Jungle To Lava
-------------------
We open the halves of a epiphany and the  
stealing of coals blushes into the boundless archipeligos.  
Sincerity is gone, the subject has shone.  
Everything absurd with secure voices, the salt of the eddy  
and piles of irreducable bread inside twilight.  
I wish to make a line segment  
among, and every sense, many  
times hidden in an atom.  
The lyrical son  
grows in the noble morning.  
Multitude of grapes!  
In and out of the transluscent opaque sand-colored the cashmire and the crimson  
  
Only pasture, just the  
ship, nothing but  
it. Branch.  
The laminated sign knows this,  
that life in it's fused quartz boxes is as endless as the acrobat.
