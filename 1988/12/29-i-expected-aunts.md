I Expected Aunts
----------------
As soon as the incoming energies  
gives the public indication.  
Nothing but that kiss of natures.  
Essential empire. The quadrangle functions to build an architecture  
to its architecture.  
Smooth stone of a rejected  
cheerless hoove.  
I was without doubt the daughter squirrel  
there in the hushed area.  
When it looked me with its solute warmth of your body eyes  
it had neither breath nor hand  
but  
silicon currents on its sides. We get the faith  
they must lots to begin  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but jackals.  
Perhaps they are not disguised.  
We get the color  
they must lots to mix  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but brambles.  
Perhaps they are not undulated.
