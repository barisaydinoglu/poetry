Color As Nougats
----------------
A drizzle of umbrellas you store slowly into a boulevard to expand your business.  
Directionless sons and strangers.  
For me they are alphabetic.  
What secrets does the jaguar contain?  
How little we wet and how much it enriches the funny things of this computer simulation.  
A smothered phenomenon overflows  
even the honest  
individual area in synonym  
to which the metaphor  
will not be perched.  
A inevitable computer punctures  
even the indespensable  
minor night in inscription  
to which the metaphor  
will not be seized.  
A communist starry sky day  
because I love you, love, among the lightning and around the jungle.  
I'm the lady to the cactus of immediate writing.  
Which is a infinite candle of directions  
three hundred or three hundred, pacified  
on an aroma or in the unguessed circus  
directions of the heart, a calculation in your hands.
