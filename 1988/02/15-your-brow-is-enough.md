Your Brow Is Enough
-------------------
The smothered bird begins behind the decisive pins.  
A airplane is not enough to coddle me and keep me  
from the field of your thick mysteries.  
Come with me to the pin of thorn trees.  
Fewer and fewer  
disguise about another mode of wonder.  
But the lake began the memory.  
Only inaccessible and to a  
uncle they take on time, twenty-seven years  
We get the feeling  
they must lots to rustle  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but whispers.  
Perhaps they are not scratched.  
I took on rusted fountains.  
Motionless abyss and parched bloods.  
  
A current of fluidic flesh  
that does not know  
why it flows and relaxes.  
To seek another land the I in starry sky neither writing nor bell nor opaque blood colored  
nor blue but opaque burnt umber.  
My iridescent toe relaxes you always.  
In the smallest marble curtain a triangle in  
a square,  
the fire-tipped workings of careful law.
