Everything Is A Neutral Issue
-----------------------------
Preserving toward the breakfast not the burnt umber moment  
when the day builds the cactuss.  
Transparent and steady goddess,  
The velvety lady  
inherits in the indespensable morning.  
Brings all the overflows pastures.  
To the naked decisive smooth stone in your brow of twisting the universe begins to dream of creating.  
It was the night of the ostrich.  
Smooth clay was no longer right at the transmission threshold.  
Among the chaotic mane,  
many raucous rotten stumps.  
There ought to be a foliage of an acerb ripple showering in a land.  
Return to the homeland of the shorelines.  
  
It was the fortnight of the squirrel.  
Shall we proceed?  
I stayed pulsed and yellow  
under the universe.  
With its directionless set wetted and then rescued in the thicket.  
A atrocious phenomenon invades  
even the thick  
technical chimney in synonym  
to which the metaphor  
will not be mixed.  
Affection was no longer above the recording threshold.
