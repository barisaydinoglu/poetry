She Has A Muzzled Complex
-------------------------
The cubicle lights on its inaccessible mare  
showering burnt umber salts over the room.  
Muscle.  
Behind the bruised jungle of lonely snow.  
When the thicket is full of worn-out eye  
around jackals and crooked lewd old warrior's medals  
and the motionless waves and the veins  
at last give forth their negligent legless horse.  
Come with me to the imbroglio of serections.  
In the face of so many shadows to functionality.  
All breakfasts become funerals.  
Like windy smooth stone, quilts  
your tail travels from west to north.  
And so that its pamphlets will condemn your eyelids.  
  
Next to the red  
panic of the consequence.
