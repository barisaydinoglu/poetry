Silent Theories Of Writings

And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
protect of ribbons and lunars  
and the blazing jars of his native land?  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the perfect miracles?  
And the drizzle thick splattering its lights and congealing them full of  
boulevard and lobster?  
Realized aromatic ribbon the archipeligos outside hers  
a story we divulge in passing,  
with notions of wonder  
and a passion for science and science  
I could make trap, uranu, and clock  
from autumns and autumns  
with a red bell  
with yeasts in my eye.  
Nauesous whispers and phosphorus noises.  
Setting a vein  
magnified in the manly fog.  
You say, what is the hat waiting for in its crimson map?  
I tell you it is waiting for jar like you.
