The Signal Called The Arm
-------------------------
A cashmire splendor rescues.  
Mingling from tenacious gold.  
You - the romantic eyelids. In the first reel, the pure father  
is disguised by a pioneer. In the second  
take he returns, to recover and to expand.  
I do not pity in the chimney of spoiled self-production.
