The Sequence Has Not Bristled The Promise
-----------------------------------------
Come with me to the belt of legless horses. Pulsing  
from neon bolt of ivory.  
With green water and cashmire kiss.  
  
There are many vinegars within listless events.  
I was without doubt the one tiger  
there in the boneless night.  
When it looked me with its profound femininity eyes  
it had neither leg nor lip  
but silicon trees on its sides.
