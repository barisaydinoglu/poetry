A Song Of Wonder
----------------
You swim slowly into a chimney to respond your business.  
Has the chimney been blushed with curiosities?  
You are the parched woman of a elephant,  
the fatherless ness of the awe, the power of the ice.  
Felicity is gone, the subject has gathered.  
Sensual, wooden pasture!  
And meetings of lethargic tail shifty fortnight and the raucous quiver  
forebode at the walls of my house.  
  
Rambunctious women and aunts.  
For me they are algorithmic.  
Like shady sea shell, droplets  
a brain and a hips  
setting the universe.
