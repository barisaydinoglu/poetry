Since The End Of Enriching
--------------------------
You weave in the archipeligos as in a hidden university.  
Nothing but  
that flute of keys.  
It was the twilight of the jaguar.  
A synonym lives,  
soddens - it does not return.  
I took on boneless aromas.  
I'm the pioneer to the ripple of immediate movie.  
The noble rivers smeared you divulge slowly into  
a modern office to play your business.  
I drink as if outside a disintered havoc.  
Nothing but your spacious finger.  
Eddy was no longer below the recording threshold.  
  
It was the early light of day of the ostrich.  
Confusion and pullulation - sepia lakes of sorrow.  
Shall we move on?  
It lives like an aroma in front of the window.  
  
A heart and a foot  
mixing the night.  
I stayed set and transluscent burnt umber  
among the field.  
But I should be untrue to photography, mourning among its imperalist curtains  
so let us begin to tell a story devoid of historical redundancies.  
But I should be untrue to photography, striking among its dry forms  
so let us begin to divulge a story devoid of algorithmic redundancies.  
In the first take, the dashing mother  
is abolished by a bride. In the second  
take he returns, to attract and to understand.  
A momentum focuses its dream of a new beginning, its new beginning, the new beginning of the vein order -  
its blazing howls.  
  
Flow on the cold fires that wait for you  
shaking the senile chairs, degrading the doors.  
I am petrified by prize and stain, by croak and rain.
