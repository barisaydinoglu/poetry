The Calcerous Wasteland
-----------------------
It's a forming utensil of shardss of marble.  
Wave of wave of friendships rolling down the sea.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
play of veins and utensils  
and the cosmic poppies of his native land? On what disintered vinegars rose with wind?
