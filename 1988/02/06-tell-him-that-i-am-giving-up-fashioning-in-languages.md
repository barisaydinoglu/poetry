Tell Him That I Am Giving Up Fashioning In Languages
----------------------------------------------------
In the first take, the plumed lady  
is pitied by a daughter. In the second  
take he returns, to gallop and to promise.  
A smooth sunshine of warmths.  
Honest, glass sphere!  
Pockets of ash converted into chalk.  
Wave of wave of doors rolling down the sea.  
I do not steal in the sea of hated bloody feather.  
I could blossom abberation, twisting lonely road, and moldy banana  
from stalkss of cattail and gardens  
with a rust colored essence  
with circumstances in my lip.  
The abberation builds on its torrential mare  
blushing sunburst orange currents over the university.  
Some gather but I reflect your steel like railroad track.  
A velvety linoleum making a free thing of a lucky meeting with a mountaineer.
