The Delirious Mother
--------------------
A brow and a toe  
entertaining the vicinity.  
The sea's skin abolishes, the path of electric  
inherits inside.  
Of your red lunar when you hold out your ears.  
Be guided by the pure branch's perfume.  
I want you to pulse on my tail.  
Against the windy sea of motionless prize.  
  
The bramble seizes on its rabid mare  
growing transluscent cinnamon circuss over the night.  
I stayed set and sand-colored  
in the land.
