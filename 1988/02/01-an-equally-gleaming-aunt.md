An Equally Gleaming Aunt
------------------------
We get the color  
they must lots to dawn  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but dusts.  
Perhaps they are not congealed.  
I wish to make a line  
next to, and every feeling, many  
times hidden in a cluster.  
Outside the lethargic friendship, many directionless nights.  
Multitude of suns!  
In and out of the cinnamon the transluscent marine and the transluscent sand-colored  
I saw how threads are protected  
by the cleansed banner.  
What is this projection but a memory crushed of its poppies?  
What we say awakens to  
magnify some other mother  
what a language may teach.  
The neurotic lobster attracts under the silent nights.  
In your eyeballs of fear the field of lights imbue.
