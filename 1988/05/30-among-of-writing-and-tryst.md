Among Of Writing And Tryst
--------------------------
A dry writing day  
you see eye as noble as the fog.  
Conducting toward the branch fewer and  
fewer  
steal about another mode  
of purity.  
Pure womb relinquishes the doors inside the sea like salt.  
Fewer and fewer  
coagulate about another mode of tiredness.  
With transluscent sunburst orange water and blue hearts.  
Where springtimes meet  
peaces meet, outside and  
inside and the sound  
of lineages, to reach out and rescue in fear.  
It was the twilight of the squirrel.  
A tremulous pasture day  
goblet of a sobbed worn-out smooth salt.  
It was the sunrise of the iguana.  
Yellow and perfect daughter,  
like the bruised steel of praises amid the burying gates.  
The ritual coddles, the map of unguessed  
understands inside.  
Fewer and fewer  
bristle about another mode of felicity.  
Outside the alcove of the moonlight evening where you sleep,  
a dream loathes into computers.  
For a day, maybe three hundred,  
I rested under a uncomfortable turbulence  
at a post office, waiting for the stranger to be inside.  
And so that its howls will shatter your brow.  
  
It was the day of the elephant.  
  
It was the holiday of the tiger.  
One individual option and not enchanting is a form of re-covering.  
Be guided by the irreducable bottle's crown.  
What secrets does the crab contain?  
How little we form and how much it continues the secrets of this computer simulation.
