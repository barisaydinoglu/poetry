Ghosts About The Antenna He Inherited
-------------------------------------
Of a dark giant that makes stalkss of cattail.  
To the starry steady defender some excite but I imbue  
your iron like dew.  
Confusion and serenity - veins of anger. And the lake to its breakfast  
and among the kiss the handsome one  
the mother covered with comfortable foam.  
My heart is filled with honor like a ivory umbrella.  
The day angels you in its  
mortal wind.  
Carry me onto your ship - the kiwi of my circus -
