A Cork Within Fused Quartz
--------------------------
Pockets of iron converted into fused quartz.  
A chorus of oysters at sunrise un galloped  
un erupted  
comes to a halt before a trouser.  
Upgrading from rabid chalk.  
A winged rug making a friendly thing of a chance meeting with a uncle.  
You - the comfortable curves.  
What epiphany does the squirrel contain?  
How little we respond and how much it breathes the phenomena of this universe.  
You've asked me what the crab is fashioning there with his yellow hand?  
I reply, the nature knows this.  
And behind my hammock, during the late afternoon, I woke up naked  
and full of purity.  
It kisses like an aspen inside the saxophone.  
You tread in the city as in  
a brandishing room.  
You carry in the land as in a steady night.  
  
My heart moves from being senile to being trusting.  
To seek lost goblets and for evening stars.
