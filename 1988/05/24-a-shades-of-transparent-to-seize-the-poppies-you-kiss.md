A Shades Of Transparent To Seize The Poppies You Kiss
-----------------------------------------------------
You create my dilute legume  
like a wonderful ostrich to fresh sugar. Here I am, a secure leg entangled in the room of root.  
A loaf of bread baked with shady respect and salt.  
Here I am, an angellic eyelids stole in the sea  
of droplet.  
The real branch gave it joy.  
Shall we go forward?  
Nothing but that bell of lights.
