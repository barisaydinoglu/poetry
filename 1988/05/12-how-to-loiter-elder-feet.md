How To Loiter Elder Feet
------------------------
I am brainwashed by lemon and rectum, by bloodied broken glass and clouds.  
A directionless forest day  
the frightened foam is pure on your hand.  
I saw how moons are wetted  
by the affluent garden.  
There are no shadows but frail cycles of grape and sunburst orange  
pullulations of round frightened brick.  
With its wet-winged travel what phenomena does the jaguar contain?  
How little we continue and how much it reconciles the phenomena of this computer simulation.  
My great brow refreshes you always.  
Of a blood colored bride that connects crowns.  
There are no coals but exiled cycles of propeller and yellow  
farms of full hated sand.  
I do not shake in the moonlight evening of atrocious bloodied salt.  
  
A chorus of turkeys at early light of day un recovered un foreboded  
comes to a halt before a chalk architecture.
