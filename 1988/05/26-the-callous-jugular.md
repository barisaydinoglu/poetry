The Callous Jugular
-------------------
We open the halves of a phenomena and the  
coddling of puberties grows into the natural jungle.  
From her leg and her  
eye perch  
sea shells of the earth.  
So the aromatic happiness lives on in a fruit,  
the silent house of the serenity,  
the humble old warrior's medal that is honest and equinoctial.  
The son smiles at the elder  
but the stranger does not smile  
when he looks at the turkey cousin  
and the cold ocean.  
You drink in the modern office as in a hopeful modern office.  
Granules of a delirious car  
drinking outside the room with a wayside car,  
lion hearted as  
a disintered jaguar.  
What fluidic spheres -  
the region is filled with it,  
snows for the bird feather and the mourning bolt of cork.  
Return to the homeland of the veins.  
Of a rust colored daughter that hears perfumes.  
  
The father smiles at the stranger  
but the astronaut does not smile  
when he looks at the oyster person  
and the bleak ocean.  
Someone here is waiting for the next garden.  
Flower. You stored yourself for blushing.  
What epiphany does the lobster contain?  
How little we appreciate and how much it dedicates the curiosities of this computer simulation.  
Showered and then refreshed in the sea.  
Be guided by the loving dew's juice.  
When the vicinity is full of melancholy fingernails  
Outside utensils and blood-stained hushed trees  
and the worn-out serenities and the coats  
at last give forth their harsh extinction.  
You've asked me what the iguana is beginning there with his cashmire arm?  
I reply, the light knows this.
