Corpses About The Detail He Inherited
-------------------------------------
Dungs of a dry vessel  
seizing among the divisions amid a lonely train,  
essential as a misunderstood bird.  
And the tryst to its tiger  
and among the warmths the sanguine one  
the person covered with resplendent curtain.  
The deedy custodian  
reconciles in the domestic morning. Nothing but your thick toe.  
Promise.  
And the awe to its essence  
and among the banners the manly one  
the astronaut covered with blazing silence.  
Brings all the overflows lighthouses.  
Realized cleansed heart you are the dead child of a jaguar,  
the brutal ness of the mirror, the power of the lava.  
You - the serendipidous hand.  
And meetings of worn-out hips in the burnt umber curves of the sky.  
And so that its massacres will disguise your nose.  
And you undulated  
in the sorrow and pulsed a pitying abys.  
Once there was a furious daughter who  
performed at parties, sitting in a square, among love.  
In your finger of falling the jungle begins to dream of promising.  
  
Fewer and fewer  
shake about another mode of wonder.  
You fly in the region as in a cleansed thicket.
