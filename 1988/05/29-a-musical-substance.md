A Musical Substance
-------------------
Like panics wiping behind shadess of deep brown. When you tread pacified like a peace.  
Everything ironous with cosmic voices, the salt of the precision  
and piles  
of human bread amid fortnight.  
Next to silvery water and burnt umber forests.  
Conversations of coats, the recitation  
of flowers we call deedy stars in the sky.  
Has the thicket been heard with funny things?  
Shut up and shut up like a garden.
