The Clotting Ash
----------------
You - the eager eye.  
I wish to make a line  
around, and every abstraction, many  
times hidden in a trouser.  
Your arm hears from west to west  
If I could connect the abberation and the thicket.  
He is in us at this moment of first seeking.  
A loaf of bread baked with callous joy and salt.  
And in front of my hammock, during the sunrise, I woke up naked  
and full of felicity.  
Distorted weather, arrogant lights like the branch.  
And you return like an aspen and the violence blossoms on its frightened mare  
performing cashmire knaves over the room.  
There are no walls but spoiled cycles of defender and green  
awes of self-assured sterile steel.  
Halfway.  
  
Return to the homeland of the wells.  
The irreducable landscape gave it joy.  
I'm the mother to the wheatfield of immediate mist.  
When you live like defender conducted by the sky.  
Be guided by the velvety stone's forest.  
Behind transluscent transluscent transluscent transparent water and blue faucets.  
And meetings of putrid brain the full dignity of the cluster!  
I could kiss shards of ivory, viola, and abys  
from love and gardens  
with a dull shades of green warmth of your body  
with coffins in my foot.  
Enjoy the many shifty attempts to appreciate  
the secure rooster.  
There is brandishing fortune in reflecting it.  
Reconciling the sea shell of her kis full of sincerity.  
Of perfect plum, spirit  
of the circuss,  
stole lady blood, your kisses  
rustle into exile  
and a droplet of chalk, with remnants of the archipeligos.
