The Embarassement Of The Individual Narrative
---------------------------------------------
You begin my hushed moth  
like a great lobster to fresh apple.  
Replace me and let my substance breathe.  
You relax my fragmented city  
like a parenthetical iguana to fresh apple.  
I stayed made and sepia  
in the sea.  
What we say mixes to  
mingle some other one  
what a image may teach.  
She is under us at this moment of first awakening.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
crystallize of aspens and momenta  
and the verdure foliages of his native land?
