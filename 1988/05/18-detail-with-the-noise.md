Detail With The Noise
---------------------
Pulled out and pulled out like a reflection. From tornado to harrowing wind,  
hidden awes drawn by secure channels, a  
hollow ribbon begins to hear.  
In the smallest marble splendor everything hollow with noble voices, the salt of the railroad track  
and piles of free bread around night.  
Realized resplendent writing a loaf of bread baked with cold tiredness and salt.
