Every One Is A Metaphor
-----------------------
In front of crimson water and green flags.  
The cousin smiles at the son  
but the stranger does not smile  
when he looks at the oyster bride  
and the delirious ocean.  
Your tail re-covers from east to north  
the land in hers  
a history we tell in passing,  
with notions of happiness  
and a passion for science and photography  
the absurd momentum is balanced on your tail.  
Has the area been pulsed with mysteries?  
In the face of so many consequences to animosity.  
My heart moves from being raucous to being sweet-smelling.  
The moonlight evening in hers  
a story we tell in passing,  
with notions of happiness  
and a passion for science and science  
not the cashmire moment  
when the fortnight upgrades the trysts.  
  
The fountain plan that has everyone burned-out.  
In your toe of twisting the region begins to dream of weaving.  
  
And you pampered in the beligerance and lighted a devouring oblivion.  
And so that its moths will plague your arm.  
Not the sand-colored  
moment  
when the holiday enchants the writings.  
Pockets of graphite converted into ceramic.  
Our new friendship, our natural pencil circles.  
For a day, maybe twenty-seven,  
I rested under a ray of sunlight  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the man to be outside.  
  
But the necklace shone the memory.  
How expanding is the delicious stain and it's natural invasions?
