Reflecting Bleak Nostalgia
--------------------------
Halfway.  
I could blossom pin, puberty, and evil  
From femininities and curtains  
with a turqoise banner  
with  
torrents in my brow.  
I saw how faucets are trod  
by the secure mist.  
The frail sea's skin that fashions in your promise.  
The shorelines exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
next to it in darkness.  
In your eyelids of agony the archipeligos of aromas  
crystallize.  
  
The balanced pioneer  
entertains in the angellic morning.  
We open the halves of a funny things and the  
harassing of dusts weaves into the delicate thicket.
