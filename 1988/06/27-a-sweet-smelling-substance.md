A Sweet-smelling Substance
--------------------------
One of them is delicate,  
the other knows languages.  
Where is someone  
he quips, and when can we see what

mixed in the spacious snow.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
pacify of mists and drops  
and the delicate landscapes of his native land?
