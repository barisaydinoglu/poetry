An Equally Enchanting Elder
---------------------------
In the smallest bolt of saphire saxophone a grape -like felicity  
a toe and a eyeballs  
continuing the university.  
It was the fortnight of the elephant.  
Protecting toward the quilt I salute your comfortable plum  
and envy your acerb pride.  
I wish to make a circle  
in front of, and every sense, many  
times hidden in a maternity.  
You kiss slowly into a thicket to wet your business.  
When you preserve like glass architecture mixed by the jungle.  
Here I am, a decisive shoulder mutated in the night of vein.  
Against the worn-out bird feather, many delirious deaths.  
A loaf of bread baked with frightened decency and salt.  
  
It was the sunrise of the bird.  
You discover in the night as in a fresh heights.  
In the face of so many corpses to functionality.
