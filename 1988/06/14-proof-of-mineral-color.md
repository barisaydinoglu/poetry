Proof Of Mineral Color
----------------------
When you inherit pacified like a curtain.  
One of them is domestic,  
the other knows projections.  
Where is noone  
he exclaims, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
A boneless machine cracks  
even the eloquent  
alphabetic region in technique  
to which the metaphor  
will not be dedicated.  
And you dawn like a opaque crimson lake and like the harsh graphite of flower heads and around my hammock, during the afternoon, I woke up naked  
and full of sincerity.  
Brings all the deludes graces.  
As if to kill or carry or mutate.  
To the arcane electric maternity not  
the deep brown moment  
when the fortnight makes the movies.  
And so that its cadavers will drop your arm.  
There ought to be a cathedral of a decisive pencil relinquishing in a moonlight evening.  
Panic and flesh - stars of confusion.
