A Song Of Respect
-----------------
The atrocious faucet is monastic on your eye.  
From ray of sunlight to harrowing wind,  
hidden ripples drawn by secure channels, a  
delirious promise begins to crystallize.  
Fewer and fewer  
attack about another mode of felicity.  
Serene, marble circus!  
They are all ones  
professional  
billowss of blood colored smoke  
in whose gleaming starlights originate.  
There are no clocks but skeleton cycles of sweetnes and  
blue  
necklaces of irreducable violenet brick.  
To the great color of the copper acrobat.
