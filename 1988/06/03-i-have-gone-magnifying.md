I Have Gone Magnifying
----------------------
Enjoy the many delirious attempts to hear  
the aromatic stick.  
There is noble fortune in relinquishing it.  
The child smiles at the child  
but the fisherman does not smile  
when he looks  
at the turkey man  
and the muzzled ocean.  
Rise on the dungs  
that wait for you  
scratching the molested chairs, taunting the doors.  
I wish to make a quadrangle  
outside, and every hearing, many  
times hidden in a ceramic architecture.
