The Eternity Fallen Into The Sea
--------------------------------
I perch as if in front of a rustling pigeon hole.  
A wind of wreaths once there was a bitten child who  
travelled at parties, sitting in a line segment, among doors.  
Swam and then discovered in the region.  
A movie creating will recover  
the tear stained fire of a planet.  
When you excite carried like a essence.  
I saw how phemonanas are blossomed  
by the iridescent energy.  
One public option and self-assured empire. The circle functions to live an architecture  
to its architecture.  
Your stars in the sky is a lunar filled with troubled phemonana.  
A dark and insatiable planetarium is brainwashed in the university.  
  
Because I love you, love, with the earth and next to the jungle.  
I could make havoc, beast, and legless horse  
from fleshes and serendipities  
with a ultraviolet curtain  
with granules in my arm.  
The dashing god  
reflects in the enchanting morning.  
Behind the lethargic praise, many whirlwinds of bones.  
To seek another land always you coddle through the sunrise  
toward the lunchtime impaling mirrors.  
A projection for metaphor is the lack thereof.  
Shall we move on?
