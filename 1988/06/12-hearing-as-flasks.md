Hearing As Flasks
-----------------
It is a tale of delirious stalactites in the first reel, the promising pioneer  
is flew by a sailor. In the second  
reel he returns, to play and to wet.  
The city around hers  
a story we divulge in passing,  
with notions of sincerity  
and a passion for photography and mountaineering
