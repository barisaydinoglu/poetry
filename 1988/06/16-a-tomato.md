A Tomato
--------
The blood-stained starlight is serene on your heart. I wish to make a circle  
around, and every hearing, many  
times  
hidden in a hoove.  
I re-cover as if within a bitten oxide.  
Carry me onto your train - the cherry of my bird feather -  
a current of real saxophone  
that does not know why it flows and conducts.  
My noble arm makes you always.  
Once there was a rusted son who  
rustled at parties, sitting in a square, among railroad tracks.  
In your brow of condemning the city begins to dream of shining.  
When the sea is full of thirsty leg  
behind juices  
and crooked cold productivities  
and the calculating sunburst orange lakes and the fellowships  
at last give forth their mechanical vigil.
