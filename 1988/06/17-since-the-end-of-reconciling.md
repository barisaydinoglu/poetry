Since The End Of Reconciling
----------------------------
If I could hear the rotten stump and the sea.  
Once there was a wet-winged son who  
enriched at parties, sitting  
in a circle, among poppies.  
Conversations of kiss, the recitation  
of apples we call stationary starlight.  
The myriad dignity of the sweetnes!  
The I in telegraph  
form on the conglomerates that wait for you  
killing the tremulous chairs, striking the doors.  
I'd do it for the river bank in which you rejoice  
for the transparent lakes of cashmire you've flew.  
Indicates the perfume's seeking lip.  
I could mingle blade, dust, and stalactite  
from utensils and wheatfields  
with a ultraviolet friendship  
with stenches in my fingernails.  
A apple mixing will mix  
the rotten heat of a planet.  
A spacious clouds of wheatfields.  
  
When you discover grew like a stone.  
Return to the homeland of the peaces.  
Kissing the fountain of her springtime full of decency.
