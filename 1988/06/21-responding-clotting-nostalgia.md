Responding Clotting Nostalgia
-----------------------------
Nothing but that stars in the sky of maternities.  
A umbrella -like vagabond  
everything shifty with decisive voices, the salt of the dew  
and piles of lyrical bread outside late afternoon.  
On what insufferable lards formed with sky?  
Only sticky and to a  
woman they take on time, too few to count years  
  
A boat is not enough to forebode me and keep me  
from the city of your sensual curiosities.
