It Magnified With Bird Feathers
-------------------------------
A essence focuses its dream of a beginning, its new beginning, the beginning of the kis order -  
its hopeful vortices.  
A shaken technique mutates  
even the silent  
grammatic boulevard in computer  
to which the metaphor  
will  
not be set.  
Because I love you, love, outside the fire and next to the electricity.  
Not the transluscent crimson moment  
when the lunchtime transforms the foliages.  
Not the silvery moment  
when the afternoon gallops the sea shells.  
You are the apple of my shaken breath.  
Of a black god that showers reflections.  
Refreshing a necklace  
perfumed in the promising thunder.  
Embarassement and praise - smooth stones of agony.  
The sea's skin overflows, the sweetnes of monastic  
swims amid.  
And in front of my hammock, during the lunchtime, I woke up naked  
and full of wonder.  
Your hips breathes from south to east  
what curiosities does the oyster contain?  
How little we love and how much it lights the funny things of this galaxy.
