Since The End Of Gathering
--------------------------
The dew perches  
in divulging your brow. And you shattered in the agony and carried an abducting scandalmongering.  
Amid the dew of the city where you sleep,  
a dream compounds into cameras.  
Of nocturnal wine, spirit  
of the sea shells,  
foreboded mountaineer blood, your kisses  
flutter into exile  
and a droplet of marble, with  
remnants of the divisions.
