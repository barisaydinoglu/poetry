Here I Breathe You
------------------
I saw how friendships are crystallized  
by the homogeneous acrobat.  
If you were not the apple the irreducable moon  
cooks, sprinkling its bread across the moonlight evening.  
A blue quilt gallops. I do not impale in the room of guilt massacre.  
So the balanced respect lives on in a banana,  
the free house of the ship,  
the friendly goblet that is smooth and human.  
Chirped and then protected in the region.  
A airplane is not enough to taunt me and keep me  
from the field of your delicious mysteries.  
The midnight kisses you in  
its mortal lightning.  
Where wine bottles meet  
serendipities meet, amid and around and the sound  
of convicts, to reach out and grow in beligerance.  
  
Gnaw me and let my substance magnify.  
Shut up and shut out like a cactus.
