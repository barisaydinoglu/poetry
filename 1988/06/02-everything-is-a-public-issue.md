Everything Is A Public Issue
----------------------------
Because I love you, love, around the heat and amid the lava.  
You love my directionless clock  
like a sweet-smelling lobster to fresh wine.  
Brings all the deludes utensils.  
Lashed daggers and fire-tipped nougats.  
I'd do it for the shoreline in which you refresh  
for the doves of blue you've mixed.  
A current of absent minded hat  
that does not know why it flows and rescues.  
You are the communist pioneer of a bird,  
the cold ness of the guitar, the power of the water.  
Sometimes a piece of the clay  
forebodes like a pasture in my heart.  
Your bed is a telegraph filled with rigid muscle.  
What we say performs to  
conduct some other mother  
what a calculation may teach.  
As if to change or tread or plague.  
And you coddled in the agony and enchanted a gnawing imbroglio.  
One of them is vertical,  
the other knows synonyms.  
Where is someone  
she says, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?
