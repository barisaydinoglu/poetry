I Have Gone Silencing
---------------------
You are the wayside goddess of a lobster,  
the careless ness of the muscle, the power of the electricity.  
So the round sincerity lives on in a orange,  
the promising house of the apple,  
the honest thread that is esoteric and loving.  
Fewer and fewer  
wet about another mode of honor.  
It mixes like a flute among the bird feather.  
And poppies and reflections. What mysteries does the jaguar contain?  
How little we love and how much it re-covers the mysteries of this galaxy.  
It's a breathing vein of dusts.  
There ought to be a leaf of an affluent root developing in a room.  
Of cleansed apple, spirit  
of the lakes,  
penetrated man blood, your kisses  
pulse into exile  
and a droplet of saphire, with remnants of the universe.  
A root conducting will flow  
the whirlwinds of wind of a planet.  
A loaf of bread baked with difficult wonder and salt.  
What manly circuss -  
the jungle is filled with it,  
grapes for the coat and the morbid cork.
