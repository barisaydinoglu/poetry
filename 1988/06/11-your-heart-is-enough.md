Your Heart Is Enough
--------------------
Spoiled astronauts and mountaineers.  
For me they are grammatic.  
A chorus of iguanas at sunrise un woke un prosecuted  
comes to a halt before a sunburst orange car.  
Transluscent transparent lava to my sterile smooth rusted nail!  
Like the fractious broken glass of gardens the mountaineer smiles at the one  
but the pioneer does not smile  
when he looks at the pheasant stranger  
and the tear stained ocean.  
From tornado to pillow of fog,  
hidden roots drawn by hidden channels, a  
hushed pencil begins to form.  
A image reconciles,  
lunges - it does not return.  
For a day, maybe too few to count,  
I rested under a uncomfortable turbulence  
at a post office, waiting for the giant to be inside.
