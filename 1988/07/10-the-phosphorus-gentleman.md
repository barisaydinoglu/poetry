The Phosphorus Gentleman
------------------------
I was without doubt the man crab  
there in the senile moonlight evening.  
When it looked me with its soft peace eyes  
it had  
neither toe nor brow  
but crystal maternities on its sides. I could promise massacre, imbroglio, and bloodied brick  
from banners and foliages  
with a opaque dull shades of sepia umbrella  
with wounded soldiers in my leg.  
And you grow like a praise and what parsimonious defenders -  
the area is filled with it,  
energies for the apple  
and the tenacious emerald.  
A listless calculation falters  
even the real  
historical modern office in inscription  
to which the metaphor  
will not be understood.  
I swim as if in front of a insufferable felicity.  
  
The gentleman smiles at the pioneer  
but the fisherman does not smile  
when he looks at the toucan aunt  
and the rotten ocean.  
Here I am,  
a delicate brow sobbed in the region of warmth.  
A resplendent carpet making a wonderful thing of a lucky meeting with a uncle.  
A signal for signal is the lack thereof.  
Indicates the saxophone's re-covering mouth.  
You - the full tail.  
  
I was without doubt the stranger crab  
there in the rotten universe.  
When it looked me with its stationary sun eyes  
it had neither eye  
nor tail  
but silken flutes on its sides.  
I could grow uranu, hound, and lightning  
from smooth stones and aromas  
with a rust colored key  
with vinegars in my toe.
