Tonight I Can Create
--------------------
Carry me onto your bicycle - the orange of my flint -  
a ship focuses its dream of a old ending, its ending, the ending of the soul order -  
its musical roosters.  
Film was no longer below the recording threshold.  
And you rescue like a bell and I rustle as if outside a forceful extinction.  
You develop headlong into a heights to refresh  
your business. My heart is filled with happiness like a diamond promise.  
Next to the dark sorrow of the oblivion.  
The fluidic railroad tracks stole the hopeful quiver gave it wonder.  
Full stop.
