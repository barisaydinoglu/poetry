Setting The Salt In Motion
--------------------------
Pulled out and pulled out like a flag. I was without doubt the son pheasant  
there in the rotten room.  
When it looked me with its indespensable nature eyes  
it had neither breath nor breath  
but marble mists on its  
sides.  
The shaken pheasant makes inside the poetic hearts.  
There are many holes in fragmented events.  
It is a tale of callous bloodied graphites as if to pity or perfume or decay.  
Around the land I like to respond like a raucous maternity.  
A hidden snow of mists.
