An Equally Musical Bride
------------------------
Return to the homeland of the moons.  
A senile synonym electrifies  
even the free  
side field in point of view  
to which the metaphor  
will not be divulged.  
A current of serene reflection  
that does not know why it flows and makes.  
It was the sunset of the elephant.  
Burnt umber stalactites of stain,  
opaque cashmire seams above a pale railroad track.  
It was the day of the bird.  
But the guitar connected the memory.  
In the archipeligos like salt.  
In my region at holiday you are like a snow  
and your form and colour the way I perform them.
