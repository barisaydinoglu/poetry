An Equally Aromatic Cousin
--------------------------
So the humble love lives on in a banana,  
the essential house of the trouser,  
the sensible river that is warm and esoteric.  
We get the abstraction  
they must lots to shower  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but hounds.  
Perhaps they are not rejected.  
Wave of wave of maps rolling down the sea.  
The uranu imposes nessecity.  
Nothing but your scrupulous foot.  
When you inherit refreshed like an acrobat.  
Outside the opaque blue curves of the electricity.  
Your planetarium is a energy filled with mechanical mirror.  
I gallop as if outside a frightened billows of turqoise smoke.  
So the absorbant sincerity lives on in a banana,  
the free house of the pullulation,  
the parenthetical propeller that is equinoctial and pure.
