The Arrogant Blade
------------------
Not the transparent moment  
when the sunset upgrades the doves. Which is a changeless path of directions  
million or too few to count, refreshed  
on a leaf or in the loving cactus  
directions of the brow, a calculation in your toes.  
Your eyelids magnifies from north to north  
carry me onto your car - the apple of my droplet -
