The Conspirator Fallen Into The Sea
-----------------------------------
Kissing the praise of her kiss full of sincerity. Always you coddle through the late afternoon  
toward the sunset changing times.  
Against the violenet evening star, many hollow billowss of black smoke.  
Wave of wave of silences rolling down the sea.  
I was without doubt the mother tiger  
there in the misunderstood  
region.  
When it looked me with its delicious circus eyes  
it had neither tail nor foot  
but glass fragrances of strawberry on its sides.
