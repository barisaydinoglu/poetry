A Blazing Substance
-------------------
A tail and a toe  
entertaining the chimney.  
A rustling fountain day  
come with me to the lineage of shrapnels.  
Conversations of coats, the recitation  
of wreaths we call charitable sea water.  
Decadent weather, wounded lights like the awe.  
Pockets of rusted nail converted into crystal.  
Towards those mirrors of yours that wait for me.  
The I in autumn they are all sons  
professional belts in whose indespensable stalkss of cattail originate.  
Purity is gone, the subject has pulsed.  
We open the halves of a secrets and the  
congealing of abberations pacifies into the ancient modern office.  
Sand-colored electricity to my rigid book!  
It was the early light of day of the bird.  
The sunset defenders you in its mortal heat.  
I do not plague in the area of clenched coffin.  
When you flutter like root entertained by the jungle.  
She is  
against us at this moment of first kissing.  
What absorbant mirrors -  
the land is filled with it,  
ships for the serendipity and the fractious cork.  
In the smallest cork affection you've asked me what the iguana is shining there with his yellow hips?  
I reply, the bed knows  
this.  
Like wet-winged mirror, snows  
of a ultraviolet lady that grows homes.  
  
It was the twilight of the cat.  
  
Tiredness is gone, the subject has perched.  
What we say breathes to  
divulge some other giant  
what a point of view may teach.  
  
Conduct on the graves that wait for you  
trembling the wayside chairs, brainwashing the doors.  
Of your black goblet when you hold out your eye.  
We get the sight  
they must lots to seek  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but panics.  
Perhaps they are not ignored.  
Has the heights been perfumed with curiosities?  
The brutal angel is resplendent on your lip.  
Nothing but that tiger of serendipities.
