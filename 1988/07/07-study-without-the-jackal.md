Study Without The Jackal
------------------------
My silent finger recovers you always. Deep brown water to my melancholy hat!  
My heart moves from being morbid to being lion hearted.  
A current of sanguine star  
that does not know why it flows and treads.  
As if to coddle or drink or disguise.  
A point of view rises,  
deforms - it does not return.  
In the face of so many stenches to positivity.  
When the city is full of furious hips  
amid nights and clenched morose stars  
and the furious hooves and the quivers  
at last give forth their difficult clandenstine.  
  
You - the cleansed fingernails.
