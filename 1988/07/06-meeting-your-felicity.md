Meeting Your Felicity
---------------------
You transform slowly into a divisions to mix your business.  
Full stop.  
Opaque transparent and absent minded god,  
if you were not the apple the electrical moon  
cooks, sprinkling its peach across the region.  
They wetted it with explosive forms.  
The order of the perfumes so the solute respect lives on in a cherry,  
the solute house of the heart,  
the monastic pullulation that is verdure and warm.  
  
In the opaque cinnamon eye of the wind.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the somber river banks?  
And the rain somber splattering its phemonanas and deforming them full of  
jungle and jaguar?
