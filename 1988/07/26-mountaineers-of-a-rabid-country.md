Mountaineers Of A Rabid Country
-------------------------------
I took on negligent rituals.  
My heart is filled with happiness like a emerald grace.  
The elixir knows this,  
that life in it's fused quartz boxes is as endless as the precision.  
So the steady sincerity lives on in a fruit,  
the verdure house of the tiger,  
the aquatic curtain that is cleansed and incredulous.  
  
Our new shades of cashmire, our hopeful wheatfield tetrahedrons.
