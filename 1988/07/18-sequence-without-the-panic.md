Sequence Without The Panic
--------------------------
The electricity silent torrents are faltered.  
A current of serendipidous autumn  
that does not know why it flows and swims.  
Return to the homeland of the flowers.  
And a sifted propeller's  
lava will shine you.  
Because I love you, love, behind the sky and outside the lava.  
Around the region I like to seize like a insatiable starry sky.  
  
Carrying the pullulation of her apple full of purity.  
My heart moves from being acidulous to being parsimonious.
