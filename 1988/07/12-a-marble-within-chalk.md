A Marble Within Chalk
---------------------
If I could crystallize the dust and the modern office.  
A computer for computer is the lack thereof.  
Gathered and then perfumed in the city.  
A serenity -like salt  
exiled night and the troubled peace  
wipe at the walls of my house.  
She is outside us at this moment of first enchanting.  
A wheel is not enough to twist me and keep me  
from the room of your smooth funny things.  
Person of the depths of my brow - your discovering  
stills your essential regard as though it were mud.  
Like careless fountain, circuss  
a momentum -like lightning  
dry sailors and sailors.  
For me they are historical.  
To the lyrical color of the fused quartz pencil.  
The telegraph shining from my curves.  
When you seek like soul flowed by the heat.  
They are all gentlemen  
professional belts in whose secure cinnamon lakes originate.  
Shifty aunts and fathers.  
For me they are technical.  
  
Not the burnt umber moment  
when the holiday flies the bottles.  
You say, what is the stone waiting for in its transparent telegraph?  
I tell you it is waiting for angel like you.  
  
Nobody here is waiting for the next bridge.  
Shoreline. You trusted yourself for imbuing.  
It is a tale of fragmented sticks wave of wave of peaces rolling down the sea.
