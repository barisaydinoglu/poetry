It Dedicated With Mosaics
-------------------------
Has the moonlight evening been breathed with secrets? It was a putrid business of alarm and shrapnels.  
But I should be untrue to computer science, bristling among its bitter writings  
so let us attempt to divulge a story devoid of algorithmic redundancies.  
A sunburst orange kis kisses.  
The blazing cousin  
weaves in the real morning.  
  
One of them is sensible,  
the other knows signals.  
Where is somebody  
he exclaims, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
I do not attack in the room of barbaous throat.
