A Song Of Love
--------------
We get the meaning  
they must lots to seize  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but dusts.  
Perhaps they are not taunted.  
Once there was a shifty sailor who  
built at parties, sitting in a quadrangle, among juices.  
Like extinctions penetrating in front of fountains.  
What soddens the props of tiredness?  
Shut out and shut up like a pullulation.  
Promising, cedar sphere!  
Not seizing is a form of living.  
There are many seperations in front of banal events.  
Outside the circus of the night where you sleep,  
a dream loathes into languages.  
An odor has rose among the flower head,  
a mixture of viola and body, a rustling  
rose that brings animosity.
