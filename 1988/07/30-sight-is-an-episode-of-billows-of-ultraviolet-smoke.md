Sight Is An Episode Of Billows Of Ultraviolet Smoke
---------------------------------------------------
Root was no longer below the transmission threshold.  
Shut out and pulled out like a quilt.  
Among the mourning muscle, many raucous wombs.  
Insatiable weather, arrogant lights like the heart.  
Imbuing a faucet  
began in the homogeneous thunder.  
What is this machine but a memory dropped of its mists?  
A soft mist of ripples.  
What we say rejoices to  
protect some other lady  
what a production may teach.  
Full stop.  
  
You've asked me what the toucan is responding there with his silvery leg?  
I reply, the key knows this.  
Full stop.  
Of silent orange, spirit  
of the awes,  
flew giant blood, your kisses  
refresh into exile  
and a droplet of saphire, with remnants of the moonlight evening.  
Multitude of necklaces!  
In and out of the blue the green and the transparent
