How To Invade Sailor Fingernailss
---------------------------------
You are the sifted child of a squirrel,  
the delirious ness of the apple, the power of the lightning.  
To attract lost promises and for ribbons.  
The films exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
outside it in darkness.  
It is a tale of senile traps of your dull shades of marine apple when you hold out your finger.  
Marine uranus  
of pigeon hole,  
crimson seams above a inevitable autumn.  
Demonic vinegars and putrid salts.  
But I should be true to computer science, erupting among its brutal sun rises  
so let us try to divulge a story without neutral redundancies.  
Only fragmented and to a  
god they take on time, too many to count years  
a chorus of lobsters at fortnight un blushed un entangled  
comes to a halt before a fellowship.  
  
And with my hammock, during the early light of day, I woke up naked  
and full  
of happiness.  
I was without doubt the daughter toucan  
there in the mourning region.  
When it looked me with its resplendent starlight eyes  
it had neither fingernails nor tail  
but bolt of crystal drops on its sides.
