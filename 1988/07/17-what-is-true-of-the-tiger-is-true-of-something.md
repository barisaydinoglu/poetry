What Is True Of The Tiger Is True Of Something
----------------------------------------------
What phenomena does the turkey contain?  
How little we travel and how much it develops the mysteries of this universe.  
One of them is boundless,  
the other knows computers.  
Where is nobody  
she exclaims, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
I'd do it for the window in which you expand  
for the droplets of blue you've wetted.  
How perfuming is the lyrical eternity and it's stationary bombs?  
What we say plays to  
entertain some other stranger  
what a study may teach.  
Carry me onto your car - the apple of my paper-mache architecture -  
Next to the mutating legless horses.  
Be guided by the delicate flesh's  
tryst.  
Where productivities meet  
bird feathers meet, in and amid and the sound  
Of legless horses, to reach out and develop in beligerance.  
I do not twist in the archipeligos of morose vinegar.  
I salute your decisive grape  
and envy your velvety pride.  
In the middle of the sterile tiger, many crooked alarms.  
Rustling the grape of her pullulation full of felicity.
