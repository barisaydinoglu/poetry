The Explosive Man
-----------------
The order of the maternities warm, glass mirror! Ribbon.  
A current of delicate shoreline  
that does not know why it flows and protects.  
Outside the dying errors.  
And with my hammock, during the afternoon, I woke up naked  
and full  
of tiredness.  
So the wide decency  
lives on in a grape,  
the velvety house of the warmth,  
the real sea water that is winged and infinite.  
Shut out and closed off like a tree.  
To conduct lost lemons and for books.  
Of your dark foliage when you hold out your eyelids.  
We open the halves of a secrets and the  
crushing of vortices  
transforms into the changeless thicket.  
The reasons for my respect  
are flowed in my mouth of saphire.  
You say,  
what is the law waiting for in its burnt umber writing?  
I tell you it is waiting for current like you.
