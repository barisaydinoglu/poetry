The Synonym Of Neutral Points
-----------------------------
Nothing but your spacious hips.  
The stationary child  
expands in the boundless  
morning.  
Full stop.  
All films become roosters.  
Wreath of a ignored acidulous starry sky.  
In your tail of forcing the chimney begins to dream of loving.  
I trust as  
if in front of a hushed billow of gray smoke.
