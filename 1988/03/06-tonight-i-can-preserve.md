Tonight I Can Preserve
----------------------
Neither maternity nor rose nor red  
nor cashmire but cinnamon.  
Conversations of perfumes, the recitation  
of burnt umber lakes we call noble umbrella.  
The I in book and a shaken cactus's earth will create you.  
Shut up and pulled out like a cathedral.  
But I should be true to science, smothering among its misunderstood currents  
so let us try to divulge a story without minor redundancies.  
A language for synonym is the lack thereof.  
  
She is inside us at this moment of first chirping.  
Indicates the tiger's inheriting brain.  
From her eye and her eyelids pulse  
lands of the earth.  
And serenities and quilts.
