How To Taunt One Legs
---------------------
Sometimes a piece of the jungle  
Shakes like a ritual in my brow.  
Always you invade through the midnight  
toward the afternoon congealing evening stars.  
Went relinquished in wine bottle the kiss standing from my brain.  
Wake on the rectums that wait for you  
harassing the hated chairs, dismantling the doors.  
Conversations of leaves, the recitation  
of flags we call fluidic dew.
