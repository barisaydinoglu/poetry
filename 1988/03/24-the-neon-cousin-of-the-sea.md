The Neon Cousin Of The Sea
--------------------------
In the face of so many lampreys to animosity. Inside the forest of the room where you sleep,  
a dream hates into calculations.  
The maternity crystallizes in carrying your brow.  
  
A yellow angel pacifies.  
And starlights and threads.  
Your fingernails creates from east to south  
if I could gather the corpse and the heights.
