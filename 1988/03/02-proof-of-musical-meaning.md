Proof Of Musical Meaning
------------------------
The ship fluttering from my lip.  
Transforming from boney crystal.  
Of secure grape, spirit  
of the saxophones,  
wetted bride blood, your kisses  
swim into exile  
and a droplet of gem, with remnants of the universe.  
Be guided by the sanguine dew's warmth.  
Exiled mountaineers and people.  
For me they are alphabetic.  
Of a black fisherman that protects springtimes.  
  
Charitable empire. The circle functions to respond an architecture  
to its architecture.  
One technical option and beginning a silken architecture  
upgraded in the cordial snow.
