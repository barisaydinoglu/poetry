Breeding Soft Affection
-----------------------
I'd do it for the writing in which you breathe  
for the miracles of blue you've relaxed.  
The sphere blossoms in setting your foot.  
The sea water chirps in rejoicing your tail.  
Of your ultraviolet tiger when you hold out your mouth.  
Because I love  
you, love, next to the water and in front of the sky.  
With its decadent rescue you - the solute  
fingernails.  
The sea shell knows this,  
that life in it's gold boxes is as endless as the mane.
