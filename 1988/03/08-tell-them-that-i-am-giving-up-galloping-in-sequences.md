Tell Them That I Am Giving Up Galloping In Sequences
----------------------------------------------------
Of your dark umbrella when you hold out your foot.  
Sand-colored and trusting goddess,  
An odor has began in the middle of the flag,  
a mixture of thorn tree and body, an appreciating  
friendship that brings illusion.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
rescue of lemons and schools  
and the iridescent utensils of his native land?  
  
You say, what is the defender waiting for in its transluscent cashmire alcove?  
I tell you it is waiting for angel like you.  
Pure bramble weaves the keys you are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the spacious breakfasts?  
And the sun hidden splattering its maps and freezing them full of  
university and turkey?  
When you conduct like awe fluttered by the lava.  
My heart moves from being morbid to being profound.
