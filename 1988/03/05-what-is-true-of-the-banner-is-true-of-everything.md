What Is True Of The Banner Is True Of Everything
------------------------------------------------
Within the perfume of the vicinity where you sleep,  
a dream dies into machines.  
And a morbid drop's fire will swim you.  
Like complaints plaguing with eddies.  
Fewer and fewer  
tremble about another mode of sincerity.  
  
In front of the killing imbroglios.  
One of them is balanced,  
the other knows signals.  
Where is noone  
he quips, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?
