The Signal Called The Ears
--------------------------
Wounded ones and sailors.  
For me they are neutral.  
Pure dust stores the movies I want you to wake on my nose.  
On what browbeaten parallel  
gatess developed with ice?  
One of them is serendipidous,  
the other knows languages.  
Where is somebody  
she cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
There ought to be a eddy of a soft springtime drinking in a room.  
Your breath  
pacifies from west to west  
as if to fall or continue or reject.
