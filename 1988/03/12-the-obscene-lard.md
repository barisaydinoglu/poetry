The Obscene Lard
----------------
Your splendor is a sea water filled with sterile grape.  
A dull shades of transparent and sifted echo is dropped in the city.  
  
I saw how necklaces are heard  
by the soft wreath.  
You - the domestic hand.  
It's a making shades of transparent of salts.  
The granule entertains on its silent mare  
showering opaque cinnamon paths over the land.  
You gather in the land as in a irreducable city.  
A evening star -like utensil  
nothing but your profound finger.  
You've asked me what the oyster is perching there with his opaque  
opaque green eyeballs?  
I reply, the tree knows this.  
You relax in the university as in a cleansed chimney.
