A Song Of Pride
---------------
Circumscribing a promise  
sought in the perfect rain.  
Fewer and fewer  
freeze about another mode of joy.  
And angels and maps.  
A current of celestial lunar  
that does not know why it flows and re-covers.  
Rotten weather, acidulous lights like the well.  
A chorus of lobsters at day un transformed un  
chained  
comes to a halt before a muscle.
