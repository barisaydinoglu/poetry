Since The End Of Congealing
---------------------------
But I should be true to photography, disguising among its phosphorus promises  
so let us attempt to speak a story devoid of individual redundancies.  
I want you to build on my ears.  
Only arrogant and to a  
goddess they take on time, too few to count years  
the sky solute receptacles are sobbed.  
  
Make on the wastelands that wait for you  
dismantling the imperalist chairs, ignoring the doors.  
What seems disjoint to one will  
not seem so to another.  
Some relinquish but I rejoice your brick like tree.  
A production for calculation is the lack thereof.
