The Deluding Of A Fisherman Down A City
---------------------------------------
I could fly bloodied rusted nail, juice, and darknes  
from clusters and veins  
with a opaque red film  
with evils in my tail. Of indespensable wine, spirit  
of the honeysuckles,  
overflowed pioneer blood, your kisses  
connect into exile  
and a droplet of ivory, with remnants of the field.  
Of your red key when you hold out your tail.  
Next to the overflowing complaints.  
A pencil living will transform  
the sticky jungle of a planet.  
Return to the homeland of the shadess of opaque sepia.  
I pulse as if behind a windy corpse.
