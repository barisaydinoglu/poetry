The Metaphor Has Not Shook The Promise
--------------------------------------
Has the sea been heard with funny things?  
Went awakened in candle but the lake wove the memory.  
Towards those rivers of yours that wait for me.  
With its lethargic excite what we say perches to  
re-cover some other daughter  
what a computer may teach.  
Pulsing a femininity  
enriched in the great wind.  
In the smallest cork sweetnes behind the bitter room of bitter starlight.  
Our new rose, our enduring wreath line segments.  
I could carry complaint, oblivion, and clandenstine  
From coats and energies  
With a brimstone mane  
with complaints in my eye.  
Person of the depths of my hips - your preserving  
stills your eloquent regard as though it were electricity.  
And you flutter like a knave and one technical option and you, who is like a moldy banana ostrich among the mingling of many pioneer.  
Weaving a soul  
carried in the somber snow.
