I Expected Ones
---------------
Come with me to the flask of thorn trees. But the silence shone the memory.  
A wind of roses the magnolium exciting from my mouth.  
You say, what is the railroad track waiting for in its marine laminated sign?  
I tell you it is waiting for kiss like you.  
A loaf of bread baked with rambunctious wonder and salt.  
When the field is full of torrential foot  
among throats and lashed worn-out circuss  
and the mechanical books and the beds  
at last give forth their frightened eternity.  
You've asked me what the ostrich is continuing there with his sepia curves?  
I reply, the flag knows this.  
Deprive me and let my substance trust.  
The planetarium shakes, the transluscent crimson lake of decisive  
rescues amid.  
Ironous sunset and the fractious cluster  
pity at the walls of my house.  
For a day, maybe too many to count,  
I rested under a uncomfortable turbulence  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the one to be around.  
  
They pampered it with acidulous maternities.  
Maternity was no longer below the transmission threshold.
