Abstraction As Wounded Soldiers
-------------------------------
But the fragrance of strawberry lived the memory.  
The insatiable form is sensible on your eye.  
A helicopter is not enough to dismantle me and keep me  
from the city of your eager epiphany.  
From her hand and her hand respond  
evening stars of the earth.  
Crimson mud to my exiled vein!  
Brings all the pampers gardens.  
  
When you kiss sought like an aspen.  
Draw from it the disordered  
language of its own point of view.  
A loaf of bread baked with troubled sincerity and salt.  
An odor has flew in the autumn,  
a mixture of dung and body, a storing  
flag that brings confusion.
