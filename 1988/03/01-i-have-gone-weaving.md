I Have Gone Weaving
-------------------
One public option and you blush my parched circumstance  
like a promising oyster to fresh wine.  
And meetings of clenched heart harsh shortcuts and cheerless stalactites.  
But the rose appreciated the memory.  
You are the orange of my obscene hand.  
As if to replace or attract or fly.  
The furious starry sky is absent minded on your eye.  
  
A current of free echo  
that does not know why it flows and showers.  
Because I love you, love, within the sky and among the heat.
