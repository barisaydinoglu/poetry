I Have Gone Wetting
-------------------
Under the whirlwinds of momentum, many boneless flasks.  
What serene peaces -  
the heights is filled with it,  
manes for the warmth of your body and the boney silken.  
I saw how flints are appreciated  
by the smooth goblet.  
A coral imbuing will relinquish  
the obscene sky of a planet.  
  
On what distorted bloodied sand refreshed with water?  
Circumscribed and then understood in the field.  
It was the day of the elephant.  
The ripple plan that has everyone lashed.  
Multitude of lunars!  
In and out of the sepia the cashmire and the marine  
  
It was the night of the lobster.  
The fatherless pheasant trusts among the delicate jugulars.
