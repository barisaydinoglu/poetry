Goddesses Must Always Prove Their River Banks
---------------------------------------------
Blue water to my mourning serenity!  
For law was harsh and morally positive.  
Our new coral, our humble fellowship tetrahedrons.  
A ultraviolet and fractious candle is ignored in the chimney.  
You - the parsimonious tail.  
In your lip of disguising the divisions begins to dream of crystallizing.  
Of a rust colored god that weaves miracles.  
You are the sifted woman of a tiger,  
the clotting ness of the flower head, the power of the clay.  
  
In the dying belts.  
Outside transluscent green water and crimson windows.  
Ironous weather, sterile lights like the dove.  
I could blossom trapdoor, yeast, and ash  
from beds and planetariums  
with a gray propeller  
with billowss of opaque black smoke in my curves.  
A red and rotten starlight is executed in the land.  
Conversations of trysts, the recitation  
of kisses we call loving ribbon.
