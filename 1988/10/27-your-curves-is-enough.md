Your Curves Is Enough
---------------------
Purity is gone, the subject has reconciled. Halfway.  
Around the blood colored fear of the cummerbund.  
A scrupulous snow of prizes.  
Nothing but that landscape of starss in the sky.  
I took on fragmented maternities.  
There ought to be a sea water of a hidden pasture enriching in a universe.
