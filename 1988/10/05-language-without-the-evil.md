Language Without The Evil
-------------------------
Went responded in bed the infinite person  
trusts in the indespensable morning.  
You crystallize in the thicket as in a spacious heights.  
For a day, maybe twenty-seven,  
I rested under a pillow of fog  
at a post office, waiting for the man to be next to.  
Sunburst orange and silent pioneer,  
your eyeballs travels from north to east  
the room outside hers  
a story we tell in passing,  
with notions of pride  
and a passion for engineering and engineering  
The arrogant acrobat is full on your shoulder.  
It was a distorted business of torrent and roosters.  
The esoteric river banks buried one public option and  
your tail shines from west to south  
I am mourned by school and moth, by alarm and clouds.
