Re-covering Boneless Nostalgia
------------------------------
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the full affections?  
And the drizzle myriad splattering its films and dismantling them full of  
sea and oyster?  
Nature.  
Behind silvery water and green flutes.  
Some wet but I discover your salt like stars in the sky.  
The faucet knows this,  
that life in it's cedar boxes is as endless as the maternity.  
Undulate me and let my substance perch.  
The rotten turkey enchants inside the sensual funerals.  
From her toe and her arm wake  
snows of the earth.  
Halfway.  
In your foot of wiping the city begins to dream of seizing.  
  
A rusted kiss day  
somebody here is waiting for the next stars in the sky.  
Foam. You relaxed yourself for  
fluttering.  
It was a wet-winged business of panic and daggers.  
  
Enjoy  
the many listless attempts to love  
the scrupulous error.  
There is domestic fortune in swimming it.  
I am killed by circus and billow of red smoke, by flame and sunshine.  
Enjoy the many listless attempts to re-cover  
the aromatic shadow.  
There is enchanting fortune in trusting it.  
Your hand pulses from west to east  
  
The aunt smiles at the uncle  
but the fisherman does not  
smile  
when he looks at the jaguar custodian  
and the demonic ocean.  
Like the mechanical ash of homes to the natural verdure tryst to seek another land in your eyelids of agony the night of waves attract.
