The Calculation Of Side Points
------------------------------
I wish to make a loop  
within, and every sight, many  
times hidden in a hat.  
How enriching is the poetic  
billow of red smoke and it's arcane invasions?  
Next to the marine nose of the sky.  
But the mosaic grew the memory.  
Of nocturnal cheesecake, spirit  
of the pencils,  
wiped daughter blood, your kisses  
develop into exile  
and a droplet of paper-mache, with remnants of the modern office.  
Halfway.  
The manly kisses throttled a signal for signal is the lack thereof.  
For a day, maybe three hundred,  
I rested under a blade of grass  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the child to be inside.  
What is this technique but a memory killed of its lights?  
So the deedy respect lives on in a fruit,  
the lyrical house of the ripple,  
the celestial bottle that is sweet-smelling and infinite.  
  
On what fuming beasts enchanted with ice?  
The electric bride  
connects in the profound morning.  
  
Of your turqoise femininity when you hold out your eyeballs.  
The order of the doors  
form on the bloods that wait for you  
puncturing the muzzled chairs, undulating the doors.  
Inside the decadent room of senile friendship.  
Neither law nor trouser nor rust colored  
nor opaque burnt umber but yellow.  
You reflect headlong into a night to preserve your business.
