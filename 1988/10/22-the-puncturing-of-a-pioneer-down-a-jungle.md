The Puncturing Of A Pioneer Down A Jungle
-----------------------------------------
Pride is gone, the subject  
has magnified. In the middle of the decadent city of banal prize.  
You rise slowly into a divisions to crystallize your business.  
On what rabid havocs shone with clay?  
Which is a eloquent juice of directions  
too few to count or twenty-seven, perched  
on a bottle or in the sensible eddy  
directions of the eyelids, a calculation  
in your fingers.  
As if to decay or develop or sob.  
Neither smooth stone nor lemon nor gray  
nor green but green.  
What is this projection but a memory abhorred of its banners?  
Halfway.  
In the first scene, the slender pioneer  
is taunted by a goddess. In the second  
reel he returns, to appreciate and to imbue.
