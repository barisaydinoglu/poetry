Tell Them That I Am Giving Up Preserving In Identities
------------------------------------------------------
Of a blood colored pioneer that rescues circuss.  
Flying the ritual of her dew full of tiredness.  
It seizes like a candle with the soul.  
A language for identity is the lack thereof.  
Relinquishing from difficult crystal.  
Hollow weather, sifted lights like the breakfast.  
  
A hips and a lip  
crystallizing the boulevard.  
Come with me to the lonely road of croaks.
