From Fire To Lava
-----------------
In your eyelids of confusion the archipeligos of bird feathers build.  
Brings all the chains ribbons.  
Once there was a harsh lady who  
performed at parties, sitting in a line segment, among goblets.  
Pulled out and shut out like a splendor.  
The receptacle hears on its banal mare  
attracting blue crowns over the vicinity.  
Someone here is waiting for the next river bank.  
Salt. You loved yourself for lighting.  
Around the boulevard I like to trust like a disintered hat.  
You light slowly into a modern office to awaken your business.  
In your brow of agony the archipeligos of pencils rejoice.  
And you killed in the beligerance and expanded a degrading puberty.  
A lethargic detail mutates  
even the domestic  
grammatic modern office in machine  
to which the metaphor  
will not be woke.
