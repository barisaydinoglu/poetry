Setting The Horse In Motion
---------------------------
It is a tale of tremulous dungs but I should be true to engineering, condemning among its hairy natures  
so let us try to tell a story devoid of historical redundancies.  
My heart moves from being rotten to being equinoctial.  
In your breath of confusion the archipeligos of roses perform.  
If I could flow the phlegm and the region.  
The bramble inherits on its lonely mare  
seizing green flags over the chimney.  
Multitude of stalkss of cattail!  
In and out of the opaque transluscent opaque blue the sand-colored and the opaque blue  
outside the universe like brick.  
Of your black cactus  
when you hold out your curves.  
  
How magnifying is the decisive scandalmongering and it's rosy juices?  
We get the faith  
they must lots to relinquish  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but darkness.  
Perhaps they are not buried.  
In my archipeligos at late afternoon you are like a starlight  
and your form and colour the way I awaken  
them.  
Exciting a smooth rusted nail  
attracted in the enduring drizzle.
