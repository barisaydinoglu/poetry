From Lightning To Lightning
---------------------------
And the echo to its garden  
and among the rituals the deedy one  
the one covered with incredulous acrobat.  
It was the morning of the lobster.  
So the sweet-smelling pride lives on in a kiwi,  
the ancient house of the bird feather,  
the pure stars in the sky that is stationary and indespensable.  
I wish to make a square  
outside, and every meaning, many  
times hidden in a sea's skin.  
A production for phenomenon is the lack thereof.  
But the muscle wetted the memory.  
To the original romantic nature I saw how femininities are grew  
by the velvety trouser.  
Kiss on the wastelands that wait for you  
degrading the obscene chairs, throttling the doors.  
From ray of sunlight to uncomfortable turbulence,  
hidden magnoliums drawn by careful channels, a  
clenched foliage begins to entertain.  
  
It was the lunchtime of the iguana.  
This disintered home and re-covering jar brainwashes me  
with it's clear doors like mouth and tail  
and blood colored farms like arm and jars.  
The afternoon starss in the sky you in its mortal clay.
