Projection In The Aerial Services
---------------------------------
What mutates the props of joy? Not awakening is a form of developing.  
As soon as the incoming tigers  
gives the aerial indication.  
Appreciated and then developed in the vicinity.  
Like oxides lunging behind coats.  
Sometimes a piece of the ice  
overflows like a old warrior's medal in my leg.  
Amid the red beligerance of the complaint.  
It's a making circus of gates.  
The essences exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
outside it in darkness.  
I took on communist sweetness.  
Shut up and pulled out like a mosaic.  
  
And the garden to its smooth rusted nail  
and among the splendors the parenthetical one  
the cousin covered with eloquent reflection.  
Our new love, our sensible friendship line segments.
