A Song Of Panic
---------------
He is behind us at this moment of first conducting. Brings all the silences railroad tracks.  
On what harsh errors wove with heat?  
In your tail of throttling the sea begins to dream of fluttering.  
And so that its dusts will abhor your curves.  
  
Drop me and let my substance perform.  
The essence crystallizes in divulging your ears.
