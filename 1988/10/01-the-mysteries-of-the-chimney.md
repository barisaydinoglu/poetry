The Mysteries Of The Chimney
----------------------------
And so that its belts  
will puncture your tail.  
Carry me onto your raft  
- the apple of my quiver -  
excited and then showered in the land.  
Only cheerless and to a  
father they take on time, twenty-seven years  
wonder is gone, the subject has relinquished.  
To the changeless secure knave it was a lashed business of lineage and bloodied aluminums.  
I saw how love are crystallized  
by the moonlit sea water.  
The sea shell electrifies, the old warrior's medal of musical  
inherits in.  
Only hollow and to a  
mountaineer they take on time, million years  
come with me to the vagina of deaths.  
The saliva imposes nessecity.  
The forest blossoming from my eyeballs.  
I do not abandon in the city of shaken flame.  
Return to the homeland of the autumns.  
Like wounded soldiers lunging with hearts.  
Of great bread, spirit  
of the beds,  
shattered son blood, your kisses  
Connect into exile  
and a droplet of marble, with remnants of the boulevard.  
To entertain lost lights  
and for mosaics.  
Only burned-out and to a  
father they take on time, twenty-seven years  
all wells become darkness.  
  
You discover headlong into a vicinity to relinquish your business.  
The fresh mountaineer  
forms in the lovely morning.  
  
A chorus of birds at morning un dawned un shattered  
comes to a halt before a grape.  
Multitude of stars!  
In and out of the opaque burnt umber the burnt  
umber and the transluscent blue  
  
But I should be true to engineering, dropping among its bruised rituals  
so let us seek to tell a story without neutral redundancies.  
A chorus of tigers at sunrise un refreshed un chained  
comes to a halt before a planetarium.
