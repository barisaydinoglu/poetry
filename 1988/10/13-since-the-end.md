Since The End
-------------
The goblet knows this,  
that life in it's silk boxes is as endless as the root.  
Which  
is a blazing law of directions  
three hundred or million, sought  
on a writing or in the deedy essence  
directions of the arm, a calculation in your eyes.  
We open the halves of a mysteries and the  
executing of egoes weaves into the charitable night.  
Because I love you, love, in the mud and next to the water.  
Here I am, a changeless hand wiped in the modern office of rose.  
Thirsty morning and the dead book  
coddle at the walls of my house.  
The moonlight evening inside hers  
a story  
we tell in passing,  
with notions of respect  
and a passion for science and jouranlism  
magnifying a river  
dawned in the electric sunshine.  
  
The wound imposes nessecity.  
If you were not the bread the decisive moon  
cooks, sprinkling its orange across the archipeligos.  
Inaccessible goddesses and mountaineers.  
For me they are technical.  
Of your rust colored light when you hold out your arm.  
Warmth of your body was no longer right at the recording threshold.  
Oily pigeon holes and delirious corruptions.  
A law -like wax  
realized nocturnal form in the smallest cork map a technique drinks,  
plagues - it does not  
return.  
The shifty coat that attracts in your defender.  
The order of the flints  
sorrow and tiger - ribbons of anger.  
Skeleton cousins and sons.  
For me they are grammatic.  
  
Sometimes a piece of the electricity  
replaces like a grace in  
my breath.  
Always you imprison  
through the sunrise  
toward the night invading clusters.
