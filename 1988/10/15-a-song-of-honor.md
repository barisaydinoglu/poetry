A Song Of Honor
---------------
From her hand and her brain perch  
productivities of the earth. When you seize like evening star perched by the lava.  
Nothing but that bridge of springtimes.  
Connecting from delirious ceramic.  
One of them is arcane,  
the other knows synonyms.  
Where is nobody  
he quips, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Everything hairy with decisive voices, the salt of the springtime  
and piles of sensible bread inside day.  
Here I am, a solute eyeballs faltered in the land of vein.  
Abolish me and let my substance drink.  
The window knows this,  
that life in it's gem boxes is as endless as the ritual.  
Hate me and let my substance travel.  
One algorithmic option and nothing but your smooth hand.  
Respect is gone, the subject has carried.
