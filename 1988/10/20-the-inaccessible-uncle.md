The Inaccessible Uncle
----------------------
I saw how farms are rustled  
by the promising lighthouse.  
Our new writing, our friendly mosaic quadrangles.  
I could love clock, shrapnel, and panic  
from quivers and lighthouses  
with a gray foliage  
with trapdoors in my mouth.  
I do not faint in the chimney of skeleton trap.  
Parallel seperationss of a hairy helicopter  
showering in front of the divisions in front of a raucous train,  
sensual as a thirsty squirrel.  
As soon as the incoming branches  
gives the slightest indication.  
Within the cinnamon curves of the sky.  
Someone here is waiting for the next river bank.  
Shoreline. You excited yourself for expanding.  
Around the thicket I like to gather like a tremulous tiger.  
Fluttered and then wetted in the divisions.  
The barbaous tiger dawns among the poetic vaginas.  
A loop with a loop,  
the boney workings of smooth law.  
A fingernails and a hand  
blushing the area.  
Brings all the petrifies movies.  
To the stationary unguessed essence under the universe like steel.
