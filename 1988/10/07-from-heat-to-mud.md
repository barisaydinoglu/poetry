From Heat To Mud
----------------
Where drops meet  
wheatfields meet, inside and in front of and the sound  
of waxes, to reach out and inherit in panic.  
Multitude of laminated signs!  
In and out of the burnt umber the transluscent transluscent green and the burnt umber  
Loathe me and let my substance awaken.  
I could circumscribe howl, imbroglio, and stick  
from sun rises and awes  
with a red landscape  
with pamphlets in my ears.  
  
You, who is like a viola lobster among the relinquishing of many one.  
Guitar was no longer right at the recording threshold.  
Like mourning flag, mists  
a foam magnifying will swim  
the disordered lightning of a planet.  
If you were not the cheesecake the serendipidous moon  
cooks, sprinkling its peach across the jungle.
