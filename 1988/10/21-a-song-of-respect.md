A Song Of Respect
-----------------
The nocturnal son  
promises in the acerb morning.  
The order of the writings one of them is stationary,  
the other knows projections.  
Where is noone  
she quips,  
and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
In yellow water and sepia pencils.  
The thicket behind hers  
a tale we tell in passing,  
with notions of honor  
and a passion for jouranlism and mountaineering  
be guided by the ancient rose's mosaic.
