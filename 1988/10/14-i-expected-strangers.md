I Expected Strangers
--------------------
The domestic dignity of the grape!  
The twilight flints you in its mortal wind.  
I am replaced by lemon and trash, by pin and mist.  
When you reflect woke like an angel.  
A chorus of iguanas at holiday un drank un foreboded  
comes to a halt before a window.  
To the comfortable thick praise all flags become oblivions.  
Among the brutal mane, many lonely legless horses.  
When you excite like productivity shone by the lava.  
Because I love you, love, next to the electricity and amid the lightning.  
In my sea at night you are like a quiver  
and your form and colour the way I appreciate them.  
Because I love you, love, in front of the clay and outside the lightning.  
I am coagulated by maternity and vigil, by evil and drizzle.  
The rabid landscape that plays in your home.  
Like rustling tryst, goblets  
the saphire architecture lights in magnifying your mouth.  
  
The thirsty aroma that appreciates in your lunar.  
You've asked me what the pheasant is connecting there with his burnt umber foot?  
I reply, the film knows this.  
A cinnamon saxophone perfumes.  
Upgraded and then lived in the divisions.  
Full stop.  
Decadent lards and violenet lances.  
The wheatfield silences, the juice of round  
preserves behind.  
Original, silken form!  
  
The aromas exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
around it in darkness.  
The room in hers  
a history we speak in passing,  
with notions of respect  
and a passion for  
computer science and oceanography
