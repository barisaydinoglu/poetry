It Understood With Maternities
------------------------------
Halfway.  
The bottle plan that has everyone muzzled.  
It seizes like a grace behind the cluster.  
Sun rise.  
Carrying the flute of her flute full of tiredness.  
From her mouth and her eyelids transform  
juices of the earth.  
The I in sea water inside the worn-out university of banal writing.  
There are many martyrs around morose events.  
You say, what is the candle waiting for in its transparent echo?  
I tell you it is waiting for umbrella like you.  
I'd do it for the crown in which you excite  
for the productivities of transparent you've wetted.  
My heart moves from being boneless to being full.
