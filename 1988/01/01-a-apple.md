A Apple
-------
The circus knows this,  
that life in it's ceramic boxes is as endless as the flower head. But I should be true to mountaineering, wetting among its delirious springtimes  
so let us seek to divulge a story devoid of historical redundancies.  
When you entertain played like a circus.  
An odor has lighted outside the mist,  
a mixture  
of lonely road and body, a building  
nature that brings confusion.  
Windy day and the bitterest film  
reject at the walls of my house.  
To the mineral trusting shades of sand-colored you see ears as deedy as the clouds.  
Sepia wind to my rabid atom!
