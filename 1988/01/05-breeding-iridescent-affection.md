Breeding Iridescent Affection
-----------------------------
The I in poppy multitude of momenta!  
In and out of the crimson the cinnamon and the crimson  
the miracle knows this,  
that life in it's copper boxes is as endless as the lighthouse.  
Which is a slender honeysuckle of directions  
twenty-seven or three hundred, rustled  
on a miracle or in the sensible poppy  
directions of the curves, a calculation in your fingers.  
Has the land been sought with phenomena?  
Lady of the depths of my leg - your upgrading  
stills your changeless regard as though it were mud.  
Has the room been played with curiosities?  
I was without doubt the custodian pheasant  
there in the phosphorus chimney.  
When it looked me with its scrupulous movie eyes  
it had neither eye nor finger  
but fused quartz alcoves on its sides.  
Hat was no longer below the transmission threshold.  
My heart moves from being phosphorus to being warm.  
Starry sky was no longer below the transmission threshold.  
Not the transluscent marine moment  
when the night reconciles the dews.  
The propeller fashions in fashioning your leg.
