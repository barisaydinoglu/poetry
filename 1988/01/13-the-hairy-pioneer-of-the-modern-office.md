The Hairy Pioneer Of The Modern Office
--------------------------------------
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the self-assured branches?  
And the rain human splattering its warmths and abolishing them full of  
universe and cat?  
The eloquent warmths coagulated conversations of spheres, the recitation  
of writings we call humble hoove.  
Not living is a form of refreshing.  
How seeking is the sweet-smelling bloody feather and it's eloquent wounded soldiers?  
My heart moves from being troubled to being deedy.  
The moon appreciating from my eye.  
Draw from it the motionless  
detail of its own signal.  
Multitude of utensils!  
In and out of the sand-colored the transparent and the cinnamon  
you awaken in the archipeligos as in a serendipidous region.  
  
Your home is a moon filled with putrid bell.
