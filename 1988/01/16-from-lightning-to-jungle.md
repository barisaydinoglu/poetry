From Lightning To Jungle
------------------------
In your brow of harassing the universe begins to dream of storing.  
When the universe is full of senile hand  
in front of dusts and spoiled troubled telegraphs  
and the calcerous love and the awes  
At last give forth their fragmented blood.
