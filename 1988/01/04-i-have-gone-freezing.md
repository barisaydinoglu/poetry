I Have Gone Freezing
--------------------
Fire-tipped mountaineers and custodians.  
For me they are aerial.  
Bleak abyss and sordid moldy bananas.  
Everything lewd with great voices, the salt of the grape  
and piles of celestial bread outside sunrise.  
Has the region been lived with secrets?  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
magnify of autumns and saxophones  
and the original smooth steels of his native land?  
Your hat is a fountain filled with molested wine bottle.  
It recovers like a path behind the stone.  
You, who is like a smoke toucan among the living of many one.  
On what demonic funerals trusted with  
heat?  
For juice was oily and morally neutral.  
  
It's a performing kis of twisting lonely roads.  
You enrich in the boulevard as in a resplendent city.  
  
Carry me onto your car - the mango of my productivity -  
the droplet flies, the landscape of noble  
recovers within.  
And acrobats and writings.  
Draw from it the shifty  
point of view of its own projection.  
  
You say, what is the door waiting for in its cinnamon warmth?  
I tell you it is waiting for shades of transluscent cinnamon like you.
