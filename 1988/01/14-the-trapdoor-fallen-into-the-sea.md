The Trapdoor Fallen Into The Sea
--------------------------------
To the aromatic color of the gold droplet.  
I was without doubt the woman pheasant  
there in the careless modern office.  
When it looked me with its deedy old warrior's medal eyes  
it had neither brain nor foot  
but saphire flower heads on its sides.  
The sunrise maps you in its mortal lava.  
They mutated it with bruised mirrors.  
Because I love you, love, with the water and inside the sky. And you deformed in the confusion and understood a deceiving gate.  
Of your gray guitar when you hold out your tail.
