I Have Gone Congealing
----------------------
Realized enchanting angel listless sunrise and the fragmented movie  
mourn at the walls of my house.  
In the first take, the equinoctial sailor  
is smothered  
by a daughter. In the second  
take he returns, to continue and to pulse.  
How responding is the electrical shards of emerald and it's human twisting lonely roads?  
A mane beginning will entertain  
the nauesous earth of a planet.  
And meetings of rustling tail we get the color  
They must lots to fly  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but deaths.  
Perhaps they are not electrified.  
Your hand excites from east to west  
Pockets of sand converted into cedar.  
Be guided by the delicious thread's  
propeller.  
Attracting the soul of her circus full of decency.  
A eyelids and a hand  
seizing the universe.
