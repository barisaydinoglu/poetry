Inside the disordered sea of disintered sea shell.  
Like the bleak graphite of atoms it kisses like an autumn in front of the serenity.  
One  
of them is wide,  
the other knows calculations.

she exclaims, and when can we see what  
is going to happen? Amid the burnt umber eye of the lightning.  
Neither lighthouse nor vein nor dull shades of silvery  
nor crimson but crimson.
