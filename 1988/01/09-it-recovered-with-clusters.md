It Recovered With Clusters
--------------------------
It continues  
like a curtain with the dove.  
A boney banner day  
the shades of sand-colored making from my heart.  
Morose weather, shifty lights like the nature.  
In your foot of smothering the vicinity begins to dream of understanding.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.
