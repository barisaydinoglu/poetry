The Secrets Of The Sea
----------------------
A circle in a circle,  
the thirsty workings of steady law.  
There are no oblivions but nauesous cycles of femininity and transparent  
bird feathers of dashing arrogant broken glass.  
A writing focuses its dream of a new ending, its new beginning, the beginning of the banner order -  
its moonlit circumstances.  
Mingling from forceful gem.  
The mirror  
pulsing from my lip.  
A point of view for synonym is the lack thereof.  
Under the night like brick.  
One of them is celestial,  
the other knows identities.  
Where is nobody  
she exclaims, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Pockets of iron converted into ceramic.  
How entertaining is the friendly circumstance and it's cosmic nails?  
Draw from it the mechanical  
machine of its own metaphor.  
I want you to perform on my nose.  
What falls the props of wonder?  
What epiphany does the tiger contain?  
How little we entertain and how much it treads the secrets of this computer simulation.  
There ought to be a dew of a great landscape showering in a jungle.  
Disintered  
yeasts and ironous graves.
