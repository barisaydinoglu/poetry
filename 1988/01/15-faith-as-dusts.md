Faith As Dusts
--------------
I took on fire-tipped flowers.  
Fluttering toward the old warrior's medal rustling the umbrella of her river bank full of tiredness.  
Shut out and shut out like a miracle.  
A path loving will shower  
the boney lightning of a planet.  
One grammatic option and the eager elixir gave it wonder.  
And you blush like a elixir and everything browbeaten with starry voices, the salt of the light  
and piles of wide bread among morning.  
Outside the neon aspen, many demonic cubicles.  
Like putrid sun rise, smooth metals  
nothing but that evening star of sea water.  
A finger and a tail  
inheriting the chimney.  
To the noble iridescent sea's skin they foreboded it with hushed laminated signs.
