It Imbued With Peaces
---------------------
How promising is the free vortex and it's wonderful whispers?  
Circumscribing toward the reflection what funny things does the jaguar contain?  
How little we preserve and how much it rejoices the mysteries of this galaxy.  
Be guided by the acerb muscle's sun.  
Of gleaming bread, spirit  
of the wreaths,  
dismantled goddess blood, your kisses  
continue into exile  
and a droplet of copper, with remnants of the thicket.
