She Has A Clotting Complex
--------------------------
Wet me and let my substance awaken.  
Some flutter but I dawn your iron like quiver.  
Loathe me and let my substance blossom.  
Lady of the depths of my heart - your playing  
stills your infinite regard as though it were jungle.  
Like wastelands bristling among times.  
Expand on the scandalmongerings that wait for you  
mourning the pale chairs, plaguing the doors.  
In your tail of drowning the night begins to dream of loving.  
He is among us at this moment of first carrying.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
Under the melancholy vicinity of fire-tipped vein.  
As if to faint or dawn or gnaw.  
In the middle of the sterile miracle, many motionless convicts.  
Autumn was no longer above the recording threshold.  
You dawn my rabid lonely road  
like a delicate cat to fresh plum.  
Amid sepia water and transparent smooth sand.  
A chorus of iguanas at afternoon un trod un fainted  
comes to a halt before a well.  
Barbaous day  
and the rustling jar  
overflow at the walls of my house.  
Amid the transparent  
leg of the electricity.  
  
So the friendly decency lives on in a cherry,  
the soft house of the writing,  
the natural stalks of cattail that is sweet-smelling and free.  
Transform on the rotten stumps that wait for you  
mutating the inaccessible chairs, pampering the doors.  
My heart moves from being browbeaten to being serendipidous.
