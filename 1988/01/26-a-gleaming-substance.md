A Gleaming Substance
--------------------
What is this identity but a memory overflowed of its wells?  
The doves exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
in it in darkness.  
The vein standing from my toe. In the first scene, the lion hearted pioneer  
is deceived by a gentleman. In the second  
scene he returns, to shower and to reconcile.  
There are no seperations but pale cycles of heart and deep brown  
shorelines of musical inevitable salt.
