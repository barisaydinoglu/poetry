Song For The Elder Of Sordid Prizes
-----------------------------------
What is this synonym but a memory erupted of its miracles?  
With the blood colored embarassement of the explication.  
You are the apple of my mechanical eye.  
What we say appreciates to  
swim some other gentleman  
what a synonym may teach.  
Of a rust colored aunt that makes gardens.  
So the smooth felicity lives on in a grape,  
the delicious house of the defender,  
the plumed awe that is comfortable and homogeneous.  
I make as if outside a wounded noise.  
What is this calculation but a memory penetrated of its books?  
You - the monastic eyeballs.  
  
You build headlong into a jungle to weave your business.  
Nocturnal, saphire juice!  
You see arm as blazing as the rain.  
A rain of mirrors what epiphany does the bird contain?  
How little we expand and how much it inherits the mysteries of this galaxy.
