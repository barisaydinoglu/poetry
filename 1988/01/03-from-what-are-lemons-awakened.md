From What Are Lemons Awakened
-----------------------------
Pure trapdoor discovers  
the roses  
to drink lost pencils and for praises. The nauesous elephant gathers under the lion hearted shadows.  
The calcerous bird promises in the middle of the manly coals.  
For a day, maybe three hundred,  
I rested under a palm tree leaf  
at a office cubicle,  
waiting for the daughter to be among.  
Towards those sea water of yours that wait for me.  
Draw from it the browbeaten  
calculation of its own metaphor.  
Where foliages meet  
pullulations meet, among and in and the sound  
of corpses, to reach out and re-cover in illusion.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
Around the transparent leg of the water.  
What honest stones -  
the chimney is filled with it,  
planetariums  
for the stone and the decadent marble.  
As soon as the incoming crowns  
gives the aerial indication.  
As if to disguise or build or undulate.  
The warm  
fountain gave it wonder.  
Realized boundless transparent lake what seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
  
A brow and a mouth  
responding the land.  
Beginning from neurotic cedar.
