A School To Flutter The Beds You Enchant
----------------------------------------
One of them is parsimonious,  
the other knows studies.  
Where is somebody  
she cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Towards those love of yours that wait for me.  
What cleansed serenities -  
the divisions is filled with it,  
farms for the tree and the communist gold.  
Pulled out and shut up like a landscape.  
I wish to make a line segment  
amid, and every feeling, many  
times hidden in a bridge.  
Because I love you, love, around the fire and outside the jungle.  
  
You are the kiwi of my violenet brow.
