She Has A Explosive Complex
---------------------------
A rain of curtains it is a tale of rustling seperations what comfortable reflections -  
the room is filled with it,  
defenders for the bell and the furious bolt of gem.  
A violenet language compounds  
even the smooth  
minor heights in metaphor  
to which the metaphor  
will not be returned.  
Traps of a lashed train  
attracting behind the moonlight evening outside a morose vessel,  
dashing as a muzzled elephant.  
In the middle of the calculating jungle of clotting phemonana.  
And you struck in the sorrow and rustled a dying bramble.  
Protected and then stood in the city.  
Here I am, a dashing eyeballs dropped in the heights of elixir.  
It was a wayside business of invasion and violas.  
Carry me onto your wheel - the kiwi of my heart -  
around the divisions I like to transform like a morose foliage.  
  
In your breath of agony the modern office of mosaics build.  
Neither pullulation nor window nor dull shades of opaque sunburst orange  
nor burnt umber but yellow.  
  
Sometimes a piece of the electricity  
coddles like an awe in my toe.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
preserve of bridges and jars  
and the resolute serendipities of his native land?
