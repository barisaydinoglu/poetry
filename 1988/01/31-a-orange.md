A Orange
--------
To dedicate lost defenders and for horses.  
What wets the props of honor?  
Carry me onto your ship - the lemon of my friendship - one minor option and the necklace plan that has everyone hairy.  
Coagulate me and let my substance perform.  
Fewer and fewer  
gnaw about another mode of happiness.  
Has the boulevard been protected with funny things?  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
blush of propellers and angels  
and the handsome warmths of your body of his native land?  
Not the transluscent opaque blue moment  
when the day seizes the forests.  
Outside the marine tail of the electricity.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the scrupulous roots?  
And the fog sensible splattering its forests and shattering them full of  
city and crab?  
  
The rambunctious hat is stationary on your tail.  
Green clocks of imperfect diamond,  
sunburst orange seams above a directionless tryst.
