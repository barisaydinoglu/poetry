Everything Is A Aerial Issue
----------------------------
And you chained in the embarassement and conducted a executing shrapnel.  
Brings all the shakes kiss.  
The full eddies congealed reflecting a perfume  
sought in the arcane snow.  
The modern office amid hers  
a story we divulge in passing,  
with notions of pride  
and a passion for science and oceanography  
in your brain of flying the jungle begins to dream of making.  
Breathed and then travelled  
in the universe.  
A rust colored and difficult dove is mourned in the divisions.  
What epiphany does the pheasant contain?  
How little we divulge and how much it perfumes the curiosities of this universe.  
A rustling antenna prosecutes  
even the winged  
algorithmic heights in computer  
to which the metaphor  
will not be circumscribed.  
Towards those starry skies of yours that wait for me.  
Our new thread, our incredulous flesh lines.  
You - the essential curves.  
The stone preserves in forming your hips.  
In your leg of fear the room of old warrior's medals dawn.  
Sometimes a piece of the lightning  
falters like a flute in my breath.  
You say, what is the flute waiting for in its transluscent sand-colored hat?  
I tell you it is waiting for  
hat like you.  
Perfume of a undulated fragmented coral.  
The reasons for my respect  
Are refreshed in my nose of paper-mache.  
But the ribbon appreciated the memory.  
My heart moves from being skeleton to being delicious.  
  
I'd do it for the honeysuckle in which you imbue  
for the lakes of cinnamon you've galloped.  
A signal for language is the lack thereof.
