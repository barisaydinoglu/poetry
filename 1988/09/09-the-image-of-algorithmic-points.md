The Image Of Algorithmic Points
-------------------------------
I saw how candles are upgraded  
by the homogeneous serendipity. Autumn of a petrified silent sphere.  
And you store like a miracle and I took on harsh hats.  
  
You see eyelids as eager as the sun.  
Only exiled and to a  
custodian they take on time, too many to count years  
apple of a brainwashed violenet acrobat.  
Our new candle, our romantic sun rise lines.
