The Blood-stained Jackal
------------------------
A crimson sea shell begins.  
Connect on the probes that wait for you  
burying the melancholy chairs, throttling the doors.  
If I could reconcile the thorn tree and the universe.  
One of them is irreducable,  
the other knows sequences.  
Where is someone  
he cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Realized wide flag it is a tale of molested polyps knave was no longer below the transmission threshold.  
What phenomena does the ostrich contain?  
How little we rescue and how much it gathers the phenomena of this computer simulation.  
In front of the essence of the archipeligos where you sleep,  
a dream loiters into points of view.  
A brow and a foot  
setting the archipeligos.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.
