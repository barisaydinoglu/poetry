The Harsh Child Of The Field
----------------------------
Anger and telegraph - dews of embarassement.  
Perching from rambunctious cedar.  
  
My poetic ears reconciles you always.  
Of acerb orange, spirit  
of the cathedrals,  
chained gentleman blood, your kisses  
perform into exile  
and a droplet of diamond, with remnants of the land.  
The kisses exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
around it in darkness.
