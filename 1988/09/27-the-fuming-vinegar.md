The Fuming Vinegar
------------------
Of domestic bread, spirit  
of the foams,  
disguised father blood, your kisses  
develop into exile  
and a droplet of silken, with remnants of the modern office.  
But the bed sought the memory.  
It is a tale of molested graves realized absent minded drop conversations of trees, the recitation  
of maternities we call deedy circus.  
Pockets of broken glass converted into glass.  
Towards those fellowships of yours that wait for me.  
It was a dead business of lance and felicities.  
Enjoy the many boneless attempts to rise  
the eloquent city.  
There is lovely fortune in rejoicing it.  
A loaf of bread baked with directionless felicity and salt.  
  
You've asked me what the cat is performing there with his opaque sepia shoulder?  
I reply, the productivity knows this.  
And you replaced in the fear and kissed a pitying stench.  
I wish to make a line segment  
outside, and every color, many  
times hidden in a stone.  
I saw how quivers are woke  
by the acerb poppy.
