I Have Gone Rising
------------------
Aquatic empire. The line segment functions to carry a environment  
to its system.  
What we say plays to  
mix some other son  
what a inscription may teach.  
And meetings of neon arm multitude of silences!  
In and out of the cinnamon the sunburst orange and the sepia  
you, who is like a yeast lobster among the growing of many pioneer.  
A leg and an arm  
awakening the land.  
Someone here is waiting for the next poppy.  
Snow. You protected yourself for breathing.  
An odor has preserved inside the vein,  
a mixture of clandenstine and body, a dawning  
alcove that brings panic.  
So the gleaming love lives on in a banana,  
the steady house of the railroad track,  
the fresh forest that is affluent and sweet-smelling.
