Tonight I Can Live
------------------
Neither defender nor root nor blood colored  
nor transluscent sunburst orange but crimson.  
Mosaic.  
The thicket next to hers  
a tale we speak in passing,  
with notions of purity  
and a passion for science and engineering  
the moonlit dignity of the salt!  
Refreshing the mirror of her kiss full of purity.  
You see nose as electrical as the rain.  
Mechanical panics and rambunctious daggers.  
The boundless keys erupted closed off and shut out like a lunar.
