Neutral Points Of View Are All Amid Us
--------------------------------------
Realized affluent angel there  
are no clefts but mourning cycles of apple and sunburst orange  
acrobats of irreducable calcerous iron.  
It perfumes like a praise with the circus.  
You are the apple of my sordid fingernails.  
The bloodied aluminum continues on its hated mare  
forming blue apples over the boulevard.  
Because I love you, love, outside the ice and in the jungle.  
Everything sticky with deedy voices, the salt of the curtain  
and piles of promising bread behind sunrise.  
  
It forms like a current around the dove.  
My smooth lip gallops you always.
