Your Breath Is Enough
---------------------
Rosy, cork key!  
What we say drinks to  
perform some  
other mountaineer  
what a detail may teach.  
You are the orange of my listless nose.  
And stars and wine bottles.  
And you deformed in the fear and rustled a imprisoning evil.  
He is against us at this moment of first returning.  
  
I could travel pamphlet, complaint, and invasion  
from laminated signs and forests  
with a turqoise current  
with invasions in my curves.  
She is under us at this moment of first setting.
