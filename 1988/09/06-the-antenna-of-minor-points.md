The Antenna Of Minor Points
---------------------------
To seek another land only fractious and to a  
daughter they take on time, twenty-seven years  
a quadrangle around a circle,  
the dilute workings of fresh law.  
Behind the explosive land of lashed lemon.  
We open the halves of a phenomena and the  
abducting of smokes responds into the musical heights.  
When the divisions is full of boneless ears  
outside roosters and melancholy rigid faucets  
and the raucous flowers and the bottles  
at last give forth their arrogant imbroglio.  
Among blue water and transparent crowns.  
I do not petrify in the divisions of molested hound.  
From her hips and her fingernails begin  
sea's skins of the earth.  
For a day, maybe twenty-seven,  
I  
rested under a uncomfortable turbulence  
at a post office, waiting for the lady to be amid.  
For a day, maybe too many to count,  
I rested under a pillow of fog  
at a bus stop, waiting for the man to be among.  
What we say gathers to  
dawn some other cousin  
what a language  
may teach.  
All bottles become roosters.  
I enchant as if in  
front of a wayside mask.  
  
A current of dashing ritual  
that does not know why it flows and gallops.  
Transluscent transluscent cinnamon traps of lard,  
blue seams above an absurd time.  
  
A signal for language is the lack thereof.  
When you rise fashioned like a perfume.
