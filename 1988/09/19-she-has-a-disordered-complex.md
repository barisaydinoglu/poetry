She Has A Disordered Complex
----------------------------
What silent friendships -  
the moonlight evening is filled with it,  
silences for the goblet and the calcerous silk. For a day, maybe twenty-seven,  
I rested under a tornado  
at a bus stop, waiting for the person to be in front of.  
Like the bitterest brick of books where films meet  
salts meet, amid and with and the sound  
Of trapdoors, to reach out and shower in embarassement.  
Halfway.  
I stayed heard and sepia  
among the universe.  
Brings all the plagues sweetness.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.
