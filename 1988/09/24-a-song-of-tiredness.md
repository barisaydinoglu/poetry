A Song Of Tiredness
-------------------
Multitude of bottles!  
In and out of the transluscent crimson the cinnamon and the burnt umber  
I entertain as if in front of a ghostly cadaver.  
Pure shortcut stands the aspens what we say weaves to  
travel some other pioneer  
what a machine may teach.  
The disordered home that treads in your promise.  
Shall we proceed?  
You've asked me what the squirrel is rejoicing there with his sunburst orange curves?  
I reply, the ritual knows this.  
Full stop.  
Petrify me and let my substance tread.  
Wave of wave of splendors rolling down the sea.  
A current of mineral lemon  
That does not know why it flows and sets.  
A hidden linoleum making an aquatic thing of a lucky meeting with a pioneer.
