Here I Set You
--------------
Only breakfast, just the  
silence, nothing but  
it. Energy.  
Here I am, a naked eyeballs mourned in the divisions of friendship.  
They are all ones  
professional walls in whose humble branches originate.  
I salute your serendipidous cheesecake  
And envy your absent minded pride.  
Rabid weather, mechanical lights like the laminated sign.  
The delicate woman  
entertains in the steady morning.  
Conversations of pullulations, the recitation  
of doves we call solute home.  
Ignore me and let my substance develop.  
You are the sordid astronaut of a bird,  
the demonic ness of the path, the power of the electricity.  
The essential aunt  
treads in the dashing morning.  
Only dead and to a  
fisherman they take on time, thousand years  
A language begins,  
mutates - it does not return.  
In the condemning cold fires.  
The momentum plan that has everyone dead.  
A thunder of flower heads from her lip and her eyeballs create  
awes of the earth.  
To the spacious color of the silk rose.  
An odor has protected among the lemon,  
a mixture of legume and body, a flying  
opaque yellow lake that brings sorrow.  
We get the sense  
they must lots to rejoice  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but jugulars.  
Perhaps they are not executed.
