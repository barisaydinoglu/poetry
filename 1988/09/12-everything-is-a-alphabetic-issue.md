Everything Is A Alphabetic Issue
--------------------------------
My heart is filled with honor like a wooden yellow lake. I salute your rosy orange  
and envy your sensual pride.  
Acerb empire. The tetrahedron functions to perch an architecture  
to its system.  
  
Like rigid springtime, miracles  
in front of the light of the universe where you sleep,  
a dream strikes into machines.  
The blood stands on its banal mare  
seeking sand-colored atoms over the room.  
Where serenities meet  
flutes meet, with and behind and the sound  
of pigeon holes, to reach out and love in embarassement.  
A turqoise and calcerous wave is  
shook in the land.  
From her tail and her hips crystallize  
atoms of the earth.  
A current of celestial springtime  
that does not know why it flows and stands.  
Decency is gone, the subject has enriched.
