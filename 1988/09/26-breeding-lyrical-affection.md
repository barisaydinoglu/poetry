Breeding Lyrical Affection
--------------------------
But I should be true to oceanography, abhorring among its lewd spheres  
so let us attempt to divulge a story devoid of slightest redundancies.  
The grape connecting from my tail.  
Not the green moment  
when the day wakes the momenta.  
One of them is full,  
the other knows techniques.  
Where is nobody  
he says, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
There ought to be a stalks of cattail of a resolute utensil rustling in a field.  
She is against us at this moment of first connecting.  
With its misunderstood weave you - the somber lip.  
And a violenet telegraph's wind will preserve you.  
In the first scene, the promising child  
is executed by a pioneer. In the second  
take he returns, to relax and to fly.  
I took on disordered hearts.  
With its fire-tipped pulse I'd do it for the affection in which you blush  
for the autumns of crimson you've galloped.  
  
As soon as the incoming circuss  
gives the technical indication.
