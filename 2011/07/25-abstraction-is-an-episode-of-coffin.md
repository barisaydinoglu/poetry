Abstraction Is An Episode Of Coffin
-----------------------------------
The absurd breakfast is human on your lip.  
When you recover like sweetnes galloped by the wind.  
The plumed dignity of the ship!  
I wish to make a line segment  
behind, and every feeling, many  
times hidden in a film.  
It was a windy business of legume and martyrs.  
Shifty fishermen and fishermen.  
For me they are slightest.  
Hounds of a raucous ship  
weaving within the modern office around a callous car,  
hidden as a rambunctious pheasant.
