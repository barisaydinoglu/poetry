The Identity Of Grammatic Points
--------------------------------
Your heart excites from east to east we get the hearing  
they must lots to store  
to each  
other  
or perhaps nothing but wounded soldiers.  
Perhaps they are not overflowed.  
And a tremulous heart's water will respond you.  
The trusting telegraph gave it decency.  
Like the banal sand of fountains one of them is monastic,  
the other knows details.  
Where is everybody  
he cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
The current knows this,  
that life in it's silicon boxes is as endless as the propeller.  
In your shoulder of taunting the vicinity begins to dream of fashioning.  
  
Of a gray custodian that trusts planetariums.  
Carry me onto your bicycle - the tomato of my foliage -  
Towards those pastures of yours that wait for me.
