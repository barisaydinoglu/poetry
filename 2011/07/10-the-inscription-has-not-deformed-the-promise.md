The Inscription Has Not Deformed The Promise
--------------------------------------------
A line segment among a triangle,  
the disintered workings of sensible law.  
Son of the depths of my hand - your standing  
stills your decisive regard as though it were mud.  
What filters the props of purity?  
Coddle me and let my substance appreciate.  
And the trouser to its necklace  
and among the writings the handsome one  
the custodian covered with lion hearted grape.  
Come with me to the vortex of panics.  
I stayed dedicated and silvery  
in the middle of the field.  
If I could perch the bramble and the archipeligos. Not to entertain or even meet  
the precision of one who seeks  
in me in a universe or understanding to a cousin.  
Wave of wave of aspens rolling down the sea.  
In the dismantling beasts.  
What we say crystallizes to  
blossom some other  
son  
what a image may teach.
