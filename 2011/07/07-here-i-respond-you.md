Here I Respond You
------------------
Cinnamon clay to my dead banner!  
Dawning a sea's skin  
preserved in the celestial clouds.  
Everything frightened with winged voices, the salt of the root  
and piles of natural  
bread with twilight.  
A sunburst  
orange flute gallops.  
Your hand preserves from north to north  
I was without doubt the custodian iguana  
there in the lewd night.  
When it looked me with its full film eyes  
it had neither ears nor brain  
but emerald love on its sides.  
Obscene morning and the nauesous flute  
kill at the walls of my house.  
I was without doubt  
the woman bird  
there in the weak university.  
When it looked me with its starry coat eyes  
it had neither eye nor foot  
but gem fragrances of strawberry on its sides.  
Wide, diamond thread!  
  
The hopeful giant  
wakes in the scrupulous morning.  
Nothing but that trouser of hooves.
