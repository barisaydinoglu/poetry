Every Mountaineer Is A Synonym
------------------------------
A burnt umber telegraph perfumes.  
An odor has enchanted among the fountain,  
a mixture of stain and body, a breathing  
awe that brings sorrow.  
Great empire. The square functions to fly a environment  
to its environment.  
What deceives the props of pride?  
So the celestial decency lives on in a lemon,  
the great house of the cashmire lake,  
the lion hearted sea shell that is absent minded and irreducable.  
What we say mingles to  
reflect some other person  
what a synonym may teach.
