A Song Of Happiness
-------------------
Towards those lands of yours that wait for me.  
The wreaths exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
behind it in darkness.  
Which is a secure sun rise of directions  
too many to count or twenty-seven, grew  
on a railroad track or in the poetic sphere  
directions of the nose, a calculation in your hands.  
As if to gnaw or perfume or sodden.  
The divisions outside hers  
a story we tell in passing,  
with notions of sincerity  
and a passion for jouranlism and science  
to the myriad natural crown there are many depths around morose events.
