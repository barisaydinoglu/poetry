Attracting Directionless Nostalgia
----------------------------------
Went continued in candle I salute your original bread  
and envy your infinite pride. You set my disordered conspirator  
like a comfortable elephant to fresh apple.  
To shine lost sea shells and for lunars.  
Skeleton twilight and the explosive essence  
fly at the walls of my house.  
My delicious breath appreciates you always.  
Inside the archipeligos like graphite.  
Carry me onto your helicopter - the grape of my sea water -  
perching a smooth iron  
flew in the steady snow.  
What mysteries does the jaguar contain?  
How little we appreciate and how much it carries the mysteries of this galaxy.  
In the wetting alarms.
