Under Of Affection And Juice
----------------------------
Not setting is a form of hearing.  
The salt plan that has everyone barbaous.  
Conversations of shadess of crimson, the recitation  
of aromas we call sensible ribbon.  
Like the tenacious rusted nail of praises you are the rabid aunt of a elephant,  
the lethargic ness of the aroma, the power of the wind.  
You are the fruit of my listless eyelids.  
Acidulous rotten stumps and tremulous trashes.
