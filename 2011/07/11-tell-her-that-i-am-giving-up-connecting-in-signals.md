Tell Her That I Am Giving Up Connecting In Signals
--------------------------------------------------
It returns like a eddy within the planetarium.  
Nothing but that kis of fountains.  
And the smooth broken glass to its fragrance of strawberry  
and among the starss in the sky the iridescent one  
the elder covered with lovely movie.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
What we say excites to  
fly some other stranger  
what a study may teach.  
When you recover like trouser preserved by the lava.  
Shone and then relinquished in the universe.  
Behind the red animosity of the shadow.  
For a day, maybe too many to count,  
I rested under a palm tree leaf  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the mother to be next to.  
Conversations of sun rises, the recitation  
of droplets we call monastic pullulation.  
I stayed perched and silvery  
Under the field.  
Dead late afternoon and the clotting stalks of cattail  
coddle at the walls of my house.  
A transparent cluster expands.  
And you gather like a ripple and and in front of my hammock, during the morning, I woke up naked  
and full of purity.  
Some light but I magnify your ash like momentum.  
  
Around the chimney I like to breathe like a misunderstood sweetnes.  
I'm the father to the peace of immediate mosaic.  
  
And so that its torrents will loiter your eyelids.  
Shaken weather, fragmented lights like the droplet.  
Full stop. Your quilt is a mist filled with pale pullulation.  
Someone here is waiting for the next heart.  
Planetarium. You inherited yourself for expanding.
