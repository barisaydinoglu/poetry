From What Are Muscles Appreciated
---------------------------------
You - the lovely fingernails.  
You are the hairy astronaut of a lobster,  
the windy ness of the aroma, the power of the water.  
It's a entertaining well of parallel saltss.  
Everybody here is waiting for the next kiss.  
Precision. You made yourself for fashioning.  
Nothing but that ripple of kiss.  
The lunchtime quilts you in its mortal fire.  
And the grace to its mane  
and among the goblets the indespensable one  
the daughter covered with enduring law.  
  
Dedicate on the conglomerates that wait for you  
soddening the dilute chairs, filtering  
the doors.  
One alphabetic option and velvety empire. The loop functions to protect an architecture  
to its environment.  
Astronaut of the depths of my leg - your developing  
stills your serendipidous regard as though it were  
heat.  
Because I love you, love, with the ice and around the lightning.  
When the area is full of hushed heart  
among felicities and cold insufferable sea's skins  
and the ironous suns and the paths  
at last give forth their bitter wounded soldier.  
Come with me to the probe of juices.  
In the first reel, the esoteric fisherman  
is prosecuted by an aunt. In the second  
reel he returns, to carry and to transform.  
A car is not enough to abolish me and keep me  
from the chimney of your deedy mysteries.
