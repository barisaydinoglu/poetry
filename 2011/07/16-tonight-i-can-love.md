Tonight I Can Love
------------------
And so that its cubicles will chain your curves. Like dry kiss, stars  
of your black quilt when you hold out your foot.  
Not to hear or even meet  
the silence of one who relinquishes  
behind me in a sea or blushing to a woman.  
  
You - the gleaming ears.  
You - the esoteric ears.
