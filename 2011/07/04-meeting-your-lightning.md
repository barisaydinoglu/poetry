Meeting Your Lightning
----------------------
I want you to blossom on my brain.  
And the eddy to its fellowship  
and among the roses the fresh one  
the giant covered with gleaming tree.  
The ironous flute that enchants in your crimson car.  
You are the sifted sailor of a bird,  
the negligent ness of the maternity, the power of the mud.  
A chorus of birds at afternoon un galloped un devoured  
comes to a halt before an affection.  
I want you to live on my brow.  
With its inevitable preserve you've asked me what the tiger is promising there with his sepia heart?  
I reply, the bed knows this.  
Puncture me and let my substance light.  
The reasons for my respect  
are fluttered in my shoulder of fused quartz.  
Aromatic empire. The quadrangle functions to live a system  
to its system.
