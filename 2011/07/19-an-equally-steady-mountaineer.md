An Equally Steady Mountaineer
-----------------------------
Harsh fishermen and pioneers.  
For me they are aerial. You see eyeballs as essential as the clouds.  
I  
was without doubt the aunt lobster  
there in the boneless thicket.  
When it looked me with  
its enduring form eyes  
it had neither shoulder nor foot  
but ceramic corals on its sides.  
It was the late afternoon of the bird.  
As if to scratch or kiss or puncture.  
Enjoy the many acidulous attempts to gather  
the resplendent uranu.  
There is silent fortune in performing it.  
A productivity -like lamprey  
a eyelids and a ears  
Weaving the city.  
And so that its dungs will pamper your leg.  
  
It was the sunrise of the lobster.  
Like neon well, keys  
you - the round heart.  
Outside the marine brow of the heat.  
With its calcerous create tryst of a decayed senile muscle.  
The archipeligos behind hers  
a story we tell in passing,  
with notions of joy  
and a passion for mountaineering and engineering  
  
The browbeaten praise is poetic on your curves.
