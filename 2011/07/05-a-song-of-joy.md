A Song Of Joy
-------------
The perfect dignity of the mirror! Behind the room like salt.  
All suns become vagabonds.  
  
Where gardens meet  
angels meet, behind and amid and  
the sound  
of dungs, to reach out and recover in illusion.  
Pockets of rusted nail converted into fused quartz.  
What phenomena does the elephant contain?  
How little  
we swim and how much it entertains the funny things of this computer simulation.  
What coagulates the props of happiness?
