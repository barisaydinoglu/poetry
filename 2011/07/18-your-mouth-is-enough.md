Your Mouth Is Enough
--------------------
From her heart and her breath tread  
angels of the earth.  
Preserving an aroma  
entertained in the natural sunshine.  
A breath and a tail  
making the boulevard.  
Where love meet  
defenders meet, outside and within  
and the sound  
of stains, to reach out and upgrade in illusion.  
Invasions  
of a rustling ship  
performing outside the area in a forceful wheel,  
enchanting as a chaotic jaguar.  
I could weave pin, cummerbund, and convict  
from foams and trees  
with a gray bed  
with walls in my shoulder.  
Multitude of productivities!  
In and out of the deep brown the silvery and the cinnamon
