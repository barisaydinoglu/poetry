From Heat To Wind
-----------------
To seek another land I want you to seek on my curves.  
On what silent graves lighted with fire?  
Went rescued in path the hollow iguana shines against the silent wounds.  
Halfway.  
Of a opaque ultraviolet daughter that perches graces.  
Awakening a sun rise  
enchanted in the incredulous sunshine.  
The electric aunt  
responds in the esoteric morning.  
Towards those stars of yours that wait for me.  
Neither umbrella nor lemon nor blood colored  
nor transluscent yellow but burnt umber.  
You mix my hairy oxide  
like a spacious squirrel to fresh sugar.  
Brings all the disguises lands.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the great prizes?  
And the snow original splattering its corals and compounding them full of  
moonlight evening and jaguar?  
Always you bury through the late afternoon  
toward the midnight undulating muscles.  
Discovering from wet-winged cork.  
But the well reflected the memory.  
I'd do  
it for the maternity in which you promise  
for the serendipities of cashmire you've dawned.  
It's a dawning propeller of juices.  
A chorus of iguanas at  
holiday un fashioned un devoured  
comes to a halt before a foam.  
To the essential color of the emerald river  
bank.  
It was a communist business of martyr and dominions.  
Around the puncturing gates.
