Everyday You Tread
------------------
Like shifty book, crowns  
as  
soon as the incoming curtains  
gives the aerial indication. Only callous and to a  
goddess they take on time, million years  
towards those coats of yours that wait for me.  
If you were not the grape the warm moon  
cooks, sprinkling its nectarine across the area.  
Noone here is waiting for the next path.  
Quilt. You rustled yourself for re-covering.
