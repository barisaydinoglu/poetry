The Animosity Of The Overtone Narrative
---------------------------------------
A turqoise and fatherless root is passed in the archipeligos. Not the cashmire moment  
when the holiday shines the muscles.  
A somber thunder of hooves.  
  
Nothing  
but that coral of mirrors.  
One side option and nothing but that magnolium of lights.
