The Epiphany Of The Divisions
-----------------------------
And so that its billows of brimstone smoke will abandon your heart.  
The friendly umbrella gave it felicity.  
You say, what is the land waiting for in its opaque  
marine cathedral?  
I tell you it is waiting for home like you.  
Agony and reflection - apples of confusion.  
  
A mirror conducting will protect  
the callous heat of a planet.  
A square around a loop,  
the disordered workings of steady law.  
I wish to make a line  
outside, and every faith, many  
times hidden in a laminated sign.  
Amid marine water and sepia drops.  
You are the fruit of my raucous mouth.  
And you dropped in the sorrow and perched an abolishing rotten stump.  
Knave of a faltered neon window.
