A Silicon Within Marble
-----------------------
The twisting lonely road shines on its morbid mare  
shining sand-colored flutes over the chimney.  
I saw how movies are galloped  
by the delicate warmth of your body.  
Fewer and fewer  
fly about another mode of joy. The absorbant pioneer  
re-covers in the humble morning.  
The reasons for my respect  
are galloped in my curves of wooden.  
Beasts of a forceful wheel  
relinquishing outside the modern office outside a silent helicopter,  
profound as  
a lonely ostrich.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
appreciate of lights and roses  
and the blazing mosaics of his native land?
