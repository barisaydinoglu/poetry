I Expected Daughters
--------------------
You say, what is the wreath waiting for in its marine telegraph?  
I tell you it is waiting for poppy like you.  
You protect my troubled rotten stump  
like an absorbant bird to fresh apple.  
Neither fountain nor ritual nor dark  
nor deep brown but transparent.  
You refresh slowly into a field to fly your business.  
Like obscene stone, atoms  
shall we keep going?  
A sun of lemons which is a resplendent nature of directions  
twenty-seven or too many to count, flew  
on a mane or in the manly echo  
directions of the foot, a calculation in your hipss.  
The thick kiss gave it felicity.  
The bird feather protecting  
from my brain.  
One of them is hopeful,  
the other knows productions.  
Where is nobody  
she cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Within the tiger of the chimney where you sleep,  
a dream loiters into details.
