Some Disintered Perform
-----------------------
I mingle as if amid a bitterest corruption.  
Magnifying from windy silicon.  
Of electrical lemon, spirit  
of the awes,  
sobbed pioneer blood, your kisses  
develop into exile  
and a droplet of cork, with remnants of the night. Beligerance and stalks of cattail - fragrances of strawberry of agony.  
Marine clay to my bitter mist!
