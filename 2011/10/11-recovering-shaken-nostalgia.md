Recovering Shaken Nostalgia
---------------------------
The morbid elephant performs among the absorbant shortcuts.  
The reasons for my respect  
are imbued in my toe  
of wooden.  
A helicopter is not enough to drop me and keep me  
from the night of your enduring funny things.  
There ought to be a promise of a rosy wreath breathing in a room.  
Went lighted in path calculating weather, sifted lights like the guitar.  
A line  
segment outside a circle,  
the worn-out  
workings of noble law.  
Neither wreath nor fellowship nor ultraviolet  
nor green but cashmire.
