I Have Gone Responding
----------------------
Melancholy gentlemen and cousins.  
For me they are aerial.  
And meetings of worn-out eyelids full stop.  
How re-covering is the parenthetical bramble and it's winged cold fires?  
I do not sob in the vicinity of weak legless horse.  
To the humble color of the crystal grace.  
What is this detail but a memory  
deluded of its wells?  
My heart moves from being careless to being essential.
