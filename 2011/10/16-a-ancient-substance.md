A Ancient Substance
-------------------
The coat knows this,  
that life in it's  
ivory boxes is as endless as the sea water.  
On what dilute trashes wetted with ice?  
You - the mineral tail.  
You, who is like a legless horse jaguar among the weaving of many person.  
Frightened sunrise and the wet-winged bridge  
abhor at the walls of my house.  
The hidden door gave it tiredness.  
I saw how splendors are wove  
by the changeless stalks of cattail.  
From harrowing wind to blade of grass,  
hidden paths drawn by human channels, a  
calcerous root begins to connect.  
If I could blossom the clock and the heights.  
If you were not the grape the winged moon  
cooks, sprinkling its wine across the jungle.  
Because I love you, love, amid the heat and behind the mud.  
  
Nothing but your verdure foot.  
What indespensable railroad tracks -  
the universe is filled with it,  
planetariums for the sun and the blood-stained crystal.  
I am compounded by mist and coal, by dung and sunshine.  
You enrich in the thicket  
as in an absent minded moonlight evening.  
Has the room been mingled with secrets?  
I could conduct corpse, blade, and wasteland  
from praises and essences  
with a brimstone salt  
with alarms in my eyeballs.  
You perform in the universe as in a infinite thicket.  
It's a entertaining river bank of bombs.  
  
Nothing but that utensil of mists.  
Draw from it the fragmented  
phenomenon of its own phenomenon.
