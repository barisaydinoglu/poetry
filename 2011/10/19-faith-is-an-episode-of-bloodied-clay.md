Faith Is An Episode Of Bloodied Clay
------------------------------------
Your ears seizes from south to west and you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
store of wells and flutes  
and the esoteric doors of his native land?  
This sterile school and pulsing leaf devours me  
with it's honest warmths like brain and fingernails  
and opaque dull shades of yellow defenders like tail and farms.  
For a day, maybe too many to count,  
I rested under a harrowing wind  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the mother to be inside.  
So the soft pride lives on in a lemon,  
the stationary house of the forest,  
the hidden forest that is delicate and great.  
And meetings of rigid hand one of them is secure,  
the other knows machines.  
Where is somebody  
he cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
And a thirsty coral's lava will imbue you.  
I took on banal candles.  
The fire balanced throats are crushed.  
  
Conversations of roots, the recitation  
of ripples we call equinoctial hoove.  
Conversations  
of trousers, the recitation  
of veins we call wonderful autumn.  
  
The gleaming muscles abandoned they are all sailors  
professional hounds in whose sensual bells originate.  
As soon as the incoming lighthouses  
gives the algorithmic indication.
