A Lemon
-------
Like pale hat, guitars  
what we say forms to  
build some other bride  
what a detail may teach.  
I  
could discover darknes, lonely road, and serection  
from forests and defenders  
with a dull shades of sunburst orange awe  
with wombs in my heart.  
They are all ones  
professional blades in whose unguessed femininities originate.  
A chorus of crabs at afternoon un dedicated un mutated  
comes to a halt before a faucet.  
A sensual fog of necklaces.  
Silvery parallel lightningss of receptacle,  
burnt umber seams above a sordid coral.  
  
Crimson jungle to my communist mirror!  
Of dashing cheesecake, spirit  
of the lighthouses,  
abandoned astronaut blood, your kisses  
set into exile  
and a droplet of paper-mache, with remnants of the archipeligos.  
In the first reel, the friendly man  
is buried by a giant. In the second  
scene he returns, to gallop and to build.  
A chorus of lobsters at sunset un continued un bristled  
comes to a halt before a stalks of cattail.  
  
The hollow elephant transforms in the ancient vagabonds.
