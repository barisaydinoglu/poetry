Technique In The Side Services
------------------------------
Has the boulevard been travelled with mysteries?  
Behind the boneless room of communist ribbon.  
Honeysuckle was no longer below the recording threshold.  
Enjoy the many inaccessible attempts to discover  
the equinoctial cummerbund.  
There is changeless fortune in flying it.  
But I should be true to photography, smothering among its parched natures  
so let us attempt to divulge a story devoid of historical redundancies.  
A flesh trusting will imbue  
the insufferable lightning of a planet.  
Nothing but that river bank of echoes.  
Marine cubicles  
of belt,  
silvery seams above a bruised flint.  
  
There are no wounds but negligent cycles of warmth of your body and transluscent silvery  
apples of original violenet graphite.  
Everything mechanical with thick voices, the salt of the light  
and piles of lovely bread amid midnight.  
This clotting flute and  
beginning propeller changes  
me  
with it's romantic pastures like ears and heart  
and ultraviolet spheres like foot and lights.  
If I could wake the alarm and the modern office.  
The trouser plan that has everyone tenacious.  
With the stalks of cattail of the heights where you sleep,  
a dream invades into studies.  
Somebody here is waiting for the next affection.  
Writing. You blossomed yourself for wetting.
