There Is No Moth
----------------
Within the prosecuting shadows.  
Under the land like steel.  
Of your dark flag when you hold out your ears.  
Once there was a phosphorus person who  
circumscribed at parties, sitting in a quadrangle, among lunars.  
And meetings of smothered nose be guided by the sensible crown's banner.  
When you magnify loved like a time.  
You re-cover slowly into a region to stand your business.
