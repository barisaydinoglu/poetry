Since The Beginning Of Setting
------------------------------
Return to the homeland of the productivities. To seek another land a computer for language is the lack thereof.  
I took on worn-out guitars.  
The I in prize sand-colored mud to my wayside aroma!  
Draw from it the frail  
synonym of its own study.  
Of unguessed cheesecake, spirit  
of the trees,  
entangled fisherman blood, your kisses  
develop into exile  
and a droplet of diamond, with remnants of the heights.  
I'm the lady to the flute of immediate cluster.  
The mechanical flower is perfect on your mouth.  
Inaccessible goddesses and astronauts.  
For me they are overtone.  
Everything frail with fleeting voices, the salt of the book  
and piles of serendipidous bread within  
twilight.
