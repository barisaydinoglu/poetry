How To Shake Father Fingers
---------------------------
A hopeful drizzle of mirrors.  
To the original color  
of the wooden pencil.  
Some shower but I mingle your brick like atom.  
Nothing but that kis of faucets.  
The thick astronaut  
drinks in the sensual morning.  
You - the secure hips.  
I do not protest in the vicinity of inaccessible lance.  
When you gallop like railroad track flew by the clay.  
  
Which is a parsimonious fragrance of strawberry of directions  
thousand or too few to count, rose  
on a time or in the resplendent droplet  
directions of the curves, a calculation in your feet.  
Of great lemon, spirit  
of the foams,  
smothered stranger blood, your kisses  
begin into exile  
and a droplet of silken, with remnants of the land.
