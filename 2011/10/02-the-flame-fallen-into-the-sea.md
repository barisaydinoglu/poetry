The Flame Fallen Into The Sea
-----------------------------
A current of trusting honeysuckle  
that does not know why it  
flows and fashions.  
Of a dull  
shades of sunburst orange  
gentleman that transforms circuss.  
I could create flame, stalactite, and salt  
from grapes and corals  
with  
a ultraviolet garden  
with lonely roads in  
my tail.  
Realized gleaming phemonana like lightnings degrading in front  
of dews.
