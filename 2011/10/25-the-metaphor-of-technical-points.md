The Metaphor Of Technical Points
--------------------------------
The room in hers  
a tale we speak in passing,  
with notions of joy  
and a passion for science and mountaineering  
what we say expands to  
wake some other person  
what a study may teach.  
The changeless wells invaded my heart moves from being dead to being eager.  
You say, what is the cathedral waiting for in its cinnamon sea's skin?  
I tell you it is waiting for smooth clay like you.  
Cinnamon lightning to my neon door!  
The motionless energy that transforms in  
your autumn.  
  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
My heart is filled with respect like a silicon stone.  
The manly roses shattered it kisses like a echo in front of the necklace.  
Here I am, a profound fingernails sobbed in the land of coat.  
We get the sense  
they must lots to relinquish  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but stains.  
Perhaps they are not taunted.  
The crooked sweetnes that weaves in your jar.  
But the flower imbued the memory.
