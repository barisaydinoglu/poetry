The Fear Of The Alphabetic Narrative
------------------------------------
There are many noises among pale events.  
Home was no longer above the transmission threshold.  
And you filtered in the beligerance and perfumed a harassing croak.  
And the curtain to its necklace  
and among the miracles the real one  
the stranger covered with real serendipity.  
Indicates the snow's fashioning tail.  
Went dawned in saxophone of iridescent orange, spirit  
of the flower heads,  
abolished uncle blood, your kisses  
Kiss into exile  
and a droplet of fused quartz, with remnants of the chimney.  
  
You gallop my insufferable viola  
like a steady lobster to fresh sugar.  
You are the morose god of a pheasant,  
the explosive ness of the foam, the power of the lava.
