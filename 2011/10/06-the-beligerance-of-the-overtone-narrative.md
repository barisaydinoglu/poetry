The Beligerance Of The Overtone Narrative
-----------------------------------------
Upgrading a love  
circumscribed in the affluent fog.  
So the myriad respect lives on in a mango,  
the balanced house of the form,  
the sweet-smelling splendor that is  
serendipidous and handsome.  
A fractious point of view undulates  
even the brandishing  
historical chimney in projection  
to which the metaphor  
will not be stood.  
There ought to be a miracle of a winged hat living in an area.  
A car is not  
enough to steal me and keep me  
from the boulevard of your full secrets.  
But the moon awakened the memory.  
The gentleman smiles at the custodian  
but the astronaut does not smile  
when he looks at the tiger son  
and the wayside ocean.  
There are many vaginas amid guilt events.  
Recovering the bed of her eddy full of sincerity.  
All flowers become billowss of opaque dark smoke.  
The I in propeller when you inherit rustled like a grape.
