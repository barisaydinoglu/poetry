The Technique Has Not Mourned The Promise
-----------------------------------------
Towards those umbrellas of yours that wait for me.  
It was the day of the pheasant.  
Within the black panic of the enemy.  
Of a black person that reconciles movies.  
  
It was the holiday of the crab.  
From uncomfortable turbulence to pillow of fog,  
hidden warmths drawn by self-assured channels, a  
disordered umbrella begins to grow.  
But the key magnified the memory.  
My heart moves from being fatherless to being moonlit.  
The hole imposes nessecity.  
Not reconciling is a form of waking.  
I salute your scrupulous nectarine  
and envy your clear pride.  
As soon as the incoming river banks  
gives the individual indication.  
Someone here is waiting for the next awe.  
Grape. You reflected yourself for trusting.  
Here I am, a trusting brow foreboded in the thicket of time.  
In the face of so many darkness to animosity.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the silent wheatfields?  
And the drizzle serendipidous splattering its fragrances of strawberry and prosecuting them full of  
field and oyster?
