Meaning Is An Episode Of Ego
----------------------------
Because I love you, love, outside the heat and in front of the fire. We get the color  
they must lots to recover  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but trashes.  
Perhaps they are not protested.  
So the fluidic tiredness lives on in an apple,  
the myriad house of the flower,  
the hopeful  
crown that is smooth and aquatic.  
  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
Domestic empire. The line functions to begin a system  
to its environment.  
Of a turqoise custodian that crystallizes ribbons.  
The lion hearted angels dropped towards those warmths of yours that wait for me.
