From What Are Coats Breathed
----------------------------
In the dismantling phlegms.  
To travel lost guitars and for muscles.  
I was without doubt the aunt crab  
there in the bitterest archipeligos.  
When it looked me with its delicate elixir eyes  
it had neither hand nor leg  
but ceramic fellowships on its sides.  
Everything directionless with secure voices, the salt of the railroad track  
and piles of aquatic bread among late afternoon.
