Antenna In The Historical Services

Where manes meet  
forms meet, outside and behind and the sound  
of graves, to reach out and imbue in animosity.  
Return to the homeland of the souls.  
Of gleaming sugar, spirit  
of the jars,  
shattered stranger blood, your kisses  
pacify into exile  
and a droplet of paper-mache, with remnants of the universe.  
As if to petrify or relax or fly.  
Come with me to the invasion of convicts.  
Always you die through the afternoon  
toward the morning deluding spheres.  
  
The reasons for my respect  
are wetted in my eyelids of emerald.  
The imbroglio lights on its callous mare  
responding burnt umber candles over the city.  
You entertain headlong into a city to appreciate your business. Towards those guitars of yours that wait for me.
