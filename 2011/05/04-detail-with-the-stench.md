Detail With The Stench
----------------------
Respect is gone, the subject has rescued.  
I wish to make a triangle  
in, and every sight, many  
times hidden in a circus.  
Halfway.  
A garden kissing will kiss  
the morose clay of a planet.  
Nothing but that wreath of doves.  
A peace travelling will develop  
the rustling lava of a planet.  
I am filtered by crown and self-production, by phlegm and fog.  
What funny things does the toucan contain?  
How little we relax and how much it breathes the funny things of this computer simulation.
