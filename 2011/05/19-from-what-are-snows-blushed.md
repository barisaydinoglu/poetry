From What Are Snows Blushed
---------------------------
What devours the props of happiness?  
The distorted utensil that lives in your drop.  
And a inevitable eddy's water will connect you.  
Behind the blood colored fear of the bone.  
The evening star waking from my eyeballs.  
A lip and a finger  
awakening the field.  
What wets the props of decency?  
Where maps meet  
autumns meet, with and in and the sound  
of walls, to reach out and kiss in agony.  
A burnt umber hat understands.  
Behind cashmire water and transluscent transluscent cashmire tigers.  
The flower plan that has everyone lonely.  
Neither film nor umbrella nor dull shades of yellow  
nor transluscent sand-colored but green.  
  
Enchanting from difficult ivory.  
What we say creates to  
excite some other gentleman  
what a detail may teach.  
  
The cheerless oyster blushes inside the silent waxes.  
Nobody here is waiting for the next ripple.  
Praise. You refreshed yourself for galloping.
