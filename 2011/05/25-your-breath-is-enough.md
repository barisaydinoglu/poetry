Your Breath Is Enough
---------------------
I was without doubt the god elephant  
there in the pale modern office.  
When it looked me with its self-assured map eyes  
it had neither foot nor leg  
but cedar fellowships on its sides.  
When you upgrade like wreath discovered by the mud.  
A circle among a square,  
the blood-stained workings of starry law. Outside the propeller of the area where you sleep,  
a dream coagulates into inscriptions.  
Not to create or even meet  
the planetarium of one who promises  
among me in a night or dedicating to a woman.
