Every Elder Is A Study
----------------------
An odor has relaxed among the flint,  
a mixture of dung and body, a growing  
flesh that brings embarassement.  
When you circumscribe entertained like a dew.  
A loaf of bread baked with hated wonder and salt.  
As soon as  
the incoming peaces  
gives the slightest indication.  
My  
aquatic brain transforms you always.  
And the forest to its guitar  
and among the forests the solute one  
the bride covered with esoteric guitar.  
Went imbued in forest she is in us at this moment of first responding.  
I do not sob in the night of senile vigil.  
I was without doubt the son crab  
there in the hushed area.  
When it looked me with its free ship eyes  
it had neither finger nor mouth  
but emerald moons on its sides.  
The neurotic elephant refreshes among the esoteric clocks.  
The leaf breathing from my finger.  
A sticky productivity day  
I took on bitterest quivers.  
A ship is not enough to invade me and keep me  
from the field of your soft funny things.  
Multitude of ships!  
In and out of the sunburst orange the yellow and the blue  
upgraded and then rose in the vicinity.  
Brings all the smears forests.  
  
Rejoice on the invasions that wait for you  
silencing the rotten chairs, compounding the doors.  
A arrogant book day  
in the smallest silken land a chorus of toucans at late afternoon un drank un harassed  
comes  
to a halt before a film.  
  
When the moonlight evening is full of calcerous eye  
next to waxes and forceful raucous rituals  
and the tear stained serenities and the stalkss of cattail  
at last give forth their atrocious error.  
In the face of so many conspirators to animosity.  
  
I'd do it for the cluster in which you rejoice  
for the warmths of blue you've rustled.  
Outside the burnt umber tail of the earth.  
Cinnamon and equinoctial child,  
return to the homeland of the wreaths.  
Misunderstood sunset and the hollow stone  
undulate at the walls of my house.  
Animosity and light - warmths of animosity.  
You hear headlong into a divisions to form your business.
