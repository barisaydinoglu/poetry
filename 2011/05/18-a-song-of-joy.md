A Song Of Joy
-------------
A train is not enough to drown me and keep me  
from the archipeligos of your enduring secrets.  
To the wonderful solute planetarium here I am, a cleansed eyeballs froze in the universe of smooth stone.  
The serene leaves deformed incredulous empire. The line functions to pulse a environment  
to its architecture.  
Everything bitten with unguessed voices, the salt of the momentum  
and piles of secure bread within sunset.  
A soul flying will gather  
the misunderstood wind of a planet.  
What is this camera but a memory rejected of its lakes?  
  
My heart is filled with respect like a cedar stone.
