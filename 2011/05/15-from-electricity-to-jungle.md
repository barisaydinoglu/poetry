From Electricity To Jungle
--------------------------
Outside the morose saxophone, many tremulous clandenstines.  
What mysteries does the bird  
contain?  
How little we seize and how much it reflects the phenomena of this universe.  
The legless horse re-covers on its senile mare  
standing sepia times over the sea.  
Outside the green nose of the clay.  
Your fingernails returns from south to west  
you - the velvety eye.  
  
Neither propeller nor sepia lake nor black  
nor opaque sunburst orange but opaque sunburst orange.
