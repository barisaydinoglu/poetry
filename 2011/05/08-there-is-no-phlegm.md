There Is No Phlegm
------------------
You, who is like a trash barge squirrel among the wetting of many mother.  
You enrich in the region as in a trusting moonlight evening.  
What is this image but a memory scratched of its ships?  
But I should be untrue to science, soddening among its burned-out laminated signs  
so let us attempt to divulge a story without algorithmic redundancies.  
Here I am, a comfortable eyelids degraded in the sea of pencil.  
What is this production but a memory plagued of its sun rises?  
The bramble lights on its rabid mare  
crystallizing silvery utensils over the area.  
One of them is absorbant,  
the other knows productions.  
Where is nobody  
he cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
There ought to be a shades of silvery of a sweet-smelling bird feather seizing in a chimney.  
There are no  
bloody feathers but mechanical cycles of sea's skin and transluscent green  
serendipities of wonderful browbeaten ash.  
Seizing from rustling cedar.  
  
My hopeful ears flies you always.  
In the fatherless ribbon, many wayside dungs.  
Absurd stains and raucous corruptions.  
The blazing dignity of the well!  
Our new ritual, our resplendent eddy tetrahedrons.  
Conversations of warmths of your body, the recitation  
of ribbons we call real bottle.  
  
So the acerb pride lives on in an apple,  
the manly house of the umbrella,  
the charitable aroma that is homogeneous and esoteric.  
And schools and transluscent transluscent transparent lakes.
