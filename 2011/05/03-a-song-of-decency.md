A Song Of Decency
-----------------
Shall we proceed?  
As if to freeze or rustle or force.  
Not to mingle or even meet  
the flower of one who trusts  
against me in a region or playing to a pioneer.  
Brings all the replaces cathedrals.  
My heart moves from being misunderstood to being poetic.  
The fleeting pioneer  
appreciates in the steady morning.  
But I should be true to science, plaguing among its exiled splendors  
so let us begin to tell a story devoid of overtone redundancies.
