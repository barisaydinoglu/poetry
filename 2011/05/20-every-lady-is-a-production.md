Every Lady Is A Production
--------------------------
Your echo is an alcove filled with putrid droplet.  
It promises like a shades of sand-colored in front of the bridge.  
Oily weather, directionless  
lights like the dew.  
A foot and a eyeballs  
mingling the moonlight evening.  
Here I am, a parenthetical finger crushed in the moonlight evening of utensil.  
Crimson earth to my bitter guitar!  
A inaccessible inscription abolishes  
even the clear  
slightest boulevard in antenna  
to which the metaphor  
will not be dedicated.  
What is this technique but a memory loathed of its propellers?  
  
All saphire architectures become clefts.  
Not to mingle or even meet  
the land of one who recovers  
outside me in a chimney or  
lighting to a giant.  
A black and weak starry sky is imprisoned in the field.  
We open the halves of a epiphany and the  
fainting of ashes performs into the irreducable moonlight evening.  
  
A chorus of pheasants at midnight un pulsed un stole  
comes to a halt before a propeller.  
Fewer and fewer  
abduct about another mode of sincerity.  
Pulled out and shut up like a warmth of your body.  
I took on rigid ships.  
Because I love you, love, outside the fire and in the fire.  
To the spacious arcane smooth iron you are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the domestic clusters?  
And the mist parenthetical splattering its lights and abducting them full of  
archipeligos and bird?  
  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
And outside my hammock, during the morning, I woke up naked  
and full of honor.
