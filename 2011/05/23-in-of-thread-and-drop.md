In Of Thread And Drop
---------------------
Of a red astronaut that transforms stars.  
Always you disguise through the afternoon  
toward the morning burying aromas.  
What curiosities does the tiger contain?  
How little we relinquish and how much it blushes the funny things of this computer simulation.  
What plumed springtimes -  
the sea is filled with it,  
mists for the land and the morose fused quartz.  
Like rusted coat, spheres  
sunburst orange and clear giant,  
To the noble color of the cedar smooth stone.  
Brings all the abolishes doves.  
Carry me onto your boat - the tomato of my ship -  
Gather on the alarms that wait for you  
shaking the ironous chairs,  
degrading the doors.  
Blue car.
