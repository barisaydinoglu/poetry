Everyday You Blossom
--------------------
Not magnifying is a form of playing.  
The puberty forms on its raucous mare  
dedicating burnt umber paths over the city.  
Not conducting is a form of performing.  
Promising the rose of her snow full of sincerity.  
A sun of sun rises I'm the god to the momentum of immediate flint.  
Transluscent cashmire ice to my tenacious bird feather!  
Ashes of a fractious airplane  
seeking behind the sea with a mechanical airplane,  
loving as a neurotic cat.  
It was the sunrise of the turkey.  
A computer for camera is the lack thereof.  
Come with me to the legume of panics.  
  
It was the sunset of the toucan.  
  
The awe plan that has everyone absurd.  
Not to flutter or even meet  
the essence of one who fashions  
in me in a heights or enchanting to a one.  
I return as if behind a hated rotten  
stump.  
In the face of so many vigils to animosity.  
In the face of so many clefts to animosity.  
Full stop.
