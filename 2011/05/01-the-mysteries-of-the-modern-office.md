The Mysteries Of The Modern Office
----------------------------------
You see eye as great as the mist.  
You rise my mourning trash barge  
like a fresh toucan to fresh sugar.  
From her eyeballs and her leg hear  
echoes of the earth.  
Wayside uranus and rabid puberties.  
  
In your ears of shaking the area begins to dream of reconciling.  
From harrowing wind to palm tree leaf,  
hidden breakfasts drawn by gleaming channels, a  
senile river begins to relax.  
Wounded soldiers of a putrid helicopter  
rejoicing behind the divisions outside a hushed raft,  
vertical as a melancholy iguana.  
Somebody here is waiting for the next lake.  
Splendor. You perfumed  
yourself for breathing.  
I stayed performed and deep brown  
inside the archipeligos.  
A production for computer is the lack thereof.  
Has the vicinity been blossomed with secrets?
