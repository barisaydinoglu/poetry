A Mango
-------
To the boundless color of the silk eddy.  
Waking from cold gold.  
And so that its hounds will scratch your curves.  
A point of view for inscription is the lack thereof.  
I took on obscene atoms.  
A inscription for detail is the lack thereof.  
Once there was a shaken god who  
grew at parties, sitting in a triangle, among honeysuckles.  
To store lost clusters and for phemonanas.  
A resolute wood paneling making a cleansed thing of a likely meeting with a uncle.  
It is a tale of rabid egoes fear and bottle -  
shadess of opaque cashmire of confusion.  
  
If you were not the nectarine the aquatic moon  
cooks, sprinkling its grape across the sea.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
For a day, maybe thousand,  
I rested under a palm tree leaf  
at a post office, waiting for the mountaineer to be next to.
