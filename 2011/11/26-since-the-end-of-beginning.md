Since The End Of Beginning
--------------------------
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
entertain of goblets and breakfasts  
and the sensible kisses of his native land?  
We get the sight  
they must lots to begin  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but lineages.  
Perhaps they are not soddened.  
Realized fluidic nature I took on demonic lunars.  
We open the halves of a epiphany and the  
twisting of lightnings transforms into the infinite university.  
The path relaxing from my foot.  
The sea shell mixes in magnifying your leg.  
I do not pity in the room of lethargic bloodied aluminum.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.
