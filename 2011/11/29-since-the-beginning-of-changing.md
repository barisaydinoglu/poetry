Since The Beginning Of Changing
-------------------------------
In my night at morning you are like a precision  
and your form and colour the way I flutter them.  
Awakening from chaotic ceramic.  
In the boney sea of sterile honeysuckle.  
Like tenacious peace, old warrior's medals  
and the mist to its soul  
and among the warmths of your body the natural one  
the man covered with acerb smooth broken glass.  
  
Conversations of river banks, the recitation  
of fleshes we call cordial wave.
