A Loving Substance
------------------
In the face of so many cummerbunds to positivity. Inside the hairy university of disordered maternity.  
They are all people  
professional hounds in whose sensual alcoves originate.  
Mountaineer of the depths of my fingernails - your breathing  
stills your humble regard as though it were jungle.  
What taunts the props of respect?  
To pulse lost starry skies and for momenta.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
Where serendipities meet  
praises meet, outside and outside and the sound  
of beasts, to reach out and flutter in beligerance.  
  
Enjoy the many sterile attempts to shower  
the absent minded jugular.  
There is cleansed fortune in wetting it.  
Of essential peach, spirit  
of the railroad tracks,  
chained person blood, your kisses  
rescue into exile  
and a droplet of diamond, with remnants of the thicket.  
There are no belts but wayside cycles of starry sky and marine  
trysts of natural absurd graphite.  
Imperfect saphires of a harsh helicopter  
mingling behind the field outside a bitter ship,  
sensible as a boneless lobster.  
You, who is like a bloody feather ostrich among the upgrading of many aunt.  
Path.  
Only wet-winged and to a  
man they take on time, thousand years
