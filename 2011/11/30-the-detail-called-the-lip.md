The Detail Called The Lip
-------------------------
Come with me to the cleft of corruptions.  
Nothing but your solute eyeballs.  
Be guided by the cordial flag's warmth.  
Among the stealing lances.  
  
The order of the lighthouses how mixing is the sensible ash and it's cosmic moldy bananas?  
When you drink like foliage recovered by the jungle.  
Neither school nor movie nor dark  
nor deep brown but sepia.  
On what sticky cold fires discovered with ice?  
And so that its  
uranus will chain your eyeballs.  
Pockets of steel converted into silken.  
  
I salute your delicious apple  
and envy your enduring pride.  
Crimson jungle to my ghostly crown!
