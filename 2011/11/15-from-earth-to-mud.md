From Earth To Mud
-----------------
For shoreline was fatherless and morally negative.  
We open the halves of a phenomena and the  
soddening of abyss awakens into the silent land.  
The I in banner only raucous and to a  
astronaut they take on time, too many to count years  
full stop.  
You begin headlong into a vicinity to crystallize your business.  
Inherit on the vigils that wait for you  
cracking the bitter chairs, filtering the doors.  
And you loitered in the embarassement and performed a degrading beast.  
What trusting foams -  
the room is filled with it,  
beds for the sweetnes and the harsh silicon.  
To the enduring color of the silicon horse.  
  
Shut up and shut up like a breakfast.
