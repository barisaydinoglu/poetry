Since The Beginning
-------------------
I wish to make a line  
Next to, and every sight, many  
times hidden in a banner.  
Only film, just the  
utensil, nothing but  
it. Flint.  
For foam was decadent and morally negative.  
I want you to perch on my fingernails.  
Be guided by the poetic old warrior's medal's flower head.  
The horse plan that has everyone nauesous.  
  
What curiosities does the iguana contain?  
How little we love and how much it carries the mysteries of this universe.  
You say, what is the hoove waiting for in its  
cashmire banner?  
I tell you it is waiting for grace like you.  
If I could relax the wound and the boulevard.  
Multitude  
of circuss!  
In and out of the silvery the opaque green and the sand-colored  
  
Swim on the legumes that wait for you  
dismantling the calcerous chairs, filtering the doors.  
Changeless, silken flute!
