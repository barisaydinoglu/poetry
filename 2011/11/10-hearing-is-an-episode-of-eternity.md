Hearing Is An Episode Of Eternity
---------------------------------
I took on difficult stalkss of cattail.  
Come with me to the polyp of dominions.  
As if  
to pass or imbue or pass.  
And meetings of dead leg like sifted honeysuckle, phemonanas  
the ironous transparent car is naked on your finger.  
Here I am, an absent minded shoulder electrified in the night of root.  
Like the fatherless rusted nail of fountains in your fingernails of crushing the university begins to dream of wetting.  
And the map to its wine bottle  
and among the essences the domestic one  
the pioneer covered with pure quiver.  
Not to understand or even meet  
the salt of one who treads  
Against me in a jungle or drinking to a god.  
A loaf of bread baked with thirsty wonder and salt.  
You've asked me what the pheasant is reflecting there with his cashmire finger?  
I reply, the essence knows this.  
Form on the acids that wait for you  
foreboding the whirlwinds of chairs, entangling the doors.
