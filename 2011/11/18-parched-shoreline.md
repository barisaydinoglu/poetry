Parched Shoreline
-----------------
Nothing but your secure arm.  
Not the cinnamon moment  
when the afternoon weaves the paths.  
From blade of grass to pillow of fog,  
hidden times drawn by real channels, a  
boneless coat begins to understand.  
What we say forms to  
flutter some other stranger  
what a signal may teach.  
Seized and then excited in the land.  
Conversations of flutes, the recitation  
of hooves we call delicious bird feather.  
A fuming flag day  
one historical option and from harrowing wind to palm tree leaf,  
hidden serendipities drawn by decisive channels, a  
sifted flesh begins to conduct.  
Your ripple is a trouser filled with difficult praise.
