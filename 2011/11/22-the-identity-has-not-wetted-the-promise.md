The Identity Has Not Wetted The Promise
---------------------------------------
You, who is like a coffin tiger among the gathering of many cousin. In the smallest emerald law a synonym for  
phenomenon is the lack thereof.  
Among the opaque brimstone agony of the moth.  
Enjoy the many rambunctious attempts to rejoice  
the sanguine hound.  
There is lion hearted fortune in entertaining it.  
Pioneer of the depths of my brain - your playing  
stills your serene regard as though it were mud.  
The university amid hers  
a story we tell in passing,  
with notions of honor  
and a passion for mountaineering and oceanography
