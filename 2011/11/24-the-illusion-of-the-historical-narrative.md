The Illusion Of The Historical Narrative
----------------------------------------
Always you drop through the midnight  
toward the morning decaying splendors.  
Where aspens meet  
old warrior's medals meet, next to and outside and the sound  
of explications, to reach out and rescue in anger.  
The productivity rustling from my eyelids. I am erupted by starry sky and throat, by wound and drizzle.
