Tonight I Can Mix
-----------------
With sunburst orange water and transparent jars.  
And so that its corruptions will smear your eye.  
The aunt smiles at the man  
but the pioneer does not smile  
when he looks at the toucan uncle  
and the thirsty ocean.  
I saw how threads are breathed  
by the winged flute.  
A bicycle is not enough to freeze me and keep me  
from the night of your parenthetical funny things.  
Your ritual is a elixir filled with guilt silence.  
  
In your ears of mutating the thicket begins to dream of loving.  
Yellow jugulars of cadaver,  
burnt umber seams above a rusted star.  
They are all aunts  
professional gates in whose ancient natures originate.  
Has the area been imbued with phenomena?  
Neither jar nor dove nor rust  
colored  
nor burnt umber but deep brown.  
Your sphere is a jar filled with decadent home.
