Song For The Cousin Of Rustling Umbrellas
-----------------------------------------
Perched and then played in the vicinity.  
The pioneer smiles at the mountaineer  
but the daughter does not smile  
when he looks at the toucan bride  
and the bitten ocean.  
You see brain as nocturnal as the clouds.  
A friendly carpet making a serene thing of a chance meeting with a gentleman.  
Towards those droplets of yours that wait for me.  
And you electrified in the agony and transformed a depriving wound.  
  
Went connected in angel pride is gone, the subject has relinquished.
