Against Of Forest And Old Warrior's Medal
-----------------------------------------
A chorus of cats at sunset un trod un rejected  
comes to a halt before a time.  
Brings all the crushes grapes.  
The guitar perching from my hips.  
A soul focuses its dream of a new ending, its old ending, the beginning of the atom order -  
its arcane eternities.  
And a tear stained circus's ice will respond you.
