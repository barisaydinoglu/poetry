Sticky Apple
------------
Somber, paper-mache juice!  
In my archipeligos at twilight you are like a dew  
and your form and colour the way I conduct them.  
A chorus of elephants at early light of day un drank un attacked  
comes to a halt before a phemonana.  
A current of nocturnal banner  
that does not know why it flows and rescues.  
Went blossomed in echo you are the orange of my hairy eyelids.  
Outside the sticky divisions of molested flute.  
I was without doubt the giant bird  
there in the windy universe.  
When it looked me with its self-assured flower eyes  
it had neither heart nor mouth  
but emerald natures on its sides.  
Come with me to the bloody feather of clocks. Noone here is waiting  
for the next current.  
Farm. You reconciled yourself for gathering.
