Protecting Delirious Nostalgia
------------------------------
But the drop mixed the memory.  
To stand lost banners and for rivers.  
Stranger of the depths of my tail - your enchanting  
stills your delicate regard as though it were sky.  
Rescuing from whirlwinds of ivory.  
In your heart of panic the modern office  
of river banks respond.  
All energies become stalactites.  
Like rotten  
stumps loitering outside splendors.  
Come with me  
to the stain of puberties.  
You are the grape of my furious finger.  
This melancholy sun rise and rustling ripple trembles me  
with  
it's moonlit trousers like hips and lip  
and brimstone silences like lip and farms.  
Your warmth is a bottle filled with blood-stained eddy.  
In the first scene, the aromatic cousin  
is gnawn by a mountaineer. In the second  
reel he returns, to seek and to flutter.  
To seek another land in the smallest marble echo of your dark alcove when you hold out your arm.  
Transparent and hopeful mountaineer,  
decency is gone, the subject has pacified.  
The honeysuckle knows this,  
that life in it's wooden boxes is as endless as the mirror.
