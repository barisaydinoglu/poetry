Tonight I Can Imbue
-------------------
Only bitterest and to a  
person they take on time, million years  
the thicket inside hers  
a tale we tell in passing,  
with notions of wonder  
and a passion for jouranlism and oceanography  
a careful carpet making a velvety thing of a probable meeting with a daughter.  
There ought to be a fountain  
of a careful reflection magnifying in a university.  
The evil imposes nessecity.  
How growing is the infinite self-production and it's eloquent receptacles?  
A wind of landscapes in the forceful sea of rambunctious branch.  
To the manly color of the crystal light.  
In the face of so many moths to positivity.  
Sand-colored egoes of clock,  
sepia seams above a motionless mirror.  
When you fashion like fountain trusted by the wind.  
And warmths of your body and sea water.  
Behind the gray confusion of the grave.  
You attract slowly into a chimney to enrich your business.  
Coagulate me and let my substance reconcile.  
You chirp in the night as in a noble land.  
Illusion and forest - snows of panic.  
I'm the custodian to the promise of immediate flint.
