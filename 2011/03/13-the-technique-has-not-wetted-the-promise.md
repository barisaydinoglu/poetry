The Technique Has Not Wetted The Promise
----------------------------------------
Like the mechanical graphite of essences you rise slowly into a night to wet your business.  
The films exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
behind it in darkness.  
How connecting is the domestic havoc and it's celestial imperfect coppers?  
The sweet-smelling ship gave it pride.  
Of unguessed plum, spirit  
of the branches,  
foreboded mother blood, your kisses  
refresh into exile  
and a droplet of gem, with remnants of the night.  
In your finger of throttling the jungle begins to dream of flowing.  
  
They lunged it with thirsty hooves.  
So the warm love  
lives on in a fruit,  
the enchanting house of the foam,  
the absorbant essence that is steady and clear.  
The elder smiles at the one  
but the aunt does not smile  
when he looks at the elephant fisherman  
and the wet-winged ocean. One of them is thick,  
the other knows sequences.  
Where is somebody  
she exclaims, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?
