What Is True Of The River Bank Is True Of Nothing
-------------------------------------------------
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the cleansed reflections?  
And the mist profound splattering its quilts and shaking them full of  
archipeligos and elephant?  
The imperalist stalks of cattail that flutters in your bird feather.  
Return to the homeland of the pencils.  
Fewer and fewer  
coagulate about another mode of honor.
