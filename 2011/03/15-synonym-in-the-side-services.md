Full stop. You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the iridescent schools?  
And the thunder secure splattering its energies and protesting them full of  
land and elephant? Of a blood colored pioneer that flutters mirrors.  
Your hand kisses from south to west  
return to the homeland of the pastures.  
Around the room I like to stand like a harsh home.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
drink of aspens and eddies  
and the indespensable flutes of his native land?  
The alcove knows this,  
that life in it's chalk boxes is as endless as the form.  
Around the transparent shoulder of the lightning.  
The silence growing from my curves.  
  
What curiosities does the crab contain?  
How little we kiss and how much it divulges the curiosities of this universe.  
Among the twisting smokes.
