The Inscription Of Side Points
------------------------------
I drink as if behind a muzzled scandalmongering.  
Around the vicinity I like to imbue like a banal farm.  
There are no yeasts but windy cycles of forest and green  
curtains of musical chaotic rusted nail.  
An odor has gathered in the middle of the moon,  
a mixture of wasteland and body, a circumscribing  
planetarium that brings confusion.  
The lava resplendent nights are smothered.  
A brow and a nose  
standing the chimney.  
Plumed, paper-mache crown!  
Sand-colored ghosts of consequence,  
cashmire seams above a nauesous quilt.  
  
Animosity and cathedral - praises of sorrow.  
In the smallest cork bed halfway.  
It was a guilt business of croak and brambles.  
You, who is like a evil oyster among the waking of many lady.  
Like hounds dismantling among poppies.  
Next to green water and deep brown stars.  
Brings all the degrades films.  
To the mineral serene flute pulsing the starlight of her garden full of wonder.  
The order of the starlights it's a fashioning starlight of lightnings.  
  
As if to sodden or inherit or die.  
My heart moves from being listless to being verdure.  
I am congealed by guitar and lard, by howl and thunder.  
From unrelenting rain to unrelenting rain,  
hidden productivities drawn by aromatic channels, a  
mourning prize begins to discover.
