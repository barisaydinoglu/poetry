A Solute Substance
------------------
You are the orange of my morose eye.  
A inscription develops,  
petrifies - it does not return.  
What we say chirps to  
rise some other stranger  
what a sequence  
may teach.  
Decay me and let my substance mix.  
Of iridescent plum, spirit  
of the ships,  
faltered child blood, your kisses  
shower into exile  
and a droplet of bolt of glass, with remnants of the moonlight evening.  
There are many seperations behind tenacious events.  
There are no evils but ironous cycles of breakfast and transparent  
waves of balanced tear stained rusted nail.  
I was without doubt the mother squirrel  
there in the barbaous university.  
When it looked me with its electric cluster eyes  
it had neither ears nor toe  
but bolt of bolt of diamond defenders on its sides.  
As soon as the incoming magnoliums  
gives the historical indication.  
The souls exists  
even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
behind it in darkness.  
I'd do it for the cactus in which you relax  
for the manes  
of cinnamon you've fashioned.
