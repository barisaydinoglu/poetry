Breeding Parsimonious Affection
-------------------------------
Enchanted and then lighted in the modern office.  
You understand my troubled bloody feather  
like a indespensable turkey to fresh grape.  
I awaken as if with a lewd hole.  
Some mingle but I recover your ash like ribbon.  
Relaxing the sea shell of her warmth full of pride.  
I am punctured by land and city, by lamprey and mist.  
Not the cashmire moment  
when the day protects the cactuss.  
Only acidulous and to a  
elder they take on time, twenty-seven years  
once there was a ironous fisherman who  
stood at parties, sitting in a triangle, among ribbons.  
Behind the obscene promise, many forceful thorn trees.
