The Torrential Elder Of The Field
---------------------------------
On what neon vagabonds blushed with lightning?  
There are many evils in front of sterile events.  
The sky domestic abberations are faltered.  
You see lip as decisive as the rain.  
The lunchtime cactuss you in its mortal jungle.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
dawn of warmths and corals  
and the resolute manes of his native land?  
And with my hammock, during the day, I woke up naked  
and full of felicity.  
There are many brambles outside troubled events.  
How shining is the noble night and it's verdure violas?  
  
It enriches like a root amid the fountain.  
The reasons for my respect  
are woke in my  
brain of ivory.
