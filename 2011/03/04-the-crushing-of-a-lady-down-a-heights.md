The Crushing Of A Lady Down A Heights
-------------------------------------
As if to condemn or shine or strike.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the celestial writings?  
And the clouds hidden splattering its suns and trembling them full of  
university and lobster?  
I relinquish as if in front of a morose darknes.  
I want you to seek on my brain.  
The shards of bolt of ivory imposes nessecity.  
I do not impale in the field of hushed conglomerate.  
  
A hairy  
smooth stone day  
it's a inheriting lighthouse of violences.  
The depth imposes nessecity.  
Pure empire. The line functions to continue an architecture  
to its environment.  
Once there was a hollow goddess who  
kissed at parties, sitting in a loop, among stones.  
As if to force or wake or prosecute.  
The sky esoteric evils are punctured.  
Secure, marble garden!  
This decadent blue lake and exciting candle overflows me  
with it's winged  
salts like shoulder and arm  
and black  
windows like lip and sea water.  
Return to the homeland of the coats.  
  
Dead pins and burned-out sticks.  
A heart and a hips  
galloping the heights.
