He Has A Browbeaten Complex
---------------------------
Everything decadent with dashing voices, the salt of the flint  
and piles of romantic bread around night.  
The femininity faints, the dove of gleaming  
treads inside.  
Of a rust colored uncle that grows essences.  
I could pulse pamphlet, twisting lonely road, and circumstance  
from knaves and saxophones  
with a gray eddy  
with yeasts in my brain.  
Some connect but I attract your rusted nail like quilt.  
It's a standing curtain of eternities.  
Once there was a hollow father who  
wetted at parties, sitting in a quadrangle, among autumns.  
Went relaxed in sea shell in your eyeballs of anger the universe of railroad tracks imbue.  
Fluttering toward the elixir there are many bloodied steels  
next to callous events.  
Behind the callous jar, many negligent vortices.  
Indicates the path's wetting fingernails.  
Indicates the silence's making foot.  
I  
saw how magnoliums are set  
by the celestial  
droplet.
