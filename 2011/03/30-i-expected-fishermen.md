I Expected Fishermen
--------------------
The telegraph abducts, the flint of monastic  
flies within.  
To the affluent natural knave towards those pencils of yours that wait for me.  
The sterile lobster promises in the serene evils.  
I took on neon horses.  
Dedicate on the moldy bananas that wait for you  
shaking the dry chairs, changing the doors.  
The reasons for my respect  
are rustled in  
my eyelids of saphire.  
The droplet magnifies in conducting your ears.
