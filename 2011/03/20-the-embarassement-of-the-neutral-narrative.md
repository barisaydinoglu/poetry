The Embarassement Of The Neutral Narrative
------------------------------------------
The lonely mane is cosmic on your mouth.  
For a day,  
maybe twenty-seven,  
I rested under a pillow of fog  
at a post office, waiting for the mountaineer to be outside.  
We open the halves of a epiphany and the  
undulating of felicities wets into the cosmic divisions.  
Bitterest vagabonds and whirlwinds of convicts.  
  
In the first reel, the parenthetical man  
is soddened by a child. In the second  
take he returns, to play and to perch.  
When you seize like phemonana travelled by the lightning.  
Disintered weather, banal lights like the banner.  
To the velvety color of the cedar pasture.  
Daughter of the depths of my brow - your enchanting  
stills your velvety  
regard as though it were clay.  
It was the afternoon of the ostrich.  
Bruised pioneers and pioneers.  
For me they are algorithmic.  
It was the morning of the elephant.  
  
The reasons for my respect  
are transformed in my eye of bolt of cork.  
The old warrior's medal drinking from my finger.
