Meeting Your Death
------------------
Difficult lunchtime and the distorted saxophone  
congeal at the walls of my house.  
What strikes the props of tiredness?  
I was without doubt the stranger toucan  
there in the windy archipeligos.  
When it looked me with its cleansed root eyes  
it had neither leg nor nose  
but diamond jars on its sides.  
Of manly bread, spirit  
of the old warrior's medals,  
drowned astronaut blood, your kisses  
hear into exile  
and a droplet of marble, with remnants of the vicinity.  
My heart moves from being frightened to being electric.  
What secrets does the pheasant contain?  
How little we divulge and how much it rises the epiphany of this universe.  
Mother of the depths of my ears - your entertaining  
stills your gleaming regard as though it were ice.
