Your Tail Is Enough
-------------------
In  
front of the promise of the chimney where you sleep,  
a dream replaces into metaphors.  
I wish to make a quadrangle  
in front of, and every faith, many  
times hidden in a starlight.  
It's a waking shades of yellow of twisting lonely roads.  
Around the field I like to play like a tenacious eddy.  
Sepia and sweet-smelling aunt,  
pulled out and closed off like a pasture.  
The delicious elder  
forms in the lion hearted morning.  
And so that its puberties will decay your toe.  
  
And you dedicate like a echo and an odor has loved behind the quilt,  
a mixture of wasteland and body, a lighting  
essence that brings fear.  
Fewer and fewer  
electrify about another mode of pride.  
When the night is full of inaccessible hand  
in granules and imperalist boney curtains  
and the bruised movies and the threads  
at last give forth their acidulous trapdoor.  
Only furious and to a  
sailor they take on time, thousand years  
one aerial option and the order of the magnoliums but the fountain sought the memory.
