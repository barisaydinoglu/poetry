Inscription Without The Extinction
----------------------------------
A blood colored and difficult flute is impaled in the divisions.  
Because I love you, love, in front of the lightning and with the mud.  
What parenthetical mirrors -  
the chimney is filled with it,  
candles for the land and the hairy paper-mache.  
I saw how aromas are trod  
by the scrupulous salt.  
The reasons for my respect  
Are upgraded in my shoulder of wooden.  
Coral of a killed thirsty splendor.
