The Technique Of Minor Points
-----------------------------
What we say breathes to  
wet some other uncle  
what a synonym may teach.  
My heart moves from being demonic to being soft.  
You reconcile my windy ash  
Like a poetic lobster to fresh lemon.  
Pockets of ash converted into fused quartz.  
  
Return to the homeland of the paths.  
Always you drown through the sunset  
toward the midnight penetrating juices.  
Of your red fountain when you hold out your tail.  
I salute your mineral wine  
and envy your real pride.
