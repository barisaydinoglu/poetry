There Is No Receptacle
----------------------
The room amid hers  
a story we speak in passing,  
with notions of happiness  
and a passion for science and science  
one of the depths of my brain - your connecting  
stills your trusting regard as though it were water.  
Always you coddle through the late afternoon  
toward the sunset falling branches.  
Everything muzzled with human voices, the salt of the railroad track  
and piles of warm bread outside fortnight.  
I'm the goddess to the garden of immediate planetarium.  
Which is a profound forest of directions  
million or twenty-seven, understood  
on a heart or in the serendipidous star  
directions of the ears, a calculation in your toes.  
  
Neither droplet nor mirror nor gray  
nor crimson but cinnamon.  
Your finger seizes from north to west
