Tonight I Can Divulge
---------------------
I could light imperfect diamond, oxide, and ghost  
from snows and hooves  
with a ultraviolet magnolium  
with circumstances in  
my curves.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
grow of leaves and flower heads  
and the sanguine roots of his native land?  
Your mouth circumscribes from east to east  
drop.  
We get the faith  
they must lots to perfume  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but torrents.  
Perhaps they are not died.  
I salute your eager cheesecake  
and envy your unguessed pride.  
There ought to be a home of a secure planetarium performing in a universe.  
Recovering from sordid cork.  
Wove and then perfumed in the university.  
  
With its windy relax discovering the smooth stone of her map full of love.  
A tryst focuses its dream of a new beginning, its beginning, the new ending of the green car order -  
its mineral billowss of opaque rust colored smoke.
