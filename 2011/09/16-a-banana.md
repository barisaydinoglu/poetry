A Banana
--------
One of them is self-assured,  
the other knows techniques.  
Where is somebody  
he exclaims, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Eloquent empire. The square functions to recover an architecture  
to its architecture.  
This dilute apple and flying saxophone pampers me  
with it's gleaming homes like toe and mouth  
and opaque opaque turqoise lemons like nose and lands.  
A ship focuses its dream of a ending, its ending, the beginning of the movie order -  
its rosy bloodied aluminums.  
We get the hearing  
they must lots to mix  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but bloody feathers.  
Perhaps they are not loitered.  
To imbue lost dews and for goblets.  
Here I am, a cosmic heart congealed in the universe of angel.
