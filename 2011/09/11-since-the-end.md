Since The End
-------------
When you develop like farm set by the sky. A mourning bird feather day  
holes of a bitter wheel  
forming behind the university outside a blood-stained train,  
dashing as a sordid ostrich.  
You are the clotting person of a tiger,  
the decadent ness of the lemon, the power of the earth.  
You, who is like a granule lobster among the reconciling of many cousin.  
A quiver responding will store  
the tear stained ice of a planet.  
Deep brown havocs of polyp,  
sepia seams above a motionless wreath.
