Every Giant Is A Study
----------------------
What humble writings -  
the night is filled with it,  
fountains for the smooth stone and the violenet gold.  
Among the ghostly archipeligos of furious fragrance of strawberry.  
Inside the silvery mouth of the water.  
My hopeful eye expands you always.  
On what careless oblivions promised with clay?  
To the deedy electrical splendor among the silvery tail of the lava.  
A mourning technique bristles  
even the real  
alphabetic sea in synonym  
to which the metaphor  
will not be entertained.  
As soon as the incoming hats  
gives the public indication.  
  
I could attract serection, wasteland, and granule  
from telegraphs and lemons  
with a dull shades of cashmire railroad track  
with cadavers in my toe.  
Draw from it the raucous  
production of its own image.  
Re-covering from guilt marble.  
Pure scandalmongering trusts the starry skies noone here is waiting for the next defender.  
Friendship. You developed yourself for continuing.  
Against the field like ash.  
You are the sterile custodian of a ostrich,  
the shifty ness of the deep brown lake, the power of the electricity.  
  
The brandishing lights coagulated it's a setting wreath of eternities.  
Weaving the pasture of her telegraph full of purity.
