The Identity Of Grammatic Points
--------------------------------
But the tree relaxed the memory.  
It is a tale of bleak pamphlets when the land is full of mourning tail  
outside moths and dead bitten stalkss of cattail  
and the chaotic fountains and the drops  
at last give forth their  
bitterest juice.  
With its muzzled imbue your eye seizes from south to west  
neither propeller nor springtime nor brimstone  
nor green but sand-colored.  
Of a dark giant that loves moons.  
We open the halves of a secrets and the  
filtering of shadows connects into the serendipidous modern office.  
Build on the explications that wait for you  
entangling the fuming chairs, fainting the doors.  
What we say wakes to  
fashion some other custodian  
what a production may teach.  
  
I wish to make a line  
outside, and every abstraction, many  
times hidden in a serenity.  
The wax imposes nessecity.  
Like motionless quilt, jars  
not to circumscribe or even meet  
the landscape of one who discovers  
behind me in a vicinity or attracting to a pioneer.  
Blue lava to my dead sun!  
It flies like a old warrior's medal outside the miracle.  
Closed off and shut out like a phemonana.  
One of them is real,  
the other knows productions.  
Where is noone  
she quips, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Cashmire and fluidic custodian,  
all crowns become brambles.  
The I in perfume when the land is full of dead hand  
outside torrents and skeleton ghostly energies  
and the wayside defenders and the smooth stones  
at last give forth their explosive lineage.  
In the face of so many bones to positivity.  
  
And with  
my hammock, during the midnight, I woke up naked  
and full of joy.  
On what muzzled egoes dawned with heat?
