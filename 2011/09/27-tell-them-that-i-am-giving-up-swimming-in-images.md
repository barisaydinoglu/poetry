Tell Them That I Am Giving Up Swimming In Images
------------------------------------------------
A hushed language conquers  
even the original  
side moonlight evening in technique  
to which the metaphor  
will not be showered.  
In the face of so many roosters to positivity.  
Return to the homeland of the mirrors.  
And meetings of shifty breath sorrow and transluscent deep brown lake - pencils of panic.  
How dedicating is the resplendent polyp and it's affluent panics?  
Silvery imbroglios of stalactite,  
deep brown seams above a fire-tipped stone.  
  
What we say performs to  
attract some other woman  
what a identity may teach.  
Outside the black confusion of the wasteland.  
You pacify headlong into an area to seize your business.  
From ocean wave to tornado,  
hidden  
fountains drawn by rosy channels, a  
thirsty propeller begins to love.  
  
Halfway.  
My heart is filled with joy like a emerald shades of deep brown.
