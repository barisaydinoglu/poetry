Your Eyeballs Is Enough
-----------------------
And so that its utensils will ignore your arm.  
I'd do it for the ribbon in which you rescue  
for the grapes of cinnamon you've fluttered.  
Misunderstood martyrs and fragmented smokes.  
When you excite like ribbon blushed by the clay.  
To preserve lost silken architectures and for currents.  
Everything silent with absent minded voices, the salt of the landscape  
and piles of electric bread within day.  
A explosive technique impales  
even the enduring  
neutral modern office in point of view  
to which the metaphor  
Will not be entertained.  
The foliage rustles in flying your toe. Noone here is waiting for the next foam.  
Propeller. You awakened yourself for mingling.  
Some dawn but I return your broken glass like energy.
