The Bitterest Fisherman Of The Divisions
----------------------------------------
For a day, maybe million,  
I rested under a pillow of fog  
at a bus stop, waiting for the goddess to be outside.  
You - the blazing mouth.  
A chorus of birds at night un trod un degraded  
comes to a halt before a foam.  
The nougat imposes nessecity.
