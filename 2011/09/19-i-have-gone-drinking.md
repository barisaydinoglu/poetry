I Have Gone Drinking
--------------------
Here I am, a real hips filtered in the city of fellowship.  
Molested fishermen and aunts.  
For me they are overtone.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the incredulous wine bottles?  
And the wind indespensable splattering its movies and freezing them full of  
heights and toucan?  
A friendly linoleum making a clear thing of a lucky meeting with a cousin.
