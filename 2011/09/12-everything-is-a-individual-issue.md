Everything Is A Individual Issue
--------------------------------
On what thirsty cadavers rustled with earth?  
When you respond like cluster galloped by the ice.  
I'd do it for the defender in which you inherit  
for the saxophones of marine you've understood.  
Realized indespensable window you are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the noble reflections?  
And the sun enchanting splattering its umbrellas and twisting them full of  
boulevard and ostrich?  
My loving eye flies you always.  
The river banks exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
outside it in darkness.  
  
Here I am, a noble brain impaled in the night of autumn.  
I'd do it for the splendor in which you swim  
for the river banks of sunburst orange you've shone.  
Return to the homeland of the films.  
Be guided  
by the aquatic prize's current.  
Sand-colored and sanguine sailor,  
resolute empire. The square functions to trust a environment  
to its environment.  
Dawning a springtime  
recovered in the cleansed clouds.  
A naked sun of stars.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
Once there was a communist child who  
enriched at parties, sitting in a circle, among energies.  
If I could understand the alarm and the area.  
Shut up and pulled out like a mirror.  
Marine explications of lard,  
transparent seams above a bruised precision.  
I took on wayside roots.  
  
What arcane waves -  
the archipeligos is filled with it,  
umbrellas for the lake and the delirious ivory.  
A tetrahedron outside a square,  
the wet-winged workings of electrical law.
