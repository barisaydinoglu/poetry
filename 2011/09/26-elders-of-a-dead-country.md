Elders Of A Dead Country
------------------------
Our new honeysuckle, our resolute propeller circles.  
A mouth and a ears  
pulsing the boulevard.  
Obscene day and the muzzled sea water  
shake at the walls of my house.  
Pockets of steel converted into marble.  
Fewer and fewer  
undulate about another mode of sincerity.  
Like rotten stumps throttling outside serendipities.  
  
Fewer and fewer  
steal about another mode of sincerity.  
Your foliage is a flower head filled with rotten flute.  
A triangle outside a line segment,  
the forceful workings of warm law.  
Respect is gone, the subject has kissed.  
A loaf of bread baked with decadent sincerity and salt.
