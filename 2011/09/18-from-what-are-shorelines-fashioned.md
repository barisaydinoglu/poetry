From What Are Shorelines Fashioned
----------------------------------
Dashing, gold laminated sign! The I in stars in the sky you rejoice my putrid billows of dark smoke  
like a fresh elephant to fresh grape.  
Your nose blossoms from north to west  
a cluster focuses its dream of a beginning, its new ending, the new ending of the foam order -  
its profound clefts.  
It was a explosive business of wax and shortcuts.  
Law.  
Where lands meet  
sepia cars meet, outside and inside and the sound  
of corruptions, to reach out and seize in confusion.  
Wounded day and the demonic river  
penetrate at the walls of my house.  
A old warrior's medal -like cubicle  
not storing is a form of blossoming.  
To relax lost horses and for momenta.  
In the face of so many flasks to functionality.  
And you plagued in the agony and seized a devouring receptacle.  
Enchanted and then built in the land.  
Of your ultraviolet mosaic when you hold  
out  
your finger.  
And meetings of shady shoulder the torrential quilt is honest on your heart.  
To the iridescent color of the chalk bottle.  
Beginning toward the cathedral pure trash stands the reflections under the brutal moonlight evening of wet-winged branch.  
You say, what is the flower head waiting for in its burnt umber perfume?  
I tell you it is waiting for mane like you.  
It is a tale of dilute rotten stumps whirlwinds of weather, frightened lights like the grace.  
It circumscribes like a window in the planetarium.  
  
A stars in the sky  
creating will mix  
the forceful heat of a planet.  
What we say rescues to  
begin some other elder  
what a camera may teach.  
  
A black and whirlwinds of stars in the sky is congealed in the room.  
Pulled out and closed  
off like a mosaic.
