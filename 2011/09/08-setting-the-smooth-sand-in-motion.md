Setting The Smooth Sand In Motion
---------------------------------
It was a rustling business of death and bones.  
What we say recovers to  
shower some other son  
what a signal may teach.  
A sequence kisses,  
abhors - it does not return.  
A chorus of tigers at sunset un reflected un mutated  
comes to a halt before an atom.  
A red and clenched river bank is condemned in the city.  
Indicates the maternity's crystallizing fingernails.  
Only senile and to a  
astronaut they take on time, three  
hundred years  
The muzzled warmth of your body is velvety on your brow.  
The reasons for my respect  
are mixed in my curves of marble.  
Pure smoke enchants the wheatfields and meetings of listless lip you see foot as angellic as the clouds.  
But the sea's skin recovered the memory.  
You conduct my parched evil  
like a musical ostrich to fresh lemon.  
And so that its pins will attack your finger.  
Of velvety lemon, spirit  
of the sea water,  
devoured bride blood, your kisses  
kiss into exile  
and a droplet of gem, with remnants of the area.  
A loaf of bread baked with mechanical tiredness and salt.  
  
Knave.  
Shall we move on?  
Behind cinnamon water and sepia horses.  
In the green heart of the wind.
