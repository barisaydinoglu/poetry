The Camera Has Not Devoured The Promise
---------------------------------------
My heart is filled with tiredness like a gold wheatfield. You carry my weak coffin  
like a lovely crab to fresh orange.  
You are the tomato of my furious finger.  
You are the rusted man of a lobster,  
the bitter ness of the soul, the power of the ice.  
I saw how kisses are carried  
by the sweet-smelling sun.  
Inside the furious chimney of insatiable starry sky.  
In your eye of beligerance  
the jungle of spheres promise.  
In your tail of disguising the chimney begins to dream of trusting.  
Transluscent silvery polyps of wax,  
sepia seams above a negligent root.  
Return to the homeland of the promises.
