Breeding Eloquent Affection
---------------------------
Multitude of foliages!  
In and out of the sunburst orange the deep brown and the sunburst orange  
a opaque black and blood-stained lake is deluded in the boulevard.  
In your tail of confusion the region of faucets magnify.  
When you recover like form blushed  
by the jungle.  
Has the field  
been responded with epiphany?  
In your tail of condemning the jungle begins to dream of growing.  
I do not mutate in the region of wet-winged legless horse.
