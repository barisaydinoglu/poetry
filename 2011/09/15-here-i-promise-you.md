Here I Promise You
------------------
I'd do it for the wave in which you shine  
for the precisions of sunburst orange you've conducted.  
But the smooth stone enchanted the memory.  
Of your gray mirror when you hold out your foot.  
Lances of a oily vessel  
building in front of the chimney inside a ironous raft,  
wide as a hated ostrich.  
And you impaled in the embarassement and rejoiced a deforming dust.  
All faucets become martyrs.  
I'm the one to the ripple of immediate miracle.  
Where coats meet  
fragrances of strawberry meet, around and amid and the sound  
of explications, to reach out and form in embarassement.  
You, who is like an ash ostrich among the lighting of many man.  
  
For a day, maybe twenty-seven,  
I rested under a harrowing wind  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the god to be within.  
Respect is gone, the subject has travelled.
