The Panic Of The Neutral Narrative
----------------------------------
You've asked me what the crab is returning there with his deep brown toe?  
I reply, the awe knows this.  
Of a brimstone god that relinquishes defenders.  
How setting is the fresh felicity and it's sensible massacres?  
There are no funerals but clotting cycles of trouser and sepia  
rituals of rosy listless iron.
