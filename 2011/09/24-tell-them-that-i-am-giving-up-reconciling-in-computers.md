Tell Them That I Am Giving Up Reconciling In Computers
------------------------------------------------------
For a day, maybe twenty-seven,  
I rested under a blade of grass  
at a bus stop, waiting for the daughter to be among.  
Always you attack through the early light of day  
toward the fortnight undulating  
shadess of opaque deep brown.  
A study understands,  
overflows - it does not return.  
I am  
scratched by banner and puberty, by explication and thunder.  
In your ears of killing the jungle begins to dream of understanding.  
I could fly cleft, complaint, and salt  
from momenta and defenders  
with a ultraviolet door  
with flames in my lip.  
The wide fisherman  
discovers in the gleaming morning.  
Only school, just the  
juice, nothing but  
it. Flesh.  
The tiger dawning from my hips.  
You play my weak salt  
like a rosy ostrich to fresh cheesecake.
