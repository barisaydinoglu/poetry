An Equally Fresh Person
-----------------------
I stayed conducted and transluscent burnt  
umber  
inside the night.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
imbue of breakfasts and writings  
and the absorbant momenta of his native land?  
And meetings of wounded hips a silence -like martyr  
so the balanced pride lives on in an apple,  
the serendipidous house of the cactus,  
the angellic peace that is parsimonious and cordial.  
Not pacifying is a form of re-covering.  
There ought to be a praise of a dashing circus exciting in a heights.  
You are going to ask where  
are the fill?  
And the original branches?  
And the clouds real splattering its currents and abhorring them full of  
modern office and oyster?  
A current of sweet-smelling kiss  
that does not know why it flows and mixes.  
Blue and eloquent son,
