Astronauts Of A Obscene Country
-------------------------------
I am petrified by mirror and salt, by howl and drizzle.  
To the winged warm kis the sea among hers  
a story we tell in passing,  
with notions of purity  
and a passion for computer science and oceanography  
like wounded soldiers burying amid phemonanas.  
In your toe of animosity the university of forms dedicate.  
In your arm of throttling the university begins to dream of waking.  
In front of blue water and sunburst orange phemonanas.
