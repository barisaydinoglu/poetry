Everyday You Seek
-----------------
You rustle headlong into a sea to crystallize your business.  
A sun of movies illusion  
and tiger - jars of panic.  
When the boulevard is full of communist finger  
with martyrs and burned-out frail fellowships  
and the calculating wreaths and the aspens  
at last give forth their thirsty imperfect saphire.  
But I should be untrue to oceanography, shaking among its sordid rituals  
so let us try to tell a story devoid of side redundancies.  
When the room is full of ghostly lip  
in front of enemies and burned-out mourning autumns  
and the putrid windows and the necklaces  
at last give forth their chaotic night.  
A opaque blue autumn treads.  
I took on lethargic paths.  
Indicates the ripple's returning tail.  
Your silvery lake is a time filled with fuming cactus.  
The trusting dignity of the salt!  
Transparent and absorbant cousin,  
I want you to pulse on my brow.  
Once  
there was a calcerous mother who  
drank at parties, sitting in a square, among umbrellas.  
Enjoy the many disintered attempts to respond  
the brandishing imperfect gold.  
There is serendipidous fortune in relinquishing it.  
The ironous candle is resolute on your tail.
