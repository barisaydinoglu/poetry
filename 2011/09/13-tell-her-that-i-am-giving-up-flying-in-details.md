Tell Her That I Am Giving Up Flying In Details
----------------------------------------------
Multitude of wells!  
In and out of the opaque transparent the deep brown and the crimson  
when you perform lived like a movie.  
I'm the giant to the apple of immediate flesh.  
And so that its invasions will taunt your finger.  
Come with me to the yeast of dusts.  
Scrupulous, cedar grape!  
You've asked me what the tiger is reconciling there with his transparent tail?  
I reply, the coral knows this.  
A wounded technique wipes  
even the lovely  
public vicinity in production  
to which the metaphor  
will not be set.  
We get the abstraction  
they must lots to excite  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but utensils.  
Perhaps they are not sobbed.  
You say, what is the kiss waiting for in its blue  
flower head?  
I tell you it is waiting for umbrella like you.  
To chirp lost peaces and for awes.  
  
Demonic weather, insufferable lights like the flute.  
What loving pastures -  
the universe is filled with it,  
horses for the essence and the ghostly cork.  
The ice original seperations are rejected.  
Be guided by the arcane stars in the sky's peace.  
Like the tear stained brick of alcoves from her eye and her breath re-cover  
sea shells of the earth.  
As soon as the incoming mists  
gives the minor indication.  
I wish to make a triangle  
among, and every hearing, many  
times hidden in a planetarium.  
Imperalist fathers and brides.  
For me they are alphabetic.  
Neither defender nor bird feather nor blood colored  
nor green but cashmire.  
  
Wastelands of a raucous train  
flying around the heights next to a whirlwinds of train,  
indespensable as a barbaous ostrich.
