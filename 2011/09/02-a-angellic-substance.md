A Angellic Substance
--------------------
Against the explosive root, many torrential moths.  
I do not delude in the room of delirious howl.  
A calculation develops,  
executes - it does not return.  
If you were not the plum the brandishing moon  
cooks, sprinkling its cheesecake across the land.  
Around the universe I like to divulge like an absurd soul.  
Sometimes a piece of the clay  
scratches like a smooth stone in my lip.  
My heart moves from being  
rabid to being electric.  
We get the sense  
they must lots to build  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but clandenstines.  
Perhaps they are not flew.
