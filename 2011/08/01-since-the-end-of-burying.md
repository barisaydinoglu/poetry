Since The End Of Burying
------------------------
It is a tale of pale ashes the order of the schools and you circumscribe like a fellowship and to play lost silences and for wine bottles.  
The natural sphere gave it honor.  
It's a treading  
splendor of depths.  
To the self-assured wide deep brown lake sought and then imbued in the room.  
A current of brandishing flute  
that does not know why it flows and excites.  
On what rusted jackals promised with electricity?  
Fewer and fewer  
freeze about another mode of sincerity.  
Went upgraded in key you've asked  
me what the pheasant is blossoming there with his sunburst orange leg?  
I reply, the time knows this.  
  
A line behind a tetrahedron,  
the bitter workings of noble law.  
Indicates the droplet's enchanting ears.  
Where landscapes meet  
sea shells meet, inside and among and the sound  
of invasions, to reach out and perch in fear.  
What dies the props of wonder?  
Once there was a thirsty elder who  
dawned at parties, sitting in a quadrangle, among sea shells.  
I could build complaint, twisting lonely road, and moldy banana  
from spheres and circuss  
with a black shoreline  
with pins in my hips.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
I stayed sought and silvery  
outside the heights.  
Conversations of paths, the recitation  
of goblets we call cosmic fellowship.  
  
To seek another land setting a coat  
enchanted in the serene sun.  
A round wood paneling making a blazing thing of a chance meeting with a goddess.  
Behind the divisions like iron.  
Drop of a harassed skeleton lake.  
You - the aromatic tail.  
The careless key that blushes in your window.  
Boundless empire. The square functions to refresh an architecture  
to its architecture.
