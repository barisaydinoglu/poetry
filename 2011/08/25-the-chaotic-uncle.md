The Chaotic Uncle
-----------------
A antenna conducts,  
twists - it does not return.  
Return to the homeland of the trysts.  
I was without doubt the person tiger  
there in the frightened city.  
When it looked me with its incredulous knave eyes  
it had neither curves nor foot  
but marble defenders on its sides.  
I took  
on browbeaten ribbons.  
Flower.  
My heart is filled with happiness like a silicon ripple.  
Starry, chalk mist!
