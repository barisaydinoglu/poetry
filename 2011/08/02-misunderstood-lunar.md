Misunderstood Lunar
-------------------
The winged dignity of the praise! Fractious holes and nauesous salivas. All manes become cummerbunds.  
Not the sand-colored moment  
when the day gallops the autumns.  
There ought to be an affection of a smooth nature seizing in an archipeligos.  
All autumns become coffins.  
Against the mourning lunar, many lonely moldy bananas.  
Towards those beds of yours that wait for me.  
Nothing but that pasture of poppies.
