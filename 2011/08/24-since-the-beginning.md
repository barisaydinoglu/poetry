Since The Beginning
-------------------
Among cinnamon water and blue rituals. Everything ghostly with eager voices, the salt of the sun  
and piles of decisive bread inside sunset.  
And the love to its flute  
and among the warmths of your body the humble one  
the goddess covered with gleaming foam.  
The banal lobster entertains under the lyrical walls.  
It is a tale of banal daggers the bridge executes, the smooth brick of absorbant  
gallops outside.  
A sphere continuing will rejoice  
the wet-winged water of a planet.  
You see breath as perfect as the drizzle.  
Which is a sanguine farm of directions  
million or too few to count, made  
on a tryst or in the resplendent kiss  
directions of the fingernails, a calculation in your curvess.  
Some preserve but I hear your aluminum like springtime.  
The planetarium knows this,  
that life in it's glass boxes is as endless as the sun.
