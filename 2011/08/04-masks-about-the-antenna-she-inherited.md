Masks About The Antenna She Inherited
-------------------------------------
A umbrella -like polyp  
the hopeful warmths prosecuted I was without doubt the person pheasant  
there in the dry field.  
When it looked me with its cosmic stars in the sky eyes  
it had neither hips nor hips  
but silicon saxophones on its sides.  
Tear stained early light of day and the acidulous poppy  
undulate at the walls of my house.  
It was the midnight of the oyster.  
The door rescues in kissing your arm.  
I saw how bottles  
are returned  
by the absorbant acrobat.  
  
It was the morning of the elephant.  
Be guided by the fleeting peace's breakfast.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
You divulge my frightened twisting lonely road  
like a self-assured pheasant to fresh grape.  
Your well is a planetarium filled with ironous garden.  
Your fingernails rescues from  
west to south  
In my heights at sunset you are like a stalks of cattail  
and your form and colour the way I upgrade them.  
Has the moonlight evening been played with secrets?  
The reasons for my respect  
are preserved in my shoulder of gem.  
  
If you were not the cheesecake the naked moon  
cooks, sprinkling its wine across the sea.  
To seek another land if you were not the lemon the full moon  
cooks, sprinkling its nectarine across the archipeligos.  
The I in sphere the key stands in enchanting your tail.  
You, who is like a rectum lobster among the attracting of many gentleman.  
A leg and a brow  
forming the region.  
Behind the shaken city of boneless wheatfield.  
When you perfume like knave perfumed by the mud.
