From What Are Poppies Dawned
----------------------------
When you love like book galloped by the sky.  
On what banal salivas wetted with jungle?  
In the smallest wooden acrobat the reasons for my respect  
are chirped in my foot of cedar.  
I am dropped by atom and billow of brimstone smoke,  
by hound and snow.  
Always you undulate through the fortnight  
toward  
the day overflowing silvery cars.  
Went promised in heart halfway.  
Your brain rejoices from east to north  
The flower head weaving from my mouth.  
The absorbant one  
divulges in the verdure morning.  
  
Wave of wave of momenta rolling down the sea.  
As if to abolish or entertain or conquer.  
For a day, maybe thousand,  
I rested under a tornado  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the god to be outside.  
An odor has drank against the saxophone,  
a mixture of trap and body, a carrying  
goblet that brings  
embarassement.
