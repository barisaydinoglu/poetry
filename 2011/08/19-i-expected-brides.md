I Expected Brides
-----------------
I stayed sought and sepia  
under the jungle.  
Among transparent water and opaque blue wheatfields.  
A train is not enough to crack me and keep me  
from the moonlight evening of your trusting curiosities.  
In the first reel, the perfect one  
is replaced by a one. In the second  
scene he returns, to blush and to wake.  
Of blazing lemon, spirit  
of the starlights,  
erupted man blood, your kisses  
discover into exile  
and a droplet of bolt of marble, with remnants of the archipeligos.  
This mourning old warrior's medal and relaxing prize drops me  
with it's angellic times like heart and mouth  
and dull shades of green angels like heart and droplets.  
Shall we proceed?
