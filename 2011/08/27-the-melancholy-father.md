The Melancholy Father
---------------------
Around the hating twisting lonely roads.  
The tear stained perfume is serendipidous on your leg.  
The fleshes exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
outside it in darkness.  
Abhor me and let my substance divulge.  
Green serections of wax,  
silvery seams above a dead key.  
The cheerless path that carries in your transluscent sand-colored lake.  
Upgrading from boney diamond.  
Inside the mechanical dove, many disintered vinegars.  
A gray and violenet atom is fainted in the region.  
  
And laws and umbrellas.  
In my region at sunset you are like a poppy  
and your form and colour the way I tread them.
