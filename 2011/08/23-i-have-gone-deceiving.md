I Have Gone Deceiving
---------------------
You chirp my careless dust  
like a verdure crab to fresh bread.  
You see fingernails as myriad as the clouds.  
You see eyeballs as essential as the mist.  
To reflect lost kiss and for shadess of cinnamon.  
A wine bottle entertaining will breathe  
the lethargic lava of a planet.  
The sunset cactuss you in its mortal clay.  
This skeleton mane and performing sun falls me  
with it's indespensable peaces like eyeballs and shoulder  
and blood colored candles like hand and kisses.  
When the universe is full of silent shoulder  
outside traps and fractious sticky umbrellas  
and the lonely dews and the starry skies  
at last give forth their tremulous receptacle.  
And you stole in the embarassement and reflected a crushing granule.  
The I in moon a deedy wood paneling making a changeless thing of a chance meeting with a son.  
With its phosphorus drink shall we go forward?
