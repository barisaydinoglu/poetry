A Marble Within Silk
--------------------
Shall we keep going?  
Not the burnt umber moment  
when the fortnight gathers the farms.  
And meetings of shifty arm like calculating shades of opaque cinnamon, miracles  
fresh empire. The circle functions to re-cover a system  
to its system.  
In front of the stone of the room where you sleep,  
a dream loathes into antennae.
