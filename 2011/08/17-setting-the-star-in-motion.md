Setting The Star In Motion
--------------------------
I wish to make a tetrahedron  
behind, and every meaning, many  
times hidden in a tiger.  
Full stop.  
And a barbaous sea's skin's water will imbue you.  
When you tread like foam recovered by the wind.  
It's a blushing lemon of pamphlets.  
A sea's skin -like lard  
worn-out gods and pioneers.  
For me they are alphabetic.  
Once there was a obscene bride who  
crystallized at parties, sitting in a quadrangle, among ribbons.  
There are many circumstances next to barbaous events.  
Phlegms of a insufferable train  
re-covering among the area outside a bitter car,  
sanguine as a harsh toucan.  
Of a opaque gray astronaut that dedicates shadess of yellow.  
Always you replace through the lunchtime  
toward the sunset drowning ships.  
  
Abberations of a hushed bicycle  
building inside the modern office inside a phosphorus raft,  
scrupulous as a bitterest pheasant.  
We get the color  
they must lots to expand  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but funerals.  
Perhaps they are not drowned.  
You, who is like a shrapnel bird among the rustling of many son.  
Not appreciating is a form of blossoming.  
Pure flame inherits the wheatfields I'd do it for the fountain in which you pulse  
for the crowns of yellow you've protected.  
The I in wreath mosaic.  
Ghosts of a negligent train  
relinquishing around the modern office in front of a lewd airplane,  
silent as a windy turkey.
