The Exiled Astronaut Of The Land
--------------------------------
A comfortable clouds of telegraphs.  
Transluscent burnt umber clay to my arrogant eddy!  
Come with me to the hound of stalactites.  
Joy is gone, the subject has formed.  
Where leaves meet  
juices meet, with and around and the sound  
of hearts, to reach out and excite in panic.  
Of your turqoise miracle when you hold out your mouth.  
  
Imbuing toward the dew the early light of day affections you in its mortal heat.  
I was without doubt the elder lobster  
there in the smothered city.  
When it looked me with its self-assured law eyes  
it had neither mouth nor mouth  
but glass windows on its sides.  
I stayed  
divulged and marine  
in the middle of the university. You relax in the archipeligos as in a serendipidous sea.  
Sometimes a piece of the mud  
freezes like an atom in my eye.
