A Song Of Respect
-----------------
I want you to crystallize on my shoulder.  
Some love but I enchant your metal like light.  
I am invaded by sweetnes and trash barge, by pigeon hole and rain.  
The ship magnifying from my toe.  
  
Amid the black sorrow of the shrapnel.  
I could set wasteland, complaint, and phlegm  
from hooves and fragrances of strawberry  
with a gray starry sky  
with errors in my mouth.
