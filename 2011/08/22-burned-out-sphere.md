Burned-out Sphere
-----------------
It's a returning warmth of twisting lonely roads.  
As if to brainwash or protect or loathe.  
A tetrahedron outside a loop,  
the insatiable workings of blazing law.  
Pamper me and let my substance re-cover.  
The mask imposes nessecity.  
Ironous abyss and tremulous wounds.  
Within the ultraviolet embarassement of the blade.
