A Song Of Joy
-------------
Nothing but your aquatic curves.  
The changeless dignity of the magnolium!  
Inaccessible weather, hairy lights like the reflection.  
The brutal essence that crystallizes in your stone.  
  
Weaving a stalks of cattail  
began in  
the irreducable fog.  
Illusion and smooth brick - spheres of agony.
