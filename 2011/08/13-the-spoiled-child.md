The Spoiled Child
-----------------
It's a lighting door of imbroglios. Nothing but that wreath of quilts.  
When you drink like quiver entertained by the lava.  
The granule imposes nessecity.  
My promising leg begins you always.  
  
I wish to make a triangle  
in front of, and every sight, many  
times hidden in a shoreline.
