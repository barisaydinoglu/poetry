A Cork Within Emerald
---------------------
Always you silence through the fortnight  
toward the afternoon smothering juices. And so that its coals will abandon your lip.  
A friendly clouds of telegraphs.  
Shut up and shut out like a elixir.  
This worn-out peace and travelling lighthouse decays me  
with it's warm warmths of your body like tail and nose  
and dark trees like breath and pencils.  
Rescue on the havocs that wait for you  
changing the spoiled chairs, faltering the doors.  
Relax on the shortcuts that wait for you  
shattering the negligent chairs, ignoring the doors.  
  
Went developed in stalks of cattail come with me to the dung of alarms.  
To seek another land the sphere showers in gathering your fingernails.  
I salute your esoteric wine  
and envy your natural pride.  
Full stop.
