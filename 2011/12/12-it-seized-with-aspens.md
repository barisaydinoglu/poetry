It Seized With Aspens
---------------------
We open the halves of a curiosities and the  
penetrating of lampreys excites into the hopeful modern office.  
Custodian of the depths of my foot - your blossoming  
stills your infinite regard as though it were lava.  
A circle in front of a circle,  
the bleak workings of decisive law.  
It  
was the midnight of the cat.  
And meetings of disintered ears around the room I like to light like a harsh land.  
And fountains and pastures.  
And you ignored in the beligerance and discovered a soddening conspirator.  
A dead silence day  
one of them is  
sensible,  
the other knows projections.  
Where is somebody  
she cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Deep brown jugulars of viola,  
marine seams above a delirious ripple.  
Nothing but that atom of flower heads.  
  
I salute your cordial wine  
and envy your promising pride.  
Seizing a kiss  
chirped in the friendly wind.  
  
It was the late afternoon of the elephant.  
I was without doubt the fisherman tiger  
There in the fatherless vicinity.  
When it looked me with its gleaming film eyes  
it had neither shoulder nor foot  
but chalk propellers on its sides.  
Because I love you, love, amid the sky and next to the clay.  
And you throttled in the beligerance and perfumed a wiping stalactite.  
Full stop.  
And the opaque cashmire car to its sea's skin  
and among the trousers the indespensable one  
the giant covered with unguessed umbrella.  
Of secure nectarine, spirit  
of the forests,  
coagulated pioneer blood, your kisses  
develop into  
exile  
and a droplet of saphire, with remnants of the field.
