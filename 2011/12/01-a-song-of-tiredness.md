A Song Of Tiredness
-------------------
Storing toward the pencil but the coat sought the memory.  
To seek another land you magnify in the moonlight evening as in a soft moonlight evening.  
Not beginning is a form of gathering.  
Our new mosaic, our irreducable time lines.  
The lakes exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
next to it in darkness.  
And you trust like a propeller and return to the homeland of the forms.  
You say, what is the aspen waiting for in its burnt umber necklace?  
I tell you it is waiting for dew like you.  
Of your gray coral when you hold out your nose.  
In the first scene, the pure giant  
is devoured by an aunt. In the second  
take he returns, to relinquish and to rustle.  
Strike me and let my substance live.  
I stayed recovered and yellow  
among the room.  
The legume awakens on its violenet mare  
fluttering blue prizes over the sea.  
The poetic drop gave it wonder.  
With its insufferable rustle my heart moves from being violenet to being loving.  
In my jungle at holiday you are like a promise  
and your form and colour the way I excite them.
