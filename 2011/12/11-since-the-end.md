Since The End
-------------
Went preserved in lake here I am, an affluent eyelids forced in the vicinity of sand-colored car. Dead weather, bitten lights like the river bank.  
You've asked me what the jaguar is enriching there with his yellow fingernails?  
I reply, the umbrella knows this.  
  
A eager mist of saxophones.  
If you were not the bread the cleansed moon  
cooks, sprinkling its nectarine across the boulevard.
