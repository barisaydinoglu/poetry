I Have Gone Recovering
----------------------
And you faltered in the beligerance and mixed a coagulating bloody feather.  
The celestial bird feather gave it sincerity.  
Bleak late afternoon and the rusted circus  
taunt at the walls of my house.  
Of a dark uncle that reconciles lands.  
Shall we go forward?  
Only ghostly and to a  
aunt they take on time, three hundred years  
a signal travels,  
congeals - it does not return.  
And in my hammock, during the sunrise, I woke up naked  
and full  
of happiness.  
Our new droplet, our steady current squares.  
If I could trust the ghost and the vicinity.
