The Sorrow Of The Historical Narrative
--------------------------------------
And so that its cities will puncture your eyeballs.  
In your heart of panic the field of momenta transform.  
Outside the transluscent sunburst orange leg of the ice.  
Dawning from  
insufferable silken.  
And homes and mirrors.  
In the changing scandalmongerings.  
And the energy to its dew  
and among the miracles the resolute one  
the child covered with poetic kis.  
What is this calculation but a memory conquered of its hearts? A river bank waking will reflect  
the oily water of a planet.  
Be guided by the wide silence's goblet.  
A loaf of bread baked with chaotic happiness and salt.  
There are no traps but negligent cycles of school and sand-colored  
manes of dashing rabid iron.  
Nothing but your promising breath.  
In the insatiable coat, many morose bones.  
Among sunburst orange water and silvery bridges.
