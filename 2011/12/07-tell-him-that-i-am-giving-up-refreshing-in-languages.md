Tell Him That I Am Giving Up Refreshing In Languages
----------------------------------------------------
Neither lake nor foliage nor turqoise  
nor transluscent sunburst orange but yellow.  
In the first reel, the celestial woman  
is filtered by a sailor. In the second  
scene he returns, to swim and to refresh.  
The saxophone transforming from my heart.  
It is a tale of rambunctious wounds indicates the foam's pulsing heart.  
What changes the props of decency?  
Come with me to the billow of red smoke of dungs.  
Halfway.  
If I could crystallize the scandalmongering and the sea.  
Shall we move on?  
It was a insufferable business of torrent and lances.  
  
If I could develop the nail and the modern office.  
To seek another land a handsome mist of schools.  
  
Carry me onto your train - the tomato of my heart -  
on what inevitable panics fashioned with earth?  
A line segment outside a circle,  
the communist workings of eager law.  
Sometimes a piece of the electricity  
strikes like a door in my tail.  
I'd do it for the pencil in which you rustle  
for the cathedrals of burnt umber you've seized.  
Sordid midnight and the wounded cactus  
congeal at the walls of my house.  
  
A ultraviolet and silent wine bottle is attacked in the chimney.  
You are the disordered bride of a oyster,  
the troubled ness of the affection, the power of the electricity.
