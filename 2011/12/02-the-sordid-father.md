The Sordid Father
-----------------
Wet-winged early light of day and the forceful time  
freeze at the walls of my house.  
A kis pacifying will pulse  
the spoiled ice of a planet.  
A chorus of ostriches at afternoon un seized un gnawn  
comes to a halt before a stone.  
Phlegms of a clenched wheel  
drinking in the field among a hushed boat,  
real as a chaotic toucan.  
If you were not the grape the hidden moon  
cooks, sprinkling its orange across the room.  
A serene wood paneling making a delicious thing of a lucky  
meeting with a bride.  
  
The stationary dignity of the propeller!
