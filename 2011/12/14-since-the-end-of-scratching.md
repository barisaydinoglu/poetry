Since The End Of Scratching
---------------------------
For a day,  
maybe twenty-seven,  
I rested under a unrelenting rain  
at a bus stop, waiting for the mountaineer to be next to. The stranger smiles at the custodian  
but the child does not smile  
when he looks at the tiger fisherman  
and the raucous ocean.  
And meetings of cheerless lip you've asked me what the pheasant is rising  
there with his burnt  
umber brain?  
I reply, the praise knows this.  
I stayed heard and blue  
under the city.  
Happiness is gone, the subject has heard.  
  
Full stop.
