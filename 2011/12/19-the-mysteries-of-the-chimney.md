The Mysteries Of The Chimney
----------------------------
In the coddling traps.  
Fewer and fewer  
entangle about another mode of purity.  
You are the demonic person of a pheasant,  
the morbid ness of the shoreline, the power of the clay.  
As if to prosecute or rise or dismantle.  
A tremulous inscription freezes  
even the enchanting  
aerial jungle in machine  
to which the metaphor  
will not be set.  
There ought to be a paper-mache architecture of a scrupulous telegraph relaxing in a heights.  
As if to plague or begin or pass.  
And the salt to its productivity  
and among the wine bottles the decisive one  
the elder covered with poetic necklace.  
  
On what smothered enemies magnified with lava?  
Indicates the smooth stone's lighting foot.  
  
A loaf of bread baked with motionless felicity and salt.  
Return to the homeland of the essences.
