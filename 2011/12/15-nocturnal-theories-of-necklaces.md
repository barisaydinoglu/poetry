Nocturnal Theories Of Necklaces
-------------------------------
You seek my fragmented receptacle  
like a lyrical elephant to fresh sugar.  
You are the tenacious bride of a lobster,  
the violenet ness of the dew, the power of the sky.  
Multitude of branches!  
In and out of the sepia the deep brown and the crimson  
crimson croaks of torrent,  
deep brown seams above a mechanical thread.  
Indicates the door's kissing arm.  
So the smooth sincerity lives on in an apple,  
the acerb house of the sea shell,  
the wonderful vein that is enduring and noble.
