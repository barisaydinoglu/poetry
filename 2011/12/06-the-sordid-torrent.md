The Sordid Torrent
------------------
We get the feeling  
they must lots to carry  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but wounded soldiers.  
Perhaps they are not petrified.  
Always you congeal through the night  
toward the holiday abandoning serenities.  
Fewer and fewer  
invade about another mode of purity.  
Of your turqoise mane when you hold out your leg.  
Multitude of fragrances of strawberry!  
In and out of the cashmire the yellow and the burnt umber  
someone here is waiting for the next femininity.  
Flute. You upgraded yourself for reconciling.  
  
In my land at afternoon you are like a crown  
and your form and colour the way I relinquish them.
