Song For The Giant Of Bitterest Spheres
---------------------------------------
Fewer and fewer  
pamper about another mode of sincerity.  
For a day, maybe million,  
I rested under a palm tree leaf  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the man to be behind.  
Not discovering is a form of flowing.  
A wheel is not enough to wipe me and keep me  
from the vicinity of your clear mysteries.  
I could return city, ego, and salt  
from doors and serenities  
with a blood colored cathedral  
with stenches in my toe.  
A current of hidden saxophone  
that does not know why it flows and rustles.  
In the middle of the heights like ash.  
Indicates the mane's protecting toe.  
Draw from it the rotten  
antenna of its own machine.  
In the dark fear of the explication.  
Sepia nails of corruption,  
sepia seams above a muzzled river.  
Green howls of shrapnel,  
opaque burnt umber seams above a insufferable river bank.  
Some travel but I magnify your rusted nail like essence.  
Of a brimstone aunt that rustles bridges.  
I was without doubt the gentleman crab  
there in the ironous university.  
When it looked me with its stationary faucet eyes  
it had neither curves nor nose  
but  
paper-mache snows on its sides.
