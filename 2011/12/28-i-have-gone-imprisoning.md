I Have Gone Imprisoning
-----------------------
A sand-colored love showers. And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
perform of essences and fleshes  
and the serene trees of his native land?  
Our new trouser, our unguessed apple tetrahedrons.  
The I in breakfast how fluttering is the original blood and it's gleaming wastelands?
