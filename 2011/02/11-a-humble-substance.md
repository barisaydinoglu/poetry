A Humble Substance
------------------
I could build noise, complaint, and ghost  
from laws and bottles  
with a brimstone pencil  
with cities in my lip.  
Closed off and pulled out like a dove.  
You are the mechanical aunt of a lobster,  
the lethargic ness of the precision, the power of the lava.  
As soon as the incoming doves  
gives the aerial indication.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
Outside the bitterest angel, many inevitable gates.  
What drowns the props of wonder?  
The moonlit dignity of the quiver!  
  
In the face of so many noises to positivity.  
In the smallest glass bird feather sand-colored and dashing man,  
What is this image but a memory electrified of its writings?
