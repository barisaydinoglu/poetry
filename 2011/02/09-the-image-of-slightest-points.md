The Image Of Slightest Points
-----------------------------
Conversations of suns, the recitation  
of fleshes we call lion hearted productivity.  
I seek as if amid a morose pamphlet.  
Towards those pastures of yours that wait for me.  
What we say  
pulses to  
wet some other daughter  
what a inscription may teach.  
And so that its cities will deceive your hips.  
What is this camera but a memory loitered of its banners?  
The neon utensil is perfect on  
your nose.  
Shall we set forth?  
To the serendipidous color of the fused quartz propeller.  
All goblets become polyps.  
We get the meaning  
they must lots to continue  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but eternities.  
Perhaps they are not shook.  
  
I wish to make a loop  
outside, and every faith, many  
times hidden in a starry sky.  
It drinks like a foam among the book.
