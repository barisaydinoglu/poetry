Study In The Aerial Services
----------------------------
With the opaque dark animosity of the dust.  
They ignored it with troubled phemonanas.  
It's a hearing foliage of wounded soldiers.  
Fear and honeysuckle - natures of illusion.  
Here I am, a naked eyelids punctured in the university of smooth stone.  
So the lyrical felicity lives on in a tomato,  
the full house of the shoreline,  
the hidden branch that is electrical and affluent.  
And an arrogant laminated sign's water will perform you.  
And so that its howls will crush your ears.  
What boundless moons -  
the university is filled with it,  
saxophones for the faucet and the clotting diamond.  
My heart is filled with felicity like a saphire angel.  
You are the fruit of my blood-stained mouth.
