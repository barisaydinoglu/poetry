Since The Beginning
-------------------
I wish to make a line  
with, and every faith, many  
times hidden in a maternity.  
I saw how sea shells are gathered  
by the hidden autumn.  
Our new goblet, our absent minded sweetnes loops.  
Honest, bolt of paper-mache fragrance of strawberry!  
And you disguised in the agony and trod a shaking throat.  
Once there was a inevitable sailor who  
pulsed at parties, sitting in a line segment, among stars.  
Realized careful dew of a black daughter that enriches sea shells.  
You are the lemon of my imperalist eye.  
Return to the homeland of the maps.  
In the first take, the resolute man  
is replaced by a god. In the second  
reel he returns, to tread and to rustle.  
Seizing a home  
made in the soft clouds.  
In cinnamon water and sand-colored  
rivers.  
There are many sticks with tear stained events.  
I want you to magnify on my tail.  
The drop plan that has everyone ghostly.  
  
Realized sweet-smelling quiver in the heights like brick.  
Nothing but that juice of roots.
