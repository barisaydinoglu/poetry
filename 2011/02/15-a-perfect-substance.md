A Perfect Substance
-------------------
One side option and hushed weather, rambunctious lights like the planetarium.  
With its  
insufferable gather the incredulous dignity of the current!  
Maternity of a dropped shady splendor.  
Like wounds loitering behind serendipities.  
  
Fashion on the cold fires that wait for you  
abandoning the harsh chairs, impaling the doors.  
You are the apple of my insufferable nose.  
Return to the homeland of the affections.  
A chorus of toucans at lunchtime un made un struck  
comes to a halt before a pullulation.  
The wounded ostrich refreshes inside the eloquent eternities.  
The miracle plan that has everyone fire-tipped.  
A current of steady grape  
that does not know why it flows and gathers.  
Rusted weather, skeleton lights like the nature.  
The jungle inside hers  
a tale we divulge in passing,  
with notions of joy  
and a passion for photography and photography  
the astronaut smiles at the gentleman  
but the daughter does not smile  
when he looks at the oyster mountaineer  
and the putrid ocean.  
But I should be untrue to mountaineering, mutating among its demonic foliages  
so let us try to divulge a story devoid of algorithmic redundancies.  
The order of the windows when you fashion like law gathered by the earth.  
Wave of wave of railroad tracks rolling down the sea.  
What devours the props of wonder?
