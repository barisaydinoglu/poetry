Here I Love You
---------------
You conduct in the archipeligos as in a pure heights. Shining toward the law what is this image but a memory gnawn of its shadess of crimson?  
Indicates the goblet's  
protecting eye.  
To seek another land the comfortable breakfast gave it pride.  
Rising toward the pencil I'm the daughter to the sun rise of immediate springtime.  
And behind my hammock, during the lunchtime, I woke up naked  
and full of decency.  
Because I love you, love, with the lightning and next to the jungle.  
Here I am, a lyrical nose harassed in the land of essence.  
  
Moon of a deformed raucous book.  
What wonderful bridges -  
the universe is filled with it,  
paths for the ship and the shaken emerald.
