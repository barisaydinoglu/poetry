Tonight I Can Build
-------------------
Wave of wave of femininities rolling down the sea.  
One of them is thick,  
the other knows metaphors.  
Where is noone  
she cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Which is a free grace of directions  
thousand or thousand, stood  
on a vein or in the homogeneous flower head  
directions of the fingernails, a calculation in your legs.  
But the vein heard the memory.  
A raft is  
not enough to pity me and keep me  
from  
the chimney of your resplendent epiphany.  
As soon as the incoming perfumes  
gives the minor indication.  
From her eye and her  
hand preserve  
warmths of your body of the earth.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
inherit of affections and manes  
and the careful lands of his native land?  
  
How swimming is the enchanting alarm and it's full billowss of black smoke?  
The pioneer smiles at the man  
but the elder does not smile  
when he looks at the lobster one  
and the phosphorus ocean.  
To the parsimonious esoteric wreath what is this study but a memory passed of its aromas? The angellic natures electrified how lighting is the verdure clandenstine and it's lovely cadavers?  
Towards those keys of yours that  
wait for me.  
Outside the sea like steel.  
You attract my decadent beast  
like a slender jaguar to fresh wine.
