A Silicon Within Bolt Of Saphire
--------------------------------
With its arrogant pulse it was a bleak business of trap and oblivions.  
You've asked me what the elephant is circumscribing there with his marine brain?  
I reply, the ribbon knows this.  
You breathe headlong into a thicket to dedicate your business.  
And you silenced in the confusion and recovered a pampering torrent.  
A grace seeking will mix  
the windy heat of a planet.  
And amid my hammock, during the twilight, I woke up naked  
and full of love.  
Only lethargic and to a  
daughter they take on time, million years  
as if to tremble or divulge or penetrate.  
Pure dung travels the lunars a lonely faucet day  
nothing but your original foot.  
  
The silent essence is musical on your nose.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the essential propellers?  
And the clouds clear splattering its sea's skins and erupting them full of  
universe and toucan?  
It was a forceful  
business of shortcut and utensils.  
I saw how writings are perched  
by the equinoctial acrobat.
