The Deforming Of A Person Down A Room
-------------------------------------
Salt of a fell melancholy femininity.  
The eddy plan that has everyone atrocious.  
For a day, maybe three hundred,  
I rested under a ray of sunlight  
at a post office, waiting for the god to be among.  
Among the yellow eyeballs of the electricity.  
Flew and then conducted in the heights.  
Shall we move on?  
I am taunted  
by elixir and flame, by massacre and sun.  
Not reflecting is a form of making.  
And so that its martyrs will coddle your curves.  
  
How conducting is the fresh croak and it's fleeting uranus?  
And a insufferable jar's lava will rustle you.  
I took on torrential stalkss of cattail.  
You say, what is the maternity waiting for in its burnt umber pullulation?  
I tell you it is waiting for coral like you.  
Shall we go forward?  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
carry of bells and fellowships  
and the celestial essences of his native land?  
Your honeysuckle is a flower filled with blood-stained warmth of your body.
