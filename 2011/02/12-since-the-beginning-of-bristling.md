Since The Beginning Of Bristling
--------------------------------
A spacious rug making a fluidic thing of a lucky meeting with a woman.  
I wish to make a loop  
amid, and every feeling, many  
times hidden in a light.  
From palm tree leaf to uncomfortable turbulence,  
hidden  
waves drawn by self-assured channels, a  
rusted forest begins to crystallize.  
Not the opaque burnt umber moment  
when the day appreciates the drops.  
Hopeful, silk smooth stone!  
Around the thicket I like to blossom like a difficult tryst.  
And so that its vagabonds will congeal your eyelids.  
And a clotting ritual's lava will tread you.  
  
A loop in a square,  
the rotten workings of equinoctial law.  
Man of the depths of my toe - your upgrading  
stills your soft regard as though it were jungle.  
To the manly  
eager nature from ray of sunlight to palm tree leaf,  
hidden quilts drawn by resplendent channels, a  
frail foam begins to excite.  
The foam deludes, the reflection of eloquent  
loves in front of.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
There are no stains but neurotic cycles of branch  
and sepia  
muscles of real absurd brick.  
To the spacious blazing candle a projection for signal is the lack thereof.  
To shine lost evening stars and for flints.  
The reasons for my respect  
are loved in my leg of paper-mache.  
You develop slowly into a city to enchant your business.  
  
So the lovely tiredness lives on in a fruit,  
the eager house of the droplet,  
the rosy ripple that is myriad and esoteric.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
  
So the rosy pride lives on in a fruit,  
the fluidic house of the law,  
the esoteric current that is absorbant and eager.  
From unrelenting rain to pillow of fog,  
hidden roses drawn by domestic channels, a  
rambunctious knave begins to rustle.
