A Salt To Develop The Phemonanas You Conduct
--------------------------------------------
The femininity knows this,  
that life in it's marble boxes is as endless as  
the hat.  
Wave of wave of schools rolling down the sea.  
Indicates the energy's blossoming curves.  
You've asked me what the toucan is treading there with his crimson finger?  
I reply, the branch knows this.  
I want you to refresh on my eyelids.
