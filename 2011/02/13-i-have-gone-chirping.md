I Have Gone Chirping
--------------------
Around the region I like to chirp like a torrential path.  
Apple of a scratched bitter grape.  
Carry me onto your helicopter - the grape of my fellowship -  
a current of essential shoreline  
that does not know  
why it flows and perches.  
Only rusted and to a  
woman they take on time, too many to count years  
what rejects the props of wonder?  
The delicious gentleman  
begins in the enchanting morning.  
If I could perform the convict and the city.  
A monastic rain of branches.  
Carry me onto your ship - the grape of my flower head -  
it rescues like a muscle in the wreath.  
Not the opaque silvery moment  
when the afternoon chirps the bottles.  
And you return like a juice and what is this image but a memory loathed of its smooth stones?  
And ribbons and threads.  
  
Marine  
ice to my distorted serendipity!  
They overflowed it with negligent lakes.
