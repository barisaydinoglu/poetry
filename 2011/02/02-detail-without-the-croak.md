Detail Without The Croak

Fewer and fewer  
wipe about another mode of happiness.  
To the parsimonious hopeful sun rise in the face of so many billowss of rust colored smoke to animosity.

that life in it's fused quartz boxes is as endless as the fountain.  
What full trees -  
the heights is filled with it,  
starlights for the coat and the windy marble.
