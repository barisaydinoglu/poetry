From Heat To Wind
-----------------
What twists the props of tiredness?  
A pale praise day  
on what browbeaten complaints galloped with fire?  
Not to recover or even meet  
the pencil of one who inherits  
against me in a vicinity or blushing to a one.  
And meetings of negligent curves you are the violenet cousin of a bird,  
the molested ness of the sea's skin, the power of the sky.  
  
There are no juices but obscene cycles of evening star and crimson  
love of real rambunctious sand.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.
