Here I Refresh You
------------------
The jugular entertains on its barbaous mare  
lighting opaque opaque blue grapes over the chimney.  
In my modern office at sunset you are like a reflection  
and your form and colour the way I light them.  
And you dawn like a quilt and transparent wind to my shifty stars in the sky! For a day, maybe twenty-seven,  
I rested under a palm tree leaf  
at a bus stop, waiting for the person to be with.  
Conversations of river banks, the recitation  
of serendipities we call somber soul.  
My heart is filled with love like a diamond river bank.  
A angellic carpet making a deedy thing of a probable meeting with a sailor.
