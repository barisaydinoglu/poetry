Proof Of Winged Abstraction
---------------------------
Furious weather, fragmented lights like the mosaic.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
Only sun rise, just the  
femininity, nothing but  
it. Heart.  
It is a tale of explosive imperfect diamonds conversations of pastures, the recitation  
of candles we call myriad grace.  
In the first take, the fleeting daughter  
is drowned by a father. In the second  
take he returns, to divulge and to recover.  
You form my distorted cubicle  
like an absent minded oyster to fresh nectarine.  
  
Not to circumscribe or even meet  
the law of one who promises  
in me in a sea or enchanting to a child.  
The forest freezes, the foliage of somber  
awakens outside.  
A cactus -like seperation  
halfway.  
It is a tale of putrid utensils sometimes a piece of the lightning  
trembles like a friendship in my ears.  
Nothing but that kis of foams.  
He  
is under us at this moment of first rejoicing.  
The muscles exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
outside it in darkness.  
Essential, ivory promise!  
It was a motionless business of mask and deaths.  
With its careless carry because I love you, love, with the earth and amid the jungle.  
Illusion and umbrella - flowers of anger.  
In the smallest copper essence I salute your profound nectarine  
and envy your homogeneous pride.  
  
A praise focuses its dream of a ending, its new ending, the ending of the laminated sign order -  
its rosy funerals.  
You - the celestial nose.  
  
And you cracked in the beligerance and formed a shaking dust.  
The rosy springtimes impaled a harsh phenomenon replaces  
even the sanguine  
alphabetic room in phenomenon  
to which the metaphor  
will not be conducted.  
A signal loves,  
strikes - it  
does not return.  
For vein was senile and morally neutral.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
swim of bird feathers and praises  
and the delicate spheres of his native land?  
There are no legless horses but nauesous cycles of coral and sunburst orange  
jars of silent troubled brick.  
And meetings of tear stained shoulder setting from clenched marble.  
Among the silvery finger of the mud.  
A profound snow of books.  
In deep brown water and sepia  
flags.  
But the perfume protected the memory.  
The plumed cathedrals abhorred an odor has inherited under the bell,  
a mixture of nail and body, a treading  
rose that brings panic.  
Honest, diamond propeller!  
  
Blue enemies of ash,  
blue seams above a putrid affection.  
Went showered in precision not the deep brown moment  
when the lunchtime drinks the hearts.
