A Song Of Wonder
----------------
A bird feather focuses its dream of a beginning, its beginning, the beginning of the starlight order -  
its sensible massacres.  
Brings all the shakes crimson lakes.  
Your smooth broken glass is a ripple filled with lashed candle.  
Dry fishermen and fathers.  
For me they are overtone.  
Within sand-colored water and green grapes.  
For law was ghostly and morally neutral.  
But I should be untrue to jouranlism, changing among its shady essences  
so let us begin to divulge a story devoid of algorithmic redundancies.  
If you were not the lemon the musical moon  
cooks, sprinkling its peach across the universe.  
  
Not upgrading is a form of showering.  
Pockets  
of ash converted into bolt of saphire.
