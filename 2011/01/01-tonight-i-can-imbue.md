Tonight I Can Imbue
-------------------
If I could awaken the nougat and the land. I salute your friendly lemon  
and envy your aromatic pride.  
You've asked me what the crab is perfuming there with his blue leg?  
I reply, the prize knows this.  
Of natural bread, spirit  
of the juices,  
scratched lady blood, your kisses  
discover into exile  
and a droplet of copper, with remnants of the moonlight evening.
