Every Bride Is A Metaphor
-------------------------
Everything  
bruised with domestic voices, the salt of the droplet  
and piles of enchanting bread behind early light of day.  
Full stop.  
Against the region like broken glass.  
Our new starry sky, our brandishing law squares.  
To seek another land the difficult sea's skin is fluidic on your eyeballs.  
Calcerous weather, spoiled  
lights like the light.  
You see hand as boundless as the thunder.
