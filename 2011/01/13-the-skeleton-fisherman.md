The Skeleton Fisherman
----------------------
You wet in the city as in a stationary moonlight evening.  
Mourning bloods and ghostly enemies.  
Noone here is waiting for the next trouser.  
Jar. You rejoiced yourself  
for seeking.  
They are all fishermen  
professional daggers in whose loving veins originate.  
A lovely mist of ships.  
You breathe headlong into a night to recover your business.  
The uranu imposes  
nessecity.  
Of nocturnal wine, spirit  
of the veins,  
killed gentleman blood, your kisses  
travel into exile  
and a droplet of ceramic, with remnants of the chimney.  
Once there was a violenet elder who  
blossomed at parties, sitting in a tetrahedron, among  
bells.  
Towards those lunars of yours that wait for me.  
Gnaw me and let my substance chirp.
