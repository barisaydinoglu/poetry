Goddesses Of A Blood-stained Country
------------------------------------
Like hollow momentum, knaves  
wave of wave of natures rolling down the sea.  
But I should be untrue to engineering, gnawing among its guilt splendors  
so let us seek to tell a story without slightest redundancies.  
Come with me to the smoke of legumes.  
Because I love you, love, behind the heat and with the lava.  
The mechanical jaguar gathers behind the noble cadavers.  
Your apple is a promise filled with listless magnolium.  
It's a circumscribing telegraph of hounds.
