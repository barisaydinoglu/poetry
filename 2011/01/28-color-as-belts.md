Color As Belts
--------------
A sunshine of mirrors the reasons for my respect  
are formed in my toe of gem. On what morose waxes circumscribed with mud?  
A loaf of bread baked with neon honor and salt.  
The sky silent flasks are rejected.  
A current of charitable aroma  
that does not know why it flows and perches.  
  
For a day, maybe million,  
I rested under a ray of sunlight  
at a post office, waiting for the daughter to be behind.
