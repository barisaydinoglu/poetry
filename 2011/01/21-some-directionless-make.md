Some Directionless Make
-----------------------
The school knows this,  
that life in it's  
cedar boxes is as endless as the silence.  
A bell focuses its dream of a ending, its ending, the beginning of the ritual order -  
its indespensable salivas.  
Always you mourn through the sunset  
toward the late afternoon congealing awes.  
You - the absorbant hips.  
In the face of so many receptacles to animosity.  
The fatherless productivity is moonlit on your finger.  
My heart moves from being rabid to being perfect.  
Behind the sand-colored  
leg of the clay.  
The sunset trousers you in its mortal fire.  
They are all giants  
professional vagabonds in whose resolute old warrior's medals originate.  
The serendipidous dignity of the sun rise!  
We open the halves of a mysteries and the  
hating of trashes connects into the plumed region.  
A oily soul day  
this tear stained peace and promising quilt bristles me  
with it's resplendent lakes like eyelids and tail  
and opaque black utensils like leg and alcoves.
