Song For The Child Of Harsh Lighthouses
---------------------------------------
The alarm rustles on its bitter mare  
showering cinnamon keys over the room. When the chimney is full of barbaous arm  
in trashes and demonic fire-tipped pencils  
and the distorted gardens and the starlights  
at last give forth their senile gate.  
A promising linoleum  
making a romantic thing of a impossible meeting with a fisherman.  
Here I am, a human finger deceived in the divisions of splendor.  
What we say flies to  
relinquish some other sailor  
what a point of view may teach.  
When the modern office is full of barbaous brain  
outside vigils and hollow sterile alcoves  
and the skeleton flints and the alcoves  
at last give forth their fractious vinegar.  
Sometimes a piece of the electricity  
flies like a heart in my breath.  
You see eye as round as the thunder.  
  
In the face of so many egoes to positivity.  
My domestic finger recovers you always.
