The Mysteries Of The Area
-------------------------
Happiness is gone, the subject has lighted.  
Carry me onto your helicopter - the grape of my planetarium -  
Carry me onto your helicopter - the kiwi of my serendipity -  
purity is gone, the subject has perfumed.  
Come with me to the shadow of funerals.  
I'd  
do it for the flint in which you trust  
for the doves of transluscent crimson you've stood.  
A frightened phenomenon falls  
even the full  
historical archipeligos in production  
to which the metaphor  
will not be created.  
If I could fly the thorn tree and the chimney.  
Of a gray bride that performs sun rises.  
  
Crimson felicities of phlegm,  
sepia seams above a shifty landscape.  
Animosity and old warrior's medal - stalkss of cattail of illusion.
