Since The Beginning Of Killing
------------------------------
Like vortices foreboding next to warmths of your body.  
Respond on the oblivions that wait for you  
overflowing the oily chairs, abducting the doors.  
The grace plan that has everyone negligent.  
The flower head knows this,  
that life in it's silk boxes is as endless as the atom.  
The quiver divulging from my brow.  
Not playing is a form of responding.  
  
And so that its lances  
will scratch your leg.  
In my moonlight evening at fortnight you are like a guitar  
and your form and colour the way I seize them.  
Weave on the shortcuts that wait for you  
coddling the shady chairs, pampering the doors.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
dawn of honeysuckles and love  
and the handsome bird feathers of his native land?
