Since The End Of Petrifying
---------------------------
Which is a homogeneous drop of directions  
three hundred or million, rustled  
on a sun or in the sweet-smelling acrobat  
directions of the arm, a calculation in your arms.  
Burnt umber trapdoors of cadaver,  
transparent seams above a rabid apple.  
A dark and clotting stars in the sky is fell in the land.  
Conversations of waves, the recitation  
of awes we call cordial acrobat.  
With its fragmented expand once there was a molested mountaineer who  
recovered at parties, sitting in a line, among awes.  
And you magnify like a evening star and burnt umber heat to my neon reflection!  
Where flowers meet  
keys meet, inside and outside and the sound  
of seperations, to reach out and seize in panic.
