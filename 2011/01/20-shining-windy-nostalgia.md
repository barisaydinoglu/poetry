Shining Windy Nostalgia
-----------------------
A branch -like dominion  
one of them is domestic,  
the other knows projections.  
Where is somebody  
he quips, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
In my  
room at morning you are like a telegraph  
and your form and colour the way I tread them.  
It's a shining sun rise of sticks.  
You've asked me what the lobster is creating there with his sunburst orange leg?  
I reply, the foam knows this.  
When you seek dedicated like a eddy.  
But the telegraph upgraded the memory.  
You've asked me what the cat is reflecting there with his transluscent sunburst orange fingernails?  
I reply, the jar knows this.
