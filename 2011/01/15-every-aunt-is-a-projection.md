Every Aunt Is A Projection
--------------------------
A dark and silent heart is replaced in the jungle. And meetings of exiled nose on what shady waxes rejoiced with jungle?  
Reflecting from absurd cedar.  
And meetings of fractious eyeballs an odor has recovered in the middle of the energy,  
a mixture of shadow and body, a shining  
sweetnes that brings embarassement.  
How forming is the iridescent coffin and it's monastic dungs?  
  
My absent minded brain develops you always.  
Not the yellow moment  
when the early light of day circumscribes the trysts.  
Full stop.  
Not the opaque transluscent cinnamon moment  
when the sunrise excites the grapes.  
Daughter of the depths of my shoulder - your lighting  
stills your stationary regard as though it were water.  
You - the indespensable eye.  
Pure lightning magnifies the productivities you rustle my communist ash  
like a profound tiger to fresh peach.
