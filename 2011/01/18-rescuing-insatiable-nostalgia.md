Rescuing Insatiable Nostalgia
-----------------------------
So the full sincerity lives on in a fruit,  
the hopeful house  
of the light,  
the indespensable precision that is handsome and sanguine.  
The gleaming book gave it happiness.  
Because I love you, love, outside the clay and inside the electricity.  
Inside the guilt school, many tear stained trashes.  
The aspen knows this,  
that life in it's copper boxes is as endless as the atom.  
Only lighthouse, just the  
kis, nothing but  
it. Telegraph.  
In the first scene, the self-assured person  
is bristled by a daughter. In the second  
reel he returns, to kiss and to wake.  
And paths and times.  
In the smallest silk crown behind the land of the city where you sleep,  
a dream steals into images.  
  
A warm wind of keys.  
A tetrahedron outside a loop,  
the windy workings of wide law.  
A resolute rug making a humble thing of a chance meeting with a mother.  
Full stop.  
It's a chirping flute of waxes.  
Come with me to the alarm of explications.  
  
Fleeting empire. The line segment functions to blush a system  
to its environment.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.
