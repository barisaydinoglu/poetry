An Equally Essential Sailor
---------------------------
Once there was a insufferable one who  
rejoiced at parties, sitting in a square, among pastures. Because I love you, love, outside the sky and next to the ice.  
From her shoulder and her foot understand  
lighthouses of the earth.  
A transluscent burnt umber shoreline develops.  
If you were not the cheesecake the scrupulous moon  
cooks, sprinkling its plum across the vicinity.  
  
A esoteric wood paneling making a careful thing of a chance meeting with a elder.  
Has the chimney been flowed with secrets?  
The city mingles on its negligent mare  
pacifying green peaces over the land.  
Under the sifted boulevard of mourning tree.  
Not the green moment  
when the morning blushes the grapes.  
To rustle lost snows and for acrobats.  
You are the banana of my worn-out tail.
