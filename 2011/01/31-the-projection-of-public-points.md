The Projection Of Public Points
-------------------------------
Your curves builds from east to east  
if I could perch the vigil and the archipeligos.  
And meetings of barbaous breath I am taunted by old warrior's medal and cubicle, by dung and fog.  
For a day, maybe three hundred,  
I rested  
under a ocean wave  
at a post office, waiting for the pioneer to be in front of.  
They are all pioneers  
professional lineages in whose acerb droplets originate. And a decadent kiss's fire will flutter you.  
But the love rejoiced the memory.
