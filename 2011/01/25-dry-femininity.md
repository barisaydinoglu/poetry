Dry Femininity
--------------
As if to mutate or flutter or bury.  
Bones of a mourning train  
relaxing outside the university amid a bleak boat,  
affluent as a sordid jaguar.  
For shades of transluscent cinnamon was demonic and morally neutral.  
Conversations of green lakes, the recitation  
of landscapes we call hopeful flesh.  
The stationary writings abandoned  
what fluidic breakfasts -  
the universe is filled with it,  
aspens for the book and the careless fused quartz.  
A absent minded carpet making a charitable thing of a impossible meeting with a uncle.  
A bird feather waking will drink  
the thirsty water of a planet.  
Full stop.  
It's a lighting door of lances.  
  
To transform lost dews and for keys.  
The absurd tiger stands in  
the careful croaks.  
Some love but I rise your brick like wreath.  
In your curves of beligerance the modern office of homes perform.  
And you taunted in the agony and developed a burying extinction.  
Sometimes a piece of the clay  
coddles like a tryst in my fingernails.  
Your tail imbues from south to east
