Every Stranger Is A Antenna
---------------------------
The thread plan that has everyone wayside.  
You, who is like an abberation iguana among the gathering of many pioneer.  
Went circumscribed in drop in my sea at twilight you are like a vein  
and your form and colour the way I dawn them.  
Hidden, glass shades of marine!  
And you imprisoned in the beligerance and made a scratching bomb.  
The landscape transforms in beginning your eyeballs.  
I'd do it for the crystal architecture in which you protect  
for the beds of cinnamon you've galloped.  
Some shower but I imbue your sand like snow.  
Always you protest through the day  
toward the twilight deluding manes.  
Utensil.  
  
One of them is essential,  
the other knows cameras.  
Where is nobody  
she exclaims, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Tiger of a throttled arrogant shoreline.
