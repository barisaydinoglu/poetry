Unguessed Theories Of Sea's Skins

Of a opaque blood colored one that discovers serendipities. What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
If you were not the apple the great moon  
cooks, sprinkling its nectarine across the night.  
But the light recovered the memory.  
We open the halves of a mysteries and the  
pampering of moths kisses into the careful vicinity.  
  
I salute your indespensable nectarine  
and envy your sensual pride.  
Return to the homeland of the quilts.
