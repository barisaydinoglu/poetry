The Petrifying Of A Gentleman Down A Universe
---------------------------------------------
Putrid cummerbunds and hollow parallel scandalmongeringss.  
If I could awaken the yeast and the night.  
Our new book, our charitable current triangles.  
Pure womb reconciles the cathedrals halfway.  
And meetings of brutal brow an odor has fashioned inside the fragrance of strawberry,  
a mixture of heart and body, a magnifying  
springtime that brings embarassement.  
Panic and starlight - serendipities of embarassement.  
Pockets of metal  
converted into saphire.
