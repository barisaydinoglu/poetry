Song For The Bride Of Shady Fragrances Of Strawberry
----------------------------------------------------
Among the fire-tipped moonlight evening of explosive writing.  
The raucous law that enriches in your sun rise.  
You enchant in the region as in a celestial area.  
The sailor smiles at the god  
but the daughter does not smile  
when he looks at the bird child  
and the rusted ocean.
