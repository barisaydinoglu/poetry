The Bloody Feather Fallen Into The Sea
--------------------------------------
Realized humble vein inside the university like rusted nail. The tiger exciting from my arm.  
Enjoy the many rigid attempts to respond  
the absent minded blood.  
There is romantic fortune in blushing it.  
It was a thirsty business of funeral and shardss of diamond.  
Some shine but I continue your salt like path.  
  
A mineral wood paneling making  
a nocturnal thing of a chance meeting with a daughter.  
I took on rustling kiss.
