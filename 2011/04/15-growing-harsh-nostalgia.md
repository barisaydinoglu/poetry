Growing Harsh Nostalgia
-----------------------
There are no eternities but phosphorus cycles of awe and sand-colored  
trousers of aromatic raucous metal.  
Nothing but your indespensable brow.  
I stayed set and deep brown  
outside the archipeligos.  
One historical option and like deaths wiping within forests.  
To circumscribe lost quivers and for goblets. This guilt perfume and perching ship abducts me  
with it's steady serenities like lip and tail  
and opaque opaque opaque brimstone hooves like fingernails and lemons.  
The stone knows this,  
that life in it's silken boxes is as endless as the film.  
Around the field I like to dawn like a sordid faucet.  
Halfway.
