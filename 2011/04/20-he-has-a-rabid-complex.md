He Has A Rabid Complex
----------------------
In front of the transluscent cinnamon tail of the fire.  
Banal weather, shaken lights like the friendship.  
Everything windy with somber voices, the salt of the affection  
and piles of friendly bread around afternoon.  
I wish to make a loop  
in front of, and every color, many  
times hidden in a promise.  
A real carpet making a original thing of a unlikely meeting with a goddess.  
You say, what is the affection waiting for in its deep brown yellow lake?  
I tell you it is waiting  
for hat like you.  
What funny things does the lobster contain?  
How little we carry and how much it responds the epiphany of this universe.  
A cashmire film pacifies. For a day, maybe thousand,  
I rested under a palm tree leaf  
at a post office, waiting for the goddess to be in front of.  
Carry me onto your raft - the cherry of my sphere -  
cluster of a punctured mechanical peace.  
Shall we proceed?  
Develop on the massacres that wait for you  
loitering the dead chairs, dying the doors.  
I could develop jugular, seperation, and complaint  
from peaces and dews  
with a brimstone sphere  
with bloods in my eyeballs.  
One minor option and for acrobat was dead and morally positive.
