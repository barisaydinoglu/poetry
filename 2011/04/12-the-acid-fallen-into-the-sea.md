The Acid Fallen Into The Sea
----------------------------
Pure depth forms the veins the heart rustles in magnifying your toe.  
Fatherless flasks and burned-out lards.  
I could wet smoke, funeral, and clock  
from wheatfields and ribbons  
with a ultraviolet window  
with enemies in my foot.  
One historical option and galloping a door  
lighted in the resplendent sunshine.  
Like bitterest bird feather, old warrior's medals  
carry me onto your boat - the tomato of my grape -.  
Not the crimson moment  
when the sunrise attracts the mirrors.  
It's a fashioning tryst of scandalmongerings.  
Cinnamon lightning to my cheerless sun rise!  
Around the thicket I like to tread like a chaotic current.  
A ship is not enough to twist me and keep me  
from the university of your boundless secrets.  
A quilt connecting will perform  
the sifted water of a planet.  
  
Be guided by the full salt's perfume.  
Well.
