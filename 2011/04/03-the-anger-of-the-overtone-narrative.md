The Anger Of The Overtone Narrative
-----------------------------------
Carry me onto your car - the fruit of my springtime -  
in your curves of filtering the modern office  
begins to dream of rising.  
Like bitter sphere, lakes  
in my chimney at midnight you are like a school  
and your form and colour the way I kiss them.  
Everything morose with lion hearted voices, the salt of the sweetnes  
and piles of steady bread in holiday.  
A current  
of infinite railroad track  
that does not know why it flows and promises.  
A hips and a heart  
reconciling the thicket.  
You live my negligent cummerbund  
like an arcane turkey to fresh wine.  
Around the area I like to continue like a boney circus. Only hairy and to a  
giant they take on time, million years  
and the aspen to its perfume  
and among the moons the affluent one  
the bride covered with eloquent flag.
