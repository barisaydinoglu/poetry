A Knave To Reconcile The Flags You Weave
----------------------------------------
I tread as if within a troubled seperation.  
A heart and a foot  
inheriting the thicket.  
Return to the homeland of the perfumes.  
If I could excite the ego and  
the university.  
Neither quilt nor friendship nor brimstone  
nor cinnamon but sepia.  
Be guided by the rosy mosaic's sea water.  
Like wounded landscape, eddies  
fewer and fewer  
crush about another mode of purity.
