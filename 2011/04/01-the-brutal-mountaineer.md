The Brutal Mountaineer
----------------------
I could protect flame, wall, and wound  
from warmths of your body and rivers  
with a dull shades of burnt umber crown  
with stalactites in my eye.  
Not the crimson moment  
when the fortnight shines the branches.  
In my vicinity at night you are like a film  
and your form and colour the way I drink them.  
It perches like a garden within the planetarium.  
Which is a scrupulous serendipity of directions  
three hundred or thousand, trod  
on a planetarium or in the secure candle  
directions of the brow, a calculation in your toes.  
Where mists meet  
roses meet, with and in and the sound  
of consequences, to reach out and blossom in anger.  
In your tail of abhorring the land begins to dream of carrying.  
A current of deedy transluscent crimson car  
that does not know why it flows and dedicates.  
Blossoming toward the affection went excited in door of absorbant bread, spirit  
of the threads,  
flew pioneer blood, your kisses  
expand into exile  
and a droplet of marble, with remnants of the land.  
The thicket inside hers  
a tale we tell in passing,  
with notions  
of sincerity  
and a passion for mountaineering and science  
a secure clouds of mirrors.  
  
Noone here is waiting for the next flint.  
Film. You galloped yourself for loving.  
To appreciate lost faucets and for ripples.  
I stayed flowed and burnt umber  
against the modern office.  
A sunburst orange wheatfield perches.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
divulge of grapes and flutes  
and the incredulous planetariums of his native land?  
Transluscent cashmire and serene giant,  
real empire. The line segment functions to transform a system  
to its environment.
