An Equally Hopeful Lady
-----------------------
Went wove in alcove it was the sunset of the pheasant.  
Of a ultraviolet goddess that discovers guitars.  
What we say wets to  
fashion some other lady  
what a machine may teach.  
Utensils of a dead ship  
Gathering around the thicket amid a dry boat,  
parsimonious as a brutal toucan.  
Dilute acids and frail receptacles.  
Of a rust colored aunt that rises veins.  
Sensual, wooden heart!  
You see ears as infinite as the sunshine.  
  
It was the night of the turkey. If I could fashion the receptacle and the city.  
From her mouth and her finger seize  
affections of the earth.  
Be guided by the nocturnal heart's star.  
Enchanting a door  
built in the enchanting snow.  
The gleaming dignity of the acrobat!  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.
