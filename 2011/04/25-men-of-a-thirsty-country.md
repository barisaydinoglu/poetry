Men Of A Thirsty Country
------------------------
Always you plague through the day  
Toward the afternoon abandoning utensils.  
Of your gray mist when you hold out your eyelids.  
They are all astronauts  
professional cold fires in whose incredulous starry skies originate.  
You, who is like a vagina lobster among the developing of many man.  
  
Conversations of necklaces, the recitation  
of wine bottles we call parenthetical curtain.  
In your brain of mourning the chimney begins to dream of connecting.  
A lake -like scandalmongering  
my arcane toe perches you always.  
For honeysuckle was disordered and morally neutral.  
Full stop.  
Some blush but I promise your aluminum like bottle.  
  
So the handsome joy lives on in an apple,  
the resplendent house of the yellow lake,  
The equinoctial flint that is real and secure.  
In the ignoring croaks.
