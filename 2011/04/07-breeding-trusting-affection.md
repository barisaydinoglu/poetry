Breeding Trusting Affection
---------------------------
I saw how planetariums are mixed  
by the resplendent smooth stone.  
Pockets of steel converted into silken.  
Towards those magnoliums of yours that wait for me.  
We get the feeling  
they must lots to store  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but cubicles.  
Perhaps they are not conquered.  
There are no rotten stumps but raucous cycles of awe and yellow  
curtains of boundless rabid ash.  
Deep brown uranus of mask,  
transparent seams above a torrential grace.  
In the face of so many wounded soldiers to positivity.  
I am scratched by wine bottle and blade, by clock and sunshine.  
Only fellowship, just the  
movie, nothing but  
it. Lunar.  
Shall we recount?  
And a hated bridge's lightning will blush you.
