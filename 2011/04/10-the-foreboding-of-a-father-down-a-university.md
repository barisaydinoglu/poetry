The Foreboding Of A Father Down A University
--------------------------------------------
Motionless fishermen and women.  
For me they are algorithmic.  
Nothing but that muscle of graces.  
Of your opaque black fountain when you hold out your ears.  
If I could protect the conspirator and the boulevard.  
I shine as if with a boney abys.  
Conversations of pastures, the recitation  
of bells we call secure laminated sign.  
Fewer and fewer  
degrade about another mode of decency.  
This dry evening star and carrying prize falls me  
with it's gleaming stalkss of cattail like shoulder and hips  
and black precisions like foot and flints.  
With its skeleton gather like the bitten brick of saxophones goblet was no longer above the transmission threshold.  
I want you to gather on my fingernails.  
Come with me to the lance of dominions.  
I'm the elder to the defender of immediate reflection.  
Not travelling is a form of loving.
