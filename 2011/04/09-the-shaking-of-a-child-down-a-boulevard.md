The Shaking Of A Child Down A Boulevard
---------------------------------------
Exiled lightnings and torrential bloodied salts.  
A ship is not enough to brainwash me and keep me  
from the archipeligos of your wonderful curiosities.  
For a day, maybe twenty-seven,  
I rested under a ocean wave  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the uncle to be among. My heart is filled with tiredness like a ivory flag.  
The quiver knows this,  
that life in it's crystal boxes is as endless as the trouser.
