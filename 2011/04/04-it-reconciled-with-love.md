It Reconciled With Love
-----------------------
And so that its lonely roads will protest your tail.  
The vortex gallops on its acidulous mare  
trusting opaque transluscent sand-colored autumns over the archipeligos.  
Draw from it the directionless  
inscription of its own phenomenon.  
Moldy bananas of a dead car  
attracting around the sea outside a negligent car,  
comfortable as a bitter oyster.  
You are the apple of my clenched breath.  
You grow my worn-out bomb  
like a careful elephant to fresh bread.  
  
Seek on the shortcuts that wait for you  
smothering the cold chairs, soddening the doors.  
The dead leaf that plays in your phemonana.
