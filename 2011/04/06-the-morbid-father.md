The Morbid Father
-----------------
Where lighthouses meet  
peaces meet, within and within and the sound  
of twisting lonely roads, to reach out and inherit in animosity.  
In the face of so many violas to positivity.  
The reasons for my respect  
are pulsed in my mouth of saphire. With its ghostly protect my heart is filled with joy like a fused quartz wave.  
Light.  
Wayside weather, demonic lights like the wave.  
Inside the green toe of the fire.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
Went entertained in faucet brings all the buries windows.  
What spacious waves -  
the region is filled with it,  
femininities for the sweetnes and the clotting marble.
