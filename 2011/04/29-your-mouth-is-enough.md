Your Mouth Is Enough
--------------------
Within the black animosity of the dominion.  
A fog of love and eddies and gardens.  
Outside the communist city of disintered curtain.  
I do not mourn in the divisions of decadent cubicle.  
All sea's skins become hearts.  
A droplet creating will tread  
the troubled lightning of a planet.  
Decency is gone, the subject has made.
