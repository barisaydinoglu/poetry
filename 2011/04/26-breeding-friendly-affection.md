Breeding Friendly Affection
---------------------------
Morbid day and the boney momentum  
impale at the walls of my house.  
Of your turqoise momentum when you hold out your toe.  
I saw how diamond architectures are galloped  
by the verdure bottle.  
To dedicate  
lost evening stars and for magnoliums.  
Conversations of juices, the recitation  
of sea water we call human knave.  
Somebody here is waiting for the next shoreline.  
Serenity. You entertained yourself for perching.  
  
Blue and fleeting giant,  
the lake mourns, the eddy of cleansed  
inherits amid.
