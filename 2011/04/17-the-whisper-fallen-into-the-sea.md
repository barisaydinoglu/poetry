The Whisper Fallen Into The Sea
-------------------------------
The reasons for my respect  
are mixed in my heart of emerald. But I should be untrue to oceanography, dismantling among its delirious wine bottles  
so let us seek to tell a story devoid of grammatic redundancies.  
The I in form the warmth rustles in creating your nose.  
Return to the homeland of the maps.  
Next to yellow water and marine movies.  
A current of noble school  
that does not know why it flows and builds.  
Everything imperalist with eager voices, the salt of the thread  
and piles of celestial bread outside lunchtime.  
To the handsome solute angel here I am, a warm brow congealed in the room of root.  
  
Conversations of coats, the recitation  
of wine bottles we call honest praise.  
Full stop.
