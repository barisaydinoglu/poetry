Behind Of Lemon And Leaf
------------------------
They foreboded it with decadent alcoves.  
Circus of a harassed rambunctious map.  
Somebody here is waiting for the next silence.  
Atom. You perched yourself for shining.  
This nauesous sweetnes and flying planetarium abhors me  
with it's irreducable bridges like hand and eyeballs  
and dull shades of silvery fountains like arm and transparent lakes.  
You attract slowly into  
a land to live your business.  
In the smallest saphire river bank exciting toward the sea's skin the bride smiles at the person  
but the elder does not smile  
when he looks at the pheasant giant  
and the calcerous ocean.  
Of your opaque brimstone mane when you hold out your toe.  
Free, saphire precision!  
There are many pigeon holes with boneless events.  
Deep brown whispers of whisper,  
green seams above a muzzled kis.  
In your brow of twisting the university begins to dream of divulging.  
  
And in front of my hammock, during the afternoon, I woke up naked  
and full of respect.  
Animosity and sun - serenities of illusion.  
In the first scene, the solute cousin  
is replaced by a goddess. In the second  
scene he returns, to protect and to awaken.  
Parched sailors and ladies.  
For me they are historical.  
The brutal bird stores outside the humble ghosts.  
I shine as if behind a bitterest enemy.
