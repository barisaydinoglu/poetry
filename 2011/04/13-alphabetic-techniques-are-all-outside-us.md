Alphabetic Techniques Are All Outside Us

A bitten bird feather day  
only putrid and to a  
person they take on time, too many to count years  
as soon as the incoming writings  
gives the historical indication.  
You say, what is the faucet waiting for in its cinnamon book?  
I tell you it is waiting for school like you.  
How reflecting is the lion hearted flask and it's solute lances?  
From her foot and her eyelids flow  
beds of the earth.  
Nothing but that productivity of cathedrals.  
Attracting a movie  
shone in the sensible drizzle.  
A worn-out phenomenon congeals  
even the unguessed  
minor region in point of view  
to which the metaphor  
will not be chirped.  
How shining is the natural vinegar and it's noble bloodied clays?  
I do not coagulate in the sea of calcerous wounded soldier.  
  
Nothing but your serene brow.  
You, who is like a wall tiger among the weaving of many custodian.  
  
Not to rescue or even meet  
the grace of one who blushes  
behind me in a universe or perching to a fisherman.  
Sometimes a piece of the mud  
devours like a time in my breath.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
Disordered lineages and frightened shrapnels.
