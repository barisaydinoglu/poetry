Breeding Acerb Affection
------------------------
We open the halves of a phenomena and the  
cracking of bones recovers into the human vicinity.  
And the affection to its mane  
and among the bottles the warm one  
the pioneer covered with honest maternity.  
I saw how fountains are rose  
by the acerb circus.  
I took on insufferable evening stars.  
And so that its vinegars will silence your fingernails.  
Not the sunburst orange moment  
when the sunrise hears the souls.  
I want you to travel on my foot.  
It is a tale of calculating conspirators when you circumscribe like form blossomed by the fire.  
Cold panics and morbid twisting lonely roads.  
Multitude of cactuss!  
In and out of the sepia the marine and the cashmire  
to seek another land a brow and a hand  
blushing the sea.  
  
Of slender peach, spirit  
of the magnoliums,  
coagulated son blood, your kisses  
mingle into exile  
and a droplet of bolt of crystal, with remnants of the divisions.  
I'd do it for the affection in which you light  
for the defenders of burnt umber you've trod.
