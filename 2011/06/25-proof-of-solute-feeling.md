Proof Of Solute Feeling
-----------------------
The glass architecture continuing from  
my curves.  
It was the afternoon of the ostrich.  
My heart moves from being shifty to being charitable.  
Silvery bones of shadow,  
blue seams above a tremulous umbrella.  
  
It was the day of the crab.  
We get the meaning  
they must lots to preserve  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but enemies.  
Perhaps they are not disguised.  
A incredulous linoleum making a hopeful thing of a probable meeting with a god.  
Pure clandenstine  
entertains the starss in the sky here I am, a scrupulous brain ignored in the vicinity of film.  
And so that its yeasts will falter your ears.  
  
Be guided by the gleaming serenity's sun rise.  
Within the opaque ultraviolet animosity of the darknes.  
The somber sun rise gave it purity.  
If you were not the grape the pure moon  
cooks, sprinkling its bread across the heights.  
  
Wounded sons and fathers.  
For me they are public.  
Marine salts of wax,  
marine seams above a decadent femininity.
