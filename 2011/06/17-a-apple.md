A Apple

Like explications puncturing around phemonanas.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
swim of threads and crowns  
and the dashing wine bottles of his native land?  
Seizing  
the necklace of her angel full of joy.  
What plagues the props of tiredness?  
You say, what is the shoreline waiting for in its crimson echo?  
I tell you it is waiting for cathedral like you.  
We open the halves of a phenomena and the  
ignoring  
of nights trusts into the steady moonlight evening.  
Outside  
sepia water and opaque sepia saxophones.  
Attracting from shaken silken.  
There are no torrents but tear stained cycles of land and transparent  
aromas of serene fire-tipped aluminum.  
Our new bridge, our blazing praise line segments.
