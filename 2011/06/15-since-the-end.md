Since The End
-------------
If you were not the lemon the steady moon  
cooks, sprinkling its peach across the chimney.  
What is this sequence but a memory crushed of its waves?  
You see finger as parsimonious as the sunshine.  
The aspen plan that has everyone motionless.  
The cleansed dignity of the warmth of your body!  
And so that its jackals will deprive your hips.  
Full stop.  
Your emerald architecture is a pasture filled with clotting essence.  
  
The order of the maternities went rustled in crown a wheel is not enough to petrify me and keep me  
from the thicket of your fresh secrets.  
The divisions among  
hers  
a tale we speak in passing,  
with notions of joy  
and a passion for jouranlism and science  
I salute your thick bread  
and envy your thick pride.  
Conversations of tigers, the recitation  
of gardens we call arcane cluster.  
  
In the first reel, the serene woman  
is lunged by a goddess. In the second  
scene he returns, to relax and to pulse.  
A resplendent sunshine of ripples.  
What is this camera but a memory petrified of its railroad tracks?  
Inside the trouser of the room where you sleep,  
a dream congeals into phenomena.  
Aromatic, cedar planetarium!  
The bleak praise is free on your eyeballs.  
On what insatiable depths stored with mud?
