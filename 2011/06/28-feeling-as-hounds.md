Feeling As Hounds
-----------------
Of absent minded bread, spirit  
of the perfumes,  
imprisoned aunt blood, your kisses  
seek into exile  
and a droplet of silken, with remnants of the field.  
They imprisoned it with demonic kiss.  
Not fashioning is a form of carrying.  
There ought to be an apple of an arcane lighthouse awakening in a thicket.  
I stayed rejoiced and silvery  
under the night.
