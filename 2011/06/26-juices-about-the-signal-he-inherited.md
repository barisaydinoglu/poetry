Juices About The Signal He Inherited
------------------------------------
Indicates the curtain's chirping heart.  
Some refresh but I begin your rusted nail like ship.  
From her heart and her hand form  
river banks of the earth.  
The bridge plan that has everyone torrential.  
You say, what is the acrobat waiting for in its marine  
droplet?  
I tell you it is waiting for serenity like you.  
Of your dark foliage when you hold out your eye.  
Fisherman of the depths of my brain - your carrying  
stills your angellic regard as though it were wind.  
As if to invade or wake  
or lunge.  
  
You, who is like a night pheasant among the breathing of many giant.  
I'm the father to the sun of immediate praise.  
  
Halfway.  
She is against us at this moment of first building.  
Of a rust colored stranger that mingles flowers.
