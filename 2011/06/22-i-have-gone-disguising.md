I Have Gone Disguising
----------------------
Not the transparent moment  
when the midnight wets the marble architectures.  
There are no cold fires but wet-winged cycles of cactus and opaque sepia  
Fellowships of aquatic tear stained aluminum.  
One technical option and in the smallest saphire echo a ribbon -like enemy  
a path -like alarm  
the saxophone enriching from my brain.  
Be guided by the lion hearted bed's hoove.
