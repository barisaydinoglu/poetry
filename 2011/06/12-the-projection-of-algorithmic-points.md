The Projection Of Algorithmic Points
------------------------------------
In the first take, the angellic son  
is brainwashed by a uncle. In  
the second  
scene he returns, to mix and to develop. Your hips attracts from east to east of your turqoise sweetnes when you hold out your leg.  
One of them is unguessed,  
the other knows signals.  
Where is everybody  
she cries,  
and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Our new sepia car, our thick apple circles.  
From her ears and her eye play  
reflections of the earth.
