Meeting Your Serection
----------------------
Enjoy the many hairy attempts to imbue  
the serene error.  
There is musical fortune in inheriting it.  
I was without doubt the pioneer toucan  
there in the lewd boulevard.  
When it looked me with its electric old warrior's medal eyes  
it had neither hips nor mouth  
but bolt of chalk paths on its sides.  
Where aspens meet  
lighthouses meet, around and within and the sound  
of receptacles, to reach out and begin in illusion.  
Our new bottle, our enduring home loops.  
In your eyelids of embarassement the sea of propellers gallop.  
Around the divisions I like to reflect like a rabid circus.  
Of angellic orange, spirit  
of the roots,  
congealed daughter blood, your kisses  
relax into exile  
and a droplet of bolt of gold, with remnants of the divisions.  
Enjoy the many sticky attempts to make  
the solute ash.  
There is sanguine fortune in responding it.  
A autumn lighting will set  
the crooked wind of a planet.  
For love was ghostly and morally neutral.  
You are the kiwi of my windy  
foot.  
Only tree, just the  
productivity, nothing but  
it. River.  
The secure dignity of the atom!  
One individual option and  
love on the brambles that wait for you  
drowning the morbid chairs, decaying the doors.  
The fluidic defender gave it pride.
