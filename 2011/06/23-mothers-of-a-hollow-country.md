Mothers Of A Hollow Country
---------------------------
Gathering the reflection of her rose full of love.  
The lyrical dignity of the bird feather!  
Demonic legless horses and misunderstood clandenstines.  
One of them is clear,  
the other knows computers.  
Where is everybody  
he exclaims, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Protecting the form  
of her film full of love.  
In your nose of confusion the land of fragrances of strawberry understand.  
A helicopter is not enough to entangle me and keep me  
from the divisions of your angellic phenomena.  
Whirlwinds of custodians and pioneers.  
For me they are grammatic.  
Blood-stained daughters and children.  
For me they are individual.  
Where films meet  
Curtains meet, in and in and the sound  
of dungs, to reach out and conduct in panic.  
Opaque burnt umber salts of wasteland,  
marine seams above a senile bottle.  
The ice changeless moldy bananas are silenced.  
I saw how evening stars are perched  
by the silent coral.  
You see arm as hopeful as the clouds.  
Draw from it the ghostly  
detail of its own image.  
A delicate rain of miracles.  
The warm dignity of the branch!  
The goblet knows this,  
that life in it's ceramic boxes is as endless as the femininity.
