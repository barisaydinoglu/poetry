The Trembling Of A Custodian Down A Jungle
------------------------------------------
Here I am, a moonlit curves mutated in the sea of smooth stone.  
You say, what is the planetarium waiting for in its sand-colored door?  
I tell you it is waiting for thread like you.  
Because I love you, love, next to the water and in the fire.  
The astronaut smiles at the pioneer  
but the cousin does not smile  
when he looks at the cat man  
and the windy ocean.  
Conversations of flags, the recitation  
of prizes we call slender leaf.  
You, who is like a shortcut squirrel among the hearing of many mother.  
  
Nobody here is waiting for the next faucet.  
Lunar. You dedicated yourself for developing.  
To the aromatic color of the bolt of diamond saxophone.
