Tell Her That I Am Giving Up Seeking In Studies
-----------------------------------------------
The boulevard with hers  
a history we divulge in passing,  
with notions of felicity  
and a passion for mountaineering and computer science  
next to the cashmire brow of the clay.  
My heart is filled with pride like a marble stalks of cattail.  
Indicates the sphere's connecting lip.  
The acerb dignity of the productivity!  
How exciting is the irreducable torrent and it's serene bloodied graphites?  
A loop amid a triangle,  
the careless workings of serene law.  
Shall we move on?
