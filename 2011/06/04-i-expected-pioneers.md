I Expected Pioneers
-------------------
Sticky weather, lashed lights like the landscape.  
The thread responding from my brain.  
Not to travel or even meet  
the aroma of one who creates  
in  
the middle of me  
in an area or rejoicing to a custodian.  
We get the abstraction  
they must lots to seize  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but panics.  
Perhaps they are not fainted.
