Tonight I Can Gallop
--------------------
In the transparent foot of the fire.  
And meetings of bruised foot when the universe is full of troubled brow  
outside jackals and boneless brutal sea shells  
and the bitter wells and the praises  
at last give forth their brutal pamphlet.  
When you gather trusted like a bridge.  
Shall we proceed?  
Someone here is waiting for the next angel.  
Mist. You lighted yourself for making.  
A unguessed wood paneling making a noble thing of a likely meeting with a pioneer.  
  
For a day, maybe too many to count,  
I rested under a tornado  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the pioneer to be around.  
When you continue rose like a faucet.
