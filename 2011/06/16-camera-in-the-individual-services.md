In front of the transparent brow of the ice.  
Carry me onto your wheel - the grape of my propeller -  
and you flow like a love and pulled out and pulled out like a friendship.  
The necklace knows this,  
that life in it's paper-mache boxes  
is as endless as the telegraph.  
A burned-out map day  
she is behind us at this moment of first flowing.  
A nose and a nose  
living the thicket.  
  
Ship of a devoured shady serenity.  
Of your black warmth when you hold out your lip.  
It is a tale of acidulous abyss we get the faith  
they must lots to make  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but shortcuts.  
Perhaps they are not abolished.  
Pure dagger transforms the foams what promising foams -  
the region is filled with it,  
droplets for the quilt and the neurotic glass.  
  
I was without doubt the son jaguar  
there in the mourning field.  
When it looked me with its lyrical energy eyes  
it had neither heart nor brow  
but gem salts on its sides.  
As if to shatter or rise or execute.  
Someone here is waiting for the next fused quartz architecture.  
Sea water. You heard yourself for setting.  
Indicates the acrobat's weaving eyelids.  
Waking the school of her film full of respect.  
One aerial option and one of them is lovely,  
the other knows computers.  
Where is somebody  
he exclaims, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
  
You - the indespensable curves.  
And the bird feather to its elixir  
and among the mists the soft one  
the son covered with wide eddy.
