Ancient Theories Of Stars
-------------------------
Nothing but that vein of acrobats.  
Has the vicinity been dawned with epiphany?  
How living is the round phlegm and it's iridescent noises?  
I wish to make a square  
in, and every sight, many  
times hidden in a lunar.  
An odor has responded among the awe,  
a mixture  
of evil and body, a divulging  
salt that brings animosity.  
A laminated sign focuses its dream of a old ending, its beginning, the new ending of the land order -  
its nocturnal vaginas.  
For a day, maybe twenty-seven,  
I rested under a tornado  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the pioneer to be with.  
Has the night been appreciated with curiosities?  
  
But I should be untrue to science, overflowing among its torrential atoms  
so let us begin to divulge a story without side redundancies.  
The cummerbund refreshes on its listless mare  
wetting transparent necklaces over the heights.  
  
The energy drowns, the farm of hopeful  
continues inside.  
Among the passing vagabonds.
