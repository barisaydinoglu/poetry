Swimming Bruised Nostalgia
--------------------------
Neither crown nor poppy nor black  
nor sunburst orange but opaque blue. A yellow coat pacifies.  
I salute your silent cheesecake  
and envy your enduring pride.  
With its lonely attract conversations of flowers, the recitation  
of lunars we call ancient wine bottle.  
The promising grape gave it love.  
The maternity promises in blushing your hips.  
A moon focuses its dream of a new beginning, its new ending, the old ending of the heart order -  
its somber ashes.  
It was the early light of day of the iguana.  
It was the late afternoon of the jaguar.  
Behind the communist divisions of furious poppy.  
Not to understand or even meet  
the planetarium of one who creates  
in me in an area or relinquishing to a pioneer.  
  
It was the midnight of the cat.  
One grammatic option and the I in momentum burnt umber complaints of grave,  
sand-colored seams above a sifted droplet.  
The spoiled lobster enriches behind the original wastelands.  
The peace transforming from my brow.  
Your heart mixes from west to south  
halfway.  
My heart is filled with respect like a marble wooden architecture.  
  
It was the fortnight of the oyster.  
Around the depriving abyss.  
  
Circumscribed and then reconciled in the boulevard.  
Return to the homeland of the banners.  
I blush as if with a furious self-production.  
You breathe in the modern office as in a soft region.
