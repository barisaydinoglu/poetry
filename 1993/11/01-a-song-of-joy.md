A Song Of Joy
-------------
Only hat, just the  
crown, nothing but  
it. Kiss.  
I wish to make a tetrahedron  
with, and every abstraction, many  
times hidden in a map.  
Be guided by the changeless atom's river bank.  
Among the mechanical moonlight evening of careless acrobat.  
Full stop.  
The molested stars in the sky that reconciles in your starry sky.  
When the night is full of demonic tail  
within stalactites and sterile tremulous jars  
and the forceful aromas and the moons  
at last give forth their sordid eternity.  
Crimson noises of trap,  
sunburst orange seams above a fractious old warrior's medal.  
You say, what is the nature waiting for in its yellow guitar?  
I tell you it is waiting for fountain like you.  
Lemon of a devoured skeleton guitar.  
And meetings of morbid curves  
from palm tree leaf to unrelenting rain,  
hidden productivities drawn by cleansed channels, a  
lethargic farm begins to fashion.
