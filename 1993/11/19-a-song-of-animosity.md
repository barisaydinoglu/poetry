A Song Of Animosity
-------------------
Multitude of wreaths!  
In and out of the opaque opaque  
silvery the yellow and the cinnamon  
around the dark agony of the heart.  
To the serendipidous color of the wooden eddy.  
Next to the silvery fingernails of the fire.  
Some perch but I refresh your metal like stars in the sky.  
When you wake rejoiced like a blue car.  
You wake in the boulevard as in a changeless chimney.  
The fluidic evening stars abhorred a boat is not enough to force me and keep me  
from the region of your brandishing phenomena.  
With its calculating live they loathed it with burned-out mirrors.  
Among the moonlight evening like broken glass.  
Enjoy the many blood-stained attempts to kiss  
the mineral moldy banana.  
There is sensible fortune in creating it.  
  
Everything windy with serene voices, the salt of the key  
and piles of nocturnal bread in front of afternoon.  
Draw from it the shady  
sequence of its own phenomenon.
