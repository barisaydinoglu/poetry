The Ironous Error
-----------------
And elixirs and threads.  
What is this phenomenon but a memory dropped of its lights?  
If I could entertain the moth and the land.  
When the chimney is full of dead arm  
within legumes and clotting acidulous aromas  
and the careless dews and the foams  
at last give forth  
their dry vigil.  
Of fresh apple, spirit  
of the miracles,  
scratched one blood, your kisses  
conduct into exile  
and a droplet of marble, with remnants of the modern office.  
Pockets of graphite converted into gold.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
promise of sweetness and keys  
and the loving gardens of his native land?  
What wonderful necklaces -  
the region is filled with it,  
leaves for the salt and the inevitable gold.  
Neither window nor miracle nor dark  
nor deep brown but sunburst orange.  
Here I am, a sensible curves compounded in the land of forest.  
Our new rose, our manly perfume squares.  
  
Shut up and pulled out like a bottle.  
A grace -like cummerbund  
the reasons for my respect  
are returned in my curves of copper.  
The room amid hers  
a history we speak in passing,  
with notions of respect  
and a passion for photography and mountaineering seeking toward the circus you are the weak bride of a iguana,  
the bleak ness of the promise, the power of the electricity.
