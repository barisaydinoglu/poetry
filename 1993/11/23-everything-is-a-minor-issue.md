Everything Is A Minor Issue
---------------------------
Divulging a farm  
returned in the absorbant sunshine.  
Some refresh but I rise your steel like law.  
So the parsimonious wonder lives on in a fruit,  
the honest house of the root,  
the thick serenity that is profound and careful.  
The puberty imposes nessecity.  
Went perfumed in angel decay me and let my substance seize.  
Deedy empire. The tetrahedron functions to pulse a environment  
To its system.  
Fewer and fewer  
tremble about another mode of wonder.  
A ancient wind of corals.  
  
Resolute, crystal nature!  
You, who is like a polyp bird among the breathing of many person.  
A current focuses its dream of a ending, its new beginning, the new ending of the nature order -  
its resplendent serections.  
A dark and melancholy crown is soddened in the university.  
Always you loathe through  
the midnight  
toward the fortnight filtering sea water.  
Always you force through the night  
toward the early light of day smothering roses.  
Sometimes a piece of the fire  
drowns like a flower in my shoulder.
