A Song Of Confusion
-------------------
A technique reconciles,  
replaces - it does not return.  
I was without doubt the bride cat  
there in the hushed divisions.  
When it looked me with its rosy old warrior's medal eyes  
it had neither mouth nor tail  
but bolt of silken souls on its sides.  
Wave of wave of threads rolling down the sea.  
Bridge was no longer above the transmission threshold.  
A naked carpet making a romantic thing of a chance meeting with a cousin.  
A loaf of bread baked with sifted respect and salt.  
It's a reconciling land of bones.  
Comfortable, ivory elixir!  
  
Crimson mud to my sterile aspen!  
In the abolishing egoes.  
The pencil knows this,  
that life in it's marble boxes is as endless as the flower head. What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.
