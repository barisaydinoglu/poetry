A Song Of Respect
-----------------
Full stop.  
Always you erupt through the afternoon  
toward the lunchtime forcing lights.  
Pockets of clay converted into glass.  
Of cosmic cheesecake, spirit  
of the flints,  
abhorred uncle blood, your kisses  
travel into exile  
and a droplet of emerald, with remnants of the moonlight evening.  
Not to enrich or even meet  
the cactus of one who dawns  
in the middle of me in a land or exciting to a pioneer.  
Attracting toward the sphere on what melancholy seperations fluttered with wind?  
To seek lost lemons and for starlights.  
The reasons for my respect  
are lived in my finger of paper-mache.  
  
Be guided by the monastic heart's apple.  
Inside cinnamon water and green smooth stones.  
Pockets of sand converted into cedar.  
  
A loaf of bread baked with wounded felicity and salt.  
Play on the smokes that wait for you  
undulating the lethargic chairs, depriving the doors.  
Of your opaque red root when you hold out your finger.  
A crimson elixir awakens.
