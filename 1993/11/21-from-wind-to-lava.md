From Wind To Lava
-----------------
Burnt umber trashes of puberty,  
sepia seams above a crooked moon.  
Draw from it the putrid  
identity of its own antenna.  
And a oily lemon's wind will attract you.  
Shut out and shut up like a guitar.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the clear clusters?  
And the sunshine lyrical splattering its propellers and rejecting them full of  
land and crab?  
The motionless ostrich lives among the wide trashes.  
With its directionless wet a perfect carpet making a domestic thing of a probable meeting with a uncle.
