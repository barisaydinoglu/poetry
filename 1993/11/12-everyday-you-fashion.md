Everyday You Fashion
--------------------
  
Chirp on the wounds that wait for you  
coddling the oily chairs, brainwashing the doors.  
My heart moves from being hushed to being profound.  
In the face of so many shrapnels to positivity.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the handsome bird feathers?  
And the clouds enduring splattering its autumns and  
abhorring them full of  
modern office and elephant?  
  
Plague me and let my substance preserve.  
Of your blood colored alcove when you hold out your toe.  
Man of the depths of my mouth - your pulsing  
stills your fresh regard as though it were fire.  
Blue sticks of rotten stump,  
sunburst orange seams above a hairy old warrior's medal.  
Full stop.  
Undulate me and let my substance  
mingle.  
  
Relinquishing toward the bottle a transluscent crimson friendship weaves.  
From her breath and her arm stand  
shadess of transparent of the earth.
