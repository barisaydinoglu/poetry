Machine In The Aerial Services
------------------------------
Always you abhor through the night  
toward the morning forcing splendors.  
Yellow heat to my sifted evening star!  
The gentleman smiles at the giant  
but the elder does not smile  
when he looks at the elephant one  
and the wounded ocean.  
One public option and the chimney with hers  
a story we tell in passing,  
with notions of honor  
and a passion for photography and oceanography  
because I love you, love, next to the water and inside the lava.
