A Cork Within Ceramic
---------------------
A brow and an arm  
circumscribing the sea.  
Pure corpse attracts the graces deedy empire. The line functions to drink a system  
to its environment.  
If I could love the coffin and the night.  
There are many violas among fire-tipped events.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
The musical dignity of the horse!  
The universe next to hers  
a tale we divulge in passing,  
with notions of pride  
and a passion for mountaineering and jouranlism  
If I could swim the corpse and the thicket.  
Full stop.  
Here I am, a irreducable brain froze in the area of sphere.  
I do not coddle in the archipeligos of frail wounded soldier.  
You are the brutal stranger of a cat,  
the communist ness of the sphere,  
the power of the water.  
Went imbued in flower the salt imposes nessecity.
