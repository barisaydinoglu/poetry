The Calculation Has Not Deluded The Promise
-------------------------------------------
A airplane is not enough to wipe me and keep me  
from the modern office of your humble secrets.  
Against the harsh saphire architecture, many directionless torrents.  
A romantic rain of pullulations.  
It reflects like a banner among the flesh.
