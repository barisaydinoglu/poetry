Sense Is An Episode Of Enemy
----------------------------
Within the mist of the university where you sleep,  
a dream harasses into studies.  
Fewer and fewer  
sodden about another mode of felicity.  
You are the fatherless giant of a iguana,  
the clenched ness of the mist, the power of the lightning.  
Shall we set forth?  
Everything mourning with essential voices, the salt of the juice  
and piles of fluidic bread outside lunchtime.  
Our new flower, our somber juice quadrangles.  
Wave of wave of books rolling down the sea.  
Because I love you, love, in front of the sky and outside the wind.  
The tree entangles, the sun rise of fleeting  
wets outside.  
In the face of so many oblivions to functionality.  
Seized and then showered in the city.  
The order of the laws behind the drop of the region where you sleep,  
a dream conquers into metaphors.  
Enjoy the many clotting attempts to flutter  
the velvety funeral.  
There is soft fortune in continuing it.  
They are all cousins  
professional nails in whose verdure warmths originate.  
A chorus of jaguars at lunchtime un upgraded un cracked  
comes to a halt before a fragrance of strawberry.  
The peace swims in standing your mouth.  
Blue and lion hearted person,  
for bottle was bruised and morally neutral.
