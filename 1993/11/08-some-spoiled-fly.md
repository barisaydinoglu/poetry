Some Spoiled Fly
----------------
And you killed in the confusion and shone a gnawing shrapnel.  
From her hand and her nose enchant  
foliages of the earth.  
I am soddened by dew and eternity, by womb  
and clouds.  
In the face of so many bloody feathers to positivity.  
And meetings of guilt hand neither well nor snow nor blood colored  
nor marine but silvery.  
And meetings of communist finger but I should be true to engineering, smearing among its delirious veins  
so let us seek to tell a story without aerial redundancies.  
You pulse my bruised rectum  
like a honest squirrel to fresh peach.
