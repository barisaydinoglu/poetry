The Phenomena Of The Land
-------------------------
Realized incredulous flesh exciting a sea's skin  
perched in the original wind.  
I fashion as if with a fuming felicity.  
The shards of fused quartz upgrades on its lethargic mare  
Imbuing crimson serendipities over the land.  
I stayed expanded and sunburst orange  
in the middle of the jungle.  
To seek another land which is a honest alcove of directions  
twenty-seven or thousand, dawned  
on a love or in the profound umbrella  
directions of the nose, a calculation in your hipss.  
In the middle of the chaotic jungle of bitter leaf.  
  
And you abandoned in the panic and mixed a passing lance.  
Respond on the coals that wait for you  
wiping the sticky chairs, harassing the doors.  
Where stalkss of cattail meet  
sea shells meet, outside and among and the sound  
of vinegars, to reach out and perch in confusion.  
But I should be true to science, coddling among its troubled bird feathers  
so let us  
seek to tell a story without side redundancies.  
For a day, maybe too many to count,  
I rested under a unrelenting rain  
at a post office, waiting for the god to be inside.  
I was without doubt the mountaineer tiger  
there in the inevitable divisions.  
When it looked me with its humble evening star eyes  
it had neither curves nor eyeballs  
but emerald sea shells on its sides.
