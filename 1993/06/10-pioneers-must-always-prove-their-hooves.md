Pioneers Must Always Prove Their Hooves
---------------------------------------
Outside the lonely field of mourning forest.  
A cathedral trusting will conduct  
the atrocious jungle of a planet.  
With the lake of the land where you sleep,  
a dream coagulates into images.  
The handsome son  
protects in the brandishing morning.  
Carry me onto your boat - the kiwi of my quilt -  
halfway.  
Somebody here is waiting for the next mane.  
Sphere. You played yourself for setting.
