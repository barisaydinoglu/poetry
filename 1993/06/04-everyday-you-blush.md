Everyday You Blush
------------------
A blood colored and arrogant cathedral is mourned in the archipeligos.  
A eloquent rug making a pure thing of a probable meeting with a cousin.  
Realized natural ritual to the plumed color of the copper essence.  
In your brain of embarassement the land of souls rustle.  
Panic and juice - maternities of confusion.  
Your leg re-covers from east to west  
around the essence of the land where you sleep,  
a dream rejects into phenomena.
