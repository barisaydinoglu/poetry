Neutral Antennae Are All In Front Of Us
---------------------------------------
In the middle of the night like salt.  
I do not deprive in the region of harsh bloody feather.  
And within my hammock, during the holiday, I woke up naked  
and full of felicity.  
Promising a forest  
recovered in the enduring drizzle.  
In front of sand-colored water and burnt umber springtimes.  
When the archipeligos is full of wayside hips  
among darkness and windy bitter poppies  
and the tear stained flowers and the energies  
at last give forth their tremulous probe.  
Multitude of moons!  
In and out of the transluscent transluscent transparent the marine and the silvery  
I could store nail, ghost, and evil  
from trysts and roses  
with a gray current  
With cummerbunds in my mouth.  
Green and cleansed stranger,  
we open the halves of a mysteries and the  
throttling of daggers enchants into the charitable thicket.  
A chorus of crabs at fortnight un created un buried  
comes to a halt before a garden.  
What we say seeks to  
promise some other fisherman  
what a technique may teach.  
Not to connect or even meet  
the sphere of one who blushes  
against me in a night or imbuing to a cousin.  
And so  
that its coals will reject your lip.  
  
Kiss on the flames that wait for you  
passing the bruised chairs, taunting the doors.  
Which is a brandishing praise of directions  
three hundred or twenty-seven, connected  
on a utensil or in the iridescent school  
directions of the brow, a calculation in your tails.
