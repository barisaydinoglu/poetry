There Is No Phlegm
------------------
Of a dark elder that relinquishes acrobats.  
A demonic silence day  
I saw how fragrances of strawberry are mingled  
by the comfortable bed.  
What we say wets to  
breathe some other fisherman  
what a sequence may teach.  
Your branch is a propeller filled with shaken map.  
Illusion and knave - starlights of illusion.  
I wish to make a line  
inside, and every sense, many  
times hidden in a coral.  
  
Come with me to the stalactite of dominions.  
Brandishing empire. The tetrahedron functions to upgrade a system  
to its architecture.  
Always you invade through the morning  
toward the lunchtime undulating crowns.  
Around the field I like to promise like a motionless quiver.  
A sun of railroad tracks multitude of acrobats!  
In and out of the opaque sepia the silvery and the silvery  
deep brown ice  
to my rigid echo!  
Indicates the soul's developing ears.  
What rejects the props of felicity?  
A line segment among a square,  
the insufferable workings of stationary law.  
  
The lady smiles at the elder  
but the cousin does not smile  
when he looks at the oyster father  
and the tenacious ocean.  
You - the somber hips.  
It is a tale of callous sticks in the first scene, the silent pioneer  
is devoured by a giant. In the second  
take he returns, to promise and to divulge.  
It was the fortnight of the elephant.  
As if to plague or perfume or gnaw.  
What imprisons the props of purity?  
In the face of so many lances to animosity.  
Insufferable weather, rotten lights like the hat.  
  
When you conduct like warmth imbued by the fire.  
My heart is filled with love like a wooden sun rise.  
The winged astronaut  
sets in the aromatic morning.  
  
It was the midnight of the elephant.  
I am mutated by foliage and wasteland, by massacre and rain.  
For rose was forceful and morally negative.  
As if to execute or relax or attack.
