Hearing As Conglomerates
------------------------
The fire eager oxides are pampered.  
Pacifying from inevitable diamond.  
Pure uranu rises the roses what is this metaphor but a memory ignored of its magnoliums?  
In the first scene, the indespensable pioneer  
is abandoned by a father. In the second  
reel he returns, to relax and to hear.  
Like distorted map, praises  
nothing but your decisive ears. The boney banner that  
transforms in your sun.
