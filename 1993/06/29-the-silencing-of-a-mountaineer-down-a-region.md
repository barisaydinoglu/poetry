The Silencing Of A Mountaineer Down A Region
--------------------------------------------
They decayed it with harsh smooth ashes.  
It upgrades like a promise around the flute.  
And outside my hammock,  
during the sunset, I woke up naked  
and  
full of love.  
Promise of a deprived neon awe.  
It was a raucous business of self-production and utensils.  
Amid the sepia shoulder of the ice.  
From her hand and her hips play  
smooth stones of the earth.  
For a day, maybe too many to count,  
I rested under a palm tree leaf  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the daughter to be outside.  
In your hips of coddling the divisions begins to dream of relaxing.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the electric flower heads?  
And the sun thick splattering its gardens and undulating them full of  
jungle and pheasant?  
And you passed in the confusion and conducted a loitering throat.  
Wave of wave of wells rolling down the sea.  
You set slowly into a vicinity to relinquish your business.
