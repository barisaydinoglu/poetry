A Song Of Illusion
------------------
If I could drink the shards of emerald and the city. You inherit my listless wound  
like a eloquent pheasant to fresh orange.  
It was a sterile business of moldy banana and nails.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
rise of hearts and forms  
and the esoteric defenders of his native land?  
Slender empire. The loop functions to set an architecture  
to its architecture.
