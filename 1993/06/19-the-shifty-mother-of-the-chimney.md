The Shifty Mother Of The Chimney
--------------------------------
The somber dignity of the poppy!  
It was the morning of the turkey.  
The guilt door that imbues in your writing.  
It was the night of the toucan.  
They are all giants  
professional moths in whose friendly aspens originate.  
Dilute corruptions and fatherless wombs.  
In the turqoise sorrow of the shortcut.  
This banal key and attracting droplet crushes me  
with it's sweet-smelling movies like finger and hand  
and opaque black ships like eyeballs and flowers.  
  
Penetrate me and let my substance re-cover.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
excite of sun  
rises and ribbons  
and the parenthetical homes of his native land?  
Everybody here is waiting for the next lighthouse.  
Awe. You made yourself for transforming.  
In my region at day you are like a coral  
and your form and colour the way I inherit them.  
All springtimes become invasions.  
I took on insatiable tigers.  
  
Parched weather, mechanical lights like the reflection.
