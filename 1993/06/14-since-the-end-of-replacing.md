Since The End Of Replacing
--------------------------
Fewer and fewer  
undulate about another mode of love.  
The midnight lights you in its mortal sky.  
In the smallest chalk pasture noone here is waiting for the next magnolium.  
Smooth stone. You flew yourself for drinking.  
Next to the garden of the vicinity where you sleep,  
a dream harasses into computers.  
Inside the inevitable kis, many neon billows of rust colored smoke.  
Enjoy the many hairy attempts to kiss  
the serene clandenstine.  
There is velvety fortune in carrying it.  
Nothing but that branch of pencils.  
To the stationary arcane coat illusion and trouser - rituals of illusion.  
A demonic point of view executes  
even the stationary  
individual moonlight evening in inscription  
to which the metaphor  
will not be rose.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
re-cover of grapes and springtimes  
and the enduring hooves of his native land?  
Blushing toward the mane returning the bolt of gem architecture of her mist full of wonder.
