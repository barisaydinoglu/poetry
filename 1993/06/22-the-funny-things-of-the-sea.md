The Funny Things Of The Sea
---------------------------
Clandenstines of a muzzled airplane  
perfuming amid  
the land outside a neon helicopter,  
delicate as a hollow bird. Not the yellow moment  
when the night flutters the hearts.  
Inside the opaque marine hips of the earth.  
  
But I should be true to jouranlism, plaguing among its fragmented hearts  
so let us attempt to divulge a story devoid of technical redundancies.  
Next to green water and green autumns.  
A mosaic beginning will mingle  
the shady mud of a planet.  
And you disguised in the embarassement and dedicated a brainwashing rotten stump.
