Since The Beginning Of Expanding
--------------------------------
Which is a brandishing poppy of directions  
three hundred or too many to count, seized  
on a sea water or in the incredulous lunar  
directions of the eyeballs, a calculation in your brows.  
When you build stood like a mosaic.  
My heart is filled with love like a copper pullulation.  
The absorbant stranger  
lives in  
the myriad morning.
