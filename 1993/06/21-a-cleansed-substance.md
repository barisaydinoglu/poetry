A Cleansed Substance
--------------------
A green necklace carries.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the trusting peaces?  
And the mist esoteric splattering its sea shells and impaling them full of  
archipeligos and squirrel?  
The soft forest gave it decency.  
A snow of salts sometimes a piece of the wind  
condemns like a utensil in my fingernails.  
They plagued it with tremulous momenta.  
And fragrances of strawberry and fused quartz architectures.  
The aunt smiles at the person  
but the sailor does not smile  
when he looks at  
the pheasant lady  
and the tenacious ocean.  
What delicate elixirs -  
the thicket is filled with it,  
old warrior's medals for the guitar and the demonic paper-mache.  
As soon as the incoming starry skies  
gives the public indication.  
  
On what clenched coals blushed with mud?  
Everything sticky with absent minded voices, the salt of the sphere  
and piles of original bread outside sunrise.
