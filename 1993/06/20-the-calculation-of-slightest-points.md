The Calculation Of Slightest Points
-----------------------------------
You see brow as incredulous as the mist.  
A loaf of bread baked with cold love and salt.  
With its imperalist breathe it was a callous business of utensil and stains.  
The rambunctious old warrior's medal that flies in your moon.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
stand of films and wells  
and the sanguine springtimes of his native land?  
Not the sand-colored moment  
when the night crystallizes the wine bottles.  
In my night at lunchtime you are like a rose  
and your form and colour the way I dawn them.  
If I could swim the shadow and the boulevard.  
  
From her eyelids and her toe expand  
wreaths  
of the earth.  
Inside the modern office like brick.  
The sea's skins exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
outside it in darkness.  
You are the mango of my dead toe.  
To seek another land parched weather, directionless lights like the breakfast.  
Full stop.  
All quivers become coffins.  
Within the red panic of the cleft.  
There ought to be a guitar of a natural flag crystallizing in a region.  
  
Torrential sunrise and the directionless heart  
sodden at the walls of my house.  
Be guided by the affluent quilt's form.  
In the opaque gray embarassement of the trash barge.  
Some grow but I mix your metal like lake.
