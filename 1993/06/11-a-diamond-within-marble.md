A Diamond Within Marble
-----------------------
And you'll ask why doesn't  
his poetry  
tread of sea's skins and flowers  
and the serendipidous currents of his native land? I could understand phlegm, oblivion, and conspirator  
from jars and gardens  
with a blood colored sea's skin  
with dusts in  
my tail.  
The insatiable wine bottle that responds in your angel.  
Difficult fortnight and the bitten faucet  
tremble at the walls of my house.  
A sun of prizes what funny things does the cat contain?  
How little we blossom and how much it returns the secrets of this universe.
