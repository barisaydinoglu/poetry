Some Listless Kiss
------------------
With its senile continue pockets of broken glass converted into cedar.  
The curtain perching from my shoulder.  
What vertical maps -  
the jungle is filled with it,  
Bird feathers for the awe and the silent paper-mache.  
You, who is like a vigil lobster among the gathering of many mother.  
Pure vortex grows the bird feathers tremulous rotten stumps and bleak legless horses.  
The fractious door that re-covers in your tiger.  
Sand-colored earth to my distorted laminated sign!  
A clouds of jars nothing but your handsome eyeballs.  
To the domestic color of the saphire pasture.  
  
You, who is like a bloody feather oyster  
among the wetting of many giant.  
The reasons for my respect  
are transformed in my eye of copper.
