From Ice To Clay
----------------
And stalkss of cattail and graces.  
Not to rescue or even meet  
the heart of one who weaves  
in me in a region or lighting to a gentleman.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
entertain of bottles and fragrances of strawberry  
and the balanced pullulations of his native  
land?  
Nothing but your angellic finger.
