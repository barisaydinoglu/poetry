Individual Cameras Are All Within Us
------------------------------------
The homogeneous sailor  
awakens in the profound morning.  
Tree of a taunted directionless heart.  
You live in the room as in an affluent heights.  
Nothing but that foliage of productivities.  
You live in the moonlight evening as in a mineral moonlight evening.  
Draw from it the silent  
production of its own detail.
