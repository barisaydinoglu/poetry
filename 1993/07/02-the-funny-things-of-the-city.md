The Funny Things Of The City
----------------------------
Pockets of clay converted into diamond. Demonic late afternoon and the distorted jar  
gnaw at the walls of my house.  
Went relinquished in curtain you are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the iridescent mists?  
And the clouds eloquent splattering its goblets and brainwashing them full of  
universe and jaguar?  
I am protested by muscle and stain, by heart and mist.  
You - the sweet-smelling hand.
