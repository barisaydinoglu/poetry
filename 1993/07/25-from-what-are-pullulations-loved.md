From What Are Pullulations Loved
--------------------------------
A sweetnes -like panic  
nobody here is waiting for the next curtain.  
Star. You dawned yourself for kissing.  
The land next to hers  
a story we divulge in passing,  
with notions of love  
and a passion for mountaineering and science  
a writing focuses its dream of a new ending, its ending, the old ending of the acrobat order -  
its iridescent beasts.  
When the universe is full of worn-out ears  
behind jackals and guilt thirsty trysts  
and the hushed hats and the wreaths  
at last give forth their bitter trash.  
Wave of wave of planetariums rolling down the sea.  
Enjoy the many oily attempts to connect  
the verdure moldy banana.  
There is lyrical fortune in returning it.  
  
Neither angel nor energy nor rust colored  
nor burnt umber but yellow.  
I'm the giant to the knave of immediate foliage.  
Protecting the aspen of her promise full of tiredness.  
There are many ghosts in front of blood-stained events.  
A loop inside a line segment,  
the raucous workings of delicate law.  
Draw from it the frightened  
computer of its own production.  
And the writing to its mane  
and among the keys the arcane one  
the one covered with electric curtain.
