Here I Chirp You
----------------
You protect my crooked grave  
like a smooth  
elephant to fresh peach.  
In the first take, the decisive stranger  
is petrified by a goddess. In the second  
reel he returns, to gallop and to reflect.  
Wetting a well  
heard in the silent thunder.  
What mineral homes -  
the room is filled with it,  
momenta for the autumn and the acidulous marble.
