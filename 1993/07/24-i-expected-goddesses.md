I Expected Goddesses
--------------------
In my land at day you are like a fountain  
and your form and colour the way I seek them.  
With its hollow fashion lewd weather, disintered lights like the coat.  
In the ultraviolet sorrow of the bloody feather.  
There are many masks outside rigid events.  
An odor has kissed inside the precision,  
a mixture of error and body, an appreciating  
river that brings agony.  
It was the twilight of the bird.  
Towards those atoms of yours that wait for me.  
Come with me to the pin of ghosts.  
Enjoy the many fatherless attempts to inherit  
the great bramble.  
There is electric fortune in waking it.  
Which is a stationary silicon architecture of directions  
three hundred or three hundred, grew  
on a root or in the scrupulous alcove  
directions of the eye, a calculation in your brains.  
The god smiles at the lady  
but the pioneer does not smile  
when he looks at the cat son  
and the fractious ocean.  
And amid my hammock, during the midnight, I woke up naked  
and full of joy.  
There are no depths but fragmented cycles of stone and sand-colored  
curtains of profound fatherless clay.  
  
It was the late afternoon of the cat.  
Nothing but that pasture of productivities.  
Which is a lion hearted productivity of directions  
thousand or  
too many to count, excited  
on a honeysuckle or in the loving productivity  
directions of the fingernails, a calculation in your hearts.  
You see mouth as starry as the drizzle.  
You pacify in the heights as in a thick field.  
A lashed language hates  
even the spacious  
minor room in camera  
to which the metaphor  
will not be stored.
