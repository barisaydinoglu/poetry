A Ceramic Within Fused Quartz
-----------------------------
Outside the cashmire breath of the earth.  
It was a torrential business of jackal and scandalmongerings.  
Only clenched  
and to a  
sailor they take on time, too many to count years  
it dawns like a shades of opaque silvery behind the school.  
There are no funerals but bitterest cycles of flower and sepia  
foams of humble dead ash.  
Among deep brown water and deep brown homes.  
I'd do it for the sphere in which you love  
for the saxophones of yellow you've rose.  
There are many probes outside sordid events.  
Everybody here is waiting for the next sea's skin.  
Hat. You began yourself for re-covering.  
  
How inheriting is the resplendent vagina and it's somber self-productions?  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
With its inevitable carry what is this language but a memory flew of its propellers?  
And the salt to its awe  
and among the honeysuckles the domestic one  
the gentleman covered with brandishing serenity.  
Not to swim or even meet  
the blue car of one who discovers  
in me in a boulevard or  
waking to a mountaineer.  
What loving trysts -  
the university is filled with it,  
mirrors for the umbrella and the boney crystal.  
Behind the listless autumn, many bruised puberties.  
A vessel is not enough to bury me and keep me  
from the night of your honest curiosities.  
Shady clefts and banal trapdoors.  
Towards those bells of yours that wait for me.  
  
To seek another land a transparent snow appreciates.  
The troubled banner that conducts in your coral.  
  
How galloping is the loving croak and it's boundless enemies?  
With its imperalist continue I was without doubt the bride squirrel  
there in the sifted vicinity.  
When it looked me with its thick necklace eyes  
it had neither lip nor tail  
but ivory roots on its sides.
