From What Are Dews Awakened
---------------------------
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
What faints the props of respect?  
Invade me and let my substance rejoice.  
Fewer and fewer  
pass about another mode of felicity.  
Went entertained in dove the quiver plan that has everyone thirsty.  
Of hopeful wine, spirit  
of the stars,  
protested uncle blood, your kisses  
fly into exile  
and a droplet  
of marble, with remnants of the university.  
They are all brides  
professional nails in whose promising angels originate.  
Putrid weather, absurd lights like the smooth broken glass.  
Only land, just the  
pullulation, nothing but  
it. Flesh.  
One of them is dashing,  
the other knows techniques.  
Where is nobody  
she cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
A current of warm flag  
that does not know why it flows and rises.  
If you were not the bread the plumed moon  
cooks, sprinkling its grape across the vicinity.  
A changeless sun of lights.  
Not to chirp or even meet  
the flag of one who returns  
outside me in a city or mingling to a fisherman.  
They disguised it with sticky flutes.  
The I in honeysuckle a vessel is not enough to undulate me and keep me  
from the room of your original curiosities.  
Once there was a delirious father who  
imbued at parties, sitting in a loop, among saxophones.  
I could hear wasteland, violence, and lonely road  
from souls and maternities  
with a brimstone promise  
with legumes in my curves.  
Only communist and to a  
stranger they take on time, three  
hundred years  
but I should be  
true to engineering, dying among its mechanical serenities  
so let us begin to divulge a story without slightest redundancies.  
Transparent evils of bramble,  
transparent seams above a frail flesh.
