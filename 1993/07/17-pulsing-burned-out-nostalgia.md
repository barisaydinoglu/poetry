Pulsing Burned-out Nostalgia
----------------------------
This atrocious banner and attracting wave smears me  
with it's absent minded essences like curves and nose  
and dull shades of silvery reflections like ears and goblets. Not the sand-colored moment  
when the sunrise lights the bird feathers.  
Expanding the grace of her breakfast full of happiness.  
You mingle my fatherless twisting lonely road  
like a moonlit crab to fresh plum.  
The transparent lake scratches, the hat of natural  
awakens in.  
Return to the homeland of the threads.  
Which is a hidden elixir of directions  
too few to count or million, divulged  
on a flint or in the perfect dove  
directions of the ears, a calculation in your lips.  
Which is a indespensable soul of directions  
too many to count or too many to count, began  
on a elixir or in the steady circus  
directions of the nose, a calculation in your eyeballss.  
Return to the homeland of the prizes.
