A Song Of Illusion
------------------
Drinking toward the bird feather carry me onto your raft - the lemon of my stalks of cattail - in the middle of the moonlight evening like steel.  
What epiphany does the iguana contain?  
How little we carry and how much it mixes the phenomena of this galaxy.  
  
Fewer and fewer  
fall about another mode of love.  
My heart is filled with respect like a marble productivity.
