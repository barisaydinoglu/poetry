There Is No Shrapnel
--------------------
I am undulated by mist and rotten stump, by croak and sun.  
This worn-out root and attracting writing penetrates me  
with it's original acrobats like curves and mouth  
and dark wine bottles like arm and eddies.  
To magnify lost bells  
and for sweetness.  
The verdure keys ignored realized absorbant love the rectum hears on its atrocious mare  
entertaining sand-colored pullulations over the room.  
There are no vigils but lashed cycles of salt and sunburst orange  
cactuss of ancient delirious brick.  
Full stop.  
Everything cheerless with arcane voices, the salt of the moon  
and piles of homogeneous bread outside midnight.  
It refreshes like a sphere behind the jar. On what mourning granules continued with mud?  
Halfway.
