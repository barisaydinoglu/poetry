Mountaineers Must Always Prove Their River Banks
------------------------------------------------
I could promise corruption, bomb, and bloody feather  
from roses and jars  
with a dark apple  
with pigeon holes in my tail.  
Went seized in precision sifted night and the windy shades of burnt umber  
fall at the walls of my house.  
Indicates the shoreline  
's blossoming lip.  
A synonym for technique is the lack thereof.  
Halfway.  
What sensible lemons -  
the room is filled with it,  
sea water for the candle and the ironous silicon.  
What is this projection but a memory coagulated of its aromas?  
This calcerous phemonana and upgrading tiger gnaws me  
with it's careful awes like hips and mouth  
and dark autumns like mouth and bells. This fragmented bird feather and perching stars in the sky abandons me  
with it's loving tigers like fingernails and foot  
and black springtimes like fingernails and elixirs.
