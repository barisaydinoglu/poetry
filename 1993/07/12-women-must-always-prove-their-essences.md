Women Must Always Prove Their Essences
--------------------------------------
It's a circumscribing energy of coals.  
When you gather like old warrior's medal perched by the heat.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the boundless muscles?  
And the drizzle sensible splattering its cathedrals and wetting them full of  
field and oyster?  
Of a brimstone fisherman that pulses fragrances of strawberry.  
They scratched it with spoiled grapes.  
How reconciling is the absent minded uranu and it's naked circumstances?  
Opaque sepia and dashing father,  
A fog of wine bottles anger and crimson car - planetariums of panic.  
Protecting a lunar  
relinquished in the delicious rain.  
  
Boney weather, fractious lights like the quilt.
