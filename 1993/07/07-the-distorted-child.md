The Distorted Child
-------------------
Cheerless twilight and the bleak silence  
deform at the walls of my house.  
A point of view for detail is the lack thereof.  
Enjoy the many sterile attempts to discover  
the ancient circumstance.  
There is aquatic fortune in hearing it.  
Come with me to the death of alarms.  
And shorelines and writings.  
You've asked me what the cat is divulging there with his cashmire eyeballs?  
I reply, the droplet knows this.  
A current of blazing awe  
that does not know why it flows and transforms.  
The sphere relaxes in crystallizing your brain.  
It was a bleak business of puberty and nails.  
Come with me to the dagger of moths.  
With its sifted rise confusion and flint - planetariums of agony.
