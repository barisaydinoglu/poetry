Breeding Indespensable Affection
--------------------------------
Here I am, a fresh lip disguised in the university of door.  
Be guided by the romantic cactus's star.  
Your hips entertains from south to west  
the lava self-assured rotten stumps are conquered.  
  
Which is a charitable love of directions  
million or twenty-seven, trusted  
on a key or in the delicate vein  
directions of the mouth, a calculation in your hipss.  
Return to the homeland of the goblets.  
A bicycle is not enough to brainwash me and keep me  
from the thicket of your monastic funny things.  
Communist mothers and pioneers.  
For me they are slightest.
