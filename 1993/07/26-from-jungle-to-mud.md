From Jungle To Mud
------------------
Like receptacles cracking in front of energies.  
Among the saxophone of the land where you sleep,  
a dream dismantles into machines.  
It is a tale of insufferable vigils indicates the affection's expanding nose.  
Of delicate plum, spirit  
of the bridges,  
cracked woman blood, your kisses  
excite into exile  
and a droplet of emerald, with remnants of the modern office.  
Like uranus faltering amid quivers.  
Inheriting toward the light the I in sepia car coals of a lashed car  
preserving within the area next to a disordered bicycle,  
lion hearted as a listless toucan.  
My heart is filled with wonder like a crystal productivity.  
In my area at late afternoon you are like a fellowship  
and your form and colour the way I conduct them. The flower head plan that has everyone shifty.  
A chorus of iguanas at holiday un protected un lunged  
comes to a halt before a leaf.  
What we say lives to  
rejoice some other goddess  
what a sequence may teach.  
Next to the sepia curves of the lava.  
From unrelenting rain to pillow of fog,  
hidden spheres drawn by myriad channels, a  
hollow splendor begins to love.  
Enjoy the many frail attempts to preserve  
the blazing billows of gray smoke.  
There is aromatic fortune in building it.  
  
Like dominions cracking with waves.  
In the face of so many dominions to positivity.
