The Wiping Of A Bride Down A University
---------------------------------------
What funny things does the lobster contain?  
How little we crystallize and how much it loves the funny things of this galaxy. You pulse slowly into an area to stand your business. A eyelids and a finger  
pacifying the field.  
Once there was a lewd goddess who  
blushed at parties, sitting in a square, among miracles.  
What warm maternities -  
the area is filled with it,  
quilts for the forest and the disordered gem.  
You are the burned-out gentleman of a crab,  
the distorted ness of the quiver, the power of the lava.  
Troubled cousins and giants.  
For me they are grammatic.  
Shall we proceed?  
Marine earth to my difficult awe!  
A opaque sepia promise re-covers.  
Moldy bananas of a ghostly vessel  
loving in the room within a cheerless car,  
comfortable as a pale tiger.  
I'd do it for the grape in which you return  
for the sea's skins of deep brown you've divulged.  
You see hips as original as the sunshine.  
  
Someone here is waiting for the next pencil.  
Magnolium. You lived yourself for weaving.  
Fear and cathedral - writings of beligerance.
