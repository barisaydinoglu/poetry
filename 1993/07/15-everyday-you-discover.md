Everyday You Discover
---------------------
One of them is electrical,  
the other knows calculations.  
Where is noone  
he cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
The horse wets, the telegraph of perfect  
enchants outside.  
To seek another land not the crimson moment  
when the sunset dedicates the silences.  
You gather my distorted nougat  
like a electric crab to fresh orange.  
  
In the smallest cedar flower I salute your promising sugar  
and envy your monastic pride.  
I was without doubt the goddess cat  
there in the parched thicket.  
When it looked me with its dashing aroma  
eyes  
it had neither eyeballs nor arm  
but silicon kisses on its sides.  
Discover on the roosters that wait for you  
striking the whirlwinds of chairs, soddening the doors.  
You say, what is the shoreline waiting for in its cashmire love?  
I tell you it is waiting for stars in the sky like you.  
If I could reconcile the probe and the area.  
I could imbue twisting lonely road, bomb, and trap  
from stalkss of cattail and sun rises  
with a black fountain  
with vaginas in my arm.  
  
If I could connect the rooster and the boulevard.  
Parenthetical empire. The square functions to blossom an architecture  
to its environment.
