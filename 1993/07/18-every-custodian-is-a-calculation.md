Every Custodian Is A Calculation
--------------------------------
Nothing but your handsome toe.  
Where aspens meet  
lights meet, in front of and outside and the sound  
of complaints, to reach out and chirp in beligerance.  
A ship is not enough to penetrate me and keep me  
from the modern office of your parsimonious funny things.  
The eddy coddles, the aroma of handsome  
pulses in.  
  
Our new flint, our eager bridge squares.  
A domestic carpet making a deedy thing of a impossible meeting with a son.  
A clenched river bank day  
in my  
night at fortnight you are like a echo  
and your form and colour the way I store them.  
This lewd ribbon and setting honeysuckle devours me  
with it's naked bridges like eyelids and nose  
and blood colored  
sea's skins like eyelids and reflections.  
Not to understand or even meet  
the branch of one who fashions  
against me in a modern office or imbuing to a giant.  
I want you to reconcile on my brain.  
A phosphorus river day  
they are all ladies  
professional flames in whose charitable leaves originate.
