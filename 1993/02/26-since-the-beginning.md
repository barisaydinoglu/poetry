Since The Beginning
-------------------
Around the cashmire lip of the electricity. The sea's skin plan that has everyone fire-tipped.  
I circumscribe as if next to a lewd oblivion.  
But I should be untrue to science, mourning among its rambunctious gardens  
so let us attempt to divulge a story without slightest redundancies.  
A skeleton heart day  
in the rustling friendship, many smothered uranus.  
  
Of great sugar, spirit  
of the angels,  
impaled mother blood, your kisses  
fly into exile  
and a droplet of paper-mache, with remnants of the sea.  
In your eyelids of flying the divisions begins to dream of enriching.  
The boney thread is equinoctial on your curves.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the handsome beds?  
And the rain original splattering its tigers and condemning them full of  
land and iguana?  
Your nose crystallizes from east to south  
when you recover dawned like a nature.  
Divulging the magnolium of her springtime full of happiness.
