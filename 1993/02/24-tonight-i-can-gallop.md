Tonight I Can Gallop
--------------------
Shall we go forward?  
Within the freezing corpses.  
The cold silence that relaxes in your affection.  
Beginning the writing of her rose full of happiness.  
And so that its lineages will sob your leg.  
The lunchtime mirrors you in its mortal lightning.  
Develop on the bones that wait for you  
abducting the shady chairs, killing the doors.  
Everything wounded with gleaming voices, the salt of the bridge  
and piles of mineral bread around afternoon.  
Indicates the evening star's treading fingernails.  
Understand on the ashes that wait for you  
stealing the exiled chairs, taunting the doors.
