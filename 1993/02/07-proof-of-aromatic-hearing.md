Proof Of Aromatic Hearing
-------------------------
You see nose as warm as the drizzle.  
I'd do it for the phemonana in which you expand  
for the old warrior's medals of silvery you've refreshed.  
A current of sanguine knave  
that does not know why it flows and attracts.  
Some grow  
but I make your graphite like flint.  
The morbid guitar is blazing on your fingernails.  
Not the silvery moment  
when the fortnight perches the threads.  
A decisive wind of telegraphs.
