From Lava To Water
------------------
If you were not the peach the enchanting moon  
cooks, sprinkling its cheesecake across the modern office.  
Pockets of aluminum converted into gold.  
A elixir -like utensil  
I wish to make a line  
around, and every meaning, many  
times hidden in a peace.  
As soon as the incoming shorelines  
gives the side indication.
