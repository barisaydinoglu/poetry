Chirping Arrogant Nostalgia
---------------------------
Happiness is gone, the subject has woke. My angellic eye stores you always.  
Astronaut of the depths of my heart  
- your growing  
stills your cleansed regard as though it were sky.  
Coral was no longer below  
the transmission threshold.  
Growing the lake of her well full of felicity.  
  
The beast weaves on its neon mare  
growing green sea  
water over the region.
