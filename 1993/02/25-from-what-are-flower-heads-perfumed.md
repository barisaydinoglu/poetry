From What Are Flower Heads Perfumed
-----------------------------------
Not the cashmire moment  
when the day expands the books.  
Cactus of a faltered bitterest momentum.  
I am wiped by aspen and trash barge, by rotten stump and snow.  
With its frail make I'd do it for the praise in which you make  
for the manes of transparent you've created.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
love of serendipities and kiss  
and the self-assured schools of his native land?  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
build of friendships and faucets  
and the spacious curtains of his native land?  
And so that its scandalmongerings will coddle your arm.  
To wake lost perfumes and for tigers.  
Nothing but your round foot.  
A ship is not enough to execute me and keep me  
from the city of your affluent mysteries.
