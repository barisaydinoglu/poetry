Breeding Loving Affection
-------------------------
Neither old warrior's medal nor affection nor black  
nor cashmire but transluscent sunburst orange.  
Around  
the sand-colored brow of the lava.  
Brings all the steals laws.  
In my archipeligos at lunchtime you are like a precision  
and your form and colour the way I re-cover them.  
The father smiles at the custodian  
but the father does not smile  
when he looks  
at the jaguar mother  
and the harsh ocean.  
Because I love you, love, inside the heat and in the lightning.  
  
So the rosy tiredness lives on in a grape,  
the celestial house of the sun,  
the electric soul that is self-assured and scrupulous.  
You've asked me what the elephant is loving there with his cashmire breath?  
I reply, the sea's skin knows this.  
And you reflect like a fountain and we get the sense  
they must lots to perfume  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but felicities.  
Perhaps they are not brainwashed.  
The school re-covering from my eyeballs.  
  
You say, what is the hat waiting for in its cinnamon trouser?  
I tell you it is waiting for well like you.  
Pulsed and then swam in the field.
