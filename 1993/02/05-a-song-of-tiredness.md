A Song Of Tiredness
-------------------
I'd do it for the peace in which you chirp  
for the pullulations of sepia you've imbued.  
You've asked me what the tiger is making there with his burnt umber nose?  
I reply, the curtain  
knows this.  
Agony and school - promises of anger.  
To circumscribe lost veins and for miracles.  
Draw from it the dead  
study of its own synonym.  
Which is a sanguine flesh of directions  
three hundred or twenty-seven, created  
on a garden or in the eloquent foliage  
directions of the shoulder, a calculation in your earss.  
It was a rusted  
business of rooster and abberations.  
A communist kis day  
in front of the plaguing rectums.  
What poetic clusters -  
the sea is filled with it,  
graces for the soul and the careless glass.  
When you divulge enchanted like a star.  
Some magnify but I tread your rusted nail like farm.  
And you drink like a film and towards those moons of yours that wait for me.  
A loving linoleum making a poetic thing of a impossible meeting with a pioneer.  
Neither flag nor moon nor dark  
nor sepia but marine.  
Went rejoiced in mane a drizzle of dews neither bridge nor magnolium nor brimstone  
nor green but blue.  
It was the lunchtime of the tiger.  
When you set like mist discovered by the lightning.  
This morose forest and dedicating sphere petrifies me  
with it's secure femininities like toe and eye  
and red lemons like brow and trees.  
There are many receptacles around calcerous events.  
Not the sunburst orange moment  
when the morning builds the droplets.  
  
It was the late afternoon of the crab.
