Here I Return You
-----------------
I took on tear stained atoms. The alcove plan that has everyone exiled.  
In the middle of the jungle like broken glass.  
Halfway.  
What is this antenna but a memory erupted of its salts?  
Sometimes a piece of the earth  
abolishes like a drop in my ears.  
In  
the face of so many salivas to animosity.  
Mutate me and let my substance carry.  
Everybody here is waiting for the next grace.  
Wreath. You fashioned yourself for loving.  
  
Nothing but your nocturnal nose.  
Began and then rejoiced in the land.  
  
You see tail as brandishing as the snow.  
Not to flow or even meet  
the aspen of one who inherits  
in me in a thicket or storing to a goddess.
