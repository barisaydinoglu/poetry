What Is True Of The Awe Is True Of Everything
---------------------------------------------
We open the halves of a curiosities and the  
dropping of serections recovers into the affluent night.  
Went preserved in planetarium for necklace was bruised and morally positive.  
This barbaous book and living quilt faints me  
with it's mineral silvery cars like heart and finger  
and brimstone doves like fingernails and waves.  
And inside my hammock, during the twilight, I woke up naked  
and full of pride.  
You rescue headlong into a night to rejoice your business.  
A rain of necklaces the morose starlight that recovers in your moon.  
Distorted brambles and lewd extinctions.  
If I could blush the polyp and the thicket.  
  
A nature kissing will carry  
the atrocious jungle of a planet.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
Our new praise, our handsome movie quadrangles.  
Has the land been played with epiphany?
