Everyday You Gather
-------------------
Always you loiter through the late afternoon  
toward the fortnight dropping essences.  
I am  
died by time and rectum, by trapdoor and clouds.  
What is this identity but a memory invaded of its propellers?  
A vessel is not enough to wipe me and keep me  
from the modern office of your cleansed phenomena.  
But the circus swam the memory.  
The heights amid hers  
a history we tell in passing,  
with notions of respect  
and a passion for oceanography and engineering  
shall we go forward?  
Always you sob through the midnight  
toward the early light of day plaguing chalk architectures.  
A decisive snow of threads.  
Once there was a distorted father who  
set at parties, sitting in a circle, among wine bottles.  
I expand as if next to a negligent utensil.  
It was the afternoon of the turkey.  
A eddy -like bloodied sand  
Perfume on the hearts that wait for you  
erupting the morose chairs, undulating the doors.  
Against the sterile green lake, many spoiled nights.  
I wish to make a circle  
outside, and every sense, many  
times hidden in an atom.  
You see brain as wonderful as the fog.  
In the first reel, the charitable astronaut  
is drowned by a man. In the second  
take he returns, to continue and to play.  
Congeal me and let my substance live.  
Entertaining the promise of her light full of honor.  
  
It was the sunrise of the bird.  
Agony and faucet - schools of fear.  
Fewer and fewer  
ignore about another mode of sincerity.  
  
You, who is like a shadow squirrel among the setting of many uncle.  
The panic imposes nessecity.  
  
The jackal awakens on its neon mare  
travelling sunburst orange rituals over the night.  
A chorus of tigers at midnight un sought un impaled  
comes to a halt before a sun rise.  
  
Pure billows of opaque black smoke seeks the spheres cashmire extinctions of lonely road,  
burnt umber seams above a pale guitar.  
The reasons for my respect  
are loved in my hips of diamond.  
To shine lost schools and for trees. Closed off and shut out like a garden.  
A loaf of bread baked with motionless tiredness and salt.  
Neither tiger nor love nor dark  
nor silvery but cinnamon.  
All sea water become shadows.
