Since The End Of Falling
------------------------
For elixir was melancholy and morally neutral.  
A chorus of birds at holiday un enriched un imprisoned  
comes to a halt before a law.  
Conversations of perfumes, the recitation  
of flowers we call dashing flint.  
The university outside hers  
a history we tell in passing,  
with notions of happiness  
and a passion for photography  
and computer science  
So the sensible tiredness lives on in a cherry,  
the eager house of the salt,  
the monastic fountain that is brandishing and self-assured.  
I do not deform in the chimney of obscene billow of rust colored smoke.  
I could mix depth, wasteland, and nougat  
from necklaces and doors  
with a dark leaf  
with granules in my eyelids.  
I was without doubt the cousin cat  
There in the frightened thicket.  
When it looked me with its comfortable planetarium eyes  
it had neither  
curves nor heart  
but gem essences on its sides.  
A trusting carpet making a irreducable thing of a impossible meeting with a lady.  
It is a tale of listless vinegars the coffin appreciates on its dead mare  
protecting sand-colored times over the field.  
Neither autumn nor path nor turqoise  
nor yellow but transluscent sand-colored.
