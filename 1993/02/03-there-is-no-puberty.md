There Is No Puberty

And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
breathe of pastures and bird feathers  
and the human clusters of his native land? Multitude of essences!  
In and out of the burnt umber the deep brown and the deep brown  
a sunshine of spheres around the sunburst orange hips of the heat.  
Draw from it the furious  
image of its own synonym.
