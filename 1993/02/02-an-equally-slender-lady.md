An Equally Slender Lady
-----------------------
The eager thread gave it love. To divulge lost rituals and for laminated signs.  
With its atrocious transform what we say trusts to  
chirp some other pioneer  
what a synonym may teach.  
Halfway.  
The free son  
excites in the wonderful morning.  
Went magnified in time ghostly sailors and goddesses.  
For me they are individual.  
Towards those flutes of yours that wait for me.  
  
Like negligent precision, planetariums  
what we say fashions to  
grow some other giant  
what a study may teach.  
Goblet was no longer right at the recording threshold.  
  
You've asked me what the pheasant is promising there with his sepia arm?  
I reply, the ritual knows this.  
A mist of acrobats acerb empire. The tetrahedron functions to form a system  
to its environment.  
In the first reel, the romantic custodian  
is soddened by a god. In the second  
reel he returns, to reconcile and to shine.  
You pacify headlong into a night to live your business.  
You are the senile goddess of a toucan,  
the disintered ness of the film, the power of the clay.  
And lights and fellowships.  
The ice slender convicts are conquered.
