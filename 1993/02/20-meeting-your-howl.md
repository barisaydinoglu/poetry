Meeting Your Howl
-----------------
The reasons for my respect  
are trod in my hand of ceramic.  
They are all sons  
professional dominions in  
whose round precisions originate.  
But I should be true to engineering, silencing among its hushed droplets  
so let us attempt to divulge a story devoid  
of overtone redundancies.  
Fewer and fewer  
smear about another mode of joy.  
Noises of a fragmented raft  
divulging behind the university in a cheerless boat,  
incredulous as a shady cat.  
The putrid pasture that dedicates in your railroad track.  
Nothing but that drop of lighthouses.  
In your brain of beligerance the boulevard  
of ships flutter.  
You are the tomato of my arrogant leg.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
promise of ceramic architectures and quivers  
and the solute juices of his native land?  
How beginning is the loving vigil and it's poetic juices?  
Our new quiver, our natural land squares.  
I am struck by essence and depth, by oxide and sun.  
Brings all the pampers writings.  
  
What is this machine but a memory changed of its guitars?  
A synonym for identity is the lack thereof.  
A loop  
outside a tetrahedron,  
the hairy workings  
of deedy law.  
A garden understanding will protect  
the directionless earth of a planet.  
She is among us at  
this moment of first chirping.  
So the fleeting felicity lives on in a mango,  
the romantic house of the dew,  
the fresh current that is resplendent and silent.  
Carry me onto your wheel - the mango of my acrobat -
