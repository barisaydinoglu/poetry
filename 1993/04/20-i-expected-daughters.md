I Expected Daughters
--------------------
The full goddess  
flows in the cosmic morning.  
Conversations of beds, the recitation  
of foams we call aromatic hat.  
Wave of wave of shorelines rolling down the sea. Silvery electricity to my parched stalks of cattail!  
Building toward the droplet and you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
blossom of love and utensils  
and the manly necklaces of his native land?
