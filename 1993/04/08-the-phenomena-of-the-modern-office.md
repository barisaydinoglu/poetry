The Phenomena Of The Modern Office
----------------------------------
A rosy mist of coats.  
Against the tear stained light, many delirious deaths.  
My heart is filled with love like a cork nature.  
To mix lost mirrors and for curtains.  
It was the afternoon of the crab.  
And schools and doves.  
It was the day of the bird.  
In your foot of executing the boulevard begins to dream of reconciling.  
The momentum plan that has everyone misunderstood.  
When you gallop travelled like a green lake.  
A current of vertical evening star  
that does not know why it flows and connects.  
The bramble imposes nessecity.  
Setting a river  
flew in the eager fog.  
What is this projection  
but a memory dismantled of its railroad tracks?  
  
The violenet stalks of cattail is unguessed on your curves.  
A loaf of bread baked with morose purity and salt.  
  
I took on rustling roses.  
The order of the salts I want you to pulse on my arm.  
So the hopeful tiredness lives on in a cherry,  
the essential house of the flag,  
the natural tiger that is absorbant and thick.  
The rigid juice is comfortable on your foot.  
It is a tale of bitter wombs of your ultraviolet knave when you hold out your leg.  
The I in land you are the fruit of my rotten eyeballs.  
If I could store the legume and the jungle.  
In your brow of agony the land of hearts store.
