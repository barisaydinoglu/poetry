Standing Wounded Nostalgia
--------------------------
The I in ship it was the early light of day of the jaguar.  
Transformed and then appreciated in the land.  
What cosmic sea's skins -  
the jungle is filled with it,  
branches for the juice and the chaotic cedar.  
  
It was the lunchtime of the iguana.  
You are the grape of my banal toe.
