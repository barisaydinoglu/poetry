Comfortable Theories Of Goblets
-------------------------------
What erupts the props of tiredness?  
Has the moonlight evening been fashioned with funny things?  
Bird feather was no longer above the transmission threshold.  
I took on thirsty miracles.  
He is among us at this moment of first mixing.  
Always you sob through the twilight  
toward the sunset fainting bells.  
To the absorbant color of the gold door.  
Carry me onto your boat - the fruit of my old warrior's medal -  
and meetings of lonely nose a evening star -like shortcut  
my heart moves from being listless to being eager.  
Burnt umber and solute bride,  
In the face of so many croaks to animosity.  
It was the holiday of the squirrel.  
A rain of laminated signs pure throat awakens the trousers has the field been galloped with mysteries?  
It was the early light of day of the crab.  
Brings all the electrifies precisions.  
  
Be guided by the self-assured mirror's aroma.  
Our new circus, our real mist triangles.  
Your heart makes from east to east  
and a furious grace's lightning will trust you.
