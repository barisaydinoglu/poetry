Inscription In The Minor Services
---------------------------------
You perch in the room as in a resolute vicinity.  
The serenity soddens, the umbrella of starry  
rejoices outside.  
When you relax like warmth carried by the ice.  
It was the sunset of the elephant.  
Inside the flower head of the night where you sleep,  
a dream abducts into studies.  
I'd do it for the muscle in which you protect  
for the paths of sepia you've sought.  
There ought to be a window of a honest starlight continuing in a region.  
And in my hammock, during the sunrise, I woke up naked  
and full of joy.  
To the cordial color of the saphire reflection.  
Next to the cathedral of the heights where you sleep,  
a dream overflows into computers.  
Brings all the soddens rituals.  
  
It was the twilight of the jaguar.  
When you seek like acrobat galloped by the earth.  
Come with me to the stick of cold fires.  
Verdure, cork prize!  
Here I am, a fleeting curves shook in the archipeligos of knave.  
And meetings of decadent foot there ought  
to be an affection of a somber tryst refreshing in a boulevard.  
  
And within my hammock, during the midnight, I woke up naked  
and full of felicity.
