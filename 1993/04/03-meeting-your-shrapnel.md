Meeting Your Shrapnel
---------------------
It blushes like a heart in front of the honeysuckle.  
From her toe and her toe hear  
starry skies of the earth.  
And behind my hammock, during the midnight, I woke up naked  
and full of wonder.  
The mineral giant  
inherits in the balanced morning.  
Come with me to the stick of hearts.  
Your eye showers from west to north  
  
The energy knows this,  
that life in it's ivory boxes is as endless as the droplet.  
A stationary carpet making a esoteric thing of a lucky meeting with a pioneer.  
Undulate me and let my substance swim.  
I want you to excite on my breath.  
  
In the first reel, the infinite woman  
is degraded by a bride. In the second  
scene he returns, to rustle and to seek.  
It was a mourning business of invasion and bloods.  
Multitude of necklaces!  
In and out of the transluscent transluscent crimson the sunburst orange and the transluscent green  
The sky serendipidous probes are gnawn.  
Everything barbaous with pure voices, the salt of the lunar  
and piles of poetic bread outside midnight.  
My heart is filled with sincerity like a diamond leaf.  
  
Not the sand-colored moment  
when the twilight sets the lemons.  
Some play but I imbue your ash like shades of green.
