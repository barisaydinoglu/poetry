People Of A Acidulous Country
-----------------------------
A shades of silvery -like salt  
as soon as the incoming  
trysts  
gives the neutral indication.  
I was without doubt the goddess jaguar  
there in  
the exiled archipeligos.  
When it looked me with its lion hearted shades of marine eyes  
it had neither mouth nor shoulder  
but cork ripples on its sides.  
She is in the middle of us at this moment of first pulsing.  
There are many clefts in  
front of worn-out events.  
If I could expand the jackal and the university.  
Only dead and to a  
person they take on time, too many to count years  
the earth fluidic lineages are electrified.  
In front of transparent water and yellow flower heads.  
It weaves like a tiger amid the grace.  
They are all women  
professional pigeon holes in whose angellic cashmire lakes originate.  
Because I love you, love, with the electricity and in front of the clay.
