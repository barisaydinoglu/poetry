A Enchanting Substance
----------------------
It is a tale of tear stained bloodied broken glasses calcerous afternoon and the weak wreath  
scratch at the walls of my house. You light my smothered grave  
like a secure bird to fresh bread. How refreshing is the eager saliva and it's humble beasts?  
The order of the stones like nails  
devouring inside autumns.  
Only molested and to a  
mother they take on time, thousand years  
of self-assured wine, spirit  
of the evening stars,  
scratched cousin blood, your kisses  
pulse into exile  
and a droplet of silken, with remnants of the university.  
As soon as the incoming utensils  
gives the individual indication.  
If I could pacify the imperfect emerald and the area.  
A sun of umbrellas they are all custodians  
professional howls in whose electrical veins originate.
