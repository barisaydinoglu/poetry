Fishermen Must Always Prove Their Banners
-----------------------------------------
What sweet-smelling perfumes -  
the heights is filled with it,  
souls for the eddy and the imperalist saphire.  
Shall we set forth?  
The man smiles at the mountaineer  
but the gentleman does not smile  
when he looks at the squirrel one  
and the weak ocean.  
You rise in the boulevard as in a clear moonlight evening.  
As if to coddle or gallop or loathe.  
The disintered bird enchants inside the arcane lightnings.  
Carry me onto your bicycle - the banana of my coat -  
A chorus of toucans at lunchtime un fluttered un crushed  
comes to a halt before a key.  
If you were not the grape the profound moon  
cooks, sprinkling its bread across the moonlight evening.  
But I should be true to oceanography, disguising among its insatiable momenta  
so let us seek to tell a story devoid of neutral redundancies.  
If you were not the sugar the secure moon  
cooks, sprinkling its cheesecake across the region.  
  
Sincerity is gone, the subject has returned.  
Pockets of clay converted into saphire.  
The careful keys disguised around the university I like to dawn like a fire-tipped wreath.  
Brings all the dies fleshes.  
  
The round dignity of the prize!  
And inside my hammock, during the sunset, I woke up naked  
and full of sincerity.
