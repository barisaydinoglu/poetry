A Song Of Fear
--------------
Of a red mountaineer that chirps smooth stones.  
Nothing but that hat of branches.  
Stalks of cattail of a disguised rustling curtain.  
Only sticky and to a  
pioneer they take on time, twenty-seven years  
The marine lake faints, the saxophone of affluent  
showers behind.  
Decadent weather, disordered lights like the springtime.  
Pioneer of the depths of my leg - your playing  
stills your nocturnal regard as though it were ice.
