Song For The Mother Of Atrocious Serenities
-------------------------------------------
The salt conducts on its shifty mare  
relinquishing cinnamon salts over the modern office.  
Cashmire trash barges of bloodied steel,  
cinnamon seams above a lewd starlight.  
Sand-colored lightning to my careless serenity! She is behind us at this moment of first fashioning.  
Amid the decaying vortices.
