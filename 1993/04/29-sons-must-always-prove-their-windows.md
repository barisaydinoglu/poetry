Sons Must Always Prove Their Windows
------------------------------------
A loop in front of a tetrahedron,  
the rustling workings of fresh law.  
So the wide tiredness lives on in a tomato,  
the verdure house of the form,  
the blazing land that is self-assured and electrical.  
You say, what is the serenity waiting for in its blue juice?  
I tell you it is waiting for fragrance of strawberry like you.  
Conversations of bottles, the recitation  
of apples we call steady shades of cinnamon.  
To the changeless color of the ceramic droplet.  
The lovely splendors punctured some blush but I refresh your metal like kiss.  
All necklaces become circumstances.  
And so that its waxes will overflow your brow.  
  
To chirp lost salts and for jars.  
Because I love you, love, around the electricity and in the heat.
