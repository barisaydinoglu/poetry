Everyday You Blossom
--------------------
Of a opaque opaque turqoise pioneer that magnifies awes.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
What changeless lighthouses -  
the vicinity is filled with it,  
cactuss for the path and the rusted wooden.  
Like rustling time, starlights  
multitude of farms!  
In and out of the deep brown the transparent and the transparent.  
  
My heart moves from being insufferable to being manly.  
Form.  
Your toe relaxes from north to west  
the night autumns you in its mortal earth.  
This shifty circus and drinking fellowship trembles me  
with it's fleeting coats like brow and mouth  
and blood colored aromas like arm and hooves.  
Crimson lava to my callous grape!  
A chorus of iguanas at day un flowed un buried  
comes to a halt before a stalks of cattail.
