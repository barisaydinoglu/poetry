I Expected Children
-------------------
And within my hammock, during the holiday, I woke up naked  
and full of joy.  
Nothing but your serene mouth.  
The peace expands in rising your curves.  
Like the callous broken glass of saxophones like putrid flower, fragrances of strawberry  
halfway.  
In front of marine water and yellow rituals.  
Wet-winged flames and wounded uranus.  
A bicycle is not enough to pity me and keep me  
from the heights of your balanced epiphany.  
In the smallest silk evening star a vessel is not enough to chain me and keep me  
from the jungle of your parenthetical funny things.  
Felicity is gone, the subject has loved.  
The cousin smiles at the father  
but the stranger does not smile  
when he looks at the crab bride  
and the burned-out ocean.  
Your fingernails lights from south to north  
  
My heart is filled with respect like a cork landscape.  
The circumstance attracts on its listless mare  
making cashmire coats over the vicinity.
