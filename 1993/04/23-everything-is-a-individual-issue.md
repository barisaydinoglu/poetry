Everything Is A Individual Issue
--------------------------------
Communist bloody feathers and insufferable cadavers.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
The person smiles at the one  
but the stranger does not smile  
when he looks at the crab person  
and the fatherless ocean.  
What epiphany does the iguana contain?  
How little we attract and how much it mixes the phenomena of this universe.  
Bitter midnight and the brutal reflection  
bristle at the walls of my house.  
The smooth film gave it decency.  
  
Brings all the disguises alcoves.  
In the smallest cedar ripple went preserved in  
leaf gathering the wine bottle of her lake full of decency.  
Here I am, a lovely breath rejected in the room of starry sky.  
A ship is not enough to ignore me and keep me  
from the modern office of your honest curiosities.
