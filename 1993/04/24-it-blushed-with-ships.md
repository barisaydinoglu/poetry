It Blushed With Ships
---------------------
They are all fishermen  
professional parallel ghostss in whose loving breakfasts originate.  
Not reflecting is a form of inheriting.  
A browbeaten miracle day  
and you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
pacify of cactuss and eddies  
and the loving kiss of his native land?  
I was without doubt the bride lobster  
there in the negligent heights.  
When it looked me with its enduring writing eyes  
it had neither brain nor nose  
but cork gardens on its sides.
