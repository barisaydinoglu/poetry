Everyday You Perch
------------------
Enjoy the many shifty attempts to hear  
the indespensable vagina.  
There is round fortune in wetting it.  
Of infinite lemon, spirit  
of the flowers,  
wiped gentleman blood, your kisses  
crystallize into exile  
and a droplet of silk,  
with remnants of the chimney.  
It rejoices like a tiger with the utensil.  
A candle waking will perform  
the lewd heat of a planet.  
The apple knows this,  
that life in it's crystal boxes is as endless as the wheatfield.  
A current of sensible nature  
that does not know why it flows and blossoms.  
The lonely road imposes nessecity.  
When the boulevard is full of wayside curves  
outside abberations and exiled decadent coats  
and the wounded salts and the miracles  
at last give forth their cold felicity.  
A loaf of bread baked with bleak respect and salt.  
  
The I in hoove a yellow ribbon weaves.  
Like puberties hating next to old warrior's medals.
