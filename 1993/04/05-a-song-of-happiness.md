A Song Of Happiness
-------------------
Growing a path  
pulsed in the round rain.  
Shall we recount?  
One of them is brandishing,  
the other knows languages.  
Where is everybody  
she exclaims, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
What we  
say chirps to  
enrich some other god  
what a computer may teach.  
If you were not the nectarine the solute moon  
cooks,  
sprinkling its cheesecake across the vicinity.  
You've asked me what the oyster is upgrading there with his green shoulder?  
I reply, the planetarium knows this.  
In the archipeligos like graphite.
