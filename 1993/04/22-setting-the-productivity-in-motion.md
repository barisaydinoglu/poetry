Setting The Productivity In Motion
----------------------------------
And a torrential stalks of cattail's mud will grow you.  
A loaf of bread baked with morbid respect and salt.  
A phemonana responding will preserve  
the pale ice of a planet.  
Transluscent yellow wind to my barbaous goblet!  
Gentleman of the depths of my ears - your responding  
stills your natural regard as though it were jungle.  
Come with me to the scandalmongering of holes.  
Lady of the depths of my brow - your pulsing  
stills your domestic regard as though it were ice.  
Of your gray curtain when you hold out your eye.  
There are no nights but cheerless cycles of magnolium and marine  
cathedrals of smooth frightened ash.  
Imperalist weather, blood-stained lights like the silence.  
A steady rain of horses.  
  
You promise in the moonlight evening as in a sensual sea.  
Warm, saphire goblet!  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
fly of droplets and bird feathers  
and the cleansed shadess of transparent of his native land?  
Halfway.  
  
And behind my hammock, during the afternoon, I woke up naked  
and full of purity.  
The slender dignity of the quiver!
