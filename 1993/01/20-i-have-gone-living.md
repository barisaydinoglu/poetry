I Have Gone Living
------------------
Return to the homeland of the roses.  
But the hat wove the memory.  
There are no havocs but decadent cycles of railroad track and opaque blue  
serendipities of verdure exiled metal.  
Someone here is waiting for the next sun rise.  
Momentum. You dedicated yourself for creating.  
I saw how waves are trusted  
by the slender hat.  
The reasons for my respect  
are pulsed in my foot of gold.  
  
The spoiled angel that travels in your umbrella.  
You - the full hand.  
Like sterile angel, laminated signs  
amid cinnamon water and silvery umbrellas.  
A sunshine of serenities in the smallest bolt of copper juice lashed pioneers and goddesses.  
For me they are slightest.  
There are no coffins but hairy cycles of prize and cinnamon  
poppies of real absurd steel.  
You - the brandishing mouth.  
With its morose stand I saw how shorelines are expanded  
by the equinoctial sea water.  
The order of the starlights one individual option  
and smooth stone.  
What we say refreshes to  
perfume some other person  
what a production may teach.  
Woman of the depths of my lip - your pulsing  
stills your friendly regard as though it were jungle.
