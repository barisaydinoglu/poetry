The Molested Giant
------------------
And the serendipity to its salt  
and among the maternities the winged one  
the sailor covered with resplendent apple. What is this camera but a memory dismantled of its mirrors?  
Brings all the prosecutes curtains.  
Incredulous, bolt of bolt of silken awe!  
But the tree showered the memory.  
In your shoulder of shaking the thicket begins to dream of appreciating.  
As if to mourn or flow or sob.  
A mechanical sphere day  
nothing but that pencil of necklaces.  
  
They compounded it with listless branches.  
Cinnamon electricity to my bitten sun rise!
