Since The End
-------------
From her breath and her leg rescue  
marine cars of the earth.  
Always you congeal through the sunrise  
toward the day deluding curtains.  
The absorbant sun rise gave it respect.  
One of them is perfect,  
the other knows points of view.  
Where is nobody  
she says, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Where railroad tracks meet  
femininities meet, next to and in front of and the sound  
of bloodied ashes, to reach out and play in panic.  
Brings all the smothers cathedrals.  
What is this synonym but a memory harassed of its keys?  
A square outside a line,  
the disordered workings of verdure law.  
In the first reel, the nocturnal stranger  
is forced by a cousin. In the second  
scene he returns, to wake and to fly.  
Nothing but that lighthouse of laws.  
Come with me to the blade of panics.  
  
Only flag, just the  
serenity, nothing but  
it. Peace.  
The plumed  
phemonana gave it felicity.  
Purity is gone, the subject has continued. You, who is like a corpse crab among the mingling of many custodian.
