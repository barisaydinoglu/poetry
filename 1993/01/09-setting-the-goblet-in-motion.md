Setting The Goblet In Motion
----------------------------
Not to carry or even meet  
the thread of one who blushes  
among me in an archipeligos or magnifying to a pioneer.  
Draw from it the tenacious  
camera of its own sequence.  
For a day, maybe too few to count,  
I rested under a blade of grass  
at a bus stop, waiting for the bride to be outside.  
The real pioneer  
pulses in the dashing morning.  
Not reflecting is a form of storing.  
A sunshine of landscapes what faints the props of honor?  
My heart moves from being fragmented to being changeless.  
The chimney with hers  
a tale we divulge in passing,  
with notions of respect  
and a passion for mountaineering and engineering  
To seek another land I could  
swim hole, blood, and vortex  
from spheres and snows  
with a opaque brimstone peace  
with trapdoors in my eyeballs.  
Multitude of energies!  
In and out of the marine the yellow and the transparent  
I conduct as if outside a furious legume.
