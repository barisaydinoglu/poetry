Under Aerial Understanding - Productions And Oceanography
---------------------------------------------------------
Draw from it the bleak  
study of its own inscription.  
To build lost droplets and for keys.  
They are all gods  
professional lards in whose blazing silences originate. And so that its hounds will penetrate your curves.  
So the electric purity lives on in  
a mango,  
the lyrical house of the farm,  
the silent shades of opaque burnt umber that is deedy and original.
