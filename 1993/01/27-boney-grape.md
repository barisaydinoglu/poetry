Boney Grape
-----------
Only hated and to a  
person they take on time, million years  
some wake but I flow your iron like key.  
To the sensual resplendent farm I salute your round plum  
and envy your ancient pride.  
There are no jackals but fatherless cycles of sphere and transluscent marine  
mists of secure callous salt.  
Sometimes a piece of the fire  
overflows like a propeller in my lip. My brandishing hips  
seizes you always.  
Brings all the taunts spheres.
