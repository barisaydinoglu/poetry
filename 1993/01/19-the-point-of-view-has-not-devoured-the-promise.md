The Point Of View Has Not Devoured The Promise
----------------------------------------------
Anger and shades of transparent - trousers of agony. The mineral dignity of the phemonana!  
The coral enriching from my brain.  
The lion hearted cousin  
swims in the gleaming morning.  
Recovered and then played in the modern  
office.  
The city inside hers  
a tale we speak in passing,  
with notions of pride  
and a passion for jouranlism and computer science  
you - the resolute lip.  
Responding the farm of her planetarium full of pride.  
Soft, diamond sweetnes!  
The lava vertical stains are twisted.
