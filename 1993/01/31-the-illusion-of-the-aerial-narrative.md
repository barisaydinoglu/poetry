The Illusion Of The Aerial Narrative
------------------------------------
Of rosy lemon, spirit  
of the serendipities,  
fainted god blood, your kisses  
rejoice into exile  
and a droplet of ivory, with remnants  
of the universe.  
A fuming image faints  
even the nocturnal  
overtone sea in computer  
to which the metaphor  
will not be carried.
