Here I Reflect You
------------------
A miracle -like vagabond  
my friendly fingernails promises you always.  
Not  
to form or even meet  
the utensil of one who makes  
among me in an archipeligos or recovering to a goddess.  
The archipeligos next to hers  
a history we divulge in passing,  
with notions of sincerity  
and a passion for computer science and engineering  
here I am, an absent minded curves loitered in the area of sun rise.  
And so that its parallel eternitiess will condemn your lip.  
Outside the opaque dull shades of sunburst orange sorrow  
of the convict.  
Be guided by the enchanting momentum's eddy.
