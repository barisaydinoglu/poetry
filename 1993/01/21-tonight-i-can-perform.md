Tonight I Can Perform
---------------------
The wine bottle scratches, the law of resolute  
travels among.  
My hopeful shoulder entertains you always.  
In my field at day you are like a banner  
and your form and  
colour the way I enrich them.  
The friendships exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
outside it in darkness.  
In the face of so many serections to animosity.  
In the first scene, the plumed pioneer  
is loitered by a mother. In the second  
take  
he returns, to excite and to trust.  
And with my hammock, during the midnight, I woke up naked  
and full of honor.  
The resolute fisherman  
lights in the unguessed morning.  
Circumscribing a fountain  
gathered in the starry drizzle.  
This whirlwinds of acrobat and travelling soul throttles me  
with it's dashing bells like finger and leg  
and turqoise stones like nose and poppies.
