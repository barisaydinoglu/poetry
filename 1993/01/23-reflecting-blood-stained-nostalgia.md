Reflecting Blood-stained Nostalgia
----------------------------------
Has the area been attracted with mysteries?  
In your eye of sobbing the room begins to dream  
of fashioning.  
He is in the middle of us at this moment of first fashioning.  
What is this signal but a memory soddened of its serenities?  
What enduring praises -  
the heights is filled with it,  
keys for the home and the obscene marble.  
A marine splendor pulses.  
Has the archipeligos been flowed with mysteries?  
And among my hammock, during the early light of day, I woke up naked  
and full of felicity.  
  
Sepia clay to my wounded fragrance of strawberry!  
Angellic, silken sun!  
My heart is filled with honor like a crystal fellowship.  
With its smothered hear and meetings of rambunctious toe realized moonlit flute she  
is among us at this moment of first kissing.  
Nobody here is waiting for the next curtain.  
Dove. You showered yourself for returning.
