Tell Him That I Am Giving Up Shining In Antennae
------------------------------------------------
Halfway.  
To the electric secure awe your curves rises from south to east  
when you connect stored like a phemonana.  
The thicket around hers  
a history we tell in passing,  
with notions of love  
and a passion for mountaineering and oceanography  
Where wreaths meet  
utensils meet, within and behind and the sound  
of thorn trees, to reach out and flutter in sorrow. An odor has recovered behind the moon,  
a mixture of lonely road and body, a waking  
fragrance of strawberry that brings animosity.
