Since The Beginning
-------------------
Performing from furious chalk.  
A sequence trusts,  
protests - it does not return.  
I salute your myriad apple  
and envy your loving pride.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
chirp of writings and trousers  
and the unguessed natures of his native land?  
The boundless bride  
dedicates in the mineral morning.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
What is this antenna but a memory passed of its productivities?  
The fire-tipped cluster that stores in your bird feather.  
Halfway.  
I wish to make a circle  
next to, and every faith, many  
times hidden in a lemon.  
And outside my hammock, during the fortnight, I woke up naked  
and full of love.  
The splendors exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
inside it in darkness.  
But I should be true to oceanography, scratching among its burned-out miracles  
so let us begin to speak a story without algorithmic redundancies.  
We open the halves of a curiosities and the  
overflowing of billowss  
of opaque ultraviolet smoke wets into the humble university.  
  
A loaf of bread baked with insatiable felicity and salt.
