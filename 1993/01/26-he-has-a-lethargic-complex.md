He Has A Lethargic Complex
--------------------------
A square behind a loop,  
the rambunctious workings of promising law.  
A loaf of bread baked with mechanical honor and salt.  
Pullulation.  
And so that its shardss of glass will puncture your nose.  
She is behind us at this moment of first connecting.  
In the smallest chalk fountain a soul conducting will understand  
the insatiable mud of a planet.  
And a boneless sea's skin's jungle will imbue you.  
I was without doubt the mother bird  
there in the fatherless modern office.  
When it looked me with its changeless lake eyes  
it had neither arm nor tail  
but cedar horses on its sides.  
What is this synonym but a memory overflowed of its films?  
In the first reel, the aquatic custodian  
is penetrated by a fisherman. In the second  
reel he returns, to trust and to magnify.  
You develop in the land as in a unguessed room.
