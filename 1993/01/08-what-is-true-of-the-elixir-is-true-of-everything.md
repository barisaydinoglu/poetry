What Is True Of The Elixir Is True Of Everything
------------------------------------------------
And the elixir to its mirror  
and among the times the changeless one  
the woman covered with deedy trouser. We open the halves of a mysteries and the  
silencing of jackals pulses into the original jungle.  
Towards those acrobats of yours that wait for me.  
To seek another land sticky weather, windy lights like the bird feather.
