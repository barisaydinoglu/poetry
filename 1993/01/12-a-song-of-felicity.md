A Song Of Felicity
------------------
Multitude of affections!  
In and out of the yellow the yellow and the sepia  
a dark and listless eddy is abandoned in the boulevard.  
For sun was insatiable and morally neutral.  
Disordered darkness and harsh explications.  
Come with me to the violence of conspirators.  
I do not pity in the chimney of weak evil.  
Realized parsimonious writing full stop.  
In the smallest emerald jar has the land been inherited with mysteries?  
  
The parched crab rescues behind the changeless sticks.  
Marine and perfect custodian,
