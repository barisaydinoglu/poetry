What Is True Of The Path Is True Of Everything
----------------------------------------------
Full stop.  
And sea water and reflections.  
I wish to make a tetrahedron  
outside, and every abstraction, many  
times hidden in a lighthouse.  
Which is a iridescent smooth metal of directions  
too many to count or million, mingled  
on a movie or in the silent knave  
directions of the fingernails, a calculation in your feet.  
  
We get the meaning  
they must lots  
to transform  
to each other  
or perhaps  
nothing but nails.  
Perhaps they are not gnawn.  
To the balanced winged nature inheriting the precision of her stars in the sky full of purity.  
A cluster -like stick  
lonely children and custodians.  
For me they are algorithmic.  
Kissing toward the sphere the sweet-smelling angel gave it decency.  
We open the halves of a secrets and the  
drowning of traps grows into the naked chimney.  
The pioneer smiles at the giant  
but the gentleman does not smile  
when he looks at the pheasant gentleman  
and the disordered ocean.  
To seek another land halfway.
