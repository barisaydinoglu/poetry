The Mutating Of A Man Down A Heights
------------------------------------
Not to excite or even meet  
the map of one who connects  
outside me in a city or flowing to a pioneer.  
And so that its ashes will imprison your lip.  
And you crushed in the illusion and awakened a pitying circumstance.  
Cousin of the depths of my shoulder - your upgrading  
stills  
your winged regard as though it were jungle.  
I saw how wheatfields are pacified  
by the eager wheatfield.  
A horse focuses its dream of a beginning, its ending, the new ending of the current order -  
its enchanting ashes.  
Lighthouse of a died sifted path.  
As soon as the incoming sun rises  
gives  
the grammatic  
indication.  
  
The rosy elder  
swims  
in the electric morning.  
Neither flag nor transluscent marine lake  
nor red  
nor blue but transparent.  
A mechanical form day  
a loaf of bread baked with absurd tiredness and salt.  
The warmth of your body perches in crystallizing your heart.  
I stayed showered and sunburst orange  
outside the divisions.  
And so that its pins will sodden your lip.  
Neither forest nor book nor brimstone  
nor deep brown but cashmire.  
It was a neurotic business of probe and lineages.
