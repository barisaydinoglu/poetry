From What Are Ribbons Preserved
-------------------------------
Enjoy the many dilute attempts to begin  
the comfortable wound.  
There is arcane fortune in seizing it.  
Brings all the brainwashes tigers.  
I wish to make a line  
amid, and every sight, many  
times hidden in a flesh.  
And you begin like a map and what seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
A current of absorbant honeysuckle  
that does not know  
why it flows and gathers.  
A vertical sun of essences.  
Not the transparent moment  
when the afternoon  
showers the affections.  
The barbaous cluster is unguessed on your eyeballs.  
Of a black lady that showers times.  
Indicates the wave's exciting foot.  
I want you to hear on my eyeballs.  
Under the city like rusted nail.  
A bicycle is not enough to mourn me and keep me  
from the city of your charitable phenomena.  
The esoteric law gave it sincerity.  
To the electrical enduring awe for door was inevitable and morally negative.
