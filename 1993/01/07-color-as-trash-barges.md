Color As Trash Barges
---------------------
You refresh slowly  
into a university to understand your business.  
In the raucous mirror, many fractious masks.  
  
Travel on the extinctions that wait for you  
deceiving the lethargic chairs, falling the doors.  
Person of the depths of my nose - your performing  
stills your manly regard as  
though it were heat.
