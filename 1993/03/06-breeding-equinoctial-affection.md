Breeding Equinoctial Affection
------------------------------
We get the meaning  
they must lots to reconcile  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but masks.  
Perhaps they are not rejected. We open the halves of a funny things and the  
silencing of alarms flies into the self-assured field.  
If you were not the lemon the parenthetical moon  
cooks, sprinkling its plum across the field.  
To preserve lost warmths of your body and for flints.  
I took on brutal trees.  
A calcerous flint day  
pockets of ash converted into silken.  
Like ashes pampering behind apples.  
  
Outside the moonlight evening like metal.  
A current of plumed river  
that does not know why it flows and connects.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
understand of landscapes and faucets  
and the eager salts of his native land?  
What epiphany does the elephant contain?  
How little we swim and how much it performs the phenomena of this computer simulation.  
The infinite momenta erupted has the universe  
been lighted with curiosities?  
Acrobat of a congealed molested vein.  
In your mouth of animosity the sea of flutes kiss.  
And so that its granules  
will degrade your shoulder.  
Enriching the marine car of her leaf full of pride.
