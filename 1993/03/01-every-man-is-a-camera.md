Every Man Is A Camera
---------------------
It was the late afternoon of the crab.  
I stayed enriched and yellow  
behind the moonlight evening.  
You inherit in the land as in a gleaming thicket.  
  
It was the night of the ostrich. Wave of wave  
of sweetness rolling down the sea.  
In the middle of the bleak stalks of cattail, many tremulous pigeon holes.  
One slightest option and towards those salts of yours that wait for me.  
The darknes imposes nessecity.  
  
How setting is the serene vigil and it's scrupulous receptacles?  
And you mutated in the anger and kissed a deceiving saliva.  
In my sea at early light of day you are like a flesh  
and your form and colour the way I rejoice them.  
A mist of bridges and so that its ghosts will lunge your eye.  
The comfortable splendors buried I saw how flints are inherited  
by the essential current.  
And a obscene flag's earth will dedicate you.  
Returning toward the pencil a clotting sea water day  
from her eye and her eye mingle  
forms of the earth.
