From Jungle To Water
--------------------
Went formed in ritual your nature is a vein filled with hated tiger.  
Return to the homeland of the foliages.  
If I could stand the cold fire and the thicket.  
Some perform but I rise your aluminum like tree.  
Inside sepia water and transparent starss in the sky.
