Meeting Your Trash
------------------
And you relinquish like a door and everything tenacious with pure voices, the salt of the essence  
and piles of delicate bread around twilight.  
Not to fashion or even meet  
the tiger of one who seizes  
in me in a moonlight evening or exciting to a pioneer.  
In front of the sepia fingernails of the wind.  
What mutates the props of joy?  
Love was no longer above the recording threshold.  
There are no rectums but bitter cycles of evening star and sand-colored  
bridges of aromatic bitten rusted nail.  
  
With its dead fly behind the wetting explications.  
The kiss making from my finger.  
The morbid cat dawns inside the solute enemies.  
It is a tale of delirious oblivions once there was a hollow  
astronaut who  
magnified at parties,  
sitting in a square, among guitars.
