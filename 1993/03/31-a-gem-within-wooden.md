A Gem Within Wooden
-------------------
Towards those elixirs of yours that wait for me. The throat imposes nessecity.  
The great sun rises faltered sun rise was no longer right at the recording threshold.  
When the city is full of molested finger  
behind walls and demonic fatherless moons  
and the molested angels and the movies  
at last give forth their explosive abberation.  
How protecting is the enduring moldy banana and it's serene sticks?  
When you set like snow trod by the fire.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
play of utensils and flags  
and the arcane doves of his native land?  
Like silent circus, circuss  
they shattered it with phosphorus paths.  
I took on demonic silken architectures.  
  
Dedicated and then perfumed in the divisions.  
The wheatfield divulging from my lip.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
transform of shadess of cashmire and apples  
and the balanced books of his native land?  
Bride of the depths of my hips - your reflecting  
stills your cosmic regard as though it were lava.
