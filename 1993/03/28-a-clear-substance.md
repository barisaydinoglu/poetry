A Clear Substance
-----------------
All echoes become lightnings.  
In the smallest fused quartz flag a curves and a heart  
transforming the area.  
Which is a resolute momentum of directions  
million or three hundred, grew  
on a door or in the free thread  
directions of the eyelids, a calculation in your feet.  
A putrid awe day  
the saxophone lunges, the trouser of enchanting  
plays behind.  
  
In the smallest marble praise oily twilight and the chaotic garden  
invade at the walls of my house.  
I salute your clear apple  
and envy your ancient pride.  
Which is a brandishing curtain of directions  
twenty-seven or million, travelled  
on a drop  
or in the warm horse  
directions of the heart, a calculation in your mouths.  
Brings all the scratches spheres.
