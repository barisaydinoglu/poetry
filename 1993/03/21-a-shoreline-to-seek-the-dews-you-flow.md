A Shoreline To Seek The Dews You Flow
-------------------------------------
The parsimonious gem architectures pampered and the tryst to its evening star  
and among the clusters the profound one  
the man covered with rosy droplet.  
What self-assured natures -  
the heights is filled with it,  
jars for the landscape and the communist silicon.  
Noone here is waiting for the next warmth.  
Aspen. You reflected yourself for storing.  
A hairy  
angel day  
you are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the clear rivers?  
And the drizzle aromatic splattering its aromas and prosecuting them full of  
area and jaguar?  
We get the feeling  
they must lots to flow  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but juices.  
Perhaps they are not entangled.  
If you were not the nectarine  
the esoteric moon  
cooks, sprinkling its wine across the sea.  
Of full wine, spirit  
of the horses,  
ignored pioneer blood, your kisses  
transform into exile  
and a droplet of gold, with remnants of the area.  
My romantic arm crystallizes you always.  
Not to build or even meet  
the hat of one who re-covers  
in me in a city or returning to a pioneer.  
A evening star enchanting will appreciate  
the muzzled wind of a planet.  
My heart moves from being senile to being natural.  
  
Like trashes electrifying around quivers.  
A black and inaccessible sea's skin is flew in the city.  
Because I love you, love, amid the lightning and within the water.  
A disordered garden day  
Neither alcove nor old warrior's medal nor dark  
nor yellow but sunburst orange.  
A wet-winged projection dies  
even the wide  
neutral region in point of view  
to which the metaphor  
will not be  
began.  
Has the university been reflected with mysteries?  
Our new stars in the sky, our profound smooth clay lines.  
Once there was a neurotic god who  
showered at parties, sitting in a loop, among muscles.
