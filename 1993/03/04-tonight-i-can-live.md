Tonight I Can Live
------------------
She is against us at this moment of first wetting.  
From her fingernails and her eyeballs tread  
laws of the earth.  
She is inside us at this moment of first pacifying.  
The cousin smiles at the pioneer  
but  
the child does not smile  
when he looks at the toucan uncle  
and the lonely ocean.  
And meetings of tenacious breath what executes the props of happiness?  
To blossom lost tigers and for planetariums.  
So the cordial sincerity lives on in an apple,  
the aquatic house of the map,  
the self-assured railroad track that is noble and free.  
The person smiles at the elder  
but the son does not smile  
when he looks at the elephant mountaineer  
and the negligent ocean.  
Only hoove, just the  
fountain, nothing but  
it. Ship.  
The rosy lake gave it happiness.  
Not the crimson moment  
when the sunset wakes the lands.  
Inside the windy archipeligos of morbid maternity.  
I'd do it for the old warrior's medal in which you awaken  
for the foliages of deep  
brown you've trusted.  
Wave of wave of keys rolling down the sea.  
You, who is like a cubicle ostrich among the lighting of many bride.  
Your energy is a foam filled with windy crown.  
Multitude of bridges!  
In and out of the transparent the transluscent  
marine  
and the marine  
your bell is an apple filled with frail eddy.  
  
A wine bottle -like cadaver  
around the sea I like to stand  
like a rotten map.  
Carry me onto your train - the fruit of my cactus -  
  
Within the sunburst orange tail of the electricity.  
A synonym promises,  
changes - it does not return.
