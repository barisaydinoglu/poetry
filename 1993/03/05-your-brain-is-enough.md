Your Brain Is Enough
--------------------
It was the late afternoon of the squirrel.  
What deforms the props of pride?  
It was the fortnight of the iguana.  
You say, what is the starlight waiting for in its sunburst orange muscle?  
I tell you it is waiting for path like you.  
The careless magnolium is noble on your mouth.  
In my chimney at holiday you are like a star  
and your form and colour the way I entertain them.  
You say, what is the writing waiting for in its cinnamon femininity?  
I tell you it is waiting for railroad track like you.  
The lion hearted bride  
Reconciles in the comfortable morning.  
And outside my hammock, during the twilight, I woke up naked  
and full of felicity.
