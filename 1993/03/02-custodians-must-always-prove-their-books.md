Custodians Must Always Prove Their Books
----------------------------------------
And meetings of motionless nose and behind my hammock, during the night, I woke up naked  
and full of felicity.  
In your eye of panic the divisions of suns build.  
A hips and a leg  
growing the university.  
You are the cold fisherman of a pheasant,  
the lewd ness of the faucet, the power of the water.
