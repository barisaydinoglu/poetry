Color Is An Episode Of Phlegm
-----------------------------
The fortnight honeysuckles you in its mortal jungle.  
You are the orange of my ghostly hips.  
A wave recovering will trust  
the torrential heat of a planet.  
Your eyelids stands from west to west  
in your eyeballs of beligerance the night of wine bottles perch.  
Fewer and fewer  
freeze about another mode of respect.  
  
What devours the props of happiness?
