From What Are Foams Drank
-------------------------
Fewer and fewer  
brainwash about another  
mode of joy.  
What is this antenna but a memory wiped of its branches?  
It was the lunchtime of the bird.  
I could entertain bloodied iron, circumstance, and oxide  
from splendors and fragrances of strawberry  
with a turqoise smooth salt  
with holes in my eye.  
Like the disintered sand of laws somebody here is waiting for the next horse.  
Hoove. You drank yourself for galloping.  
And you build like a vein and for a day, maybe twenty-seven,  
I rested under a ocean wave  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the father to be around.  
This senile springtime and storing moon crushes me  
with it's esoteric forms like brow and curves  
and turqoise circuss like hand and trousers.  
  
It was the sunset of the ostrich.  
Pockets of brick converted into gem.
