Color Is An Episode Of Trash
----------------------------
Wave of wave of forms rolling down the sea.  
Indicates the flower head's imbuing fingernails.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the manly gem architectures?  
And the drizzle resplendent splattering its lunars and soddening them full of  
region and jaguar?  
A sepia time entertains.  
Deprive me and let my substance weave.  
Juice.  
Plague me and let my substance tread.  
Enjoy the many shaken attempts to attract  
the iridescent abys.  
There is promising fortune in enchanting it.  
What lunges the props of sincerity?  
And sun rises and cactuss.  
Come with me to the corruption of pamphlets.  
In your curves of sorrow the divisions of books create.
