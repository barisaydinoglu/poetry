Every Aunt Is A Antenna
-----------------------
Behind the black illusion of the shards of emerald.  
The cathedral plan that has everyone clotting.  
Fewer and fewer  
undulate about another mode of sincerity.  
Everything brutal with changeless voices, the salt of the river  
and piles of wide bread among late afternoon.
