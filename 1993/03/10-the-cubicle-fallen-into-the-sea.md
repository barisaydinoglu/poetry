The Cubicle Fallen Into The Sea
-------------------------------
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the incredulous trousers?  
And the snow indespensable splattering its lighthouses and dismantling them full of  
heights and crab?  
You are the disintered woman of a lobster,  
the blood-stained ness of the horse, the power of the wind.  
The profound aspen gave it tiredness.  
Hoove.
