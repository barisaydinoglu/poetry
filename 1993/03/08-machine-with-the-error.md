Machine With The Error
----------------------
Like belts gnawing in front of cactuss.  
Behind transluscent transluscent transparent water and sand-colored cathedrals.  
A tetrahedron behind a tetrahedron,  
the rabid workings of decisive law.  
I was without doubt the person squirrel  
there in the arrogant thicket.  
When it looked me with its slender lunar eyes  
it had neither tail nor toe  
but saphire miracles on its sides.  
Felicity is gone, the subject has flowed.  
With its fragmented wet a snow of smooth aluminums here I am, a lovely breath changed in the modern office of precision.  
The warm dignity of the tiger!  
  
Has the night been trod with phenomena?  
I'm the astronaut to the ripple of immediate praise.  
You are the dry gentleman of a bird,  
the rambunctious ness of the crown, the power of the lava.  
I stayed mingled and sepia  
inside the archipeligos.  
In the first scene, the incredulous one  
is punctured by a mountaineer. In the second  
reel he returns, to respond and to weave.  
Wave  
of wave of roses rolling down the sea.  
But I should be true to computer science, attacking among its neon quivers  
so let us begin to speak a story without public redundancies.  
One of them is mineral,  
the other knows  
calculations.  
Where is nobody  
he exclaims, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
  
Cinnamon and lyrical giant,  
a blue ship reconciles.
