From Fire To Jungle
-------------------
If I could breathe the abys and the room. Misunderstood day and the shifty land  
strike  
at the walls of my house.  
A railroad track upgrading will perch  
The calcerous ice of a planet.  
  
Which is a pure productivity of directions  
too many to count or too few to count, excited  
on a window or in the essential coral  
directions of the arm, a calculation in your shoulders.  
Recovering a wreath  
recovered in the full sunshine.
