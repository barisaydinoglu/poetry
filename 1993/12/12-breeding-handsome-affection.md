Breeding Handsome Affection
---------------------------
Wave of wave of apples rolling down the sea.  
Gentleman of the depths of my finger - your pacifying  
stills your gleaming regard as though it were sky.  
You say, what is the stone waiting for in its transparent window?  
I tell you it is waiting for evening star like you.  
Like gates dropping outside guitars.  
  
In the first take, the fluidic bride  
is deluded by a child. In the second  
take he  
returns, to transform and to return.  
A mist of juices you say, what is the ribbon waiting for in its sepia quilt?  
I tell you it is waiting for cluster like you.  
Only form, just the  
land, nothing but  
it. Springtime.  
When the university is full of sterile ears  
amid roosters and rabid windy green lakes  
and the tenacious eddies and the starlights  
at last give forth their fragmented cold fire.  
There are no consequences but inaccessible cycles of hoove and silvery  
ribbons of warm clotting steel.  
What soddens the props of honor?  
Not to shine or even meet  
the movie of one who wakes  
in the middle of me in a chimney or loving to a sailor.
