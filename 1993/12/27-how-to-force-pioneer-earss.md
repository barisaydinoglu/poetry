How To Force Pioneer Earss
--------------------------
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the clear sea shells?  
And the sun solute splattering its lakes and shattering them full of  
chimney and ostrich?  
Wounded weather, fragmented lights like the trouser.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
dedicate of ribbons and stalkss of cattail  
And the delicate writings of his native land?  
It lives like a bell outside the peace.  
Inside the universe like metal.  
The juice knows this,  
that life in it's silken boxes is as endless as the window.  
A fresh rain of kiss.  
My heart moves from being disintered to being monastic.  
Nothing but your wide heart.  
A bruised language devours  
even the aquatic  
individual boulevard in antenna  
To which the metaphor  
will not be lived.
