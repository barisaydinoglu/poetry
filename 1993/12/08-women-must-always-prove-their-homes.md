Women Must Always Prove Their Homes
-----------------------------------
Brings all the entangles planetariums.  
A brain and a lip  
drinking the jungle.  
  
The order of the trysts realized sweet-smelling stone like billows of dull shades of silvery smoke abhorring among keys.  
Closed off and shut up like a friendship.  
  
A stars in the sky focuses its dream of a ending, its new ending, the old ending of the foam order -  
its silent vinegars.
