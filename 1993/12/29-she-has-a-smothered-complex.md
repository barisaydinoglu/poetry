She Has A Smothered Complex
---------------------------
Neither honeysuckle nor stalks of cattail nor dark  
nor yellow but sepia.  
We open the halves of a epiphany and the  
undulating of vinegars expands into the serene archipeligos.  
An odor has understood in the landscape,  
a mixture of shards of chalk and body, a rising  
muscle that brings agony.  
There ought to be a diamond architecture of a steady productivity gathering in a sea.  
  
We get the faith  
they must lots to rescue  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but conglomerates.  
Perhaps they  
are not stole.  
Beligerance and stone - smooth aluminums of anger.
