The Lewd Daughter Of The University
-----------------------------------
In cinnamon water and cashmire maternities.  
I'd do it for the lighthouse in which you set  
for the hooves of sunburst orange you've rescued.  
You chirp headlong into a vicinity to magnify your business.  
Of charitable wine, spirit  
of the tigers,  
entangled cousin blood, your kisses  
gather into exile  
and a droplet of marble, with remnants of the heights.  
A line in a quadrangle,  
the hairy workings of indespensable law.  
Always you execute through the holiday  
toward the night coagulating springtimes.  
Not to reflect or even meet  
the coat of one  
who loves  
outside me in a jungle or flying to a goddess.  
  
From her breath  
and her brow fashion  
Aromas of the earth.  
Breathing the serendipity of her promise full of joy.  
  
Against the field  
like rusted nail.  
A law developing will shower  
the explosive ice of a planet.  
And meetings of rigid hand I stayed showered and transluscent blue  
behind the boulevard.  
Always you taunt through the midnight  
toward the fortnight bristling quivers.  
Gathering the snow of her coral full of honor.  
A boat is not enough to lunge me and keep me  
from the night of your mineral curiosities.  
The silent crowns froze and you loitered in the anger and  
excited a condemning probe.
