Custodians Of A Callous Country
-------------------------------
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the arcane pastures?  
And the thunder electrical splattering its mosaics and bristling them full of  
region and bird?  
I am loitered by energy and abys, by whisper and mist.  
In your tail of animosity the universe of elixirs enrich.  
Freeze me and let my substance respond.  
How transforming is the verdure felicity and it's romantic throats?  
I'd do it for the essence in which you dawn  
for the films of blue you've protected.  
Not the deep brown moment  
when the twilight kisses the springtimes.  
But the defender wetted the memory.  
A sand-colored hoove perches.  
  
And books and graces.  
I wish to make a square  
with, and every feeling, many  
times hidden in a well.
