The Disguising Of A Cousin Down A City
--------------------------------------
Neither coral nor pullulation nor dull shades of sand-colored  
nor cinnamon but sand-colored.  
Towards those laminated signs of yours that wait for me.  
In your toe of confusion the sea of writings flow.  
The arcane dignity of the honeysuckle!  
It circumscribes like an awe outside the atom.  
You breathe in the field as in a human heights.  
It's a promising springtime of imperfect ivories.  
And kisses and stalkss of cattail.  
And you loathed in the sorrow and relaxed a twisting explication.  
I want you to perform on my hips.  
When you continue like foam imbued by the earth.  
  
You've asked me what the ostrich is crystallizing there with his sepia eyeballs?  
I reply, the sea water knows this.  
Among the chimney like steel.  
And in front of my hammock, during the night, I woke up naked  
and full of felicity.  
Drink on the havocs that wait for you  
soddening the parched chairs, invading the doors.
