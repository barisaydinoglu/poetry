Full stop.  
I could dedicate vagina, blood, and cummerbund  
from fellowships and flutes  
with a dull shades of opaque transparent hoove  
with receptacles in my hand.

rejoice some other sailor  
what a identity may teach.

In the phosphorus fragrance of strawberry, many mourning wounds.  
The home knows this,  
that life in it's gold boxes is as endless as the reflection.
