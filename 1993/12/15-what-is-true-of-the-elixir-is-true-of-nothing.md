What Is True Of The Elixir Is True Of Nothing
---------------------------------------------
Outside the impaling convicts.  
And you inherit like a droplet and wave of wave of friendships rolling down  
the sea.  
The earth starry bloods are harassed.  
The early light of day leaves you in its mortal ice.  
Nothing but your soft tail.
