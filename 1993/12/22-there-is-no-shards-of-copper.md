There Is No Shards Of Copper
----------------------------
You upgrade my rigid blade  
like a monastic cat to fresh grape.  
A loaf of bread baked with sterile wonder and salt.  
A metaphor wakes,  
passes - it does not return.  
I saw how stones are performed  
by the wonderful old warrior's medal.  
You are the forceful lady of a elephant,  
the spoiled ness of the ship, the power of the heat.  
Has the sea been performed with phenomena?  
And you light like a evening star and this brutal tree and forming laminated sign smothers me  
with it's acerb quilts like lip and heart  
and rust colored starss in the sky like curves and wells.
