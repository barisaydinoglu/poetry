The Secrets Of The Field
------------------------
We open the halves of a phenomena and the  
condemning of pins continues into the fluidic archipeligos. A listless metaphor scratches  
even the slender  
slightest universe in production  
to which the metaphor  
will not be crystallized.  
A black and dry grape is soddened in the land.  
  
A quilt drinking will reflect  
the ghostly water of a planet.  
Only candle, just the  
muscle, nothing but  
it. Bird feather.
