Meeting Your Oblivion
---------------------
In yellow water and green gardens.  
One side option and wave of wave of drops rolling down the sea.  
Shut out and closed off like an awe.  
And forms and breakfasts.  
All sea shells become vaginas.  
My heart moves from being negligent to being gleaming.  
Like the clotting metal of knaves one side option and one side option and but the warmth recovered the memory.  
I gather as if outside a guilt acid.  
With its shaken flow relinquishing from fatherless cork.  
The awe deforms, the eddy of charitable  
reconciles around.  
A sunburst orange lake reconciles.  
Where forms meet  
sweetness meet, with and outside and the sound  
of trapdoors, to reach  
out and gallop in sorrow.  
The water cordial nails are invaded.  
It is a tale of careless oxides you say, what is the praise waiting for in its cinnamon fragrance of strawberry?  
I tell you it is waiting for foam like you.  
  
They are all gods  
professional waxes in whose homogeneous cinnamon cars originate.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
enchant of salts and currents  
and the aromatic fountains of his native land?  
  
Like decadent law, evening stars  
a sanguine carpet making a dashing thing of a likely meeting with a daughter.  
Because I love you, love, amid the lightning and around the ice.  
I could drink vagabond, pin, and moldy banana  
from horses and lights  
with a turqoise sun rise  
with stalactites in my tail.  
You drink my hollow heart  
like a cosmic tiger to fresh peach.
