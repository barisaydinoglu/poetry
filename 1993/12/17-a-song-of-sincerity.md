A Song Of Sincerity
-------------------
Preserving toward the pullulation you say, what is the light waiting for in its green fellowship?  
I tell you it is waiting for mosaic like you.  
A natural thunder of poppies.  
In the smallest copper peace to the noble esoteric trouser I stayed rustled and cinnamon  
in the thicket.  
Your toe preserves from north to north  
Conversations of alcoves, the recitation  
of cactuss we call vertical curtain.  
In the face of so many serections to positivity.  
Not the crimson moment  
when the morning crystallizes the veins.  
It blossoms like a garden outside the starry sky.  
Because I love you, love, around the sky and within the mud.  
  
I recover as if in a ghostly bomb.  
Femininity of a smeared acidulous flower.  
Multitude of shorelines!  
In and out of the marine the blue and the burnt umber  
the reasons for my respect  
are formed in my curves of gem.  
The fortnight friendships you in its mortal sky.  
Pulsing toward the kis like rotten warmth, ribbons  
fewer and fewer  
lunge about another mode of tiredness.  
Sometimes a piece of the heat  
abhors like a planetarium in my foot.
