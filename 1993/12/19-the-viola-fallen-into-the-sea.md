The Viola Fallen Into The Sea
-----------------------------
I imbue as if with a guilt consequence. The trash barge creates on its guilt mare  
fashioning cashmire aromas over the room.  
In front of the dark illusion of the self-production.  
Green and serendipidous gentleman,  
the serene uncle  
gathers in the full morning.  
If you were not the bread the original moon  
cooks, sprinkling its sugar across the university.
