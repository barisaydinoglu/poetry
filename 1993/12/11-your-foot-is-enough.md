Your Foot Is Enough
-------------------
Towards those pencils of yours that wait for me.  
Shall we keep going?  
A gray and silent sea shell is forced in the archipeligos.  
Bride of the depths of my ears - your drinking  
stills your charitable regard as though it were clay.  
You are the pale custodian of a tiger,  
the torrential ness of the bottle, the power of the earth.  
Molested  
uncles and women.  
For me they are overtone.  
Your lip grows from east to north  
if I could return the vinegar and the heights.  
Blush on  
the utensils that wait for you  
replacing the oily chairs,  
devouring the doors.  
The lashed hat is boundless on your heart.  
  
You - the perfect curves.  
Not the yellow moment  
when the lunchtime stores the serendipities.  
  
Amid the wetting self-productions.  
Here I am, a honest heart hated in the city of perfume.
