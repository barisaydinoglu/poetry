The Stealing Of A Lady Down A Boulevard
---------------------------------------
My heart is filled with respect like a cedar form.  
The I in movie awe of a congealed torrential home.  
Conversations of bird feathers, the recitation  
Of doors we call natural love.  
The crimson cars exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
inside it in darkness.  
In the first scene, the mineral son  
is cracked by a stranger. In  
the second  
scene he returns, to dawn and to reflect.  
Realized parenthetical friendship pure trash barge showers the clusters cosmic empire. The line functions to create a environment  
to its architecture.  
Silvery wind to my hollow river bank!  
It was a mechanical business of bramble and extinctions.  
The senile railroad track that weaves in your flower head.  
Always you loiter through the night  
toward the early light of day forcing necklaces.
