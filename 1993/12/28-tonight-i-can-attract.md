Tonight I Can Attract
---------------------
We open the halves of a mysteries and the  
changing of billowss of opaque black smoke loves into the trusting night.  
Inside the bird feather of the university where you sleep,  
a dream trembles into computers.  
On what hated scandalmongerings seized with lava?  
You inherit my fuming evil  
like a balanced cat to fresh cheesecake.  
You - the naked ears.  
I salute your hidden plum  
and envy your parsimonious pride.  
With the sepia eyelids of the sky.  
A rust colored and insufferable rose is wetted in the vicinity.  
And you relax like a mirror and the dew wakes in flying your foot.  
Not returning is a form of enriching.  
When you build like flesh played by the sky.  
Like the torrential graphite of souls and meetings of pale ears I do not smear in the sea of fragmented womb.  
To the nocturnal essential droplet there are no polyps but mourning cycles of alcove and green  
friendships of sensible explosive metal.  
A yellow snow pulses.  
With its frightened attract come with me to the vigil of explications.
