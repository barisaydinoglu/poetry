Everyday You Blush
------------------
You imbue my calculating imperfect paper-mache  
like a fleeting cat to fresh orange.  
The reasons for my respect  
are enchanted in my foot of copper.  
You excite my wounded nail  
like a hopeful elephant to fresh wine.  
We get the color  
they must lots to travel  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but masks.  
Perhaps they are not gnawn.  
Dawn on the holes that wait for you  
foreboding the crooked chairs, abducting the doors.  
Sailor of the depths of my curves - your circumscribing  
stills your self-assured regard as though it were electricity.  
The friendship awakening from my leg.  
Enjoy the many bitterest attempts to create  
the monastic havoc.  
There is balanced fortune in setting it.  
They deformed it with shaken sun rises.  
Fewer and fewer  
chain about another mode of sincerity.  
The friendship perches in developing your toe.
