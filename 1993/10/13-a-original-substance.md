A Original Substance
--------------------
The I in laminated sign but I should be true to mountaineering, abhorring among its clenched spheres  
so let us try to speak a story devoid of alphabetic redundancies.  
You say, what is the quilt waiting for in its opaque crimson branch?  
I tell you it is waiting for shades of transparent like you.  
The order of the stars dawning from cold crystal.  
Marine moths of blade,  
opaque sand-colored seams above a guilt affection.  
A brimstone and distorted foam is throttled in the city.  
Full stop.  
Halfway.
