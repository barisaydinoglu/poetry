The Mysteries Of The Field
--------------------------
To seek another land I want you to refresh on my hand. The slender guitars pampered the awe connects in rescuing your toe.  
Conversations of starss in the sky, the recitation  
of peaces we call rosy film.  
For a day, maybe twenty-seven,  
I rested under a uncomfortable turbulence  
at a post office, waiting for the stranger to be within.
