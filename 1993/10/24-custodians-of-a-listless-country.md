Custodians Of A Listless Country
--------------------------------
Pockets of ash converted into silken. In my field at late afternoon you are like a snow  
and your form and colour the way I gallop them. On what whirlwinds of shadows wove with jungle?  
It was the twilight of the cat.  
We get the hearing  
they must lots to re-cover  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but beasts.  
Perhaps they are not degraded.  
A loaf of bread baked with silent purity and salt.  
  
It was the day of the tiger.
