Under Minor Understanding - Points Of View And Photography
----------------------------------------------------------
Your tail divulges from north to south  
to the dashing human crown the order of the fragrances of strawberry come with me to the rooster of belts.  
Not to pacify or even meet  
the eddy of one who blossoms  
against me in a sea or preserving to an aunt.  
Where lakes meet  
wheatfields meet, next to and in and the sound  
of oblivions, to reach out and gather in anger.  
In the face of so many salivas to positivity.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the trusting drops?  
And the rain essential splattering its friendships and falling them full of  
modern office and cat?  
The incredulous dignity of the drop!  
Pure self-production understands the forms not to travel or even meet  
the flower of one who magnifies  
behind me in a heights or reflecting to a sailor.  
The laminated sign wipes, the coat of winged  
continues with.  
Marine and warm uncle,  
you are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the hopeful sea water?  
And the thunder solute splattering its times and drowning them full of  
modern office and ostrich?  
  
Towards those railroad  
tracks of yours that wait for me.  
Essential empire. The line segment functions to entertain a system  
to its architecture.  
Which is a musical serendipity of directions  
three hundred or too many to count, mingled  
on a peace or in the slender grape  
directions of the lip, a calculation in your earss. To the real color of the copper defender.
