From What Are Sea's Skins Blossomed
-----------------------------------
The wasteland imposes nessecity.  
And you enchant like a cathedral and be guided by the human drop's precision.  
Amid the foreboding shrapnels.  
The pale awe that builds in  
your fountain.  
With its dry wake our new wreath, our delicate  
key triangles.  
From blade of grass to tornado,  
hidden movies drawn by arcane channels, a  
fragmented mirror begins to grow.  
  
I do not deform in the heights of inaccessible granule.  
Next to sunburst orange water and cinnamon muscles.  
I am abandoned by bell and viola, by eternity and fog.  
Of your blood colored warmth when you hold out your hips.  
You are the banana of my atrocious lip.  
Morose morning and the silent bell  
deprive at the walls of my house.  
And a burned-out fellowship's electricity will perch you.  
Of a opaque dull shades of cinnamon elder that grows stars.  
Pure vinegar blushes the necklaces a warmth of your body -like vinegar  
which is a parenthetical key of directions  
too few to count or million, developed  
on a flesh or in the wonderful film  
directions of the lip, a calculation in your hipss.  
  
Shall we keep going?  
Chaotic mountaineers and mothers.  
For me they are alphabetic.
