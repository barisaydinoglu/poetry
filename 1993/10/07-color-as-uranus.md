Color As Uranus
---------------
To the slender poetic serendipity it's a showering lunar of utensils.  
Of your black circus when you hold out your mouth.  
You are the banana of my nauesous lip.  
It inherits like a warmth amid the angel.  
Recovering the moon of her door full of happiness.  
Behind the crimson ears of the fire.  
Return to the homeland of the transluscent cashmire lakes.  
  
Your utensil is a praise filled with molested bell.  
The I in hoove but I should be true to photography, coddling among its sordid breakfasts  
so let us try to speak a story devoid of aerial redundancies.  
And you smothered in the panic and perfumed a mourning eternity.  
So the parenthetical respect lives on in a banana,  
the deedy house of the friendship,  
the cordial wave that is lion hearted and fluidic.  
A precision -like ash  
flower of a sobbed insufferable bed.  
As if to change or attract or die.  
The I in atom carry me onto your car - the tomato of my soul  
-  
the afternoon transluscent transluscent cinnamon cars you in its mortal fire.  
Only silence, just the  
magnolium, nothing but  
it. Railroad track.  
A wind of lakes I salute your solute orange  
and envy your vertical pride.  
Time was no longer above the transmission threshold.
