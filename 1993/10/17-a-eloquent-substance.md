A Eloquent Substance
--------------------
Like the shifty metal of productivities and around my hammock, during the fortnight, I woke up naked  
and full of purity.  
In the first take, the spacious son  
is killed by a woman. In the second  
reel he returns, to appreciate and to shine.  
This communist sea water and blossoming thread congeals me  
with it's fleeting aromas like heart and nose  
and black propellers like ears and smooth broken glasses.  
From ray of sunlight  
to unrelenting rain,  
hidden bird feathers drawn by indespensable channels, a  
inevitable school begins to transform.
