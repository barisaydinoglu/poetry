Halfway.  
Be guided by the comfortable flute's warmth of your body.  
Sometimes a piece of the clay  
degrades like a honeysuckle in my fingernails.

toward the sunrise twisting branches.  
Sepia extinctions of throat,  
cinnamon seams above a fire-tipped awe.  
Fewer and fewer  
hate about another mode of respect.
