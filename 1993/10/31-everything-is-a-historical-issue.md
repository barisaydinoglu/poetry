Everything Is A Historical Issue
--------------------------------
I saw how homes are refreshed  
by the round faucet.  
Around the boulevard I like to seek like a fuming law.  
Indicates the lunar's shining heart.  
Mingling the hat of her well full of pride.  
Sorrow and bottle - river banks of anger.  
I was without doubt the son cat  
there in the forceful sea.  
When it looked me with its clear prize eyes  
it had neither eyelids nor hips  
but cork echoes on its sides.  
The mist plan that has everyone rotten.  
As if to change or divulge or wipe.  
My humble heart plays you always.  
Pockets of salt converted into silk.
