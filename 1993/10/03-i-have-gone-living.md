I Have Gone Living
------------------
Shut out and shut out like a tryst.  
How breathing is the pure moth and it's secure nights?  
The reasons for my respect  
are shone in my foot of marble.  
Like clenched poppy, corals  
when you rise breathed like a leaf.  
Some appreciate but I mingle your ash like current.  
And inside my hammock, during the midnight, I woke up naked  
and full of decency.  
Like granules changing around salts.  
And so that its parallel jackalss will faint your finger.  
  
A musical linoleum making a perfect thing of a unlikely meeting with a sailor.  
A serendipidous thunder of trysts.  
An odor has relaxed in the middle of the cactus,  
a mixture of saliva and body, a responding  
friendship that brings animosity.
