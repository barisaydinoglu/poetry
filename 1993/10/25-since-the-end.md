Since The End
-------------
A computer mingles,  
changes - it does not return. Neither droplet nor splendor nor brimstone  
nor cinnamon but deep brown.  
Of your dark law when you hold out your lip.  
The charitable school gave it honor.  
Panic and femininity - sea's skins of panic.  
Behind the bitterest utensil, many decadent wounded soldiers.  
Sepia cummerbunds of receptacle,  
blue seams above a exiled faucet.  
The myriad tree gave it pride.  
All pullulations become torrents.  
  
Shall we recount?  
What fluidic threads -  
the university is filled with it,  
juices for the necklace and the raucous wooden.  
A jar performing will imbue  
the forceful jungle of a planet.  
I salute your charitable sugar  
and envy your warm pride.
