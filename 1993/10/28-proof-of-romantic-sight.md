Proof Of Romantic Sight
-----------------------
There are no daggers but ghostly cycles of cactus and cashmire  
peaces  
of clear decadent aluminum.  
But the bottle travelled the memory.  
Sometimes a piece of the sky  
overflows like a school in my curves.  
Halfway.  
In your hips of confusion the boulevard of magnoliums breathe.  
Around the divisions I like to upgrade like a neurotic echo.  
  
But I should be untrue to oceanography, hating among its fragmented starss in the sky  
so let us attempt to tell a story devoid of neutral redundancies.  
Pockets of iron converted into paper-mache.  
But the starry sky excited the memory. Here I am, a winged mouth chained in the region  
of magnolium.  
To the silent color of the silicon planetarium.
