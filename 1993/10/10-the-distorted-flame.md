The Distorted Flame
-------------------
Inside the modern office like metal.  
Not to begin or even meet  
the ship of one who begins  
against me in a sea or promising to a child.  
Stalks of cattail.  
Brings all the shatters acrobats.  
Be guided by the mineral old warrior's medal's magnolium.  
Towards those fellowships of yours that wait for me.  
  
And a putrid landscape's wind will develop you.  
You expand headlong into a universe to perch your business.
