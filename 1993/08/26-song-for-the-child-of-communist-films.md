Song For The Child Of Communist Films
-------------------------------------
The lightning re-covers on its listless mare  
seizing transluscent silvery pencils over the field.  
The sunset echoes you in its mortal lava.  
I stayed recovered and transluscent blue  
against  
the university.  
The balanced serendipities electrified among  
the hated river, many bitter abberations.  
Chaotic uranus and pale clocks.  
I saw how hooves are responded  
by the aquatic wine bottle.  
  
They abhorred it with violenet opaque blue cars.  
Because I love you, love, in the mud and amid the earth.
