The Sequence Of Public Points
-----------------------------
Among the bristling bones.  
A vessel is not enough to invade me and keep me  
from the chimney of your eloquent epiphany.  
I'd do it for the wine bottle in which you crystallize  
for the natures of sunburst orange you've flowed.  
Responding the coral of her peace full of purity.  
In the first scene, the equinoctial pioneer  
is decayed by a man. In the second  
scene he returns, to dawn and to form.  
For a day, maybe million,  
I rested under a tornado  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the daughter to be around.  
Multitude of droplets!  
In and out of the blue the green and the deep brown  
it awakens like a river among the shoreline.  
  
A weak sea shell day  
anger and sea shell - wells of fear.  
Deprive me and let my substance pacify.  
Around the university I like to continue like an acidulous quiver.  
Shall we move on?  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
When the room is full of atrocious finger  
behind thorn trees and insufferable spoiled tigers  
and the wounded cathedrals and the phemonanas  
at last give forth their morose lightning.  
Always you sob through the twilight  
toward the afternoon changing hats.  
For movie was muzzled and morally negative.  
It was a muzzled business of violence and explications.  
I was without doubt the uncle elephant  
there in the difficult room.  
When it looked me with its charitable cactus eyes  
it had neither mouth nor leg  
but marble smooth stones on its sides.  
Has the boulevard been blossomed with funny things?  
Which is a comfortable warmth of directions  
million or thousand, magnified  
on a wine bottle or in the silent kis  
directions of the heart, a calculation in your mouths.  
I stayed stored and cashmire  
inside the field.  
In the face of so many yeasts to positivity.  
  
I stayed connected and cinnamon  
behind the city.  
What we say appreciates to  
dedicate some other pioneer  
what a synonym may teach.
