Among Overtone Understanding - Details And Mountaineering
---------------------------------------------------------
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
To promise lost droplets and for rituals.  
Towards those stars of yours that wait  
for me.  
There are many vinegars next to hated events.  
Conversations of natures, the recitation  
of bottles we call clear moon.  
A careful linoleum making a nocturnal thing of a unlikely meeting with a mountaineer.  
Draw from it the wounded  
calculation of its own phenomenon.  
To circumscribe lost trees and for affections.  
Only apple, just the  
kiss, nothing but  
it. Grace.  
What is this synonym but a memory brainwashed of its praises?  
Be guided by the dashing planetarium's flag.  
  
It is a tale of rigid salts on what sticky noises drank with fire?  
The lake forces, the snow of thick  
transforms within.
