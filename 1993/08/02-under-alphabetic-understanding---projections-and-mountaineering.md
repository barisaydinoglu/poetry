Under Alphabetic Understanding - Projections And Mountaineering
---------------------------------------------------------------
A study for language is the lack thereof.  
All promises become violas.  
A winged linoleum making a brandishing thing of a unlikely meeting with a lady.  
As if to smear or perfume or erupt.  
A splendor focuses its dream of a new ending, its old ending, the old ending of the garden order -  
its comfortable traps.  
You are the cherry of my delirious eyeballs.  
She is in us at this moment of first recovering.  
Acids of a neon airplane  
crystallizing among the boulevard amid an arrogant wheel,  
winged as a tremulous turkey.
