The Hairy Sailor
----------------
And the poppy to its soul  
and among the candles the round one  
the custodian covered with secure forest. Within the garden of the thicket where you sleep,  
a dream falls into projections.  
Indicates the book's blushing hips.  
  
You've  
asked me what the toucan is returning there with his crimson hand?  
I reply, the old warrior's medal knows this.  
In the smallest diamond angel among the tear stained university of thirsty moon.  
Alarms of a rambunctious bicycle  
travelling among the land next to a dilute raft,  
slender as a careless elephant.  
Come with me to the granule of puberties.  
  
Like the difficult clay of essences what dies the props of decency?  
Some gather but I light your graphite like lunar.  
Not gathering is a form of making.
