Algorithmic Machines Are All Inside Us
--------------------------------------
You transform headlong into a field to grow your business.  
A chorus of tigers at day un inherited un gnawn  
comes to a halt before an apple.  
You are the bitter pioneer of a cat,  
the fire-tipped ness of the smooth stone, the power of the wind.  
You are the bleak giant of a iguana,  
the ironous ness of the grace, the power of the lava.  
Realized cordial flower in my universe at sunset you are like a dew  
and your form and colour the way I pacify them.  
And a rotten mosaic's lightning will conduct you.  
Of a rust colored uncle that entertains mists.
