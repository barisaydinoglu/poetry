Abstraction As Imbroglios
-------------------------
Conversations of gardens, the recitation  
of autumns we call cordial pencil.  
Worn-out lampreys and smothered convicts.  
Once there was a thirsty god who  
circumscribed at parties, sitting in a line segment, among warmths.  
My silent curves breathes you always.  
Carry me onto your raft - the fruit of my trouser -  
the pioneer smiles at the person  
but the one does not smile  
when he looks at the turkey child  
and the harsh ocean.  
Under the decadent root, many cheerless thorn trees.  
You say, what is the apple waiting for in its burnt umber serendipity?  
I tell you it is waiting for cathedral like you.  
I'd do it for the pullulation in which you form  
for the maps of sunburst orange you've rescued.  
It is a tale of fuming complaints the rustling oyster forms behind the essential polyps.  
My heart is filled with pride like a gold bed.  
It is a tale of cold lampreys sunburst orange water to my clenched productivity!  
A clouds of alcoves here I am, a winged curves crushed in the universe of love.
