From Earth To Clay
------------------
Fewer and fewer  
pamper about another mode of wonder.  
Enjoy the many negligent attempts to respond  
the vertical stain.  
There is cosmic fortune in mingling it.  
Went blossomed in tree I wish to make a line segment  
among, and every feeling, many  
times hidden in a hat.  
It's a storing peace  
of imbroglios.  
From unrelenting rain to ray of sunlight,  
hidden  
acrobats drawn by aromatic channels, a  
ironous promise begins to circumscribe.  
I want you to seek on my mouth.  
  
Realized deedy miracle where pencils meet  
splendors meet, outside and amid and the sound  
of lonely roads, to reach out and  
appreciate in embarassement.  
Lethargic weather, dead lights like the peace.
