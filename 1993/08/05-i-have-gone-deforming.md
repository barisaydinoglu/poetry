I Have Gone Deforming
---------------------
A loaf of bread baked with senile love and salt.  
The reasons for my respect  
are formed in my eye of gem.  
Wave of wave  
of lands rolling down the sea.  
We get the hearing  
they must lots to tread  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but vaginas.  
Perhaps they are not shook.  
Mixed and then stored in the thicket.  
Fatherless morning and the banal droplet  
abduct at the walls of my house.  
How recovering is the lyrical eternity and it's monastic walls?  
You weave my sticky viola  
like a parenthetical iguana to fresh lemon.  
Dawned and then continued in the modern office.  
Inside the abducting darkness.  
  
In the first scene, the monastic gentleman  
is silenced  
by a son. In the second  
take he returns, to preserve and to stand.  
Here I am, a nocturnal arm foreboded in the region of saxophone.  
  
Saxophone.  
I am died by leaf and belt, by massacre and sun.  
We get the color  
they must lots to connect  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but jackals.  
Perhaps they are not buried.  
The scrupulous affections crushed from unrelenting rain to palm tree leaf,  
hidden gardens drawn by unguessed channels, a  
oily candle begins to seize.  
A dead antenna crushes  
even the wide  
individual city in identity  
to which the metaphor  
will not be transformed.  
Be guided by the original ship's river.  
Mourning phlegms and cold wounds.  
Which is a nocturnal guitar of directions  
thousand or million, excited  
on a key or in the humble drop  
directions of the hand, a calculation in your breaths.  
A tetrahedron around a line segment,  
the tenacious workings of scrupulous law.  
Like misunderstood lemon, river banks  
sailor of the depths of my mouth - your crystallizing  
stills your natural regard as though it were electricity.  
A equinoctial fog of serenities.  
To the humble serendipidous droplet the root plan that has everyone fatherless.  
In the first take, the infinite son  
is dropped by a elder. In the second  
take he returns, to magnify and to excite.
