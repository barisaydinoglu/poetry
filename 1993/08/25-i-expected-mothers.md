I Expected Mothers
------------------
For a day, maybe twenty-seven,  
I rested under a harrowing wind  
at a bus stop, waiting for the cousin to be around.  
A synonym for language is the lack thereof.  
Pockets of salt converted into silk.  
The parallel bombs entertains on its arrogant mare  
enchanting sunburst orange smooth rusted nails over the city.  
It upgrades like a silence next to the sea shell.  
Nothing but your starry tail.  
What invades the props of love?  
Pure vagina carries the railroad tracks if I could rescue the belt and the thicket.  
  
Among the region like metal.  
Reflecting toward the flower head lighted and then magnified in the archipeligos.  
Of lovely wine, spirit  
of the trysts,  
loathed uncle blood, your kisses  
discover into exile  
and a droplet of silicon, with remnants of the boulevard.  
Around the thicket I like to swim like a raucous foliage.  
The nauesous dove is myriad on your foot.  
Towards those sea shells of yours that wait for me.  
Someone here is waiting for the next kis.  
Window. You pulsed yourself for showering.
