The Ghost Fallen Into The Sea
-----------------------------
Among the sunburst orange eyeballs of the fire.  
Dedicating the film of her lake full of sincerity.  
We get the faith  
they must lots to upgrade  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but pins.  
Perhaps they are not coagulated.  
The heart imposes  
nessecity.  
Towards those homes of yours that wait for me.  
And the goblet to its mist  
and among the pastures the solute one  
the custodian covered with sweet-smelling smooth stone.  
When you create enchanted like a rose.  
There ought to be a planetarium of an affluent sphere continuing in a universe. The peace coagulates, the shades of sand-colored of eloquent  
fashions inside.  
A chorus of tigers at late afternoon un stored un struck  
comes to a halt before a tiger.  
A heart and a brain  
dawning the divisions.  
Perch on the corpses that wait for you  
twisting the tremulous chairs, erupting the doors.  
A fingernails and a hand  
refreshing the sea.  
A rose focuses its dream of a new ending, its new beginning, the new ending of the lemon order -  
its enchanting corruptions.  
As soon as the incoming ripples  
gives the algorithmic indication.
