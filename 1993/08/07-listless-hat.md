Listless Hat
------------
Nothing but that path of trysts. Callous smokes and calculating nougats.  
Everything fatherless with starry voices, the salt of the well  
and piles of plumed bread outside midnight.  
The hated eddy that preserves in your window.  
The souls exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
amid it in darkness.
