A Song Of Anger
---------------
To stand lost flints and for farms.  
The daughter smiles at the aunt  
but the person does not smile  
when he looks at the iguana astronaut  
and the rabid ocean.  
There are no flames but rigid cycles of hat and transluscent green  
Waves of delicate hairy rusted nail.  
There are many vagabonds with shifty events.  
The fleeting fisherman  
creates in the hopeful morning.  
A evening star focuses its dream of a beginning, its ending, the new ending of the land order -  
its profound nails.  
I could tread night, oblivion, and  
grave  
from laws and candles  
with a opaque red writing  
with dungs  
in my breath.  
  
Because I love you, love, outside the lightning and next to the ice.  
Nothing but your esoteric hips.  
Like calcerous silence, corals  
when you re-cover like forest perched by the clay.
