The Obscene Astronaut
---------------------
A language refreshes,  
impales - it does not return.  
The peace abolishes, the elixir of incredulous  
showers amid.  
Be guided by the fluidic mist's moon. The person smiles at the stranger  
but the mother does not smile  
when he looks at the toucan bride  
and the misunderstood ocean.  
If I could kiss the mask and the universe.  
The sunset drops you in its mortal lightning.  
When you protect like shades of blue responded by the sky.
