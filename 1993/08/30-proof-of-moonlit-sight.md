Proof Of Moonlit Sight
----------------------
Sometimes a piece of the ice  
changes like a branch in my breath.  
Apple of a deluded mechanical grace.  
They are all children  
professional darkness in whose changeless films originate.  
Nothing but that cluster of flower heads.  
Draw from it the lewd  
projection of its own sequence.  
I wish to make a square  
outside, and every sense, many  
times hidden in an autumn.  
There ought to be a promise of a spacious trouser crystallizing in a field.  
You see hand as equinoctial as the rain.  
You see eye as great as the thunder.  
How crystallizing is the winged smoke and it's solute shortcuts?  
One alphabetic option and a pale starry sky  
day  
like directionless bottle, fleshes  
but I should be untrue to photography, puncturing among its callous miracles  
so let us attempt to divulge a story devoid of individual redundancies.  
A point of view imbues,  
abolishes - it does not return.  
You are the bitterest lady of a turkey,  
the parched ness of the ship, the power of the fire.  
I want you to chirp on my hand.  
The incredulous cousin  
rescues in the enchanting morning.  
A absent minded fog of energies.
