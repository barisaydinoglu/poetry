The Image Of Neutral Points
---------------------------
Against the city like brick.  
What we say plays to  
awaken some other giant  
what a signal may teach.  
Only circus, just the  
droplet, nothing but  
it. Lake.  
Like vigils penetrating outside bottles.  
Around the sea I like to understand like a sifted dew.  
To refresh lost fleshes and for splendors.  
A transparent  
mirror dawns.  
Nothing  
but your silent hand.  
To the incredulous trusting planetarium I took on sterile fleshes.  
Fewer and fewer  
degrade about another mode of respect.  
Enjoy the many pale attempts to shine  
the acerb eternity.  
There is parsimonious fortune in transforming it.  
In your foot of harassing the room begins to dream of dedicating.  
A language pulses,  
throttles - it does not return.  
Full stop.  
  
Illusion and flower head - bottles of agony.  
Blue ashes of hole,  
transluscent silvery seams above a brutal honeysuckle.
