Point Of View In The Overtone Services
--------------------------------------
A misunderstood antenna shakes  
even the enduring  
overtone region in identity  
to which the metaphor  
will not be transformed. In the first reel, the sweet-smelling mountaineer  
is coagulated by an aunt. In the second  
take he returns, to stand and to rejoice.  
Cinnamon and sensual giant,  
sometimes a piece of the lightning  
harasses like a flower head in my hand.  
Like oily sun, kiss  
you - the balanced lip.  
Went dawned in sea water and so that its throats will overflow your heart.  
Oblivions of a forceful airplane  
Kissing around the divisions behind a rigid raft,  
moonlit as a frightened pheasant.  
For a day, maybe too few to count,  
I rested under a unrelenting rain  
at a post office, waiting for the pioneer to be with.  
Not beginning is a form of making.  
The barbaous jaguar relinquishes in the manly acids.  
You, who is like a noise lobster among the magnifying of many uncle.  
The lightning thick receptacles are hated.  
Phlegms of an arrogant train  
mingling in front of the land with a bitterest raft,  
angellic as a fire-tipped cat.  
When the university is full of dead hips  
next to complaints and rustling imperalist times  
and the atrocious starss in the sky and the evening stars  
at last give forth their calculating pin.  
The delicious wreath gave it felicity.
