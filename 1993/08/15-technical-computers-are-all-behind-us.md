Technical Computers Are All Behind Us

Of electrical wine, spirit  
of the telegraphs,  
deprived astronaut blood, your kisses  
build into exile  
and a droplet of bolt of saphire, with remnants of the vicinity. You are the banana of my directionless curves.  
Sepia and soft child,  
amid the red sorrow of the billows of rust colored smoke.
