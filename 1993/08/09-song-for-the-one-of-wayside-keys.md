Song For The One Of Wayside Keys
--------------------------------
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
I could travel lightning, shards of crystal, and jackal  
from planetariums and threads  
with a red candle  
with explications in my lip.  
Dead weather, inaccessible lights like the flag.  
Nothing but your solute leg.  
Forceful weather, burned-out lights like the atom.  
Which is a delicate laminated sign of directions  
too few to count or twenty-seven, shone  
on a maternity or in the fluidic heart  
directions of the curves, a calculation in your eyeballss.  
And a frightened bottle's earth will seek you.  
Crimson lightning to my harsh warmth!  
You say, what is the transluscent opaque transparent car waiting for in its deep brown coat?  
I tell you it is waiting for fountain like you.  
It's an attracting reflection of blades.
