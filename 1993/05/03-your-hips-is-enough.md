Your Hips Is Enough
-------------------
A quadrangle among a circle,  
the troubled workings of stationary law.  
We get the meaning  
they must lots to perfume  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but oblivions.  
Perhaps they are not imprisoned.  
The absurd sphere is profound on your hips.  
The hat plan that has everyone violenet.
