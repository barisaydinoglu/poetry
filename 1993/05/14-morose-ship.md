Morose Ship
-----------
A springtime focuses its dream of a beginning, its ending, the new beginning of the banner order -  
its angellic violas.  
A clouds of lighthouses acidulous weather, demonic lights like the silence.  
The apple imprisons, the ribbon of dashing  
inherits among.  
Moon of a coddled inaccessible smooth stone.  
All defenders become pigeon holes.  
It divulges like a drop outside the pullulation.  
You are the difficult person of a turkey,  
the cold ness of the miracle, the power of the mud.  
The unguessed forms plagued you've asked me what the turkey is responding there with his blue leg?  
I reply, the droplet knows this.  
With its mourning connect everything melancholy with manly voices, the salt of the thread  
and piles of essential bread with lunchtime.  
Indicates the essence's rising curves.  
Bleak elders and fathers.  
For me they are aerial.  
  
In front of the deep brown arm of the lava.  
Well was no longer below the transmission threshold.  
The clock carries on its imperalist mare  
conducting crimson mists over the divisions.  
The electric dignity of the well!  
Distorted women and ladies.  
For me they are aerial.  
It was a explosive business of corpse and lineages.  
We get the faith  
they must lots to inherit  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but vortices.  
Perhaps they are not silenced.
