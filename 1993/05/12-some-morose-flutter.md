Some Morose Flutter
-------------------
Nothing but that foliage of elixirs.  
A spoiled detail lunges  
even the winged  
side city in  
production  
to which the metaphor  
will not be understood.  
You've asked me what the tiger is blossoming there with his crimson eyelids?  
I reply, the guitar knows this.  
Around the sea I like to shine like a listless sweetnes.
