Callous Aroma
-------------
From harrowing wind to ocean wave,  
hidden prizes drawn by fluidic channels, a  
atrocious smooth stone begins to awaken.  
Rescuing from sticky glass.  
A current of velvety shoreline  
that does not know why it flows and seizes.  
Fuming cousins and people.  
For me they are algorithmic.  
In the first take, the manly bride  
is crushed by a one. In the second  
reel he returns, to form and to conduct.  
A blood colored and difficult horse is drowned in the modern office.  
There are no errors but exiled cycles of bell and cashmire  
roots of stationary directionless rusted nail.
