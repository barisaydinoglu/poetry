Breeding Sanguine Affection
---------------------------
Where defenders meet  
souls meet, outside and amid and the sound  
of uranus, to reach out and promise in anger.  
Everything wounded with sweet-smelling voices, the salt of the trouser  
and piles of infinite bread behind late afternoon.  
As if to abhor or enrich or die.  
Only atrocious and to a  
son they take on time, thousand years  
I salute your velvety wine  
and envy your trusting pride. My verdure foot showers you always.  
The sensual dignity of the awe!
