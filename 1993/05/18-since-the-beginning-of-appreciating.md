Since The Beginning Of Appreciating
-----------------------------------
In the smallest emerald friendship a laminated sign focuses its dream of a new ending, its new ending, the new beginning of the flower order -  
its lyrical bloodied rusted nails.  
Has the chimney been trusted with epiphany?  
A loaf of bread baked with sterile pride and salt.  
Agony and promise - angels of confusion.  
Multitude of coats!  
In and out of the deep brown the sand-colored  
and the opaque cashmire  
the perfect sea shell gave it honor.
