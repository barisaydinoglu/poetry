Misunderstood Ship
------------------
Multitude of foliages!  
In and out of the opaque deep brown the opaque sepia and the marine  
and meetings of barbaous foot the hushed jaguar promises in the irreducable flasks.  
Dove was no longer above the transmission threshold.  
It  
was a worn-out business of lineage and twisting lonely roads.  
A loaf of bread baked with lethargic wonder and salt.  
Like neon perfume, fountains  
sometimes a piece of the water  
imprisons like a utensil in my fingernails.  
Like scandalmongerings ignoring behind salts.  
Disintered ones and gentlemen.  
For me they are alphabetic.  
You are the guilt astronaut of a cat,  
the bitten ness of the film, the power of the sky.  
  
Of a turqoise son that pulses mists.
