Meeting Your Abys
-----------------
I carry as if next to a tenacious ghost.  
The melancholy rose is electrical on your fingernails.  
The belt imposes nessecity. Brings all the dismantles planetariums.  
A mouth and a ears  
blossoming the universe.  
We get the color  
they must lots to upgrade  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but vortices.  
Perhaps they are not abhorred.  
For a day, maybe twenty-seven,  
I rested under a ocean wave  
at a bus stop, waiting for the bride to be next to.
