In Of Aspen And Drop
--------------------
Once there was a troubled cousin who  
rustled at parties, sitting in a line, among fragrances of strawberry.  
A rain of mirrors time  
of a changed dry drop.  
Coagulate me and let my substance magnify.  
They are all fishermen  
professional complaints in whose changeless wreaths originate.  
Crooked masks and fire-tipped serections.  
I'd do it for the quilt in which you perform  
for the drops of cinnamon you've loved.  
A bruised computer devours  
even the profound  
algorithmic vicinity in identity  
to which the metaphor  
will not be connected.
