Here I Create You
-----------------
Not the marine moment  
when the late afternoon mingles the aspens.  
It recovers like a river bank in front of the springtime.  
Where hooves meet  
natures meet, next to and next to and the sound  
of rotten stumps, to reach out and perform in beligerance.  
If you were not the bread the essential moon  
cooks, sprinkling its peach across the city.  
It's a performing current of corruptions.  
A skeleton production erupts  
even the serendipidous  
algorithmic boulevard in point of view  
to which the metaphor  
will not be flew.  
  
And meetings of fragmented breath you say, what is the nature waiting for in its yellow ship?  
I tell you it is waiting for shades of silvery like you.  
Pockets of salt converted into emerald.
