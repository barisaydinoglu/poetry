The Production Of Minor Points
------------------------------
What chains the props of pride?  
A bell wetting will crystallize  
the muzzled wind of a planet.  
From tornado to pillow of fog,  
hidden lemons drawn by esoteric channels, a  
bitterest film begins to set.  
You are the guilt fisherman of a pheasant,  
the putrid ness of the current, the power of the water.  
The uncle smiles at the god  
but the stranger does not smile  
when he looks at the elephant fisherman  
and the calcerous ocean.  
Of your red  
mist when you hold out your brain.  
You - the celestial arm.
