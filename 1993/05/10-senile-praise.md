Senile Praise
-------------
My heart is filled with sincerity like a marble jar.  
They are all sailors  
professional rotten stumps in whose angellic pencils originate.  
It was a banal business of scandalmongering and nougats.  
What abducts the props of decency?  
I want you to enrich on my hips.  
Where planetariums meet  
gardens meet, amid and behind and the sound  
of coals, to reach out and recover in agony.  
Our new moon, our poetic sphere tetrahedrons.
