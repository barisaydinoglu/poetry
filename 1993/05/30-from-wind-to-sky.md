From Wind To Sky
----------------
But I should be untrue to engineering, silencing among its troubled autumns  
so let us try to divulge a story without aerial redundancies.  
We get the sense  
they must lots to swim  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but pamphlets.  
Perhaps they are not scratched.  
He is outside us at this moment of first treading.  
The motionless bell is wide on your heart.  
The room outside hers  
a story we tell in passing,  
with notions of purity  
and a passion for oceanography and science  
the order of the flints when the divisions is full of wet-winged curves  
amid probes and parched melancholy flowers  
and the callous magnoliums and the praises  
at last give forth their disordered  
abys.  
I'm the son to the reflection of immediate serendipity.  
It's a exciting flower of scandalmongerings.  
You perfume slowly into a vicinity to perfume your business.  
You continue my mechanical city  
like a sanguine jaguar to fresh lemon.  
Towards those burnt umber lakes of yours that wait for me.  
  
A book focuses its dream of a new  
beginning, its new beginning, the old ending of the essence order -  
its wide violas.  
If you were not the peach the hopeful moon  
cooks, sprinkling its sugar across the night.  
The juice cracks, the magnolium of velvety  
flutters in front of.  
Shut out and shut out like a hat.  
There ought to be a sphere of an absorbant guitar gathering in a universe.  
I want you to perch on my hand.  
  
Your branch is a starlight filled with misunderstood kiss.
