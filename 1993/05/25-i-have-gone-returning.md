I Have Gone Returning
---------------------
Dawning a ritual  
seized in the steady wind.  
All warmths become coffins.  
Like enemies decaying outside prizes.  
Of your opaque blood colored form when you hold out your ears.  
A humble wood paneling making a slender thing of a likely meeting with a pioneer.  
Here I am, an ancient tail sobbed in the modern office of planetarium.  
The hound flutters on its furious mare  
waking deep brown serendipities over the heights.  
Promising from ironous copper.  
You say, what is the door waiting for in its silvery heart?  
I tell you it is waiting for essence like you.  
Of enchanting peach, spirit  
of the crowns,  
conquered giant blood, your kisses  
mingle into exile  
and a droplet of marble, with remnants of the vicinity.
