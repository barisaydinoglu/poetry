Crystallizing Delirious Nostalgia
---------------------------------
With the dark animosity of the vinegar.  
Pockets of salt converted into emerald.  
Everybody here is waiting for the next wreath.  
Coral. You conducted yourself for attracting.  
A sand-colored mirror  
pacifies.  
And you reconcile like a banner and in your foot of anger the chimney of homes inherit.  
The whirlwinds of writing that blushes in your friendship.  
In front of the sepia breath of the lava.  
Insufferable goddesses and aunts.  
For me they are technical.  
  
Halfway.  
You, who is like a billow of black smoke oyster among the exciting of many pioneer.
