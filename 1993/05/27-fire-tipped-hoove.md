Fire-tipped Hoove
-----------------
Nauesous weather, negligent lights like the school.  
I was without doubt the stranger cat  
there in the troubled city.  
When it looked me with its velvety bed eyes  
it had neither eye nor mouth  
but chalk snows on its sides.  
The reasons for my respect  
are rustled in my tail of silicon.  
You see brain as manly as the sun.  
Like the parched rusted nail of dews a forceful sequence petrifies  
even the velvety  
aerial city in technique  
to which the metaphor  
will not be mixed.  
Carry me onto your raft - the kiwi of my path -  
like hearts penetrating in farms.  
I trust as if in a wet-winged hound.  
In your mouth of soddening the sea begins to dream of wetting.  
Nothing but that sphere of pullulations.  
A current of eager lemon  
that does not know why it flows and  
builds.  
To discover lost lights and for shorelines.  
I am coddled by hat and thorn tree, by coffin and wind.
