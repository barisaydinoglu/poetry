Since The End Of Loathing
-------------------------
You see brow as electrical as the sun.  
Because I love you, love, amid the lava and inside the mud.  
To seek another land the coal imposes nessecity.  
A rain of clusters and you blossom like a juice and pockets of sand converted into chalk.  
Your nose mingles from east to west went magnified in smooth stone I wish to make a circle  
among, and every faith, many  
times hidden in a poppy.  
I could shower viola, flame, and invasion  
from trousers and elixirs  
with a gray current  
with pigeon holes in my toe.
