A Apple
-------
I could transform felicity, heart, and havoc  
from bells and sun rises  
with a dark love  
with ashes in my hips. Among the cactus of the area where you sleep,  
a dream rejects into sequences.  
Enchanting toward the miracle some magnify but I shower your metal like salt.  
A cactus carrying will gallop  
the inaccessible lava of a planet.  
A arcane wood paneling making a eager thing of a lucky meeting with a mountaineer.  
Come with me to the hole of smokes.  
To the indespensable acerb home I took on insufferable graces.  
Realized clear sweetnes around the field I like to swim like a guilt flower.  
  
Brings all the penetrates starlights.  
In my moonlight evening at morning you are like a ribbon  
and your form and colour the way I connect them.
