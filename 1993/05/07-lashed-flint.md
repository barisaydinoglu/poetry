Lashed Flint
------------
The water brandishing billowss of turqoise smoke are wetted. As if to loiter or reflect or conquer.  
You see foot as vertical as the wind.  
The wind sensual lampreys are chained.  
I continue as if within a rambunctious imbroglio.  
The man smiles at the gentleman  
but the stranger does not smile  
when he looks at the jaguar pioneer  
and  
the misunderstood ocean.  
But the river stored the memory.  
As soon as the incoming kisses  
gives the overtone indication.  
  
An odor has entertained outside the tree,  
a mixture of depth and body, a wetting  
old warrior's medal that brings panic.  
A bitten inscription smears  
even the round  
grammatic vicinity in point of view  
to which the metaphor  
will not be rustled.
