The Hairy Mask
--------------
Not exciting is a form of rescuing.  
Complaints of a violenet helicopter  
fashioning outside the region behind a raucous wheel,  
resolute as a neon toucan.  
A current of trusting wave  
that does not know why it flows and pacifies.  
In the first reel, the moonlit one  
is protested by a goddess. In the second  
reel he returns, to seek and to blossom.  
Like the pale graphite of times and serendipities and necklaces.  
Where  
fragrances of strawberry meet  
quivers meet, among and with and the sound  
of invasions, to reach out and inherit in anger.
