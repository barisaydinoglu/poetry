The Rectum Fallen Into The Sea
------------------------------
What is this projection but a memory forced of its farms?  
On what lethargic bones attracted with electricity?  
Neither umbrella nor film nor dark  
nor transluscent blue but blue.  
I was without doubt the father bird  
there in the senile heights.  
When it looked me with its lyrical fellowship eyes  
it had neither heart nor ears  
but silicon angels on its sides.  
Guilt sailors and daughters.  
For me they are side.  
Refreshing from putrid silk.  
A current of naked soul  
that does not know why it flows and imbues.
