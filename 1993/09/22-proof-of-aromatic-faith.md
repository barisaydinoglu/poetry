Proof Of Aromatic Faith
-----------------------
You've asked me what the cat is playing there with his deep brown shoulder?  
I reply, the telegraph knows this.  
The rosy woman  
re-covers in the charitable morning.  
She is inside us at this moment of first creating.  
Forceful children and children.  
For me they are individual.  
A bitter knave day  
a tetrahedron inside a tetrahedron,  
the dead workings of secure law.  
A writing focuses its dream of a ending, its ending, the ending of the promise order -  
its comfortable panics.  
Inside the entangling  
lightnings.
