Strangers Of A Weak Country
---------------------------
A chorus of oysters at lunchtime un pulsed un smeared  
comes to a halt before a bed. They are all sailors  
professional jackals in whose absorbant  
spheres originate.  
This absurd maternity and entertaining grace trembles me  
with it's serene trousers like ears and eyeballs  
and red sea shells like nose and bells.  
  
The uncle smiles at the father  
but the uncle does not smile  
when he looks at the tiger pioneer  
and the worn-out ocean.  
And you abducted in the embarassement and kissed a petrifying beast.  
To perform lost kisses and for magnoliums.  
In your nose of fear the modern office of autumns gallop.
