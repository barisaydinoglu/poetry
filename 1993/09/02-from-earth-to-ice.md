From Earth To Ice
-----------------
If I could trust the bloodied rusted nail and the modern office.  
You - the rosy tail.  
A sea shell focuses its dream of a old ending, its new beginning, the old ending of the sea shell order -  
its honest twisting lonely roads.  
Nothing but that umbrella of natures.  
  
What pure stars -  
the night is filled with it,  
jars for the land and the calculating silk.
