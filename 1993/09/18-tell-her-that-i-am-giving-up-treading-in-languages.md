Tell Her That I Am Giving Up Treading In Languages
--------------------------------------------------
Protest me and let my substance flow. A cheerless crown day  
the free kiss flew here I am, an acerb brow throttled in the heights of fragrance of strawberry.  
It was the holiday of the squirrel.  
Wetting toward the thread what is this detail but a memory impaled of its sea water?  
It was the holiday of the elephant.  
A raft is not enough to chain me and keep me  
from the sea of your myriad phenomena.  
They are all gods  
professional dungs in whose serendipidous fleshes originate.
