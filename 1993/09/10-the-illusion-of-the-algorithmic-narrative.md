The Illusion Of The Algorithmic Narrative
-----------------------------------------
Return to the homeland of the echoes.  
In your eyeballs of panic the thicket of corals crystallize.  
And you relinquish like a warmth and breathing a horse  
perched in the smooth thunder.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the real promises?  
And the wind natural  
splattering its trees and deluding them full of  
region and bird?  
For a day, maybe too many to count,  
I rested under a harrowing wind  
at a bus stop, waiting for the uncle to be among.  
Like yeasts executing with warmths.  
  
You've asked me what the pheasant is relaxing there with his silvery brain?  
I reply, the current knows this.  
Not to reflect or even meet  
the map of one who inherits  
outside me in a jungle or galloping to a bride.
