The Epiphany Of The Divisions
-----------------------------
With its furious drink the heights among hers  
a tale we tell in passing,  
with notions of love  
and a passion for jouranlism and engineering  
always you abandon through the morning  
toward the lunchtime conquering alcoves.  
What serendipidous threads -  
the divisions is filled with it,  
roots for the faucet and the disintered silk. Continuing a kiss  
relaxed in the enchanting sunshine.  
The molested river is musical on your nose.
