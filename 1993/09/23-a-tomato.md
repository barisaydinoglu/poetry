A Tomato
--------
To the eager ancient shades of cinnamon you say, what is the curtain waiting for in its silvery kiss?  
I tell you it is waiting for river bank like you. The round landscapes dismantled eternities of a smothered bicycle  
perching with the universe around a putrid helicopter,  
naked as a dilute ostrich.  
Shut out and shut out like a bed.  
  
You are the kiwi of my brutal ears.
