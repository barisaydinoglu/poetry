What Is True Of The Dove Is True Of Everything
----------------------------------------------
You see brow as poetic as the thunder.  
Like atrocious railroad track, lunars  
the bomb imposes nessecity.  
A fog of lemons to seek another land transluscent  
cashmire traps of explication,  
opaque burnt umber seams above a calculating knave.  
  
Return to the homeland of the perfumes.  
In the face of so many lonely roads to functionality.
