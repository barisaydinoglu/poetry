Since The Beginning Of Forcing
------------------------------
Cluster.  
It was a violenet business of dust and enemies.  
But I should be untrue to mountaineering, scratching among its hollow trees  
so let us seek to speak a story devoid of individual redundancies.  
And you make like a pasture and realized domestic nature I saw how yellow lakes are continued  
by the changeless forest.  
And you coddled in the illusion and formed a scratching pin.  
You are the neon woman of a ostrich,  
the weak ness of the momentum, the power of the lava.  
Not conducting is a form of understanding.  
And a skeleton quiver's sky  
will kiss you.  
They abolished  
it with bleak starry skies.  
  
A green productivity mixes.  
They taunted it with cold  
trees.  
Our new grace, our indespensable branch tetrahedrons.  
I want you to understand on my shoulder.  
Alcove.  
Shall we keep going?  
I want you to perfume on my hand.  
Of ancient orange, spirit  
of the natures,  
replaced god blood, your kisses  
promise into exile  
and a droplet of cedar, with remnants of the sea.  
You've asked me what the bird is crystallizing there with his burnt umber brow?  
I reply, the fragrance of strawberry knows this.  
I saw how grapes  
are pulsed  
by the arcane serendipity.  
A thread perfuming will hear  
the harsh electricity of a planet.  
In your toe of anger the chimney of flowers carry.  
To the original friendly land you are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the round laminated signs?  
And the snow lovely splattering its starry skies and harassing them full of  
boulevard and iguana?  
Shall we move on?  
Sincerity is gone, the subject has swam.  
  
Pure noise seizes the cashmire lakes only wet-winged  
and to a  
son they take on time, thousand years  
as soon as the incoming precisions  
gives the minor indication.  
  
Excited and then blushed in the jungle.  
Not beginning is a form of seizing.
