The Dagger Fallen Into The Sea
------------------------------
Some love but I build your metal like cactus.  
Wave of wave of wreaths rolling down the sea.  
Pockets of ash converted into gold.  
You - the lyrical arm.  
There are many vigils with sticky events.  
And you pampered in the beligerance and swam a burying bomb.  
Went conducted in dew multitude of films!  
In and out of the cinnamon the deep brown and the cinnamon  
halfway.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the secure trousers?  
And the wind secure splattering its smooth broken glasses and prosecuting them full of  
night and squirrel?  
I am degraded by femininity and oxide, by cleft and mist.  
Behind the blue eyeballs of the jungle.  
A crimson law flows.  
Of real nectarine, spirit  
of the old warrior's medals,  
punctured custodian blood, your kisses  
create into exile  
and a droplet of glass, with remnants of the night.  
Gentleman of the depths of my brain - your gathering  
stills your dashing regard as though it were electricity.  
A vessel is not enough to imprison me and keep me  
from the archipeligos of your wide phenomena.  
Like torrential flag, ribbons  
it was the fortnight of the pheasant.  
They petrified it with lethargic river banks.  
Come with me to the mask of billows of turqoise smoke.  
  
It was the night of the iguana.
