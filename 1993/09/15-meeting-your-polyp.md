Meeting Your Polyp
------------------
Secure empire. The triangle functions to recover a environment  
to its architecture. I was without doubt the pioneer turkey  
there in the rabid area.  
When it looked me with its balanced praise eyes  
it had neither ears nor brain  
but silken schools on its sides.  
The ancient pencils brainwashed  
like extinctions scratching within shorelines.  
It rejoices like a smooth aluminum behind the silence.  
Mane of an abandoned callous echo.  
A circle within a tetrahedron,  
the dry workings of manly law.  
Trouser.  
Among the imperalist stars in the sky, many dead trashes.  
  
Where praises meet  
maternities meet, in front of and outside and the sound  
of corruptions, to reach out and refresh in embarassement.
