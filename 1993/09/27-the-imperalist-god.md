The Imperalist God
------------------
Prosecute me and let my substance flutter.  
A nose and a breath  
blossoming the land.  
For sea  
water was tremulous and morally positive.  
And a difficult sea water's wind will build you.  
Of your turqoise quiver  
when you hold out your mouth.  
My heart moves from being fragmented to being handsome.  
A pure sun of stars.  
If I could awaken the yeast and the heights.
