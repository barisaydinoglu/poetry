Everything Is A Grammatic Issue
-------------------------------
Like directionless muscle, mirrors  
the harsh bottle that entertains in your shoreline. A reflection -like pigeon hole  
went rejoiced in planetarium with its hairy reconcile sunburst orange wind to my frightened alcove! I was without doubt the mother tiger  
there in the distorted night.  
When it looked me with its cosmic miracle eyes  
it had neither eye nor brow  
but marble guitars on its sides.  
And starry skies and fountains.  
I wish to make a tetrahedron  
outside, and every sense, many  
times hidden in a propeller.  
The jugular imposes nessecity.
