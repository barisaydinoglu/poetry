Since The Beginning Of Drowning
-------------------------------
The circus plan that has everyone bitter.  
If you were not the plum the trusting moon  
cooks, sprinkling its wine across the night.  
Some trust but I grow your steel like mane.  
From her heart and her eyelids light  
jars of the earth.  
A sun rise focuses its dream of a old ending, its new ending, the beginning of the affection order -  
its homogeneous abberations.  
Draw from it the acidulous  
study of its own synonym.  
  
Love on the serections that wait for you  
deforming the dead chairs, abhorring the doors.  
Neither kis nor nature nor dull shades of deep brown  
nor burnt umber but sunburst orange.  
You are the cherry of my cheerless hips.  
I salute your aromatic grape  
and envy your fleeting pride.
