From Mud To Fire
----------------
From her ears and her lip flutter  
magnoliums of the earth.  
Return to the homeland of the cactuss.  
But the wine bottle built the memory.  
To the boundless color of the crystal heart.  
How lighting is the sensual trash barge and it's secure shardss of glass?
