Song For The Son Of Frail Quilts
--------------------------------
Of serendipidous wine, spirit  
of the foliages,  
harassed woman blood, your kisses  
flow into exile  
and a droplet of fused quartz, with remnants of the area.  
How entertaining is the domestic coffin and it's affluent violences?
