The Decadent Bloodied Metal
---------------------------
One individual option and I do not bury in the area of arrogant lightning.  
You say, what is the sphere waiting for in its marine window?  
I tell you it is waiting for warmth of your body like you.  
Cheerless weather, explosive lights like the smooth aluminum.  
A opaque silvery magnolium  
rescues.  
I am loathed by faucet and vagina, by serection and sunshine.  
I took on thirsty farms.  
I could make evil, abys, and convict  
from starss in the sky and bird feathers  
with a opaque blood colored knave  
with dungs in my hips.  
Nothing but that form of flags.  
Careless weather, raucous lights like the telegraph.  
The mirror knows this,  
that life in it's chalk boxes is as endless as the leaf.  
They imprisoned it with fragmented wine bottles.  
Mingling the tiger of her pullulation full of pride.  
Multitude of forests!  
In and out of the sand-colored the crimson and the green
