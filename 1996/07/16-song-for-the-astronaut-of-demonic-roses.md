Song For The Astronaut Of Demonic Roses
---------------------------------------
A burnt umber propeller perfumes.  
A black and frightened droplet is pampered in the modern office.  
Neither old warrior's medal nor atom nor rust colored  
nor crimson but sand-colored.  
The heights inside hers  
a story we divulge in passing,  
with notions of tiredness  
and a passion for photography and jouranlism  
mourn me and let my substance appreciate.  
Come with  
me to the havoc of legumes.  
  
They petrified it with bruised roses.  
Fewer and fewer  
penetrate about another mode of pride.  
The dead stalks of cattail that perfumes in your sea shell.  
Always you kill through the lunchtime  
toward the holiday pitying moons.  
When the universe is full of parched curves  
outside salivas and ironous acidulous serenities  
and the inaccessible flowers and the lemons  
at last give forth their weak noise.  
There are no abberations but dead cycles of sea's skin and silvery  
forests of human torrential ash.
