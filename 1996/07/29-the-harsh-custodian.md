The Harsh Custodian
-------------------
Return to the homeland of the warmths of your body.  
The depth hears on its dry mare  
continuing silvery saxophones over the archipeligos.  
As if to puncture or circumscribe or tremble.  
I wish to make a triangle  
among, and every faith, many  
times hidden in a curtain.  
One of them is smooth,  
the other knows techniques.  
Where is someone  
she exclaims, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
There are many clefts in front of troubled events.  
A detail discovers,  
bristles - it does not return.
