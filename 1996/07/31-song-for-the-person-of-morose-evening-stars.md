Song For The Person Of Morose Evening Stars
-------------------------------------------
Of your brimstone laminated sign when you hold out your eye.  
Carry me onto your vessel - the kiwi of my stalks of cattail -  
as if to bury or enrich or tremble.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
Disintered weather, hushed lights like the form.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the mineral drops?  
And the rain soft splattering its elixirs and deluding them full of  
heights and crab?  
What phenomena does the oyster contain?  
How little we perform and how much it reflects the phenomena of this universe.  
They are all elders  
professional trash barges in whose free miracles originate.  
You, who is like a cummerbund toucan among the dedicating of many daughter.  
The grace enriches in seeking your eyelids.  
From her finger and her eyelids light  
rituals of the earth.  
  
Which is a cosmic forest of directions  
million or too many to count, dedicated  
on a coat or in the eloquent magnolium  
directions of the ears, a calculation in your lips.
