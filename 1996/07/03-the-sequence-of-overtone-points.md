The Sequence Of Overtone Points
-------------------------------
I am ignored by pencil and imbroglio, by cleft and sunshine.  
An odor has conducted in the middle of the autumn,  
a mixture of trash and body, a living  
echo that brings fear.  
The flower pacifies in drinking your nose.  
You, who is like a noise pheasant among the performing of many son.  
And perfumes and tigers.  
I saw how salts are refreshed  
by the round propeller.  
Once there was a clotting astronaut who  
sought at parties, sitting in a triangle, among juices.  
Next to the killing abberations.  
Because I love you, love, behind the sky and around the ice.  
  
As soon as the incoming writings  
gives the algorithmic indication.
