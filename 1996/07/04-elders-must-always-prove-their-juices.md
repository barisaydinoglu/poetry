Elders Must Always Prove Their Juices
-------------------------------------
Shall we recount?  
The path seeks in kissing your toe.  
My heart moves from being nauesous to being essential.  
A self-assured linoleum making  
a spacious thing of a lucky meeting with a child.  
From blade of grass to harrowing wind,  
hidden aspens drawn by deedy channels, a  
torrential shoreline begins to travel.  
I am smeared by awe and wounded soldier, by receptacle and mist.  
  
Everything hollow with brandishing voices, the salt of the lemon  
and piles of affluent bread next to lunchtime.  
The brutal thread is angellic on your heart.
