A Diamond Within Gold
---------------------
A thunder of essences only ship, just  
the  
wave, nothing but  
it. Mane. In your leg of embarassement the region of cactuss seize.  
You've asked me what the bird is growing there with his sand-colored eyeballs?  
I reply, the necklace knows this.  
Only tear stained and to a  
lady they take on time, twenty-seven years  
not the transluscent cinnamon moment  
when the morning builds the friendships.  
Nothing but that foam of wheatfields.  
The pioneer smiles at the mother  
but the custodian does not smile  
when he looks at  
the bird person  
and the clotting ocean.  
It is a tale of sordid conspirators what enchanting reflections -  
the chimney is filled with it,  
lights for the lake and the lewd crystal.  
In the coagulating noises.
