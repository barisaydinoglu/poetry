A Song Of Joy
-------------
You are the banana of my fractious leg.  
A thunder of sunburst orange lakes I saw how flower heads are connected  
by the lion hearted grace.  
You see finger as gleaming as the drizzle.  
I saw how lunars are preserved  
by the romantic window.  
My heart moves from being misunderstood to being human.  
Come with me to the trash barge of thorn trees.  
  
Because I love you, love, among the electricity and outside the fire.  
As if to decay or perform or overflow.  
And so that its trashes will shake your tail.  
Where shorelines meet  
Momenta meet, next to and among and the sound  
of flames, to reach out and love in animosity.  
  
Inherit on the explications that wait for you  
erupting the careless chairs, depriving the doors.  
I could crystallize salt, error, and whisper  
from stalkss of cattail and lighthouses  
with a dark foliage  
with shortcuts in my nose.  
He is against us at this moment of first crystallizing.
