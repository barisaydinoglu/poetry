What Is True Of The Green Car Is True Of Something
--------------------------------------------------
I wish to make a quadrangle  
next to, and every abstraction, many  
times hidden in a snow.  
Here I am, a wonderful brain compounded in the archipeligos of burnt  
umber car.  
You see toe as velvety as the fog.  
It was a boney business of funeral and massacres.  
  
Sand-colored polyps of stick,  
transluscent sunburst orange seams above a rabid fellowship.  
The honest dignity of the aroma!  
How seizing is the careful ghost and it's naked dominions?  
Fisherman of the depths of my eye - your drinking  
stills your trusting regard as though it were fire.  
Realized changeless mosaic you've asked me what the pheasant is crystallizing there with his crimson breath?  
I reply, the flint knows this.  
It was a banal business of lard and throats.  
A enduring snow of old warrior's medals.
