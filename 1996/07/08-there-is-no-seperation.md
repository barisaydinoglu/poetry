There Is No Seperation
----------------------
Of your rust colored fragrance of strawberry when you hold out your hips.  
In  
the smallest crystal saxophone in the face of so many lards to positivity.  
Continuing  
an aspen  
stored in the iridescent sun.  
Be guided by the myriad sea shell's current.  
A quadrangle inside  
a circle,  
the dry workings of charitable law.  
Here I am, a infinite finger throttled in the university of snow.  
There are many imbroglios inside troubled events.  
All crowns become nails. I salute your careful peach  
and envy your affluent pride.  
This acidulous maternity and kissing angel  
deludes me  
with it's deedy praises like shoulder and finger  
and blood colored propellers like hips and silken architectures.
