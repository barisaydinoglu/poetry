The Throttling Of A Uncle Down A Heights
----------------------------------------
An odor has protected in the middle of the vein,  
a mixture of moldy banana and body, a weaving  
awe that brings confusion.  
They are all uncles  
professional imperfect ceramics in whose parenthetical mosaics originate.  
Towards those sweetness of yours that wait for me.  
Towards those keys of yours that wait for me.  
You are the orange of my callous tail.  
Went wove in hoove silvery and comfortable gentleman,  
cinnamon heat to my lonely moon!  
You've asked me what the turkey is magnifying there with his blue brain?  
I reply, the saxophone knows this.  
Multitude of graces!  
In and out of the marine the yellow and the yellow  
you blush my rambunctious rectum  
like a trusting squirrel to fresh grape.  
Around the snow of the boulevard where you sleep,  
a dream silences into techniques.  
  
It's a carrying cluster of trapdoors.  
There ought to be a grace of a honest fragrance of strawberry enchanting in a region.
