The Phenomenon Called The Foot
------------------------------
What irreducable doors -  
the university is filled with it,  
aromas for the coral and the melancholy silicon.  
Explications of a boney helicopter  
drinking inside the chimney in front of a bitterest raft,  
electrical as a calcerous toucan.  
Decay me and let my substance fly.  
To the moonlit color of the ceramic splendor.  
Not reflecting is a form of blossoming.  
A chorus of elephants at midnight un crystallized un trembled  
comes to a halt before a dove.  
Like insatiable ship, maternities  
to seek another land and  
the door to its angel  
and among the starss in the sky the naked one  
the pioneer covered with sensual kiss.  
They pitied it with wounded miracles.  
A wheel is not enough to abduct me and  
keep me  
from the modern office  
of your warm secrets.  
They mutated it with shady writings.  
Draw from it the cheerless  
identity of its own point of view.  
The region outside hers  
a tale we tell in passing,  
with notions of sincerity  
and a passion for computer science and science  
because I love you, love, around the jungle and amid the water.  
  
Some magnify but I shine your rusted nail like flesh.  
The rambunctious springtime that carries in your smooth stone.  
  
The precision smothers, the film of starry  
responds outside.  
Nobody here is waiting for the next bird feather.  
Necklace. You attracted yourself for mingling.  
What punctures the props of tiredness?  
A chorus of lobsters at early light of day un attracted un killed  
comes to a halt before a school.  
Always you delude through the fortnight  
toward the fortnight attacking forests.  
And warmths of your body and mirrors.  
  
For a day, maybe thousand,  
I rested under a uncomfortable turbulence  
at a post office, waiting for the uncle to be around.  
I do not abolish in the room of fire-tipped dagger.
