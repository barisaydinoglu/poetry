An Equally Aquatic Son
----------------------
A image for image is the lack thereof.  
Wonderful, glass hat!  
There are no extinctions but imperalist cycles of magnolium and transparent  
wine bottles of electric boneless steel.  
For a day, maybe million,  
I rested under a unrelenting rain  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the son to be within.  
Abhor me and let my substance refresh.  
Not the sepia moment  
when the lunchtime inherits the kisses.  
All schools become hounds.  
Realized unguessed ribbon a secure sun of fused quartz architectures.  
Woman  
of the depths of my eyeballs - your perching  
stills your homogeneous regard as though it were mud.
