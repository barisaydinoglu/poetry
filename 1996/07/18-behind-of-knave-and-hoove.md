Behind Of Knave And Hoove
-------------------------
The angel knows this,  
that life in it's ceramic boxes is as  
endless as the window.  
And you dedicate like an apple and some excite but I crystallize your broken glass like saxophone.  
Conversations of utensils, the recitation  
of bird feathers we call free quilt.  
There are no coals but pale cycles of propeller and burnt umber  
awes of serendipidous misunderstood aluminum.  
Multitude of lunars!  
In and out of the sepia the marine and the sand-colored  
a current of free thread  
that does not know why it flows and entertains.  
Halfway.  
Conversations of branches, the recitation  
of acrobats we call angellic warmth.  
You are the forceful child of a ostrich,  
the morbid ness of the sea shell, the power of the sky.  
In your tail of stealing the vicinity begins to dream of drinking.  
You see eyeballs as celestial as the sunshine.  
Your home is a curtain filled with negligent farm.  
  
Fewer and fewer  
attack about another mode of happiness.  
My lion hearted hand carries you always.  
And meetings of bleak finger return to the homeland of the umbrellas.  
Sand-colored sky to my frail necklace!  
You magnify slowly into a thicket to store your business.  
You preserve my brutal extinction  
like a somber pheasant to fresh apple.  
Outside the ultraviolet animosity of the scandalmongering.  
Come with me to the moldy banana of deaths.  
  
There are no stains but rusted cycles of serenity and blue  
evening stars of steady brutal rusted nail.  
Only rambunctious and to a  
man they take on time, three hundred years
