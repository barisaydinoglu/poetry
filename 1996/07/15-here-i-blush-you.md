Here I Blush You
----------------
And you weave like a hat and halfway.  
Indicates the dew's treading breath.  
Beligerance and flower - lights of animosity.  
It's a circumscribing eddy of bombs.  
Crimson abyss  
of croak,  
yellow seams above a demonic garden.  
Shall we go forward?  
What angellic breakfasts -  
the field is filled with it,  
forms for the flesh and the hushed saphire.  
Behind the dying cold fires.  
  
A autumn focuses its dream of a new beginning, its beginning, the new ending of the aroma order -  
its monastic lonely roads.  
The night forests you in its mortal lightning.  
To imbue lost breakfasts and for foliages.  
Shall we keep going?  
In the sea like clay.  
Behind the turqoise beligerance of the probe.  
Draw from it the inaccessible  
signal of its own detail.
