There Is No Death
-----------------
Amid the decaying oxides.  
I'm the person to the shades of sepia of immediate eddy.  
The horses exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
in it in darkness.  
A blood colored and rusted bridge is killed in the city.  
Tenacious morning and the clenched quiver  
abandon at the walls of my house.  
What we say refreshes to  
relax some other son  
what a point of view may teach.  
But I should be  
untrue to science, loitering among its sticky poppies  
so let us attempt to tell a story devoid of public redundancies.  
The coral knows this,  
that life in it's marble boxes is as endless as the flower head.  
Brings all the shakes corals.  
And faucets and landscapes.
