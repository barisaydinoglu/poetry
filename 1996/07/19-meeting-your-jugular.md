Meeting Your Jugular
--------------------
You see finger as infinite as the mist. And meetings of neurotic tail be  
guided by the human affection's rose.  
He is in the middle of us at this moment of first weaving.  
Multitude of old warrior's medals!  
In and out of the sunburst orange the cinnamon and the green  
rose of a conquered bitterest path.  
The ripple pulsing from my curves.  
You are the fruit of my acidulous arm.  
Our new bottle, our irreducable aroma  
line segments.  
As if to twist or build or replace.
