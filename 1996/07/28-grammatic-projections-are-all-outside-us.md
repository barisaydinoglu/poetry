Grammatic Projections Are All Outside Us
----------------------------------------
I saw how currents are upgraded  
by the human essence.  
I stayed divulged and yellow  
among the divisions.  
Not the silvery moment  
when the late afternoon preserves the angels.  
Around the area I like to seize like a dead flower head.  
The sailor smiles at the mother  
but the man does not smile  
when he looks at the lobster woman  
and the burned-out ocean.  
I could weave cold fire, dominion, and trash barge  
from leaves and  
wreaths  
with a dull shades of cashmire thread  
with traps in my shoulder.  
Pure shrapnel upgrades the marine cars on what sordid pigeon holes understood with clay?
