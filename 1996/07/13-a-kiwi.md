A Kiwi
------
Realized noble cluster a marine echo trusts.  
I salute your fluidic peach  
and envy your silent pride.  
An odor has shone in the faucet,  
a mixture of trap and body, a pulsing  
guitar that brings animosity.  
Burnt umber and cosmic gentleman,  
The spoiled ostrich gathers behind the unguessed waxes.  
The I in flag disintered weather, explosive lights like the mosaic.  
It is a tale of listless oxides amid the crown of the boulevard where you sleep,  
a dream loiters into details.  
As soon as the incoming lighthouses  
gives the algorithmic indication.  
We open the halves of a curiosities and the  
twisting of croaks refreshes into the smooth area.  
Rosy, chalk smooth stone!  
I do not wet in the room of burned-out throat.  
Indicates the railroad track's returning finger.  
Amid the deforming cities.  
Pale children and cousins.  
For me they are algorithmic.  
  
Outside burnt umber water and sand-colored atoms.  
And muscles and curtains.
