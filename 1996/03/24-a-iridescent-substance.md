A Iridescent Substance
----------------------
I could perfume dominion, legume, and trash  
from movies and aspens  
with a red bridge  
with torrents in my brain.  
I am harassed by lake and cold fire, by yeast and wind.  
  
The resplendent dignity of the leaf!  
One of them is humble,  
the other knows languages.  
Where is someone  
he exclaims, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
In the face of so many bloods to positivity.  
Nothing but your gleaming fingernails.  
Pockets of clay converted into saphire.  
In the delirious alcove, many communist enemies.  
A door beginning will shine  
the dilute jungle of a planet.  
To the wide myriad goblet the nocturnal dignity of the smooth rusted nail!
