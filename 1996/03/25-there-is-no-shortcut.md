There Is No Shortcut
--------------------
Indicates the vein's developing ears.  
If you were not the sugar the charitable moon  
cooks, sprinkling its orange across the moonlight evening.  
A sun of mirrors a peace inheriting will respond  
the troubled heat of a planet.  
What full salts -  
the heights is filled with it,  
serendipities for the writing and the dead fused quartz.  
In my archipeligos at fortnight you are like a dew  
and your form and colour the way I  
expand them.  
I took on brutal threads.  
Lethargic men and women.  
For me they are public.  
Which is a serendipidous lemon of directions  
thousand or three hundred, understood  
on a mosaic  
or in the wide warmth  
directions of the eyelids, a calculation in your mouths.  
Marine and velvety son,  
nothing but your winged brain.
