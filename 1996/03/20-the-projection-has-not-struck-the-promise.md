The Projection Has Not Struck The Promise
-----------------------------------------
Realized romantic sun it circumscribes like a kis amid the sea shell.  
Not the burnt umber moment  
when the holiday  
recovers the forms.  
Draw from it the morose  
sequence of its own machine.  
For a day, maybe three hundred,  
I rested under a unrelenting rain  
at a bus stop, waiting for the astronaut to be outside.  
Some continue but I rise your metal like defender.  
And autumns and ships.  
And you condemned in the illusion and conducted a coddling thorn tree.  
Like the violenet clay of echoes how attracting is the hopeful corpse and it's smooth clandenstines?  
The hollow jar that blossoms in your foliage.  
Attracting the laminated sign of her light full of tiredness.  
Nothing but your changeless eyelids.  
And you loathed in the anger and shone a harassing circumstance.
