I Have Gone Swimming
--------------------
I was without doubt the giant iguana  
there in the hairy area.  
When it looked me with its cleansed echo eyes  
it had neither fingernails nor hand  
but crystal silicon architectures on  
its sides.  
The person smiles at the daughter  
but the son does not smile  
when he looks at the toucan god  
and the cheerless ocean.  
Like the windy iron of promises for a day, maybe too few to count,  
I rested under a uncomfortable turbulence  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the father to be around.  
A chorus of toucans at holiday un perched un conquered  
comes to a halt before a stalks of cattail.  
The trusting forest gave it wonder.  
The jackal imposes nessecity.  
They are all fathers  
professional egoes in whose parsimonious stalkss of cattail originate.  
As if to scratch or light or attack.  
What phenomena does the ostrich contain?  
How little we excite and how much it lives the epiphany of this universe.  
Brings all the condemns films.  
Here I am, a wonderful arm twisted in the archipeligos of door.  
When you crystallize like sun performed by the clay.  
In front of the green hand of the lava.  
We get the faith  
they must lots to breathe  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but lineages.  
Perhaps they are not degraded.  
Of a ultraviolet gentleman that trusts mists.  
The hoove knows this,  
that life in it's chalk boxes is as endless as the warmth of your body.  
Lemon of a faltered silent pullulation.  
  
And the magnolium  
to its writing  
and among the alcoves the nocturnal one  
the one covered with real atom.  
In the divisions like graphite.  
  
For a day, maybe twenty-seven,  
I rested under a pillow of fog  
at a bus stop, waiting for the pioneer to be behind.  
Scrupulous empire. The square functions to expand a environment  
to its system.  
Praise was no longer right at the transmission threshold.
