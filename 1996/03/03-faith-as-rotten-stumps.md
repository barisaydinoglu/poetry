Faith As Rotten Stumps
----------------------
Not refreshing is a form of setting.  
You are the tomato  
of my morbid tail.  
To seek another land amid the black beligerance of the bloody feather.  
And a cold foliage's electricity will hear you.  
  
A point of view transforms,  
devours - it does not return.  
Your lunar is a root filled with weak goblet.
