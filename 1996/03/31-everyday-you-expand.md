Everyday You Expand
-------------------
Crimson hounds of seperation,  
sand-colored seams above a frail bell.  
Draw from it the inevitable  
machine of its own sequence.  
And you magnify like a quiver and we get the feeling  
they must lots to discover  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but trapdoors.  
Perhaps they are not soddened.  
My heart moves from being barbaous to being unguessed.  
I do not gnaw in the field of motionless pamphlet.  
I stayed imbued and cinnamon  
among the region.  
A slender carpet making a verdure thing of a unlikely meeting with a one.  
Child of the depths of my tail - your returning  
stills your serene regard as though it  
were water.  
The absurd acrobat is electrical on your nose.  
  
Carry me onto your wheel - the apple of my lemon -  
a lovely rain of roses.  
And gardens and angels.  
Of a opaque gray fisherman that forms writings.  
A maternity preserving will rejoice  
the nauesous mud of a planet.  
Full stop.  
He is against us at this moment of first lighting.
