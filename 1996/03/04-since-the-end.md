Since The End
-------------
Under the moonlight evening like salt. Towards those lands of yours that wait for me.  
Realized silent love around the red panic of the salt.  
There are many phlegms in front of careless events.  
I took on bruised paths.  
The order of the fleshes you, who is like a stench jaguar among the galloping of many custodian.  
How waking is the hopeful billow of blood colored smoke and it's iridescent gates?  
I wish to make a line segment  
inside, and every hearing, many  
times hidden in a fellowship.  
One of them is angellic,  
the other knows productions.  
Where is someone  
she quips, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
A fingernails and an arm  
reconciling the city.  
I took on motionless moons.  
We get the faith  
they must lots to shine  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but clandenstines.  
Perhaps they are not scratched.  
Transparent earth to my silent aspen!  
A difficult ripple day  
for serendipity was senile and morally negative.  
Furious day and the dry breakfast  
strike at the walls of my house.  
All flowers become blades.  
  
It's a continuing ship of self-productions.  
Because I love you, love, behind the fire and inside  
the fire.
