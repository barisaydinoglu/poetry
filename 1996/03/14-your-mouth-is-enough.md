Your Mouth Is Enough
--------------------
And meetings of brutal leg it's a treading lemon of invasions.  
Be guided by the sanguine essence's smooth salt.  
What is this phenomenon but a memory coagulated of its suns?  
An odor has dawned in the middle of the energy,  
a mixture of thorn tree and body, an appreciating  
wheatfield that brings anger.
