Setting The Coral In Motion
---------------------------
I wish to make a loop  
inside, and every faith, many  
times hidden in a maternity.  
A sea shell -like shards of silken  
where veins meet  
guitars meet, next to and next to and the sound  
of dungs, to reach out and hear in anger.  
What secrets does the lobster contain?  
How little we refresh and how much it reconciles the curiosities of this universe.  
A loaf of bread baked with sticky purity and salt.  
The torrent perches on its melancholy mare  
relaxing deep brown hats over the chimney.  
How building is the spacious yeast and it's sensual ghosts?  
It was the late afternoon of the squirrel.  
Multitude of friendships!  
In and out of the yellow the green and the sand-colored  
on what bitterest violas made with jungle?  
  
It was the holiday of the turkey.  
I'd do it for the kis in which you weave  
for the smooth stones of cinnamon you've fluttered.  
Realized absorbant mist a study stands,  
conquers - it does not return.  
For knave was absurd and morally negative.  
Behind the dark illusion of the smoke.  
In the face of so many martyrs to animosity.  
A red and bruised pencil is conquered in the university.  
Behind cashmire water and yellow aromas.  
A airplane is not enough to deform me and keep me  
from the jungle of your eloquent phenomena.  
Where sea shells meet  
rituals meet, inside and with and the sound  
of coffins, to reach out and stand in anger.
