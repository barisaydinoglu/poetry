Breeding Domestic Affection
---------------------------
In the smallest paper-mache echo not the transparent moment  
when the morning  
transforms the bells.  
The fleeting custodian  
makes in the secure morning.  
Which is a homogeneous mist of directions  
thousand or three hundred, recovered  
on a hoove or in the delicate banner  
directions of the eyelids, a calculation in your noses.  
A aromatic rain of magnoliums.  
When you recover like map recovered by the lightning.  
Of a turqoise child that flows lights.  
Crimson and soft son,  
I took on worn-out evening stars.  
Shall we recount?  
What curiosities does the ostrich contain?  
How little we fly and how much it enriches the epiphany of this computer simulation.  
The mud dashing lightnings are fainted.  
The I in coral you are the molested  
fisherman of a jaguar,  
the chaotic ness of the grace, the power of the mud.  
They smeared it with inevitable fellowships.
