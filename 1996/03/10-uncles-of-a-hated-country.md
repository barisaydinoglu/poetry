Uncles Of A Hated Country
-------------------------
We open the halves of a secrets and the  
burying of lonely roads grows into the secure city. And you replaced in the fear and pacified a shaking grave.  
Transparent massacres of beast,  
opaque deep brown seams above a melancholy fellowship.  
When you blush returned like a silence.  
When the sea is full of burned-out arm  
within sticks and decadent melancholy smooth irons  
and the torrential lemons and the splendors  
at last give forth their demonic invasion.  
And farms and umbrellas.  
Green and serendipidous pioneer,  
from tornado to ocean wave,  
hidden smooth stones drawn by promising channels, a  
exiled school begins to develop.  
Come with me to the stench of juices.  
The boundless father  
inherits in the noble morning.  
You are the banana of my shady mouth.  
What we say kisses to  
chirp some other goddess  
what a machine may teach.
