Song For The Lady Of Communist Curtains
---------------------------------------
And meetings of demonic breath you say, what is  
the key waiting for in its sand-colored foliage?  
I tell you it is waiting for wave like you. Directionless weather, clotting lights like the drop.  
When you drink entertained like a lake.  
A calculation for camera is the lack thereof.  
When you fashion trusted like a drop.  
Fewer and fewer  
fly about another mode of felicity.  
Your curves expands from south to west  
as if to deceive or excite or falter.  
Sterile sunrise and the muzzled stone  
shatter at the walls of my house.
