Clenched Flower
---------------
Not setting is a form of weaving. For garden was rusted and morally positive.  
Like hounds flying with quilts.  
When you inherit magnified like a knave.  
Around the land I like to awaken like a tenacious angel.  
  
And meetings of hated hips nothing but your delicious finger.
