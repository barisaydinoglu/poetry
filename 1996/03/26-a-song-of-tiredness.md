A Song Of Tiredness
-------------------
If you were not the grape the secure moon  
cooks, sprinkling its sugar across the jungle.  
The sanguine god  
attracts in the warm morning.  
A loaf of bread baked with tear stained felicity and salt.  
Neither fellowship nor book nor dull shades of crimson  
nor silvery but burnt umber.
