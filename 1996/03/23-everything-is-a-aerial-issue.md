Everything Is A Aerial Issue
----------------------------
Wave of wave of snows rolling down the sea.  
Sunburst orange daggers of whisper,  
cinnamon seams above a furious  
foliage.  
Sometimes a piece of the ice  
faints like a muscle in my brow.  
Where banners meet  
evening stars meet, inside and next to and the sound  
of enemies, to reach out and transform in anger.
