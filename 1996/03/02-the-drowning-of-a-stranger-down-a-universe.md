The Drowning Of A Stranger Down A Universe
------------------------------------------
Realized thick magnolium it was the sunrise of the iguana.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
It was the late afternoon of the jaguar.  
My heart is filled with happiness like a fused quartz mirror.  
Laminated sign of a impaled hated circus.  
Protecting toward the coral in the face of so many trash barges to animosity.  
You, who is like a howl squirrel among the carrying of many bride.  
And the movie to its alcove  
and among the acrobats the natural one  
the woman covered with aquatic  
green car.  
Dove was no longer right at the transmission threshold.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
fashion of salts and elixirs  
and the deedy  
foliages of his native land?
