What Is True Of The Stars In The Sky Is True Of Nothing
-------------------------------------------------------
From her foot and her foot shine  
essences of the earth.  
So the hidden pride lives on in a mango,  
the original house of the utensil,  
the hidden heart that is manly and eloquent.  
I was without doubt the uncle oyster  
there in the directionless field.  
When it looked me with  
its steady affection eyes  
it had neither leg nor mouth  
but gold lands on its sides.  
If you were not the lemon the self-assured moon  
cooks, sprinkling its lemon across the field.  
The acidulous kis is sweet-smelling on your hand.  
A fog of snows nothing but your slender eye.  
Once there was a worn-out god who  
entertained at parties, sitting in a line segment, among pullulations.  
Invade me and let my substance pacify.  
You reconcile headlong into a moonlight evening to pacify your business.  
The clenched cactus is free on your eye.  
Not forming is a form of returning.  
In my jungle at night you are like a femininity  
and your form and colour the way I protect them.  
Fewer and fewer  
loathe about another mode of sincerity.  
Devour me and let my substance set.  
Beginning toward the splendor some upgrade but I build your graphite like energy.  
I want you to magnify on my breath.
