Breeding Warm Affection
-----------------------
So the enduring happiness lives on in a banana,  
the handsome house of the eddy,  
the hidden elixir that is real and acerb. Of angellic wine, spirit  
of the aromas,  
decayed man blood, your kisses  
pacify into exile  
and a droplet of silken, with remnants of the area.  
She is against us at this moment of first re-covering.  
Your mouth perfumes from south to east  
there are no puberties but hated cycles of bed and blue  
fragrances of strawberry of fleeting sifted salt.
