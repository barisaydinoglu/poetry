Every Son Is A Machine
----------------------
Where wheatfields meet  
cashmire cars meet, in and within and the sound  
of pins, to reach out and rescue in confusion.  
Indicates the railroad track's seeking eyelids.  
The heat friendly self-productions are deceived.  
Your flint is a mist filled with ironous shoreline.  
A current of parenthetical trouser  
that does not know why it flows and refreshes.  
Pockets of salt converted into ceramic.  
A kiss focuses its dream of a new ending, its new ending, the beginning of the snow order -  
its scrupulous hounds.  
Brings all the brainwashes homes. Balanced, marble mirror!  
All forests become acids.  
When the heights is full of neurotic breath  
around felicities and wayside lewd moons  
and the cheerless poppies and the laws  
at last give forth their arrogant lineage.  
It is a tale of insufferable bloodied clays indicates the foliage's enchanting toe.
