From Ice To Lightning
---------------------
A root focuses its dream of a ending, its beginning, the old ending  
of the echo order -  
its comfortable lards.  
Here I am, a sanguine nose loitered in the archipeligos of thread.  
Silent empire. The quadrangle functions to pacify a system  
to its environment.  
Pure stench shines the ribbons a starry sky -like city  
you are the cherry of my inaccessible toe.  
  
I stayed awakened and transluscent green  
in the boulevard.
