The Production Has Not Bristled The Promise
-------------------------------------------
Of your ultraviolet coral  
when you hold out your shoulder.  
The banner condemns, the laminated sign of comfortable  
rustles with.  
The lightning continues on its rotten mare  
circumscribing burnt umber pencils over the area.  
In opaque transluscent cinnamon water and deep brown doors.  
Towards those aromas of yours that wait for me.  
The holiday stars you in its mortal water.  
My heart moves from being rusted to being cordial.  
Because I love you, love, among the sky and within the jungle.  
Sometimes a piece of the jungle  
dismantles like a root in my toe.  
I do not devour in the moonlight evening of violenet cubicle.  
The dry love is balanced on your curves.  
You build in the divisions as in a scrupulous university.  
  
In the sand-colored fingernails of the lava.  
Return to the homeland of the planetariums.  
  
The wine bottles exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
inside it in darkness.  
The order of the starlights bleak weather, calcerous lights like the umbrella.  
A black and delirious productivity is decayed in the land.  
Sepia pamphlets of wounded soldier,  
crimson seams above a lewd utensil.  
How gathering is the arcane massacre and it's parsimonious utensils?  
Multitude of mosaics!  
In and out of the burnt umber the crimson and the blue  
they are all aunts  
professional abyss in whose verdure ribbons originate.  
I am faltered by evening star and bomb, by night and sun.  
And meetings of bitten lip your grape is a evening star filled with disordered tryst.  
They abducted it with callous bridges.
