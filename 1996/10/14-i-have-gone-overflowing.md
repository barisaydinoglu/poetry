I Have Gone Overflowing
-----------------------
You say, what is the goblet waiting for in its marine ship?  
I tell you it is waiting for land like you.  
Outside blue water and sunburst orange atoms.  
And a lashed elixir's heat will recover you.  
A forest focuses its dream of a new ending, its new ending, the beginning of the aroma order -  
its self-assured coals.  
What epiphany does the ostrich contain?  
How little we relinquish and how much it understands the secrets of this galaxy.  
Dedicating the bed of her flesh full of pride.  
I do not deprive in the universe of rabid hound.  
My plumed curves wakes you always.  
Full stop.  
A toe and a brain  
mingling the room.  
If you were not the apple the serendipidous moon  
cooks, sprinkling its cheesecake across the thicket.
