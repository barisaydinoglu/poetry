The Dead Flame
--------------
This senile elixir and treading angel replaces me  
with it's arcane ribbons like lip and ears  
and ultraviolet horses like arm and foams.  
The mirror wetting from my curves.  
Conversations of sun rises, the recitation  
of bird feathers we call aromatic  
sea water.  
You say,  
what is the writing waiting for in its silvery quiver?  
I tell you it is waiting for bell like you.  
  
What we say plays to  
carry some other pioneer  
what a production may teach.
