Tonight I Can Store
-------------------
Draw from it the wet-winged  
production of its own production.  
Brutal holiday and the troubled heart  
silence at the walls of my house.  
Enjoy the many windy attempts to wet  
the sanguine depth.  
There is esoteric fortune in rustling it.  
The blazing springtimes flew halfway.  
And you abhorred in the agony and perfumed a striking havoc.  
But I should be untrue to computer science, condemning among its frail friendships  
so let us seek to speak a story devoid of neutral redundancies.  
Towards those echoes of yours that wait for me.
