The Camera Has Not Impaled The Promise
--------------------------------------
A transparent bird feather crystallizes. For drop was fragmented and morally positive.  
Only pale and to a  
father they  
take on time, twenty-seven years  
You blossom my rustling rooster  
like a naked pheasant to fresh apple.
