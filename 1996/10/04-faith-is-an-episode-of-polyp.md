Faith Is An Episode Of Polyp

And coats and mirrors.  
A fog of wreaths to the fresh color of the bolt of copper mosaic.  
In the smallest glass cork architecture to return lost forms and for fountains.  
Stalks of cattail was no longer above the recording threshold.  
Enjoy the many rambunctious attempts to perch  
the electric stench.  
There is cordial fortune in discovering it.  
Shut up and shut up like a smooth stone.  
I'd do  
it for the crown in which you entertain  
for the magnoliums of sunburst orange you've wetted.  
You are the dilute giant of a lobster,  
the clotting ness  
of the femininity, the power of the water.  
Light was no longer right at the recording threshold.  
The hidden bride  
transforms in the vertical morning.  
  
My heart moves from being forceful to being spacious.  
Distorted day and the frightened sphere  
hate at the walls of my house.  
  
Towards those farms of yours that wait for me.  
But I should be untrue to computer science, falling among its rigid clusters  
so let us try to tell a story without public redundancies.
