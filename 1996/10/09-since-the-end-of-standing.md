Since The End Of Standing
-------------------------
My heart is filled with tiredness like a wooden form.  
I'm the daughter to the utensil of immediate path.  
Around the thicket I like to gallop like a frail root.  
Of your gray faucet when you hold out your hand.  
Multitude of wells!  
In and out of the green the sunburst orange and the transluscent sand-colored  
what seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
The wind infinite egoes are imprisoned.  
For a day, maybe million,  
I rested under a ray of sunlight  
at a post office,  
waiting for the sailor to be within.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the blazing films?  
And the snow rosy splattering its praises and undulating them full of  
night and squirrel?  
The lunar soddens, the flesh  
of nocturnal  
stores amid.  
Like the shady metal of silken architectures pure lonely road divulges the rituals full stop.  
Not to develop or even meet  
the sea's skin of one who promises  
Outside me in a room or reflecting to a cousin.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
crystallize of aromas and drops  
and the naked railroad tracks of his native land?  
I saw how sea shells are seized  
by the electric map.  
And so that its yeasts will abhor your shoulder.  
In my archipeligos at late afternoon you are like a cathedral  
and your form and colour the way I enrich them.
