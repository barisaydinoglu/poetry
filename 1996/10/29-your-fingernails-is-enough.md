Your Fingernails Is Enough
--------------------------
Next to the coral of the room where you sleep,  
a dream shakes into synonyms. I was without doubt the god cat  
there in the fire-tipped sea.  
When it looked me with its dashing grape eyes  
it had neither ears nor eyelids  
but chalk tigers on its sides.  
How discovering is the charitable dominion and it's changeless felicities?  
  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the monastic roses?  
And the sunshine self-assured splattering its mirrors and ignoring them full of  
universe and cat?
