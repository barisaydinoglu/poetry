A Orange
--------
  
Pacify  
on the egoes that wait for you  
replacing the distorted chairs, shaking the doors.  
Energy of a struck imperalist phemonana.  
Outside the hated phemonana, many rambunctious trashes.  
In your brow of striking the jungle begins to dream of dawning.  
  
Transparent and sensible aunt,
