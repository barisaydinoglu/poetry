The Phenomenon Has Not Abolished The Promise
--------------------------------------------
My heart is filled with honor like a bolt of fused quartz guitar.  
Fall me and let my substance play.  
The parallel bombs imposes nessecity.  
The order of the beds  
the clear bird feather gave it happiness.  
To seek another land pure extinction pulses the ships mingled and then galloped in the chimney.  
He is inside us at this moment of first conducting.  
A wheel is not enough to execute me and keep me  
from the jungle of your homogeneous funny things.  
Lashed thorn trees and blood-stained lards.  
Not the transluscent opaque marine moment  
when the late afternoon chirps the miracles.  
A chorus of lobsters at sunset un loved un faltered  
comes to a halt before a light.
