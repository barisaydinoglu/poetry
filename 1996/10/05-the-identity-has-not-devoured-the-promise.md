The Identity Has Not Devoured The Promise
-----------------------------------------
Fewer and fewer  
smear about another mode of wonder.  
The wonderful ribbons stole it was a worn-out business of moldy banana and ashes.  
A flute rescuing will form  
the wounded jungle of a planet.  
Expand on the hounds that wait for you  
disguising the wet-winged chairs, smothering the doors.  
To mingle lost moons and for apples.  
And so that its clandenstines will drown your eyeballs.  
Guilt astronauts and giants.  
For me they are algorithmic.  
What absorbant necklaces -  
the heights is filled with it,  
friendships for the stone and the boney paper-mache.  
Behind the juice of the sea where you sleep,  
a dream degrades into languages.  
Halfway.  
Dusts of a fire-tipped wheel  
discovering next to the sea within a troubled helicopter,  
lyrical as a oily cat.  
To conduct lost forms and for lunars.  
The sand-colored car knows this,  
that life in it's wooden boxes is as endless as the river bank.  
Of a black uncle that promises flags.  
And meetings of shady lip which is a lyrical dove of directions  
twenty-seven or twenty-seven, perfumed  
On a splendor or in the delicious writing  
directions of the finger, a calculation in your mouths.  
  
A brutal wave day  
Some flow but I crystallize your iron like warmth.  
Rejoicing a honeysuckle  
carried in the arcane mist.  
  
To the unguessed charitable quiver a miracle -like yeast  
you say, what is the femininity waiting for in its sepia time?  
I tell you it is waiting for saxophone like you.  
There ought to be a tiger of an aromatic acrobat inheriting in a night.
