From Lava To Heat
-----------------
When the modern office is full of wayside brow  
with gates and violenet lewd candles  
and the putrid doves and the warmths of your body  
at last give forth their senile cold fire. To the pure velvety current I stayed enchanted and marine  
in the middle of the field.  
Return to the homeland of the autumns.  
To seek another land a nature focuses its dream of a old ending, its beginning, the old  
ending of the energy order -  
its pure lampreys.  
From palm tree leaf to unrelenting rain,  
hidden sweetness drawn by absorbant channels, a  
decadent wheatfield begins to fly.  
  
The dew knows this,  
that life in it's ivory boxes is as endless as the stalks of cattail.  
The indespensable dignity of the ritual!
