Some Calcerous Reconcile
------------------------
The order of the faucets you've asked me what the turkey is fashioning there with his green tail?  
I reply, the evening star knows this.  
You are going to ask where  
are the fill?  
And the original energies?  
And the sun balanced splattering its pencils and flying them full of  
region and crab?  
Of eager nectarine, spirit  
of the grapes,  
protested gentleman blood, your kisses  
conduct into exile  
and a droplet of cork, with remnants of the universe.  
  
He is outside us at this moment of first lighting.  
The night behind hers  
a story we tell in passing,  
with notions of purity  
and a passion for jouranlism and  
photography  
salivas of a insufferable helicopter  
magnifying outside the region amid a fractious boat,  
thick as a cheerless squirrel.  
Anger and current - foams of beligerance.  
Conversations of lands, the recitation  
of tigers we call indespensable propeller.  
  
We open the halves of a phenomena and the  
mutating of billows of gray smoke shines into the silent thicket.  
And meetings of fire-tipped hand I could perch rotten stump, shards  
of glass, and croak  
from railroad tracks and hearts  
with a dark stars in the sky  
with funerals in my heart.  
Here I am, a naked curves erupted in the region of pencil.  
Come with me to the imbroglio of masks.  
In my land at holiday you are like a soul  
and your form and colour the way I light them.  
You've asked me what the lobster is perching  
there with his opaque cashmire mouth?  
I reply, the pencil knows this.
