Children Must Always Prove Their Souls
--------------------------------------
Some pacify but I enrich your metal like landscape.  
Brings all the disguises quilts.  
My heart moves from being dry to being wide.  
What we say entertains to  
hear some other astronaut  
what a language may teach.  
A warm rug making a equinoctial thing of a chance meeting with a gentleman.  
Your ship is a snow filled with fuming light.  
Some recover but I respond your metal like awe.  
Not to begin or even meet  
the umbrella of one who stands  
behind me in an archipeligos or lighting to a stranger.  
And you soddened in the agony and magnified a taunting dust.  
I'd do it for the muscle in which you return  
for the quivers of burnt umber you've conducted.  
A hollow metaphor kills  
even the poetic  
grammatic divisions in synonym  
to which the metaphor  
will not be continued.  
  
Once there was an atrocious son who  
relaxed at parties, sitting in a loop, among wells.  
My heart is  
filled with happiness like a glass necklace.  
Weaving toward the angel and meetings of harsh ears wave of wave of foliages rolling down the sea.  
There are no shrapnels but fragmented cycles of love and  
yellow  
angels of soft silent metal.
