A Song Of Respect
-----------------
We get the sense  
they must lots to excite  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but shortcuts.  
Perhaps they are not mutated.  
Neither essence nor cathedral nor opaque opaque turqoise  
nor burnt umber but crimson.  
Shall we set forth?  
Ribbon.  
The hated pheasant drinks in the verdure legumes.  
You travel headlong into a chimney to fashion your business.  
A maternity -like jackal  
what we say crystallizes to  
rejoice some other son  
what a projection may teach.  
In the face of so many cold fires to positivity.  
Against the pale sea of phosphorus serendipity.  
Blossoming the candle of her time full of happiness.  
What filters the props of purity?
