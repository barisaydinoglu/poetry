People Of A Lashed Country
--------------------------
Love is gone, the subject has travelled.  
Wave of wave of shadess of sunburst orange rolling down the sea.  
I could live croak, lonely road, and bramble  
from warmths of your body and smooth stones  
with a red thread  
with conglomerates in my eye.  
What mysteries does the iguana contain?  
How little  
we blush and how much it builds the phenomena of this galaxy.  
In the smallest wooden laminated sign what delicate suns -  
the university is filled with it,  
poppies for the leaf and the cold fused quartz.  
The pullulation blushing from my finger.  
In my university at twilight you are like a springtime  
and your form and colour the way I magnify them.  
The I in movie sunburst  
orange pins of jackal,  
sepia seams above a lonely starlight.  
My heart is filled with love like a silicon atom.  
Has the heights been discovered with phenomena?
