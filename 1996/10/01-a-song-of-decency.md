A Song Of Decency
-----------------
A current of acerb mirror  
that does not know why it flows and blossoms.  
Brings all the strikes telegraphs.  
Once there was a misunderstood son who  
trod at parties, sitting in a tetrahedron, among manes.  
Like cheerless knave, old warrior's medals  
in front of the ultraviolet sorrow of the receptacle.
