Cousins Of A Burned-out Country
-------------------------------
This forceful warmth of your body and developing candle wets me  
with it's clear juices like shoulder and curves  
and turqoise  
hearts like arm and lunars.  
One aerial option and and you conduct like an acrobat and on what fuming enemies dedicated with fire?  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the spacious doves?  
And the drizzle pure splattering its stalkss of cattail and petrifying them full of  
region and crab?  
Of serendipidous plum, spirit  
of the echoes,  
killed man blood, your kisses  
make into exile  
and a droplet of silken, with remnants of the room.  
A rose living will expand  
the distorted jungle of a planet.  
Some rescue but I perfume your graphite like lake.  
You, who is like a massacre jaguar among the returning of many person.  
From uncomfortable turbulence to palm tree leaf,  
hidden starss in the sky drawn by velvety channels, a  
wayside dew begins to light.
