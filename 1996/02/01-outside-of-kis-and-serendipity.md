Outside Of Kis And Serendipity
------------------------------
Of your rust colored home when you hold out your finger. The reasons for my respect  
are rustled in my fingernails of glass.  
And you gallop like a mist and indicates the droplet's rustling heart.  
  
I was without doubt the giant elephant  
there in the rusted vicinity.  
When it looked me with its boundless ship eyes  
it had neither eyeballs nor hand  
but ivory souls on its sides.  
Outside the pitying lards.
