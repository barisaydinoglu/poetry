From What Are Essences Developed
--------------------------------
A curves and a hips  
beginning the field.  
Only sifted and to a  
sailor they take on time, thousand years  
Burnt umber phlegms of clandenstine,  
yellow seams above a browbeaten mane.  
I took on bitterest momenta.  
Disintered weather, tremulous lights like the muscle.  
Nothing but that quiver of kiss.  
  
What we say relaxes to  
weave some other child  
what a signal may teach.  
Your farm is a wave filled with wayside foliage.  
What smothers the props of happiness?  
Not to blush or even meet  
the landscape of one who carries  
behind me in a universe or playing to a god.
