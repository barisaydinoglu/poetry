Since The End
-------------
Chain me and let my substance rustle.  
Some connect but I chirp your aluminum like flower.  
You are the lemon of my boney breath.  
Nothing but that wheatfield of goblets.  
What curiosities does the ostrich contain?  
How little we entertain and how much it expands the epiphany of this computer simulation.  
I could love trash, abberation, and hound  
from ships and marine lakes  
with a rust colored vein  
with vortices in my toe.  
The coral crushes, the candle of secure  
connects within.  
Fewer and fewer  
overflow about another mode of pride.  
Multitude of evening stars!  
In and out of the marine the blue and the transparent  
in my region at morning you are like a old warrior's medal  
and your form and colour the way I rustle them.  
Enjoy the many phosphorus attempts to light  
the perfect vagina.  
There is steady fortune in fashioning it.  
Like crooked mist, laws  
drinking the bottle of her  
drop full of respect.  
  
Fly on the funerals that wait for you  
ignoring the negligent chairs, smearing the doors.  
In my region at late afternoon you are like a tiger  
and your form and colour the way I form them.  
Like lethargic grape, flowers  
an odor has preserved behind the serendipity,  
a mixture of heart and body, a blushing  
horse that brings beligerance.
