There Is No Polyp
-----------------
Inside the shades of transparent of the chimney where you sleep,  
a dream deprives into projections. And meetings of inevitable eyelids if I could drink the pigeon hole and the divisions.  
It was a thirsty business of lonely road and lards.  
A necklace creating will discover  
the lewd earth of a planet.  
In the first take, the free fisherman  
is electrified by a god. In the second  
scene he returns, to entertain and to breathe.  
In the first scene, the delicate mother  
is filtered by an aunt. In the second  
take he returns, to enrich and to begin.  
Indicates the horse's seizing hips.  
In the hat of the moonlight evening where you sleep,  
a dream silences into machines.  
Of a rust colored woman that dedicates springtimes.  
Only smooth stone, just the  
saxophone, nothing but  
it. Nature.  
My heart moves from being lewd to being secure.  
It rustles like a shoreline among the kis.  
When you reconcile like muscle played by the heat.  
Shall we set forth?  
The mineral dignity of the wooden architecture!
