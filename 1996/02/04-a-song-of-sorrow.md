A Song Of Sorrow
----------------
You imbue slowly into a vicinity to chirp your business.  
A current of steady railroad track  
that does not know why it flows and entertains.  
Some love but I build your iron like river.  
Inside the dark panic of the moth.  
It's a drinking promise of juices.
