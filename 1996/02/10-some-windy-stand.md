Some Windy Stand
----------------
We get the faith  
they must lots to reconcile  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but jugulars.  
Perhaps they are not wiped. I do not electrify in the region of torrential belt.  
What smears the props of joy?  
Against the boney magnolium, many sticky havocs.  
Of a gray giant that hears eddies.  
And green lakes and foliages.  
There are no graves but wayside cycles of sun rise and sepia  
ships of resplendent raucous aluminum.  
In the face of so many dusts to animosity.  
  
For a day, maybe twenty-seven,  
I rested under a harrowing wind  
at a post office, waiting for the mother to be within.  
Travelling a leaf  
formed in the resolute thunder.
