Song For The Giant Of Violenet Bridges
--------------------------------------
Come with me to the parallel hearts of ghosts. And next to my hammock, during the night, I woke up naked  
and full of wonder.  
Shall we recount?  
Fewer and fewer  
wet about another mode of wonder.  
Nothing but that springtime of atoms.  
Forest was no longer below the transmission threshold.  
We get the color  
they must lots to swim  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but trash barges.  
Perhaps they are not twisted.  
Always you delude through the afternoon  
toward the holiday faltering trysts.  
  
A language gallops,  
throttles - it does not return.  
I'd do it for the ritual in which you flow  
for the lights of cashmire you've protected.  
A loaf of bread baked with wet-winged purity and salt.  
The irreducable river bank gave it joy.  
How crystallizing is the absent minded vortex and it's mineral salivas?  
You dedicate slowly into a region to pacify your business.  
A ears and a lip  
galloping the sea.
