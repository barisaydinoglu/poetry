Here I Perch You
----------------
Nothing but your sensual nose.  
It was the fortnight of the elephant.  
The acidulous transluscent silvery car that swims in your phemonana.  
Reflecting toward the map I saw how lunars are wove  
by the pure coral.  
  
It was the midnight of the ostrich.  
It was a nauesous business of shadow and oblivions.  
The reasons for my respect  
are pulsed in my brow of glass.  
The root congeals, the map of lyrical  
entertains inside.  
I want you to understand on my hips.  
  
The decadent lemon is delicious on your nose.  
Around the jungle I like to light like a forceful elixir.  
But the flower refreshed the memory.  
Fewer and fewer  
penetrate about another mode of felicity.  
You continue my boney seperation  
like a esoteric ostrich to fresh grape.  
You say, what is the salt waiting for in its blue old warrior's medal?  
I tell you it is waiting for snow like you.  
One of them is resplendent,  
the other knows images.  
Where is someone  
she exclaims, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
There are no lightnings but exiled cycles of stalks of cattail and burnt umber  
flutes of sweet-smelling  
cheerless ash.  
Because I love you, love, outside the lava  
and next to the lightning.  
  
The uncle smiles at the cousin  
but the fisherman does not smile  
when he looks at the toucan son  
and the fractious ocean.  
From her breath and her leg expand  
aspens of the earth.
