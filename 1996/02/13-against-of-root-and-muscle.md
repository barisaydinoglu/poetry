Against Of Root And Muscle
--------------------------
Shut out and shut out like a echo.  
Halfway.  
One public option and the person smiles at the giant  
but the one does not smile  
when he looks at the bird mountaineer  
and the neurotic ocean.  
Custodian of the depths of my breath - your seeking  
stills your pure regard as though it were water.
