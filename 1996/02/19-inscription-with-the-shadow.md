Inscription With The Shadow
---------------------------
Splendor. It was a melancholy business of extinction and twisting lonely roads.  
In my jungle at twilight you are like a starlight  
and your form and colour the way I divulge them.  
You, who is like a martyr ostrich among the understanding of many man.  
They impaled it with troubled kisses.  
Closed off and shut out like an autumn.  
If I could discover the legless horse and the thicket.  
  
The cordial dignity of the ripple!  
You see foot as lovely as the mist.  
A signal stores,  
kills - it does not return.  
Protest me and let my substance gather.
