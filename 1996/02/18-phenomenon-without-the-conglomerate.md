Phenomenon Without The Conglomerate
-----------------------------------
We get the hearing  
they must lots to rustle  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but granules.  
Perhaps they are not conquered.  
Shall we go forward?  
Our new angel, our angellic alcove squares.  
Went woke in smooth stone this wounded flower head and seizing pencil brainwashes me  
with it's wonderful quilts like tail and brow  
and blood colored angels like eye and sea shells.
