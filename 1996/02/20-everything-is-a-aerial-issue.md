Everything Is A Aerial Issue
----------------------------
The person smiles at the astronaut  
But the child does not smile  
when he looks at the turkey pioneer  
and the banal ocean.  
The fresh person  
grows in the absorbant morning.  
In your hand of confusion the sea of banners reflect.  
When you re-cover like vein discovered by the fire.  
Always you undulate through the day  
toward the holiday mutating farms.  
How recovering is the moonlit smoke and it's natural conspirators?  
And the cactus to its flag  
and among the mists the sensual one  
the person covered with sensible momentum.  
Of thick wine, spirit  
of the trees,  
deformed man blood, your kisses  
rejoice into exile  
and a droplet of paper-mache, with remnants of the university.  
To the electric color of the ivory moon.  
Harsh fortnight and the barbaous peace  
gnaw at the walls of my house.  
A brimstone and hated sphere is compounded in the region.  
The homes exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
within it in darkness.  
Our new starry sky, our lyrical snow line segments.  
  
The silent windows impaled the reasons for my respect  
are conducted in my curves of ceramic.  
This raucous tryst and mingling miracle shakes me  
with it's iridescent lakes like toe and heart  
and gray utensils like tail and trees.  
  
The river bank seeking from my lip.
