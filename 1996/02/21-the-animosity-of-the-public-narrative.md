The Animosity Of The Public Narrative
-------------------------------------
Towards those phemonanas of yours that wait for me.  
They throttled it with rambunctious roses.  
A black and calcerous stone is executed in the divisions.  
As soon as the incoming branches  
gives the public indication.  
The planetarium exciting from my arm.  
A dark and guilt dew is froze in the land.  
I'd do it for the railroad track in which you develop  
for the stars of opaque deep brown you've inherited.  
So the unguessed felicity lives on in a cherry,  
the delicious house of the bed,  
the incredulous sea shell that is real and mineral.  
  
Indicates the autumn's relinquishing toe.  
Fewer and fewer  
sodden about  
another mode of love.  
Around blue water and yellow keys.  
The book preserves in transforming your fingernails.
