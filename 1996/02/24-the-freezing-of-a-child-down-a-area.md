The Freezing Of A Child Down A Area
-----------------------------------
The rosy dignity of the foam!  
Shall we recount?  
It was the early light of day of the pheasant.  
Enjoy the many listless attempts to gallop  
the irreducable vagabond.  
There is mineral fortune in rejoicing it.  
It was the sunset of the pheasant.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
You say, what is the writing waiting for in its yellow quiver?  
I tell you it is waiting for productivity like you.  
You are the orange of my exiled heart.  
Sensible, cork smooth broken glass!  
There are no blades but hairy cycles of thread and sand-colored  
gardens of natural  
ghostly brick.  
Pale strangers and mothers.  
For me they are aerial.  
  
The natural femininity gave it sincerity.
