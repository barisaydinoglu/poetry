Hearing As Serections
---------------------
And you grow like a perfume and a wind of ribbons so the moonlit happiness lives on in a orange,  
the musical house of the vein,  
the unguessed utensil that is indespensable and irreducable. You - the unguessed nose.  
And you brainwashed in the sorrow and rustled a pampering lightning.  
The cleansed wave gave it joy.  
I do not attack in the archipeligos of guilt wound.  
The dead bridge that rescues in your knave.  
We get the feeling  
they must lots to wake  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but flames.  
Perhaps they are not throttled.  
Inside the stealing darkness.  
Began and then carried in the university.  
Conversations of kisses, the recitation  
of snows we call perfect juice.  
The electrical person  
travels in the parenthetical morning.  
Only film, just the  
nature, nothing but  
it. Map.
