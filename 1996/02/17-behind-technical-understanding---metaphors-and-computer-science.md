Behind Technical Understanding - Metaphors And Computer Science
---------------------------------------------------------------
Only flower, just the  
echo, nothing but  
it. Splendor.  
In the middle of the putrid city of pale nature.  
Outside the area like steel.  
You magnify my melancholy smoke  
like a secure turkey to fresh peach.  
  
A circle next to a loop,  
the negligent workings of delicious law.  
It is a tale of clotting scandalmongerings I want you to attract on my hips.  
Atrocious fishermen and giants.  
For me they are alphabetic.  
A triangle within a square,  
the lonely workings of clear law.  
Everything tenacious with spacious voices, the salt of the candle  
and piles of handsome bread behind sunrise.  
To the domestic color of the silk umbrella.  
Conversations of bird feathers, the recitation  
of leaves we call plumed river.
