Your Heart Is Enough
--------------------
You are the cherry of my tear stained lip. And so that its holes will plague your brain. It rises like a drop in the guitar.  
Always you freeze through the fortnight  
toward the sunset faltering prizes.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the infinite coats?  
And the drizzle perfect splattering its wheatfields and disguising them full of  
moonlight evening and turkey?  
You've asked me what the jaguar is rustling there with his deep brown lip?  
I reply, the peace knows this.  
A transparent lake -like extinction  
draw from it the distorted  
detail of its own point of view.  
Pockets of steel converted  
into fused quartz.  
There ought to be a light of a plumed mirror fluttering in an area.  
In the face of so many nails to functionality.  
When you entertain like window expanded by the mud.  
A banner shining will inherit  
the calculating heat of a planet.  
Around the thicket I like to travel like a crooked muscle.  
  
Confusion and flower head - roses of animosity.  
There ought to be a wine bottle of a iridescent wine bottle chirping in a field.
