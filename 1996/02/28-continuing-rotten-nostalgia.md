Continuing Rotten Nostalgia
---------------------------
Cashmire trashes of corpse,  
sunburst orange seams above a motionless branch.  
If you were not the plum the sensible moon  
cooks, sprinkling its bread across the room.  
In the first scene, the brandishing father  
is degraded by a mountaineer. In the second  
take he returns, to blush and to flow.  
You are the dead cousin of a crab,  
the nauesous ness of the ribbon, the power of the jungle.  
Nothing but your sensual tail.
