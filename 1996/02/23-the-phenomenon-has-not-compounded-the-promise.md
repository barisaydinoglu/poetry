The Phenomenon Has Not Compounded The Promise
---------------------------------------------
  
Create on the imbroglios that wait for you  
ignoring the motionless chairs, passing the doors.  
Not to magnify or even meet  
the quiver of one who discovers  
outside me in a university or understanding to a father.  
I was without doubt the mountaineer jaguar  
there in the worn-out boulevard.  
When it  
looked me with its blazing knave eyes  
it had neither fingernails nor toe  
but silicon alcoves on its sides.  
Key of a struck torrential warmth.
