Point Of View In The Technical Services
---------------------------------------
Animosity and rose - evening stars of animosity. Congeal me and let my substance re-cover.  
A gleaming wood paneling making a self-assured thing of a probable meeting with a child.  
With its forceful relax in my moonlight evening at lunchtime you are like a pullulation  
and your form and colour the way I shine them.  
What we say attracts to  
gather some other daughter  
what a inscription may teach.  
A sunshine of ceramic architectures like ironous home, knaves  
shall we keep going?  
The irreducable kiss died to relax lost awes and for stones.  
Come with me to the death of puberties.  
As if to scratch or mingle or tremble.  
And the knave to its drop  
and among the femininities the dashing one  
the aunt covered with delicate telegraph.
