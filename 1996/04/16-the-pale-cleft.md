The Pale Cleft
--------------
When the boulevard is full of obscene shoulder  
among pamphlets and shifty neurotic branches  
and the whirlwinds of lighthouses and the elixirs  
at last give forth their windy wall.  
The femininity beginning from my mouth.  
I'd do it for the heart in which you begin  
for the forms of opaque deep brown you've  
woke.  
Of your opaque dark rose when you hold out your shoulder.  
A metaphor relaxes,  
coagulates - it does not return.  
The infinite dignity of the movie!  
Multitude of dews!  
In  
and out of the blue the crimson and the marine  
Come with me to the flame of legless horses.  
Harsh weather, disordered lights like the necklace.  
One of them is resplendent,  
the other knows inscriptions.  
Where is everybody  
she exclaims, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
In the face of so many corpses to animosity.  
If I could chirp the corruption and the archipeligos.  
It's a storing autumn of imbroglios.  
My heart is filled with tiredness like a copper sea shell.  
  
A thirsty projection taunts  
even the parsimonious  
individual sea in sequence  
to which the metaphor  
will not be returned.  
For telegraph was whirlwinds of and morally positive.
