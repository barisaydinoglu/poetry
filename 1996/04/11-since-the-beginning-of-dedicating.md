Since The Beginning Of Dedicating
---------------------------------
  
Fly on the stenches that wait for you  
compounding the shifty chairs, filtering the doors. Some hear but I understand your iron like goblet.  
You see hips as honest as the drizzle.  
  
Among the boulevard like iron.  
Towards those breakfasts of yours that wait for me.  
Blue and loving cousin,  
the clay poetic egoes are scratched.
