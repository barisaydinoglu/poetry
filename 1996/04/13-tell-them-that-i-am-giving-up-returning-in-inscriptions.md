Tell Them That I Am Giving Up Returning In Inscriptions
-------------------------------------------------------
My heart moves from being acidulous to being homogeneous.  
What crushes the props of honor?  
Awakened and then performed  
in the city.  
In the smallest copper angel sunburst orange  
graves of billow of brimstone smoke,  
sunburst orange seams above a morose umbrella.  
Neither horse nor flute nor turqoise  
nor sand-colored but crimson.  
Fewer and fewer  
pamper about another mode of purity.  
A loaf of bread baked with sordid pride and salt.  
Realized infinite sea's skin when the room is full of fragmented curves  
with holes and worn-out neurotic fountains  
and the calcerous rituals and the aspens  
at last give forth their weak evil. I was without doubt the giant pheasant  
there in the callous area.  
When it looked me with its absorbant promise eyes  
it had neither curves nor finger  
but wooden flags on its sides.
