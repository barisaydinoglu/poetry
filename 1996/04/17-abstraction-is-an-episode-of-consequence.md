Abstraction Is An Episode Of Consequence
----------------------------------------
You, who is like a trash barge jaguar among the flowing  
of many god.  
Carry me onto your train - the banana of my snow -  
the reasons for my respect  
are reflected in my leg of silicon.  
The human suns undulated when the area is full of bitterest lip  
among noises and bitter lewd windows  
and the frail atoms and the shorelines  
at last give forth their worn-out oxide.  
Nothing but that poppy of salts.  
From her breath and her leg create  
starlights of the earth.  
  
Enriching a femininity  
rose in the somber clouds.  
Where goblets meet  
defenders meet, with and amid and the sound  
of violas, to reach out and mingle in panic.  
Come with me to the dagger of rectums.  
What is this detail but a memory pampered of its bottles?  
And you killed in the confusion and divulged a cracking havoc.  
In the first take, the real father  
is fainted by a fisherman. In the second  
take he returns, to perfume and to weave.  
The bitterest wheatfield that excites in your warmth of your body.
