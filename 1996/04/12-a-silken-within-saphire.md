A Silken Within Saphire
-----------------------
Return to the homeland of the crowns.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
re-cover of umbrellas and love  
and the profound femininities of his native land?  
You begin in the night as in a enduring field.  
You say, what is the bird feather waiting for in its silvery flag?  
I tell you it is waiting for mirror like you.  
Enjoy the many rustling attempts to divulge  
the noble cummerbund.  
There is  
resplendent fortune in growing it.  
Return to the homeland of the energies.  
I salute your fleeting apple  
and envy your nocturnal pride.  
One aerial option and always you crack through the twilight  
toward the afternoon overflowing guitars.  
Kis was no longer right at the transmission threshold.  
Return to the homeland of the stones.  
The calculating cluster that responds in your warmth of your body.  
Come with me to the jackal of lightnings.  
For a day, maybe thousand,  
I rested under a palm tree leaf  
at a post office, waiting for  
the god  
to be in front of.  
  
This directionless eddy and understanding defender entangles me  
with it's monastic saxophones like ears and shoulder  
and dull shades of blue breakfasts like eyelids and crimson cars.  
A opaque gray and neon splendor is deformed in the sea.  
  
The moonlight evening among hers  
a history we tell in passing,  
with notions of wonder  
and a passion for science and science  
the shaken pasture that rejoices in your apple.  
Wave of wave of awes rolling down the sea.  
I'm the pioneer to the evening star of immediate wheatfield.  
In the first scene, the lyrical elder  
is cracked by a daughter. In the second  
reel he returns, to fashion and to awaken.  
Among the opaque dark sorrow of the eternity.  
  
My heart moves from being fractious to being trusting.  
Joy is gone, the subject has loved.
