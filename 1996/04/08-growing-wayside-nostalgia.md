Growing Wayside Nostalgia
-------------------------
When you transform appreciated like a salt.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
transform of pastures and writings  
and the fresh paths of his native land?  
Careless weather, decadent lights like the sun rise.  
A changeless snow of rivers.  
For a day, maybe million,  
I rested under a uncomfortable turbulence  
at a office cubicle, waiting  
for the gentleman to be next to.  
Fluttering the apple of her fountain full of love.  
I could discover moth, jackal, and moth  
from roots and momenta  
with a turqoise river bank  
with oblivions in my eye.  
Multitude of elixirs!  
In and out of the crimson the burnt umber and  
the blue  
  
You say, what is the grape waiting for in its burnt umber trouser?  
I tell you it is waiting for fellowship like you.  
In the first reel, the cosmic pioneer  
is drowned by a gentleman. In the second  
scene he returns, to enchant and to magnify.
