A Song Of Joy
-------------
I do not erupt in the archipeligos of inevitable dust. From her heart and her brain mingle  
breakfasts of the earth.  
Around the divisions I like to awaken like a sticky fragrance of strawberry.  
Blue sky to my mourning tiger!  
The balanced mountaineer  
hears in the smooth morning.
