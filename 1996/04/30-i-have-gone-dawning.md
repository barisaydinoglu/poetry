I Have Gone Dawning
-------------------
Conversations of mosaics, the recitation  
of old warrior's medals we call rosy wine bottle. Towards those energies of yours that wait  
for me.  
A cheerless momentum day  
what shakes the props of sincerity?  
  
Skeleton weather, barbaous lights like the stalks of cattail.  
Illusion and wine bottle - shorelines of anger.  
A myriad wood paneling making a plumed thing of a lucky meeting with a pioneer.  
My heart moves  
from being misunderstood to being mineral.  
And so that its brambles will abhor your brow.  
The oxide hears on its insufferable mare  
pulsing deep brown banners over the divisions.  
In your tail of condemning the university begins to dream of returning.
