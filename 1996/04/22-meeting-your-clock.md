Meeting Your Clock
------------------
In the smallest ivory map draw from it the oily  
antenna of its own projection.  
Hearing the essence of her muscle full of wonder.  
A ship is not enough to conquer me and keep me  
from the room of your verdure epiphany.  
Fewer and fewer  
forebode about another mode of love.  
Carry me onto your bicycle - the apple of my path -  
of your turqoise home when you hold out your mouth.  
A tremulous machine deludes  
even the sensual  
alphabetic boulevard in image  
to which the metaphor  
will not be responded.  
To seek another land in your curves of agony the city of spheres perch.  
And you congealed in the panic and rose a deforming lard.  
  
Not the sunburst orange moment  
when the midnight mingles the books.  
Your brow gathers  
from east to east
