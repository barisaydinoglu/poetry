Sense As Wastelands
-------------------
There are many deaths outside disordered events.  
Not to live or even meet  
the serenity of one who promises  
against me in a region or exciting to a pioneer.  
Under the lashed city of violenet moon. If I could pulse the legless horse and the sea.  
Of a dark one that understands blue lakes.  
I salute your aquatic apple  
and envy your esoteric pride.  
Wetting the school of her vein full of love.  
Towards those mirrors of yours that wait for me.  
Showering a jar  
drank in the cosmic sun.  
There are no martyrs but explosive cycles of ritual and blue  
manes of iridescent exiled graphite.
