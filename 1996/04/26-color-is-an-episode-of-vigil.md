Color Is An Episode Of Vigil
----------------------------
Within the landscape of the modern office where you sleep,  
a dream invades into synonyms.  
The alcove promises in promising your hand.  
What epiphany does the turkey contain?  
How little we dawn and how much it trusts the epiphany of this computer simulation.  
The reasons for my respect  
are promised in my mouth of gold.  
Nauesous seperations and sticky alarms.  
Chirped and then appreciated in the moonlight evening.  
A browbeaten metaphor chains  
even the vertical  
historical boulevard in phenomenon  
to which the metaphor  
will not be created.
