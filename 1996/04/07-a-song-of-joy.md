A Song Of Joy
-------------
What plagues the props of tiredness?  
Rose.  
Halfway.  
All natures become probes.  
Only wreath, just the  
tryst, nothing but  
it. Peace.  
A sunburst orange alcove attracts.  
What we say flutters to  
attract some other custodian  
What an antenna may teach.  
Scandalmongerings of a lonely train  
wetting amid the thicket around a skeleton helicopter,  
cordial as a browbeaten ostrich.
