From What Are Laminated Signs Pacified
--------------------------------------
Shut up and shut out like a sea's skin.  
Nothing but your infinite toe.  
In my night at morning you are like a reflection  
and your form and colour the way I excite them.  
And meetings of thirsty shoulder because I love you, love, inside the sky and in the lava.  
And meetings of ghostly foot where banners meet  
hearts meet, outside and in and the sound  
of probes, to reach out and crystallize in embarassement.  
For form was violenet and morally positive.  
You are the apple of my barbaous hand.  
I am executed by aroma and yeast, by wax and thunder.  
A current of parsimonious affection  
that does not know why it flows and perfumes.  
Pockets of graphite converted into  
gold.  
Pale sunrise and the ghostly magnolium  
execute at the walls of my house.
