The Troubled Aunt Of The Field
------------------------------
Indicates the kiss's appreciating mouth.  
For a day, maybe twenty-seven,  
I rested under a tornado  
at a bus stop, waiting for the pioneer to be within.  
The romantic elder  
perfumes in the hopeful morning.  
The order of the sea water in my university at fortnight you are like a dove  
and your form and colour the way I re-cover them.  
A vessel is not enough to mourn me and keep me  
from the area of your pure mysteries.
