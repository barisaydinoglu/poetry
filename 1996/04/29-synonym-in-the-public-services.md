Landscape. The sweetness  
exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
within it in darkness. As if to shatter or dawn or crack.  
A loaf of bread baked with insufferable decency and salt.  
A lake -like havoc  
closed off and pulled out like a planetarium.  
To the arcane myriad cluster like hounds dismantling around telegraphs.
