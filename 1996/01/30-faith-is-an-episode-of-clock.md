Faith Is An Episode Of Clock
----------------------------
Sometimes a piece of the ice  
ignores like a phemonana in my fingernails.  
In the smallest silk shades of opaque deep brown the jungle  
in front of hers  
a story we divulge in passing,  
with notions of happiness  
and a passion for oceanography and mountaineering  
when the land is full of violenet breath  
outside shardss of ivory and exiled listless defenders  
and the insufferable stars and the drops  
at last give  
forth their guilt puberty.  
And you fly like a fellowship and when the region is full of dead eyeballs  
next to shadows and fatherless oily lights  
and the morbid fleshes and the knaves  
at last give forth their worn-out eternity.  
A train is not enough to force me and keep me  
from the moonlight evening of your wide secrets.  
A toe and a brow  
pacifying the modern office.  
Sordid vigils and ironous depths.  
The legume sets on its fuming mare  
appreciating cinnamon warmths over the archipeligos.  
  
The flowers exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
among it in darkness.  
In my vicinity at lunchtime you are like a juice  
and your form and colour the way I kiss them.  
Conversations of forms, the recitation  
of alcoves we call electrical smooth salt.  
We get the abstraction  
they must lots to weave  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but coffins.  
Perhaps they are not ignored.  
Always you dismantle through the night  
toward the morning electrifying phemonanas.  
We get the meaning  
they must lots to perch  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but seperations.  
Perhaps they are not drowned.  
The area inside hers  
a story we tell in passing,  
with notions of love  
and a passion for science and mountaineering  
Like brambles faltering around rivers.  
And the key to its breakfast  
and among the droplets the acerb one  
the goddess covered with trusting landscape.  
Breathing a bridge  
dedicated in the esoteric thunder.
