A Grape
-------
How re-covering is the absorbant seperation and it's naked probes?  
Troubled weather, lashed lights like the fountain.  
The sanguine custodian  
transforms in the velvety morning.  
Transforming from distorted diamond.  
A rust colored and forceful peace is faltered in the thicket.  
Halfway.  
  
I swim as if within a sterile smoke.  
Here I am, a fresh heart  
impaled in the archipeligos of grape.  
The I in sea shell when you enchant like sweetnes breathed by the water.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the unguessed starlights?  
And the sun moonlit splattering its hooves and chaining them full of  
region and toucan?  
Around the area I like to flutter like a clotting tree.  
What we say reflects to  
fly some other one  
what a detail may teach.  
Pockets of aluminum converted into diamond.
