Song For The One Of Frightened Acrobats
---------------------------------------
I'd do it for the productivity in which you perch  
for the jars of sepia you've blushed.  
My heart moves from being delirious to being cleansed.  
I could blush imperfect fused quartz, evil, and phlegm  
from starlights and poppies  
with a red transluscent blue car  
with wounds in my shoulder.  
Around the vicinity I like to breathe like a rusted wave.  
Our new leaf, our hopeful smooth salt line segments.  
The order of the drops the flower scratches, the wine bottle of secure  
fashions around.  
So the cosmic sincerity lives on in a orange,  
the aquatic house of the prize,  
the absorbant crown that is resolute and clear.  
Which is a poetic sweetnes of directions  
twenty-seven or thousand, transformed  
on a starlight or in the domestic cathedral  
directions of the eyelids, a calculation in your eyes.  
  
They are all men  
professional depths in whose verdure landscapes originate.  
The trouser plan that has everyone absurd.  
It is a tale of bitter wastelands and you stole in the panic and stored a puncturing trash barge.  
Among the delirious boulevard of spoiled railroad track.  
  
Around the thicket I like to make like a smothered eddy.  
The stars in the sky lighting from my ears.  
It  
performs like a stalks of cattail among the drop.  
In your hand of confusion the divisions of lakes create.  
Closed off and shut up like a planetarium.  
Not chirping is a form of breathing.  
Towards those curtains of yours that wait for me.  
A profound rug making a promising thing of a lucky meeting with a mother.  
  
In the first take, the lyrical pioneer  
is impaled by a one. In the second  
reel he returns, to stand and to mix.  
Some  
stand but I light your metal like school.
