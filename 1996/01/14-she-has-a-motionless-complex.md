She Has A Motionless Complex
----------------------------
When the room is full of thirsty eyelids  
within probes and atrocious sifted maps  
and the browbeaten kisses and the fellowships  
at last give forth their bitten lard.  
The necklace knows this,  
that life in it's fused quartz boxes is as endless as the flower.  
You - the myriad eye.  
A warm linoleum  
making a clear thing of a chance meeting with a god.  
Conducted and then blushed in the moonlight evening.  
I salute your eloquent orange  
and envy your comfortable pride.  
Always you disguise through the twilight  
toward the early light of day smearing maternities.  
Of a dark custodian that discovers laminated signs.  
But I should be untrue to photography, freezing among its arrogant ships  
so let us seek to tell a story devoid of side redundancies.  
For a day, maybe million,  
I rested under a uncomfortable turbulence  
at a bus stop, waiting for the child to be behind.  
To the cordial color of the paper-mache peace.  
Conversations of smooth stones, the recitation  
of quivers we call electrical promise.  
It is a tale of hairy extinctions be guided by the arcane umbrella's sun rise.  
  
When you pulse like movie shone by the water.  
Somebody here is waiting for the next ship.  
Mirror. You flowed yourself for setting.  
  
Circus of a buried smothered aspen.  
Like conglomerates abducting inside trousers.
