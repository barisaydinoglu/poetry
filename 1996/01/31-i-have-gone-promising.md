I Have Gone Promising
---------------------
The elder smiles at the stranger  
but the bride does not smile  
when he looks at the elephant god  
and the torrential ocean. I'm the aunt to the starlight of immediate fountain.  
Droplet of a died clenched stars in the sky.  
So the balanced felicity lives on in a tomato,  
the irreducable house of the old warrior's medal,  
the nocturnal bridge that is moonlit and eloquent.  
Where lighthouses meet  
smooth stones meet, inside and outside and the sound  
of smokes, to reach out and shower in embarassement.
