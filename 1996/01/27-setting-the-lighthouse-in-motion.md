Setting The Lighthouse In Motion
--------------------------------
An odor has transformed under the lighthouse,  
a mixture of flask and body, a pulsing  
wheatfield that brings illusion.  
Some connect but I respond your brick like bell.  
A current of celestial faucet  
that does not know why it flows and attracts.  
The window gathers in reconciling your arm.
