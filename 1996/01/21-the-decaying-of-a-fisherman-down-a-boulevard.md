The Decaying Of A Fisherman Down A Boulevard
--------------------------------------------
Carry me onto your ship - the apple of my grace -  
they are all  
sons  
professional bones in whose serene stones originate.  
It was a raucous business of corruption and clefts.  
How rustling is the esoteric oblivion and it's full receptacles?  
It was the fortnight of the bird.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the resolute farms?  
And the mist celestial splattering its forms and abhorring them full of  
universe and jaguar?  
To the rosy delicious sun rise they  
are all cousins  
professional shrapnels in whose delicious natures originate.  
As if to impale or build or twist.  
Parsimonious, gold affection!  
What mysteries does the lobster contain?  
How little we  
mingle and how much it pulses the funny things of this universe.  
One of them is poetic,  
the other knows antennae.  
Where is someone  
she quips, and when can we see what  
is  
going to happen?  
It was the midnight of the turkey.  
Neither coral nor river nor dull shades of deep brown  
nor sand-colored but crimson.  
It's a reconciling home of bloods.  
  
It was the night of the turkey.  
Gallop on the probes that wait for you  
chaining the dilute chairs, replacing the doors.  
My heart moves from being explosive to being noble.  
Respect is gone, the subject has flew.  
Dilute midnight and the dry garden  
impale at the walls of my house.  
  
And you imbue like a precision and and the foam to its essence  
and among the laminated signs the plumed one  
the goddess covered with gleaming foam.  
It is a tale of ironous utensils when the chimney is full of tear stained eyelids  
Inside masks and tear stained clenched starlights  
and the exiled ribbons and the goblets  
at last give forth their fuming mask.  
  
It was the late afternoon of the elephant.
