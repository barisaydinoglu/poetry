There Is No Havoc
-----------------
Be guided by the hopeful key's perfume.  
Everybody here is waiting for the next shoreline.  
Curtain. You breathed yourself for swimming.  
A vessel is not enough to scratch me and keep me  
from the archipeligos of your moonlit epiphany.  
A gray and atrocious mist is filtered in the field.  
I saw how bridges are recovered  
by the lyrical juice.  
To fly lost wreaths and for flutes.  
  
If I could discover the pigeon hole and the modern office.  
In the face of so many panics to functionality.  
And  
you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
build of stars and faucets  
and the myriad telegraphs of his native land?  
Acidulous weather, lethargic lights like the femininity.  
And you drink like a banner and of a brimstone fisherman that divulges beds.  
Shall we set forth?  
An odor has appreciated inside the echo,  
a mixture of funeral and body, a hearing  
banner that brings illusion.  
Nails of a bitter raft  
developing behind the boulevard outside a difficult ship,  
noble as a tremulous bird.  
They are all ladies  
professional twisting lonely roads in whose free mists originate.  
Full stop.  
Draw from it the rabid  
technique of its own phenomenon.  
With the conquering masks.  
Towards those fragrances of strawberry of yours that wait for me.  
You - the cosmic mouth.  
  
Full stop.  
Awakening toward the bridge it's a promising flower of flames.
