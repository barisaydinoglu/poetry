Tremulous Foliage
-----------------
Nothing but your velvety ears.  
From uncomfortable turbulence to harrowing wind,  
hidden sea's skins drawn by moonlit channels, a  
bitter shades of yellow begins to blush.  
Shall we go forward?  
The order of the sea water you see eyeballs as delicate  
as the wind.  
I stayed mixed and sand-colored  
among the universe.  
The order of the windows full stop.  
  
But the love shone the memory.  
Return to the homeland of the stones.
