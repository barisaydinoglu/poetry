Slightest Details Are All Next To Us
------------------------------------
Only brutal and to a  
elder they take on time, three hundred years  
you gather headlong into a night to dedicate your business.  
What phenomena does the lobster contain?  
How little we hear and how much it wets the funny things of this universe.  
Behind the absurd moonlight evening of furious curtain.  
The lighthouse re-covering from my leg.  
In the smallest ceramic necklace when you protect conducted like a writing.  
Like the neon rusted nail of promises you relinquish in the sea as in a delicious city.  
And a hated curtain's fire will flutter you.  
Conversations  
of homes, the recitation  
of coats we call steady sea water.  
  
A detail grows,  
imprisons - it does not return.
