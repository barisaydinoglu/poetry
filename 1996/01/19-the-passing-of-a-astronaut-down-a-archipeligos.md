The Passing Of A Astronaut Down A Archipeligos
----------------------------------------------
There ought to be a old warrior's medal of a gleaming springtime blossoming in a thicket.  
From pillow of fog to uncomfortable turbulence,  
hidden praises drawn by loving channels, a  
disintered stone begins to carry.  
Enjoy the many barbaous attempts to continue  
the naked wounded soldier.  
There is sensual fortune in crystallizing it.  
Where planetariums meet  
ribbons meet, next to and among and the sound  
of jackals, to reach out and preserve in animosity.  
  
You see hips as spacious as the wind.  
And the stars in the sky to its cluster  
and among the muscles the friendly one  
the pioneer covered with handsome candle.  
With its mourning rejoice behind crimson water and sunburst orange doves.  
Your farm is a praise filled with shifty railroad track.  
If you were not the bread the acerb moon  
cooks, sprinkling its sugar across the room.  
The rustling sea shell that responds in your sun.  
Return to the homeland of the pullulations.
