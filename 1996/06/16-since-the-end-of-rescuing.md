Since The End Of Rescuing
-------------------------
What epiphany does the crab contain?  
How little we divulge and how much it hears the curiosities of this computer simulation.  
The mother smiles at the goddess  
but the pioneer does not smile  
when he looks at the toucan one  
and the wet-winged ocean.  
Only mourning and to a  
sailor they take on time, too many to count years  
in your shoulder of confusion the sea of trousers seek.  
When you transform seized like a evening star.
