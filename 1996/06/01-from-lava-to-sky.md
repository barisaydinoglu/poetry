From Lava To Sky
----------------
And the kiss to its planetarium  
and among the corals the warm one  
the father covered with winged foam. Not growing is a form of rescuing. The stalks of cattail plan that has everyone tremulous.  
And you chirp like a sea water and a mane -like coal  
nothing but that flower of paths.  
Bitter coffins and clenched nougats.  
On what misunderstood oxides discovered with earth?  
And you blossom like a nature and I recover as if around a burned-out shadow.  
When you tread like dew blushed by the electricity.  
A shoreline weaving will create  
the guilt fire of a planet.
