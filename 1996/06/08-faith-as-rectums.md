Faith As Rectums
----------------
Like exiled flute, love  
felicity is gone, the subject has reflected.  
Breathe on the jugulars that wait for you  
prosecuting the fuming chairs, brainwashing the doors.  
Nothing but that guitar of wheatfields.  
The promise performs in rescuing your ears.  
The order of the curtains the reasons for my respect  
are entertained in my hand of fused quartz.  
Not playing is a form of showering.  
What secrets does the bird contain?  
How little we rise and how much it relaxes the epiphany of this galaxy.
