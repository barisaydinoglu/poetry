The Projection Of Grammatic Points
----------------------------------
In the first take, the infinite woman  
is replaced by a one. In the second  
scene he returns, to preserve and to wake.  
In the frail sea of blood-stained home.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the wonderful telegraphs?  
And the fog great splattering its sea's skins and invading them full of  
vicinity and crab?  
For movie was muzzled and morally positive.  
Multitude of serenities!  
In and out of the sepia the opaque burnt umber and the crimson  
spacious, fused quartz honeysuckle!  
What shatters the props of decency?  
The cactus plan that has everyone fragmented.  
This sifted cactus and flowing goblet congeals me  
with it's rosy moons  
like ears and brow  
and brimstone phemonanas like brow and flowers.  
Self-assured, cedar rose!  
Where silk architectures meet  
starlights meet, with and around and the sound  
of consequences,  
to reach out and perfume in fear.  
What falls the props of love?  
  
A gray and raucous quiver is degraded in the field.  
They silenced it with insatiable doors.  
Enjoy the many wayside attempts to set  
the somber granule.  
There is arcane fortune  
in showering it.  
To light lost splendors and for maternities.  
Only bitten and to a  
astronaut they take on time, twenty-seven years  
the fire arcane stains are attacked.
