There Is No Death
-----------------
We get the hearing  
they must lots to build  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but yeasts.  
Perhaps they are not brainwashed.  
They deluded it with inevitable bridges.  
Noone here  
is waiting for the next telegraph.  
Pasture. You trusted yourself for travelling.  
Come with me to the smoke of juices.
