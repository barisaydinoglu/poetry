Breeding Musical Affection
--------------------------
A foot and a toe  
attracting the sea.  
A winged fog of cathedrals.  
Your dew is a goblet filled with rustling moon.  
Draw from it the cheerless  
production of its own sequence.  
Come with me to the dung of daggers.  
Nothing but your affluent brain.  
As soon as the incoming hats  
gives the neutral indication.  
And you store like a saxophone and neither vein nor window nor gray  
nor yellow but marine. Tremulous brides and children.  
For me they are technical.  
You, who is like an abberation ostrich among the expanding of many pioneer.  
The sifted sun rise is starry on your tail.  
Come with me to the vagabond of seperations.  
Once there was a oily mountaineer who  
conducted at parties, sitting in a loop, among crimson cars.  
On what lashed throats grew with fire?  
A quiver -like night  
I took on sifted ripples.  
Like dusts pitying next  
to lighthouses.  
  
So the unguessed pride lives on in a grape,  
The cordial house of the river,  
the handsome bell that is self-assured and secure.  
The trash barge imposes nessecity.
