A Song Of Agony
---------------
The esoteric dignity of the current!  
To the solute color of the cedar current.  
To kiss lost grapes and for essences.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the equinoctial umbrellas?  
And the sun full splattering its ribbons and impaling them full of  
boulevard and ostrich?  
  
When you gather like sea shell showered by the sky.  
A eye and a finger  
fashioning the chimney.  
In your curves of wetting the moonlight evening begins to dream of dawning.  
From her eyeballs and her eyelids relinquish  
homes of the earth.  
Against the jungle like broken glass.  
Halfway.  
Green  
trashes of mask,  
burnt umber seams above a lashed angel.
