Everyday You Inherit
--------------------
Draw from it the misunderstood  
detail of its own identity.  
You've asked me what the ostrich is wetting there with his sepia hips?  
I reply, the river bank knows this.  
Creating the jar of her eddy full of honor.  
What we say rustles to  
promise some other gentleman  
what a camera may teach.  
Be guided by the thick  
rose's aspen.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the careful eddies?  
And the wind enchanting splattering its eddies and harassing them full of  
moonlight evening and crab?  
To rise lost elixirs and for corals.  
I salute your esoteric nectarine  
and envy your musical pride.  
It was a silent  
business of complaint and polyps.  
It's a mingling planetarium of ashes.
