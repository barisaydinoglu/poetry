The Cheerless One Of The Divisions
----------------------------------
The negligent warmth that wakes in your utensil.  
In the face of so many parallel brambless to functionality.  
She is behind us at this moment of first perching.  
I am replaced by defender and alarm, by enemy and sunshine.  
Always you deprive through the afternoon  
toward the sunrise fainting smooth stones.  
The electricity dashing bombs are pitied.  
Our new springtime, our eloquent light squares.  
Pockets of sand converted into ceramic.  
In the smallest fused quartz wine bottle hated shadows and shaken moldy bananas.  
It was the night of the tiger.  
Some blossom but I kiss your ash like telegraph.  
It was the morning  
of the jaguar.  
  
A railroad track -like lonely road  
the peace shakes, the warmth of angellic  
rejoices behind.  
The ego imposes nessecity.  
There are many daggers outside fuming events.  
Everything bitten with velvety voices, the salt of the poppy  
and piles of delicate bread outside morning.  
  
Arrogant moths and whirlwinds of trashes.  
He is among us at this moment of first pulsing.  
The morose quiver is lion hearted on your eyeballs.  
As soon as the incoming kisses  
gives the public indication.  
From her eyelids and her mouth imbue  
films of the earth.  
The pioneer smiles at the child  
but the man does not smile  
when he looks at the toucan bride  
and the silent ocean.  
  
Domestic empire. The loop functions to fashion a environment  
to its environment.  
The furious tiger builds inside the fleeting lances.
