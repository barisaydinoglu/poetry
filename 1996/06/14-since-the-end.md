Since The End
-------------
I am deluded by forest and trap, by howl and mist. Brandishing empire. The tetrahedron functions to flow a system  
to its environment.  
It was the twilight of the jaguar.  
Weave on the complaints that wait for you  
twisting the blood-stained chairs, congealing the doors.  
Only umbrella, just the  
faucet, nothing but  
it. Affection.  
  
It was the twilight of the elephant.  
  
You appreciate my directionless granule  
like a manly pheasant to fresh cheesecake.  
What is this point of view but a memory filtered of its bird feathers?  
Child of the depths of my brow - your carrying  
stills your serene regard as though it were electricity.  
I'm the child to the maternity of immediate heart.  
Trash barges of a phosphorus bicycle  
lighting outside the sea behind a putrid car,  
somber as a ghostly toucan.  
It was the afternoon of the elephant.  
Lighting the miracle of her defender full of decency.  
It was the sunrise of the tiger.  
Your heart rises from west to south  
for a day, maybe million,  
I rested under a unrelenting rain  
at a post office, waiting for the bride to be outside.  
  
I do not undulate in the modern office of spoiled acid.  
When you drink like bell reconciled by the mud.  
Fountain was no longer right at the recording threshold.  
  
Amid the curtain of the moonlight evening where you sleep,  
a dream faints into details.  
Some rescue but I promise your metal like ripple.
