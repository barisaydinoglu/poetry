Tell Her That I Am Giving Up Blushing In Languages
--------------------------------------------------
A pasture -like hole  
and so that its vaginas will falter your brow.  
The city amid hers  
a history we divulge in passing,  
with notions of decency  
and a passion for science and science  
All breakfasts become croaks.  
A flower head focuses its dream of a beginning, its ending, the old ending of the acrobat order -  
its fluidic trash barges.  
You are the tomato of my sordid nose.  
The fragmented moon that enchants in your breakfast.
