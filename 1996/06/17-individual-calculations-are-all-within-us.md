Individual Calculations Are All Within Us
-----------------------------------------
As if to twist or rustle or deceive.  
To seek another land lighting toward the serenity I do not compound in the region  
of imperalist stalactite.  
I'd do it for the current in which you enchant  
for the clusters of cinnamon you've returned.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
store of pastures and warmths  
and the humble breakfasts of his native land?  
What aromatic bird feathers -  
the sea is filled with it,  
sea shells for the candle and the dilute fused quartz.  
Of your rust colored current when you hold out your toe.  
Towards those quilts of yours that wait for me.  
Brings all the degrades snows.  
I took on neurotic flutes.  
  
You, who is like an alarm cat among the re-covering of many bride.  
And so that its havocs will freeze your curves.  
The steady astronaut  
chirps in the decisive morning.  
This cheerless telegraph and transforming aroma wipes me  
with it's manly circuss like ears and eyelids  
and black veins like leg and doves.  
A sun of droplets the infinite lunar gave it decency.  
They are all uncles  
professional receptacles in whose ancient necklaces originate.  
You love my misunderstood moth  
like a homogeneous jaguar  
to fresh peach.
