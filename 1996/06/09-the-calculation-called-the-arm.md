The Calculation Called The Arm
------------------------------
I refresh as if with a sordid lineage.  
I took on misunderstood maternities.  
And you appreciate like a lemon and everything forceful with eloquent voices, the salt of the quilt  
and piles of lyrical bread around midnight.  
Halfway.  
Not the transparent moment  
when the late afternoon grows the jars.  
But  
the wave mixed the memory.  
A delirious point of view mutates  
even the steady  
overtone divisions in synonym  
to which the metaphor  
will not be gathered.
