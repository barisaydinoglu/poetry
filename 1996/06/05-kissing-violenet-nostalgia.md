Kissing Violenet Nostalgia
--------------------------
There ought to be a sea shell of a profound cathedral re-covering in a modern office.  
And the telegraph to its lighthouse  
and among the hats the essential one  
the person covered with cosmic circus.  
On what fuming whispers heard with ice?  
A enduring clouds of bridges.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
In my archipeligos at afternoon you are like a peace  
and your form and colour the way I return them.  
  
In my jungle at afternoon you are like a key  
and your form and colour the way I magnify  
them.  
Not to perfume or even meet  
the tree of one who awakens  
against me in a chimney or reconciling to an astronaut.  
The wall imposes nessecity.  
Once there was a motionless gentleman who  
drank at parties, sitting in a line, among aspens.  
What is this calculation but a memory impaled of its bird feathers?  
Directionless fortnight and the muzzled elixir  
lunge at the walls of my house.  
  
The puberty imposes nessecity.  
Only mist, just the  
bell, nothing but  
it. Pasture.
