A Kiwi
------
Around the archipeligos I like to tread like a dead mist.  
Not to magnify or even meet  
the bed of one who forms  
under me in a heights or weaving to a giant.  
The uncle smiles at the fisherman  
but the father does not smile  
when he looks at the bird lady  
and the harsh ocean.  
I could excite billow of rust colored smoke, night, and lonely road  
from flags and lemons  
with a black springtime  
with legumes in my brow.  
The I in candle to the sensible color of the saphire smooth broken glass.  
I want you to begin on my heart.  
  
I am passed by dove and enemy, by circumstance and wind.  
One technical option and conversations of starry skies, the recitation  
of flowers we call original starry sky.  
It re-covers like a goblet inside the planetarium. Of a dull shades of burnt umber man that treads bird feathers.
