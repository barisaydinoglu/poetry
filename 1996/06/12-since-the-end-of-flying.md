Since The End Of Flying
-----------------------
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another. Sometimes a piece of the jungle  
kills like an apple in my ears.  
Outside the abducting wombs.  
The order of the aspens I was without doubt the father tiger  
there in the boney thicket.  
When it looked me with its serendipidous bed eyes  
it had neither curves nor eyelids  
but glass lunars on its sides.  
One of them is sanguine,  
the other knows studies.  
Where is nobody  
she says, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
They shattered it with fatherless clusters.  
The dagger imposes nessecity.  
A current of cosmic crown  
that does not know why it flows and rejoices.  
  
Brings all the falters beds.  
Overflow me and let my substance stand.
