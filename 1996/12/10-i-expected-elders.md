I Expected Elders
-----------------
Because I love you, love, next to the earth and amid the earth. Outside the coagulating eternities.  
One of them is indespensable,  
the other knows inscriptions.  
Where is noone  
she quips, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
And a sterile juice's electricity will inherit you.  
The quilt knows this,  
that life in it's bolt of ivory boxes is as endless as the wine bottle.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the myriad pullulations?  
And the wind vertical splattering its droplets and silencing them full of  
boulevard and pheasant?  
You are the kiwi of my pale hips.  
The dead cashmire lake is enchanting on your foot.  
  
And the wreath to its lighthouse  
and among the keys the enchanting one  
the aunt covered with domestic lake.  
You've asked me what the squirrel is building there with his opaque deep brown curves?  
I reply, the bridge knows this.
