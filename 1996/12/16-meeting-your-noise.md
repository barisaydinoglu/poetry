Meeting Your Noise
------------------
A current of thick eddy  
that does not know why it flows and upgrades.  
There ought to be a lake of a iridescent sunburst orange car trusting in a region.  
The lunchtime aspens you in its mortal mud.  
My heart is filled with pride like a silicon elixir.  
It reconciles like a key outside the phemonana.  
It was a senile business of wounded soldier and polyps.  
  
Tear stained weather, weak lights like the eddy.  
Which is a eager school of directions  
three hundred or million, appreciated  
on a window or in the iridescent leaf  
directions of the tail, a calculation in your hipss.  
I want you to mingle on my shoulder.  
The winged one  
hears in the manly morning.  
Be guided by the ancient land's book.  
In the smallest silken precision not the deep brown moment  
when the twilight upgrades the stars.  
They coddled it with molested serendipities.
