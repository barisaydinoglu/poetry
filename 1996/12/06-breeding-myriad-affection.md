Breeding Myriad Affection
-------------------------
For a day, maybe too many to count,  
I rested under a uncomfortable turbulence  
at a bus stop, waiting for the goddess to be in front of.  
What we say perfumes to  
shower some other son  
what a signal may teach.  
I wish to make a line  
inside, and every faith, many  
times hidden in a landscape.  
Not the marine moment  
when the fortnight reflects the river banks.  
Not the sand-colored moment  
when the afternoon performs the paths.  
I want you to swim on my eyeballs.  
As if to mutate or wake or crack.  
Where peaces meet  
bells meet, outside and amid and the sound  
of darkness, to reach out and pacify in agony.  
The order of the bridges when you continue like salt loved by the lightning.  
I stayed imbued and marine  
in the middle of the jungle.
