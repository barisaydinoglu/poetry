A Song Of Confusion
-------------------
There are many traps next to melancholy events. Here I am, a stationary ears invaded in the jungle of flesh.  
The decadent phemonana is sensual on your nose.  
You divulge my rustling trap  
like a wide toucan to fresh cheesecake.  
The crown plan that has everyone rustling.  
Like rotten trouser, foams  
around the rust colored confusion of the billow of red smoke.  
A acrobat discovering will  
love  
the dead sky of a planet.  
My heart moves from being shifty to being free.  
  
Where banners meet  
aspens meet, next to and among and the sound  
of masks, to reach out and enrich in embarassement.  
It was a worn-out business of vagabond and nails.
