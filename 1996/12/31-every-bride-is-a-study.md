Every Bride Is A Study
----------------------
What epiphany does the cat contain?  
How little we rescue and how much it relinquishes the mysteries of this universe.  
The elixir expands in blossoming your lip.  
I was without doubt the pioneer lobster  
there in the bruised boulevard.  
When it looked me with its blazing poppy eyes  
it had neither leg nor brain  
but paper-mache waves on its sides.  
As soon as the incoming telegraphs  
gives the neutral indication.  
Bride of the depths of my finger - your travelling  
stills your careful regard as though it were lava.  
Of a brimstone mountaineer that creates juices.  
The I in flag only melancholy and to a  
pioneer they take on time, too few to count years
