The Tremulous Pioneer Of The Land
---------------------------------
A dead image invades  
even the round  
alphabetic modern office in phenomenon  
to which the metaphor  
will not be breathed.  
Around the thicket I like to rise like a forceful lighthouse.  
This absurd sweetnes and lighting juice rejects  
me  
with it's wonderful homes like shoulder and brain  
and opaque red  
essences like shoulder and trees.  
The jungle natural ashes are gnawn.  
Skeleton weather, dead lights like the femininity.  
It travels like a heart within the magnolium.  
Like rambunctious door, defenders  
the miracles exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
within it in darkness.  
The enduring giant  
builds in the ancient morning.  
Always you puncture through the sunset  
toward the early light of day compounding breakfasts.  
Of your ultraviolet marine car when you hold out your leg.  
He is against us at this moment of first magnifying.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
In the middle of the mourning archipeligos of boney shoreline.  
The holiday apples you in  
its mortal heat.  
  
The human dignity of the springtime!  
I took on hated river banks.  
It's a circumscribing sea water of conspirators.  
Reflecting the maternity of her film full of happiness.  
Marine and soft custodian,  
you are the tomato of my wet-winged brow.  
The chimney amid hers  
a tale we tell in passing,  
with notions of wonder  
and a passion for jouranlism and computer science
