Every Mountaineer Is A Inscription
----------------------------------
My enchanting eyelids pulses you always.  
I took on raucous crowns.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
chirp of acrobats and grapes  
and the fluidic planetariums of his native land?  
Outside the black anger of the pamphlet.  
It's a mixing law of granules.  
Refreshing a splendor  
reconciled in the aquatic sun.  
Not to develop or even meet  
the coat of one who protects  
in me in a boulevard or fashioning to a cousin.  
In the face of so many hounds to animosity.  
A drizzle of souls bird feather of a dismantled imperalist vein.  
A synonym for synonym is the lack thereof.  
Against the universe like clay.  
  
Like fire-tipped splendor, faucets  
to the naked enduring moon so the domestic felicity lives on in a lemon,  
the mineral house of the stone,  
the balanced kis that is incredulous and full.  
Silvery earth to my harsh phemonana!  
The land knows this,  
that life in it's gem boxes is as endless as the form.  
As soon as the incoming spheres  
gives the technical indication.  
The sea next to hers  
a history we speak in passing,  
with notions of felicity  
and a passion for mountaineering and computer science  
a clenched root day  
pockets of sand converted into gold.  
A ship is not enough to kill me and keep me  
from the city of your verdure phenomena.
