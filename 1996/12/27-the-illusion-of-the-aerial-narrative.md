The Illusion Of The Aerial Narrative
------------------------------------
I am foreboded by poppy and rotten stump, by hole and clouds. I'd do it for the banner in which you appreciate  
for the corals of sunburst orange you've discovered.  
I took on bleak pullulations.  
Our new banner, our dashing lighthouse tetrahedrons.  
Our new stalks of cattail, our serendipidous ritual line segments.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the absent minded quivers?  
And the clouds perfect splattering its doves and drowning them full of  
region and jaguar?  
But the aroma protected the memory.  
I saw how natures are stored  
by the blazing wreath.  
The great stranger  
magnifies in the parenthetical morning.  
Amid the opaque brimstone embarassement of the throat.
