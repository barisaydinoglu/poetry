The Furious Rectum
------------------
And the flint to its femininity  
and among the femininities the handsome one  
the daughter covered with brandishing femininity.  
Everything rustling with somber voices, the salt of the apple  
and piles of free bread around holiday.  
Which is a iridescent soul of directions  
three hundred or million, chirped  
on a smooth broken glass or in the warm bridge  
directions of the nose, a calculation in your noses.  
In your toe of beligerance the archipeligos of clusters awaken.  
Always you crack through the fortnight  
toward the early light of day plaguing wine bottles.  
Indicates the momentum's fluttering nose.  
  
Silence was no longer right at the transmission threshold.  
Windy pioneers and ones.  
For me they are minor.  
Transluscent crimson lightning to my mourning grace!  
Not appreciating is a form of kissing.  
It is a tale of tenacious scandalmongerings you are the grape of my inaccessible curves.  
We open the halves of a secrets and the  
congealing of lances perches  
into the full land.  
Our new defender, our acerb knave tetrahedrons.  
Once there was an atrocious one who  
rescued at parties, sitting in a quadrangle, among flints.  
To the affluent silent fellowship and next to my hammock, during the morning, I woke up naked  
and full of wonder.  
Carry me onto your bicycle - the orange of my fellowship -  
next to cashmire water and cashmire momenta.  
The order of the windows you breathe in the thicket as in an aquatic area.  
Not living is a form of shining.  
Like the exiled clay of poppies where angels meet  
moons meet, among and in and the sound  
of nails, to reach out and return in fear.  
As soon as the incoming honeysuckles  
gives the alphabetic indication.  
In the face of so many gates to animosity.
