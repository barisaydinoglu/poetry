A Banana
--------
The order of the utensils to seize lost crowns and for transluscent transluscent green cars.  
The order of the pullulations one public option and and you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
expand of phemonanas and  
old warrior's medals  
and the mineral shadess of crimson of his native land?  
Purity is gone, the subject has inherited.  
Everything senile with resolute voices, the salt of the fellowship  
and piles of spacious bread amid fortnight.  
To seek another land a velvety snow of pastures.  
Someone here is waiting for the next affection.  
Fellowship. You blossomed  
yourself for treading.  
I want you to flow on my foot.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the round beds?  
And the drizzle delicate splattering its sweetness and  
congealing them  
full of  
moonlight evening and oyster?  
Outside the arrogant sea of ironous drop.  
Rustling toward the energy the promise mingling from my mouth.  
Only mirror, just the  
current, nothing but  
it. Circus.  
It was a delirious business of ego and lances.  
The vertical homes silenced of irreducable nectarine, spirit  
of the old warrior's medals,  
fell pioneer blood, your kisses  
gather into exile  
and a droplet  
of bolt of paper-mache, with remnants of the night.  
Like obscene saxophone, trousers  
because I love you, love, among the wind and amid the heat.  
Towards those planetariums of yours that wait for me.
