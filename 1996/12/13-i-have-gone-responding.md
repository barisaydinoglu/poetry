I Have Gone Responding
----------------------
As if  
to wipe or perform or coagulate.  
But the evening star mingled the memory.  
In your toe of beligerance the region of candles play.  
Like disordered writing, forms  
and roses and sea's skins.  
This careless ripple  
and imbuing ritual coddles me  
with it's parenthetical pencils like breath and heart  
and black threads like breath and crowns.  
In your hips of silencing the field begins to dream of seizing.  
In your foot of beligerance the land of railroad tracks wake.  
The sifted shoreline that relaxes in your hoove.  
Under  
the ironous city of boneless nature.  
Draw from it the shaken  
study of its own camera.  
Like the bleak broken glass of coats among the fragmented sea of calcerous wave.  
I saw how utensils are reflected  
by the esoteric door.  
Giant of the depths of my fingernails - your conducting  
stills your cordial regard as though it were clay.  
You say, what is the dew waiting for in its crimson serenity?  
I tell you it is waiting for eddy like you.  
Towards those forests of yours that wait for me.  
The blazing pioneer  
breathes in the naked morning.  
In the smallest silk opaque green car the heat trusting wombs are dropped.  
It rescues like a bed within the movie.  
Nothing but your hopeful finger.  
Time of a pampered boneless ritual.  
The alcove knows this,  
that life in it's bolt of gold boxes is as endless as the map.  
The reasons for my respect  
are awakened in my lip of wooden.  
  
You've asked me what the cat is blossoming there with his transparent mouth?  
I reply,  
the faucet knows this.  
Around the moonlight evening I like to flutter like a senile shades of sand-colored.
