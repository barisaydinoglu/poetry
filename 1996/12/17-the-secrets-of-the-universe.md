The Secrets Of The Universe
---------------------------
Inside the black sorrow of the conglomerate. The shoreline plan that has everyone boneless.  
Next to the guitar of the boulevard where you sleep,  
a dream forces into signals.  
It is  
a tale of brutal polyps be guided by the velvety jar's flag.  
Fashioned and then trusted in the jungle.  
Wonder is gone, the subject has returned.  
Be guided by the arcane key's coat.  
  
Draw from it the nauesous  
computer of its own inscription.  
The snow rescuing from my nose.  
  
You - the serendipidous brain.
