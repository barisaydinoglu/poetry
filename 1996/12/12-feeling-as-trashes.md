Feeling As Trashes
------------------
As if to kill or re-cover or execute. This sordid stalks of cattail and shining precision devours me  
with it's mineral snows like fingernails and eyeballs  
and opaque gray umbrellas like toe and lemons.  
Protecting the bridge of her soul full of happiness.  
In my heights at afternoon you are like a sand-colored car  
and  
your form and colour the way I make them.  
There are many daggers outside lethargic events.
