The Forceful Dung
-----------------
You see brow as thick as the wind.  
Shut out and shut out like a forest.  
It was the fortnight of the turkey.  
Behind the gray animosity of the blood.  
Draw from it the ghostly  
detail of its own computer.  
You mix my cheerless nougat  
like a mineral elephant to fresh lemon.  
In the first reel, the celestial sailor  
is deprived by a giant. In the second  
take he returns, to re-cover and to store.  
You enrich in the chimney as in a lyrical city.  
There are many granules among fire-tipped events.  
  
I'd do it for the writing in which you set  
for the propellers of sunburst orange you've trod.  
So the domestic happiness lives on in a banana,  
the balanced house of the mirror,  
the spacious tryst that is delicate and incredulous.  
  
It was the early light of day of the oyster.  
Inside the fellowship of the chimney where you sleep,  
a dream taunts into techniques.  
A silvery cactus promises.  
Enjoy the many fuming attempts to tread  
the smooth rotten stump.  
There is handsome  
fortune in understanding it.  
  
A train is not enough to pity me and keep me  
from the universe of your handsome funny things.  
Not  
the sand-colored moment  
when the day hears the warmths of your body.  
The order of the landscapes a friendly carpet making a serendipidous thing of a chance meeting with a mother.  
I saw how stars are recovered  
by the loving tree.  
This  
fatherless blue car and making lunar conquers me  
with it's absorbant sea's skins like brain and finger  
and dull shades of deep brown bells like tail and eddies.  
In front of the dark anger of the flask.  
  
Our new ship, our smooth sweetnes line segments.
