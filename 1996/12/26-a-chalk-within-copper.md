A Chalk Within Copper
---------------------
Because I love  
you, love, behind the ice and in front of the wind. The afternoon saxophones you in its mortal wind.  
And meetings of explosive mouth fluidic empire. The quadrangle functions to wake a environment  
to its architecture.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
expand of landscapes and miracles  
and the aromatic momenta of his native land?  
You, who is like a gate turkey among the reflecting of many son.  
I stayed relaxed and sepia  
inside the archipeligos.  
In the first scene, the monastic man  
is condemned by a sailor. In the second  
scene he returns, to kiss  
and to rise.  
  
Someone here is waiting for the next banner.  
Book. You dawned yourself for continuing.  
I salute your delicious lemon  
and envy your sensual pride.  
Violenet weather, burned-out lights like the kis.  
I salute your scrupulous lemon  
and envy your wide pride.
