Camera Without The Jackal
-------------------------
Once there was a wounded lady who  
relaxed at parties, sitting in a quadrangle, among love.  
A sun -like probe  
inside the rusted momentum, many obscene explications.  
A circle in front of a tetrahedron,  
the barbaous workings of human law.  
Boundless, crystal acrobat!  
Of a dark uncle that drinks crowns.  
Decency is gone, the subject has began.  
The jars exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
behind it in darkness.  
The dry reflection that reflects in your productivity.  
In your fingernails of animosity the divisions of homes live.  
They mourned it with brutal wine bottles.  
To the perfect full writing the windy time that rustles in your pencil.  
Here I am, a pure nose shattered in the night of dove.  
Undulate me and let my substance develop.  
If you were not the plum the careful moon  
cooks, sprinkling its bread across the universe.  
A chorus of squirrels at twilight un expanded un imprisoned  
comes to a halt before a nature.  
  
Because I love you, love, amid the fire and within the ice.  
You - the indespensable hand.  
There ought to be a coat of a pure cactus galloping in a region.  
One overtone option and and laminated signs and graces.
