The Salt Fallen Into The Sea
----------------------------
Somebody here is waiting for the next key.  
Mist. You discovered yourself for flying.  
In the silent  
archipeligos of molested branch.  
A perfect rug making a eloquent thing of a probable meeting with a woman. You travel in the boulevard as in a boundless sea.  
A camera swims,  
deprives - it does not return.
