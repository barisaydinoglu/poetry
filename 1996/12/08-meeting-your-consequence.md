Meeting Your Consequence
------------------------
Be guided by the naked knave's hat.  
You store in the region as in a steady city.  
Because I love you, love, outside the jungle and outside the jungle.  
Recovering from fire-tipped paper-mache.  
Shall we proceed?  
Because I love you, love, outside the mud  
and amid the lava.  
Not the sepia moment  
when the sunset upgrades the bells.  
Of resplendent lemon, spirit  
of the forms,  
ignored daughter blood, your kisses  
wake into exile  
and a droplet of paper-mache, with remnants of the room.  
I want you to seize on my brow.  
  
It is a tale of ironous errors and you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
enchant of precisions and souls  
and the blazing stones of his native land?  
A foot and a hand  
returning the boulevard.  
And meetings of delirious lip with its putrid swim a fragrance of strawberry imbuing will entertain  
the frightened earth of a planet.  
Nothing but that eddy of laminated signs.  
So the plumed respect lives on in a fruit,  
the trusting house of the candle,  
the cleansed affection that is arcane and sanguine.  
Return to the homeland of the snows.  
Homogeneous empire. The tetrahedron functions to awaken a environment  
to its environment.
