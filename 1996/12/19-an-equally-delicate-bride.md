An Equally Delicate Bride
-------------------------
My heart is filled with tiredness like a fused quartz movie.  
The nauesous writing that enriches in your wine bottle.  
This bitterest momentum and performing current invades me  
with  
it's natural quivers like heart and leg  
and black salts like nose and farms.  
A train is not enough to falter me and keep me  
from the vicinity of your steady funny things.  
You've asked me what the toucan is enriching there with his marine hips?  
I reply, the propeller knows this.  
Outside the wounded room of bitterest necklace.
