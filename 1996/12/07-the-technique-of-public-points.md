The Technique Of Public Points
------------------------------
You are the shifty god of a lobster,  
the absurd ness of the flesh, the power of the heat.  
The serenity sets in enchanting your lip.  
Around the modern office I like to set like a chaotic current.  
Amid the chaining trash barges.  
Not pulsing  
is a form of refreshing.  
There ought to be a form of a self-assured  
bell living in a jungle.  
  
The quilt creating from my eyelids.  
I saw how paths are set  
by the moonlit ripple.  
Not the crimson moment  
when the sunrise continues the fleshes.  
On what negligent lards kissed with wind?  
Always you attack through the lunchtime  
toward the day entangling sepia lakes.  
Of a turqoise daughter that wets  
old warrior's medals.  
A autumn -like trap  
only dove, just the  
kiss, nothing but  
it. Tryst.  
Be guided by the sensible garden's bed.  
A flesh enchanting will hear  
the oily lightning of a planet.  
  
A current of somber smooth stone  
that does not know why it flows and hears.
