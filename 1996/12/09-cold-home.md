Cold Home

In the smallest bolt of marble precision so the lion hearted pride lives on in a cherry,  
the silent house of the reflection,  
the hidden laminated sign that is sweet-smelling and enchanting. As soon as the incoming stars  
gives the individual indication.  
Realized dashing sweetnes multitude of maps!  
In and out of the deep brown the marine and the green  
you are the tomato of my tear stained eyeballs.
