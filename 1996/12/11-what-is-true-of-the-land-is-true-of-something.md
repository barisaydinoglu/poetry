What Is True Of The Land Is True Of Something
---------------------------------------------
Around the area I like to travel like a rustling tiger.  
A metaphor forms,  
disguises - it does not return.  
In front of the flying vortices.  
Green and delicate giant,  
come with me to the billows of blood colored smoke of puberties.  
Wave of wave of aspens rolling down the sea.  
When you wake like quiver carried by the clay.  
Pockets of rusted nail converted into emerald. And you tread like a promise and the rambunctious banner is lyrical on your arm.  
Neither serendipity nor flag nor ultraviolet  
nor green but cashmire.
