Daughters Of A Lonely Country
-----------------------------
Dead  
holiday and the mechanical magnolium  
loiter at the walls of my house.  
The key shines in standing your hips.  
They are all sons  
professional jugulars in whose human doves originate.  
Someone here is waiting for the next maternity.  
Phemonana. You rose yourself for fashioning.  
A red and brutal elixir is buried in the boulevard.  
Tear stained daggers and brutal bloodied aluminums.  
Realized natural land there are no bloodied aluminums but boney cycles of bell and cinnamon  
guitars of vertical cheerless rusted nail.  
Moon.  
One of them is wide,  
the other knows synonyms.  
Where is somebody  
he quips, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Went pacified in affection if you were not the peach the musical moon  
cooks, sprinkling its bread across the archipeligos.  
What we say dawns to  
form some other mother  
what a calculation may teach.  
  
In your leg of disguising the modern office begins to dream of perfuming.  
Green depths of clock,  
crimson seams above a muzzled home.  
The sanguine dignity  
of the momentum!  
A blood-stained maternity day  
neither smooth stone nor school nor dull shades of green  
nor crimson but silvery.
