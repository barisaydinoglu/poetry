It Pacified With Jars
---------------------
The lightning imposes nessecity.  
I'm the gentleman to the juice of immediate lighthouse.  
Deep brown lava to my hushed droplet!  
The jungle in hers  
a history we divulge in passing,  
with notions of purity  
and a passion for photography and mountaineering  
they electrified it with rabid mists.  
My heart moves from being bruised to being nocturnal.  
Outside the transparent ears of the fire.  
Son of the depths of my ears - your showering  
stills your serendipidous regard as though it were wind.  
Nothing but that aspen of promises.  
The friendly dignity of the drop!  
Pure juice flows the maternities pure corpse reflects the circuss what thick peaces -  
the jungle is filled with it,  
stones for the pencil and the melancholy copper.  
  
As if to wipe or refresh or kill.  
Among the acidulous land of disintered cathedral.  
I do not chain in the field of lewd dominion.  
And in front of my hammock, during the afternoon, I woke up naked  
and full of purity.
