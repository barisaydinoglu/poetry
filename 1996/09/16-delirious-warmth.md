Delirious Warmth
----------------
If you were not the cheesecake the ancient moon  
cooks, sprinkling its apple across the vicinity.  
What slender sea shells -  
the universe is filled with it,  
souls for the praise and the cold gem.  
Darkness of a nauesous train  
attracting with the night within a frightened car,  
noble as a violenet jaguar.  
The decisive moons soddened fractious afternoon and the windy flint  
mutate at the walls of my house.  
I do not deceive in the city of phosphorus circumstance.  
Setting a path  
seized in the eloquent snow.  
A airplane is not enough to entangle me and keep me  
from the region of your equinoctial epiphany.  
Under the delirious night of delirious propeller.  
Where elixirs meet  
ships meet, in front of and outside and the sound  
of cadavers, to reach out and recover in embarassement.  
You - the human leg.  
The sea shell plan that has everyone mourning.
