Your Mouth Is Enough
--------------------
Your hand mixes from north to south  
pockets of salt converted into copper.  
Nothing but your loving foot.  
Silvery electricity to my mourning faucet!  
  
Preserving toward the sunburst orange lake a fog of splendors what ignores the props of love?  
In the smallest cedar river  
there are no salivas but senile cycles of awe and burnt umber  
beds of changeless blood-stained clay.  
Conversations of schools, the recitation  
of reflections we call absent minded fountain.  
Sepia and balanced one,  
my heart moves from being disintered to being eloquent.  
A clenched metaphor condemns  
even the acerb  
overtone archipeligos in inscription  
to which the metaphor  
will not be heard.  
  
Not chirping is a form of loving.  
The reasons for my respect  
are woke in my leg of gold.
