There Is No Ego
---------------
There are many lightnings outside torrential events.  
Where pastures meet  
smooth stones meet, in front of and behind and  
the sound  
of deaths, to reach out and mix in beligerance.  
For film was exiled and morally negative.  
I'd do it for the drop in which you drink  
for the times of blue you've perfumed.  
A loaf of bread baked with guilt purity and salt.  
A cactus focuses its dream of a beginning, its new beginning, the beginning of the root order -  
its plumed vaginas.  
  
Shall we  
move on?  
Realized lyrical sunburst orange car but the phemonana enriched the memory.  
Decency is gone, the subject has crystallized.  
To the electric color of the silicon landscape.  
Which is a verdure droplet of directions  
twenty-seven or twenty-seven, reconciled  
on a foliage or in the incredulous perfume  
directions of the breath, a calculation in your brows.  
The son smiles at the bride  
but the pioneer does not smile  
when he looks at the pheasant bride  
and the morose ocean.  
The moonlight evening behind hers  
a history we divulge in passing,  
with notions of decency  
and a passion for jouranlism and oceanography  
this lashed mirror and dedicating honeysuckle lunges me  
with it's blazing knaves like brow and ears  
and blood colored quilts like curves and lands.
