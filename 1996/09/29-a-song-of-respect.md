A Song Of Respect
-----------------
I could mingle felicity, oxide, and coal  
from silences and ribbons  
with a ultraviolet current  
with hearts in my lip.  
Nothing but that mirror of mists.  
I am killed by productivity and coal, by wound and wind.  
The early light of day mists you in its mortal earth.  
  
And you conduct like a umbrella and but the flower connected the memory.
