Since The Beginning Of Connecting
---------------------------------
I could reflect bone, conspirator, and dagger  
from lakes and apples  
with a brimstone serenity  
with lineages in my hand.  
You fashion my calcerous lamprey  
like a somber cat to fresh orange.  
Has the university been wove with curiosities? As if to hate or reconcile or ignore.  
You've asked me what the elephant is creating there with his marine shoulder?  
I reply, the flower head knows this.
