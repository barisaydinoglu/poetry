What Is True Of The Ribbon Is True Of Everything
------------------------------------------------
If you were not the peach the infinite moon  
cooks, sprinkling its plum across the heights.  
You begin slowly into a field to awaken your business.  
It was the night of the oyster.  
Hate me and let my substance entertain.  
It was the late afternoon of the lobster.  
A current of hopeful wheatfield  
that does not know why it flows and develops.  
Green and hidden pioneer,  
And you recover like an autumn and we get the sense  
they must lots to transform  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but coals.  
Perhaps they are not dropped.  
I protect as if inside a obscene cleft.  
Opaque transluscent opaque opaque green whispers of wound,  
marine seams above a negligent momentum.  
Everything hairy with steady voices, the salt of the muscle  
and piles of plumed bread in front of early light of day.  
  
Sometimes a piece of the lava  
taunts like a railroad track in my brain.
