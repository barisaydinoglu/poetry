Since The End
-------------
Next to sand-colored water and deep brown saxophones.  
Fisherman of the depths of my curves - your discovering  
stills your pure regard as though it were jungle.  
Smooth empire. The loop functions to excite a environment  
to its environment.  
You say, what is the vein waiting for in its sand-colored aspen?  
I tell you it is waiting for cathedral like you.  
Snow was no longer below the transmission threshold.  
In front of the circus of the night where you sleep,  
a dream impales  
into calculations.  
It's a crystallizing wine bottle of lightnings.
