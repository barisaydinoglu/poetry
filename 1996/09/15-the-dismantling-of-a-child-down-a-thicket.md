The Dismantling Of A Child Down A Thicket
-----------------------------------------
The order of the warmths of boundless orange, spirit  
Of the foliages,  
foreboded pioneer blood, your kisses  
respond into exile  
and a droplet of silken, with remnants of the area.  
My heart moves from being imperalist to being nocturnal.  
The poppy conducts in fashioning your eye.  
A starry rug making an ancient thing of a lucky meeting with a god.  
You store slowly into a moonlight evening to light your business.  
The fatherless perfume that preserves in your femininity.  
A blood colored and negligent jar is punctured in the night.  
Conversations of lands, the recitation  
of lunars we call somber shoreline.  
  
To wet lost ripples and for mists.  
When the city is full of mechanical heart  
inside felicities and lewd cold acrobats  
and the directionless aromas and the paths  
at last give forth their shady croak.  
It's a inheriting flower head  
of roosters.
