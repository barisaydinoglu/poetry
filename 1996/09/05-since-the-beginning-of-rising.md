Since The Beginning Of Rising
-----------------------------
If you were not the plum the self-assured moon  
cooks, sprinkling its wine across the night.  
You've asked me what the elephant is rescuing there with his sunburst orange tail?  
I reply, the ribbon knows this.  
A sand-colored praise recovers.  
I wake as if among an atrocious bramble.
