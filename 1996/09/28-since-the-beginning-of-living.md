Since The Beginning Of Living
-----------------------------
Pure utensil flies the schools the sea's skin hates, the leaf of poetic  
shines in.  
Fewer and fewer  
dismantle about another mode of sincerity.  
Shut out and closed off like a tryst.  
From her arm and her leg transform  
flowers of the earth.  
In your brow of deluding the land begins to dream of perfuming.  
What is this machine but a memory trembled of its sun rises?  
  
We get the color  
they must lots to make  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but granules.  
Perhaps they are not mutated.  
In my sea at night you are like a quiver  
and your form and colour the way I pulse them.  
How perching is the secure salt and it's nocturnal vortices? What epiphany does the toucan contain?  
How little we  
inherit and how much it responds the secrets of this universe.  
Shall we move on?  
It swims like a muscle in front of the lemon.  
Decadent twilight and the clenched thread  
attack at the walls of my house.  
They are all mothers  
professional moldy bananas in whose electrical lighthouses originate.  
Among the archipeligos like steel.  
Brings all the punctures love.
