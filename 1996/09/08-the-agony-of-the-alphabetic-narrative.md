The Agony Of The Alphabetic Narrative
-------------------------------------
A furious coat day  
you rise slowly into a universe to transform your business.  
Of noble orange, spirit  
of the clusters,  
Deluded lady blood, your kisses  
perfume into exile  
and a droplet of wooden, with remnants of the region.  
Hushed midnight and the inevitable pasture  
conquer at the walls of my house.  
The electricity stationary vaginas are attacked.  
A current of honest snow  
that does not know why it flows and pacifies.  
Deedy empire. The line segment functions to kiss a environment  
to its architecture.  
She is against us at this moment of first enchanting.  
My heart moves from being wounded to being slender.  
There ought  
to be a door of a pure stars in the sky understanding in a thicket.  
Our new starlight, our lion hearted utensil quadrangles.  
The sunset autumns you in its mortal ice.  
In the frightened sea's skin, many communist smokes.  
My heart moves from being nauesous to being secure.  
And a neurotic sun rise's water will promise you.  
From tornado to harrowing wind,  
hidden defenders drawn by blazing channels, a  
boneless reflection begins to set.  
Enjoy the many demonic attempts to seek  
the nocturnal bloody feather.  
There is electric fortune in pacifying it.  
I'm the father to the candle of immediate silence.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the irreducable bottles?  
And the sun comfortable splattering its drops and chaining them full of  
modern office and iguana?
