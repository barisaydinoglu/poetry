Recovering Bitter Nostalgia
---------------------------
Blue lava to my misunderstood tree!  
Towards those paths of yours that wait for me.  
So the dashing honor lives on in a mango,  
the manly house of the thread,  
the starry snow that is delicious and musical.  
With its rotten relinquish wave of a dismantled shifty sun.
