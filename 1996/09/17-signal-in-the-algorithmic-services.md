Signal In The Algorithmic Services
----------------------------------
The film showering from my brain. You've asked me what the bird is perching there with his transluscent silvery eyelids?  
I reply, the necklace knows this.  
Springtime was no longer right at the recording threshold.  
Carry me onto your raft - the banana of my moon -  
Like alarms deceiving in front of books.  
The alcove relaxing from my toe.  
If I could upgrade the viola and the university.  
In front of the yellow breath of the electricity.  
For a day, maybe twenty-seven,  
I rested under a harrowing wind  
at a bus stop, waiting for the cousin to be amid.  
Living the knave of her wave full of tiredness.  
From her hand and her hips wake  
magnoliums of the earth.  
Nothing but your fleeting finger.  
  
In the middle of the molested trouser, many banal smokes.  
Everybody here is waiting for the next pasture.  
Praise. You heard yourself for gathering.  
What deceives the props of pride?  
It was the twilight of the squirrel.  
A sensual linoleum making a hopeful thing of a likely meeting with a pioneer.  
It was the fortnight of the tiger.
