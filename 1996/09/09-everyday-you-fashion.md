Everyday You Fashion
--------------------
Light of a ignored lashed window.  
Not the transparent moment  
when the sunrise crystallizes the warmths of your body.  
Nothing but that banner of paths.  
Built and then wetted in the land.  
The cathedral knows this,  
that life in it's fused quartz boxes is as endless as the honeysuckle.  
Shall we set forth?
