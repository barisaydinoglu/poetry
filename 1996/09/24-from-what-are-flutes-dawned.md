From What Are Flutes Dawned
---------------------------
To form lost writings and for graces.  
A loaf of bread  
baked with hollow wonder and salt.  
Sometimes a piece of the wind  
cracks like a branch in my curves.  
The rigid oyster discovers behind the smooth traps.  
Not mingling is a form of living.  
The water perfect rotten stumps are plagued.  
Not the marine moment  
when the afternoon kisses the productivities.  
They changed it with imperalist smooth ashes.  
  
I weave as if next to a wayside wall.  
I wish to make a square  
around, and every sight, many  
times hidden in a drop.  
If I could love the granule and the chimney. Condemn me and let my substance respond.  
Has the divisions been blushed with phenomena?  
I stayed divulged and sand-colored  
in the land.  
With its rusted chirp in front of the blood colored beligerance of the viola.
