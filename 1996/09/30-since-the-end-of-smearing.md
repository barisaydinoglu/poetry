Since The End Of Smearing
-------------------------
In the face of so many salts to positivity.  
When the moonlight evening is full of fractious shoulder  
inside jackals and morbid senile rivers  
and the nauesous fleshes and the magnoliums  
at last give forth their rabid martyr.  
You - the iridescent arm.  
Nothing but that warmth of your body of maternities.  
Like the decadent iron of coats my myriad brain blossoms you always.  
To the dashing color of the gold perfume.  
Amid the time of the university where you sleep,  
a dream petrifies into productions.
