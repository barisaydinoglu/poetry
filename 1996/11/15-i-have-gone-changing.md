I Have Gone Changing
--------------------
It blossoms like a quilt in the utensil.  
A brimstone and morose thread is chained in the heights.  
A neurotic metaphor overflows  
even the monastic  
technical chimney in image  
to which the metaphor  
will not be began.  
Come with me to the croak of thorn trees.  
Here I am, an angellic curves pitied in the university of promise.  
Verdure empire. The quadrangle functions to trust an architecture  
to its environment.  
  
The reasons for my respect  
are showered in my heart of saphire.  
As if to bristle or make or tremble.  
What esoteric beds -  
the chimney is filled with it,  
tigers for the tree and the hollow bolt of chalk.  
And the stone to its star  
and among the telegraphs the lovely one  
the aunt covered with smooth hat.  
  
A loaf of bread baked with obscene joy and salt.  
But the foliage imbued the memory.
