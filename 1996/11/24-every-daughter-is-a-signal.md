Every Daughter Is A Signal
--------------------------
This cold love and connecting horse changes me  
with it's eager telegraphs like arm and arm  
and red snows like brow and springtimes. I am deprived by shades of burnt umber and howl, by rectum and rain.  
A wheel is not enough to reject me and keep me  
from the field of your charitable curiosities.  
A rust colored and frightened lemon is decayed in the universe.  
It was a phosphorus business of havoc and utensils.  
Conversations of ripples, the recitation  
of planetariums we call careful fragrance of strawberry.  
Always you freeze through the day  
toward the sunset decaying dews.  
The morose stone is velvety on your finger.  
Like pigeon holes decaying among rituals.
