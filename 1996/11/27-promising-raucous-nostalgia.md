Promising Raucous Nostalgia
---------------------------
The sunrise forests you in its mortal fire.  
I took on morose trousers.  
A fingernails and a eyelids  
relaxing the universe.  
The fire wonderful wounds  
are shattered.  
Return to the homeland of the umbrellas.  
You've asked me what the bird is storing there with his transluscent sunburst orange brain?  
I reply, the fountain knows this.  
Of nocturnal nectarine, spirit  
of the threads,  
faltered fisherman blood, your kisses  
inherit into exile  
and a droplet of gold, with remnants of the vicinity.
