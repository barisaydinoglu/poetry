Some Frightened Make
--------------------
How attracting is the acerb shrapnel and it's dashing nougats?  
Indicates the vein's perching heart.  
I took on rambunctious moons.  
It's a rescuing book of shadows.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
carry of currents and flints  
and the infinite stalkss of cattail of his native land?  
To return lost rituals and for serendipities.
