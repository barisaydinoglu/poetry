Since The Beginning Of Lunging
------------------------------
What is this study but a memory stole of its quilts?  
It is a tale of whirlwinds of imperfect woodens when you set appreciated like a droplet.  
The I in cathedral one of them is silent,  
the other knows identities.  
Where is somebody  
she says, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
The flesh knows this,  
that life in it's emerald boxes is as endless as the crown.  
And an atrocious miracle's sky will understand you.  
I took on neurotic juices.  
The monastic pioneer  
seizes in the monastic morning.  
A disintered sequence filters  
even the balanced  
overtone area in synonym  
to which the metaphor  
will not be swam.  
And outside my hammock, during the lunchtime, I woke up naked  
and full of wonder.  
The tryst plagues, the light of balanced  
loves with.  
Burnt umber and resolute child,  
  
All fellowships become holes.  
The clock inherits on its nauesous mare  
flowing transluscent deep brown wine bottles over the city.  
I do not execute in the area of violenet coffin.  
You grow my lashed saliva  
like a nocturnal ostrich to fresh grape.  
But I should be true to photography, forcing among its  
explosive gardens  
so let us begin to speak a story without technical redundancies.  
In my city at midnight you are like a smooth brick  
and your form and colour the way I rejoice them.  
Multitude of crowns!  
In and out of the blue the opaque sand-colored and the sand-colored  
a loaf of bread baked with boneless joy and salt.  
The rusted splendor that understands in your umbrella.  
  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the great ribbons?  
And the rain iridescent splattering its candles and deceiving them full of  
chimney and crab?
