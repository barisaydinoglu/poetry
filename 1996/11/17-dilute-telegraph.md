Dilute Telegraph
----------------
Not to breathe or even meet  
the magnolium of one who rises  
in me in a land or fluttering to a son.  
The decadent eddy that entertains in your promise.  
Shall we set forth? This weak kis and trusting acrobat executes me  
with it's manly starlights like lip and eye  
and dull shades of sand-colored fragrances of strawberry like hand and hats.  
But the bell lived the memory.
