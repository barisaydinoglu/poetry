Study Without The Enemy
-----------------------
A loaf of bread baked with explosive purity and salt.  
Shut out and pulled out like a wine bottle.  
Only thirsty and to a  
stranger they take on time, too many to count years  
How perching is the essential wounded soldier and it's irreducable flasks?  
The order of the forests mutate me and let my substance  
shine.  
The browbeaten pheasant re-covers in the hopeful holes.  
To the aromatic scrupulous sea water velvety, silken snow!  
You say, what is the leaf waiting for in its cashmire law?  
I tell you it is waiting for pencil like you.  
And river banks and curtains.  
Nothing but your electric eyelids.  
Return to the homeland of the horses.  
A line segment among a loop,  
the boney workings of starry law.  
If I could continue the panic and the boulevard.  
Conversations of starry skies, the recitation  
of circuss we call acerb warmth of your body.  
Which is a moonlit river bank of directions  
too many to count or too few to count, preserved  
on a cinnamon lake or in the moonlit stars in the sky  
directions of the mouth, a calculation in your lips.  
Pencil of an attacked brutal grape.  
For pasture was lewd and morally neutral.  
Next to cinnamon water and cinnamon veins.  
It wakes like a leaf outside the horse.  
  
Among the black confusion of the jugular.  
It transforms like a umbrella outside the quiver.  
  
Somebody here is waiting for the next forest.  
Foam. You kissed yourself for relaxing.  
A kiss -like cadaver  
draw from it the fuming  
detail of its own projection.  
  
The wet-winged lake that wakes in your magnolium.  
What steals  
the props of honor?
