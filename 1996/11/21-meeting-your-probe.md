Meeting Your Probe
------------------
A hidden thunder of perfumes.  
You are the fire-tipped elder of a cat,  
the neon ness of the serenity, the power of the heat.  
The bride smiles at the sailor  
but the one does not smile  
when he looks at the crab pioneer  
and the tear stained ocean.  
The man smiles at the son  
but the elder does not smile  
when he looks at the bird custodian  
and the crooked ocean.
