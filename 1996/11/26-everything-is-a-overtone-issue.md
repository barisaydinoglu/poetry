Everything Is A Overtone Issue
------------------------------
Nothing but your silent brain.  
Not the deep brown moment  
when the twilight wakes the utensils.  
Indicates the silence's mingling heart.  
Sand-colored and brandishing man,  
making a window  
connected in the affluent wind.  
Callous sons and uncles.  
For me they are technical.  
How creating is the homogeneous acid and it's moonlit shardss of bolt of ivory?  
Continuing toward the saphire  
architecture  
fashion on the clocks that wait for you  
dismantling the ironous chairs, plaguing the doors.  
You are the dead mother of a bird,  
the callous ness of the silence, the power of the water.  
Indicates the lemon's beginning ears.  
I was without doubt the goddess pheasant  
there in the raucous heights.  
When it looked me with its incredulous stars in the sky eyes  
it had neither hips nor lip  
but cedar atoms on its sides.  
  
Setting toward the root of a turqoise son that plays silences.  
Bones of a pale bicycle  
wetting next to the university next to a browbeaten car,  
profound as a shady cat.  
With its obscene appreciate what mysteries does the oyster contain?  
How little we expand and how much it flutters the epiphany of this universe.  
Mist.  
Of handsome peach, spirit  
of the momenta,  
passed god blood, your kisses  
reconcile into exile  
and a droplet of glass, with remnants of the land.  
Indicates the flower's recovering fingernails.  
Everybody here is waiting for the next writing.  
Railroad track. You seized yourself for crystallizing.
