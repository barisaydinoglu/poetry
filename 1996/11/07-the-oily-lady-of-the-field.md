The Oily Lady Of The Field
--------------------------
Weak sunrise and the whirlwinds of path  
electrify at the walls of my house.  
Sometimes a piece of the water  
drowns like a femininity in my curves.  
In the smallest ivory momentum it is a tale of silent abberations you say, what is the book waiting for in its marine wine bottle?  
I tell you it is waiting for pencil like you.  
A rain of sweetness an odor has enchanted against the telegraph,  
a mixture of flask and body, a breathing  
friendship that brings agony.  
This obscene sea water and perfuming book prosecutes me  
with it's friendly evening stars like finger  
and curves  
and black grapes like hand and umbrellas.  
My heart is filled with respect like a cedar aspen.  
Towards those sea shells of yours that wait for me.  
From her  
heart and her fingernails mix  
autumns of the earth.  
Around the heights I like to reconcile like a sterile awe.  
When you develop like pasture performed by the lava.  
Swimming a silence  
divulged in the resolute rain.  
A echo focuses its dream of a ending, its new ending, the beginning of the springtime order -  
its winged explications.  
A marine flute grows.  
The fortnight necklaces you in its mortal jungle.  
  
You dedicate in the room as in a irreducable archipeligos.  
Conversations of flutes, the recitation  
of wells we call enduring knave.  
You fly my atrocious lightning  
like a loving tiger to fresh orange.  
A loaf of bread baked with  
tremulous purity and salt.  
Amid the sand-colored curves of the clay.  
Draw from it the harsh  
Point of view of its own detail.  
I do not decay in the thicket of disintered error.
