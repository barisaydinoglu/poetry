The Point Of View Has Not Changed The Promise
---------------------------------------------
I do not mourn in the jungle of crooked wound. Noone here is waiting for the next miracle.  
Mist. You mingled yourself for shining.  
A exiled calculation deprives  
even the sanguine  
minor city in study  
to which the metaphor  
will not be carried.  
  
Like moldy bananas deluding outside trousers.  
And windows and branches.
