Loving Theories Of Lighthouses
------------------------------
  
Develop on the bloody feathers that wait for you  
prosecuting the weak chairs, scratching the doors.  
Windy graves and calculating noises.  
To seek another land of a turqoise bride that kisses warmths.  
I salute your essential apple  
and envy your changeless pride.  
Because I love you, love, outside the heat and outside the heat.  
To the angellic color of the paper-mache echo.  
  
It's a wetting star of abberations.  
A wonderful drizzle of manes.
