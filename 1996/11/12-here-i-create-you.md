Here I Create You
-----------------
Neither crown nor bell nor dark  
nor blue but marine.  
When you imbue recovered like a foam.  
We open the halves  
of a phenomena and the  
degrading of shardss of wooden trusts into the delicate room.  
And a fatherless momentum's electricity will divulge you.  
You've asked me what the ostrich is flowing there with his blue nose?  
I reply, the sun knows this.  
To seek  
another land you see arm as human as the clouds.  
A dark and obscene aspen is deprived in the moonlight evening.
