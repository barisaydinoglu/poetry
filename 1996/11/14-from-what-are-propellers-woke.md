From What Are Propellers Woke
-----------------------------
Because I love you, love, within the mud and around the lightning. Of serendipidous sugar, spirit  
of the hooves,  
Deluded lady blood, your kisses  
form into exile  
and a droplet of silk, with remnants of the vicinity.  
Lashed weather, difficult lights like the pencil.  
And the thread to its sea water  
and among the knaves the warm one  
the fisherman covered with soft sun.
