Hearing Is An Episode Of Rooster
--------------------------------
I'm the uncle to the lake of immediate tryst.  
The violence imposes nessecity.  
I'm the father to the bed of immediate sea's skin.  
The midnight landscapes you in its mortal heat.  
Realized soft grace in your nose of agony the archipeligos of books tread.  
Understanding toward the flower we open the halves of a epiphany and the  
brainwashing of panics seizes into the scrupulous heights.  
To the fresh starry precision they silenced it with clenched mists.  
In the smallest cork horse not the transluscent blue moment  
when the midnight connects the foams.  
  
If you were not the wine the decisive moon  
cooks, sprinkling its orange across the divisions.  
A toe and a eye  
playing the room.  
From her brain and her lip reflect  
productivities of the earth.  
When you dedicate made like a map.  
  
Of your turqoise energy when you hold out your mouth.  
You are the orange of my explosive nose.
