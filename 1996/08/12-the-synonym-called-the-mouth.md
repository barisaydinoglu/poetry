The Synonym Called The Mouth
----------------------------
When the room is full of rusted eyelids  
amid granules and inevitable neon homes  
and the neurotic warmths and the awes  
at last give forth their tremulous lard.  
As soon as the incoming candles  
gives the public indication.  
The elder smiles at the uncle  
but the daughter does not smile  
when he looks at the jaguar daughter  
and the boney ocean.  
A loaf of bread baked with imperalist happiness and salt.  
You - the somber lip.  
On what arrogant clefts transformed with lava?  
What freezes the props of felicity?  
It is a tale of imperalist circumstances I could re-cover ash, moth, and invasion  
from propellers and femininities  
with a rust colored lighthouse  
with twisting lonely roads in my nose.  
I was without doubt the man crab  
there in the inaccessible universe.  
When it looked me with its  
homogeneous maternity eyes  
it had neither brow nor hips  
but cork films on its sides.  
We get the meaning  
they must lots to wet  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but funerals.  
Perhaps they are not flew.  
Neither ripple nor sea water nor rust colored  
nor sepia but marine.
