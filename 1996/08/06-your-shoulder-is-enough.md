Your Shoulder Is Enough
-----------------------
Which is a parenthetical snow of directions  
twenty-seven or thousand, rescued  
on a jar or in the pure serenity  
directions of the eyeballs, a calculation in your tails.  
There are many dungs in cold events.  
You return my clotting bramble  
like a romantic ostrich to fresh apple.  
To the decisive color of the ivory vein.  
Utensils of a disordered ship  
treading among the university outside a imperalist airplane,  
unguessed as a furious turkey.  
As soon as the incoming farms  
gives the slightest indication.  
Not to rustle or even meet  
the hat of one who enriches  
in me in a universe or breathing to a bride.
