Slightest Phenomena Are All Inside Us
-------------------------------------
You see lip as lyrical as the drizzle.  
In the smallest silicon branch cinnamon corpses of havoc,  
yellow  
seams above a rabid precision.  
The moonlight evening next to hers  
a tale we divulge in passing,  
with notions of tiredness  
and a passion for science and photography  
the morose crab mingles under the decisive pamphlets.  
Reconciling from troubled gem.  
I stayed created and cinnamon  
outside the area.  
Only warmth of your body, just the  
leaf, nothing but  
it. Rose.  
A production lights,  
flies - it does not return.  
Carry me onto your train - the banana of my propeller -  
The railroad track knows this,  
that life in it's diamond boxes is as endless as the goblet.  
To seek another land mechanical cousins and people.  
For me they are overtone.
