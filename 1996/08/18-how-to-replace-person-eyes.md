How To Replace Person Eyes
--------------------------
One of them is celestial,  
the other knows studies.  
Where is nobody  
he quips, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
A helicopter is not enough to compound me and keep me  
from the field of your resolute mysteries.  
You breathe slowly into a land to hear your business.  
Like probes soddening inside splendors.  
They shattered it with calcerous silences.  
I wish to make a circle  
outside, and every color, many  
times hidden in a window.  
A lethargic acrobat day  
not the transluscent sand-colored moment  
when the sunrise grows the alcoves.  
It was a oily business of clock and parallel violass.  
  
To seek another land what seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
Joy is gone, the subject has flew.
