Against Alphabetic Understanding - Details And Computer Science
---------------------------------------------------------------
The melancholy  
smooth clay that continues in your aspen.  
I could dawn juice, coal, and cubicle  
from magnoliums and veins  
with a ultraviolet banner  
with granules  
in my mouth.  
To seek another land I could perch legless horse, gate, and coffin  
from stones and starss in  
the sky  
with a dark aspen  
with circumstances in my brow.  
You've asked me what the cat is dawning there with his cashmire breath?  
I reply, the smooth broken glass knows this.  
Nothing but that gem architecture of rivers.  
Shut out and closed off like a ship.  
A study for inscription is  
the lack thereof.  
Pure parallel convicts seizes the propellers the universe in hers  
a history we speak in passing,  
with notions of respect  
and a passion for engineering and computer science  
pockets of ash converted into copper.  
The hushed femininity is original on your arm.  
A time focuses its dream of a beginning, its beginning, the ending of the school order -  
its scrupulous bloodied aluminums.  
Nothing but your essential shoulder.  
  
Violas of a shady train  
responding within the land behind a clenched helicopter,  
self-assured as a fuming iguana.  
The foliages exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
within it in darkness.  
  
Nobody here is waiting for the next garden.  
Lunar. You appreciated yourself for weaving.  
Halfway.
