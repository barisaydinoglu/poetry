The Study Of Individual Points
------------------------------
All flutes become pamphlets.  
In the first reel, the essential uncle  
is filtered by a stranger. In the second  
reel he returns, to hear and to refresh.  
But the droplet refreshed the memory.  
With the dying croaks.  
You circumscribe headlong into a land to blossom your business.  
Browbeaten brides and fathers.  
For me they are alphabetic.  
And you relinquish like a salt and what filters the props of wonder?  
Where defenders meet  
rituals meet, in front of and outside and the sound  
of brambles, to reach out and dedicate in animosity.  
I'd do  
it for the peace in which you rise  
for the drops of deep brown you've sought.  
From harrowing wind to unrelenting rain,  
hidden serenities drawn by verdure channels, a  
disordered guitar begins to tread.  
Full stop.  
In the face of so many self-productions to positivity.  
Shut up and shut up like a snow.
