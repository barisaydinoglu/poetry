An Equally Arcane Gentleman
---------------------------
Perching a poppy  
returned in the delicious  
wind.  
The night imposes nessecity.  
In the middle of the night like ash.  
In the smallest bolt of gold ribbon a chorus of toucans at twilight un refreshed un devoured  
comes to a halt before a elixir.  
On what acidulous clefts pacified with sky?
