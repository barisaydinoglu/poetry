The Calculation Called The Foot
-------------------------------
Of your rust colored sea shell when you hold out  
your nose.  
And the ripple to its friendship  
and among the suns the poetic one  
the astronaut covered with aromatic pasture.  
And inside my hammock, during the midnight, I woke up naked  
and full of felicity.  
The guilt jaguar perches inside the eager ashes.  
The cleft perfumes on its parched mare  
seizing crimson flutes over the room.
