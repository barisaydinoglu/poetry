Hairy Salt
----------
I want you to travel on my curves.  
You say, what is the evening star waiting for in its cashmire sea shell?  
I tell you it is waiting for flag like you.  
Forming from lethargic silk.  
It was the midnight of the jaguar.  
A airplane is not enough to erupt me and keep me  
from the city  
of your hopeful epiphany.  
And a dilute foliage's wind will set  
you.  
  
It was the fortnight of the cat.  
Amid the marine foot of the heat.
