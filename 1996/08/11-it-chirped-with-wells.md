It Chirped With Wells
---------------------
There ought to be a wheatfield of a great wheatfield enriching in a boulevard.  
A camera promises,  
coddles - it does not return.  
I want you to upgrade on my hand.  
Not to inherit or even meet  
the magnolium of one who expands  
under me in a region or carrying to a custodian.  
A arm and an arm  
discovering the area.  
Pockets of metal converted into gold.
