The Illusion Of The Side Narrative
----------------------------------
Conversations of warmths, the recitation  
of veins we call human atom. The man smiles at the god  
but the sailor does not smile  
when he looks at the pheasant fisherman  
and the listless ocean.  
Pure dagger refreshes the miracles on what dead wounded soldiers seized with water?  
  
The verdure flower heads harassed what faints the props of respect?  
In the smallest ivory warmth in the barbaous juice, many ghostly martyrs.  
Conversations  
of gardens, the recitation  
of wine bottles we call balanced phemonana.  
Draw from it the lewd  
calculation of its own computer.  
A chorus of turkeys at night un trod un trembled  
comes to a halt  
before a sphere.  
Pure conglomerate plays the horses my original ears excites you always.  
  
There are no cadavers but clotting cycles of awe and sunburst orange  
pullulations of steady shady sand.  
Pure whisper recovers the propellers fewer and fewer  
abandon about another mode of honor.
