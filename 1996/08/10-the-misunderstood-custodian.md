The Misunderstood Custodian
---------------------------
Marine and profound cousin,  
so the pure pride lives on in a kiwi,  
the sweet-smelling house of the eddy,  
the irreducable river bank that is starry and soft.  
I stayed drank and blue  
in the field.  
Multitude of coats!  
In and out of the sepia the cinnamon and the cinnamon  
Come with me to the ghost of massacres.
