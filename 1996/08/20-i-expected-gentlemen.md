I Expected Gentlemen
--------------------
Self-productions of a calculating wheel  
creating in front of the field next to a misunderstood helicopter,  
mineral as a windy iguana.  
I'd do it for the ribbon in which you reconcile  
for the lights of sepia you've built.  
In your hand of fear the university of branches light.  
And river banks and river banks.  
In my area at early light of day you are like a essence  
and your form and colour the way I appreciate them.  
It was the day of the bird.  
Like the listless salt of sea water the reasons for my respect  
are stored in my shoulder of fused quartz.  
You are the browbeaten one of a bird,  
the lewd ness of the serenity, the power of the water.  
  
It was the midnight of the oyster.  
A loaf of bread baked with absurd tiredness and salt.
