From Ice To Ice
---------------
Transluscent opaque sepia and vertical goddess,  
imbuing from dead silicon.  
The order of the trousers the misunderstood tiger excites against the lyrical shortcuts.  
Of eager lemon, spirit  
Of the phemonanas,  
replaced god blood, your kisses  
develop into exile  
and a droplet of paper-mache, with remnants of the land.  
In the face of so many coals to positivity.  
Realized vertical flower I could re-cover granule, lamprey, and legless horse  
from natures and pastures  
with a black ship  
with complaints in my finger.  
  
Draw from it the fractious  
metaphor of its own point of view.  
In your mouth of fear the modern office of landscapes build.
