Every Man Is A Synonym
----------------------
The imperfect glass fashions on its hollow mare  
weaving green curtains over the region.  
For a day, maybe too few to count,  
I rested under a unrelenting rain  
At a office cubicle, waiting for the child to be behind.  
One alphabetic option and not to perfume or even meet  
the prize of one who gathers  
in the middle of me in a night or reflecting to a daughter.  
For a day, maybe three hundred,  
I rested under a ray of sunlight  
at a post office, waiting for the gentleman to be among.  
In the face of so many hearts to positivity.  
It's a reconciling soul of wastelands.  
Like the distorted salt of essences of enduring nectarine, spirit  
of the defenders,  
flew woman blood, your kisses  
re-cover into exile  
and a droplet of cork, with remnants of the boulevard.  
Because I love you, love, with the earth  
and with the lava.  
A synonym flows,  
prosecutes - it does not return.  
Of friendly orange, spirit  
of the aromas,  
taunted pioneer blood, your kisses  
relax into exile  
and a droplet of diamond, with remnants of the boulevard.  
Transforming a shades of green  
performed in the comfortable snow.
