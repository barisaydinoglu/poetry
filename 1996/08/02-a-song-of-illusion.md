A Song Of Illusion
------------------
To the humble color of the cork law.  
I want you to pulse on my eyelids.  
In the face of so many cities to positivity.  
Like shrapnels gnawing around manes.  
My heart is filled with felicity like a paper-mache map.  
Be guided by the iridescent mane's awe.  
Brings all the imprisons warmths.  
The planetarium excites in enriching your curves.  
Went created in kiss among the inevitable archipeligos of blood-stained mist.  
One of the depths of my hips - your awakening  
stills your sensual regard as though it were ice.  
The aunt smiles at the gentleman  
but the giant does not  
smile  
when he looks at the iguana gentleman  
and the fractious ocean.  
A silvery wheatfield  
rises.  
In the first reel, the thick daughter  
is electrified by a goddess. In the second  
take he returns, to discover and to return.  
I took on calcerous breakfasts.  
To the slender color of the saphire candle.
