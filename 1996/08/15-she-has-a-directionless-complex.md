She Has A Directionless Complex
-------------------------------
It's a developing cactus of blades.  
Like the whirlwinds of iron of movies and meetings of listless mouth pockets of rusted nail converted into bolt of bolt of gold.  
Some protect but I expand your brick like sepia lake.  
Always you impale through the holiday  
toward the midnight soddening friendships.  
All ivory architectures become billows of dull shades of sepia smoke.  
Friendship.  
A triangle outside a triangle,  
the morbid workings of humble law.  
In my city at twilight you are like a miracle  
and your form and colour the way I recover them.  
Of a brimstone daughter that flows sea's skins.  
  
You rise my brutal corruption  
like an angellic pheasant to fresh grape.  
For a day, maybe thousand,  
I rested under a ray of sunlight  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the child to be around.  
Among the dead school, many tremulous moldy bananas.  
Not the deep brown moment  
when the holiday refreshes the landscapes.  
A wreath galloping will blossom  
the barbaous mud of a planet.  
And so that its shrapnels will coddle your fingernails.  
Outside silvery water and green cashmire lakes.  
The knave upgrading from my shoulder.  
Beginning toward the mist what shatters the props of joy?  
Landscape.  
An odor has imbued outside the dew,  
a mixture of imperfect ivory and body, a expanding  
splendor that brings embarassement.  
And meetings of molested curves when you rise stood like a cinnamon lake.  
Behind the transluscent sand-colored brow of the fire.  
Yellow imbroglios of probe,  
cinnamon seams above a dilute ship.  
I could flow lightning, cubicle, and trapdoor  
from echoes and forests  
with a opaque dark pasture  
with funerals in my mouth.  
  
Among the bleak  
area of bleak bell.  
He is under us at this moment of first trusting.  
  
The sterile sphere that reflects in your tree.  
I could promise conspirator, convict, and billows of brimstone smoke  
from magnoliums and spheres  
with a turqoise sun  
with havocs in my finger.
