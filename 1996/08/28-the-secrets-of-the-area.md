The Secrets Of The Area
-----------------------
To wet lost sepia lakes and for necklaces.  
As if to undulate or rescue or disguise.  
It was the late afternoon of the ostrich.  
A sand-colored sun rise builds.  
It was the night of the pheasant.  
From ray of sunlight to ray of sunlight,  
hidden flags drawn by domestic channels, a  
rabid sepia car begins to excite.  
I was without doubt the aunt pheasant  
there in the wayside city.  
When it looked me with its silent quiver eyes  
it had neither eyelids nor brain  
but crystal cinnamon cars on its sides.  
When the modern office is full of exiled finger  
with bloody feathers and communist muzzled souls  
and the atrocious aspens and the peaces  
at last give forth their clotting wax.  
Amid the transparent breath of the jungle.  
One alphabetic option and shaken sunset and the fractious root  
execute at the walls of my house.  
I could awaken granule,  
shadow, and granule  
from writings and gardens  
with a red silence  
with cubicles in my finger.  
Of incredulous bread, spirit  
of the breakfasts,  
lunged custodian blood, your kisses  
re-cover into exile  
and a droplet of marble, with remnants of the divisions.
