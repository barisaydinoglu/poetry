The Computer Has Not Electrified The Promise
--------------------------------------------
Multitude of forests!  
In and out of the opaque blue the transluscent transluscent sunburst orange and the sand-colored one of them is romantic,  
the other knows identities.  
Where is somebody  
he exclaims, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Around the night I like to breathe like a bleak flint.  
The acrobats exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
in front of it in darkness.  
Motionless pioneers and custodians.  
For me they are aerial.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
Has the field been inherited with curiosities?
