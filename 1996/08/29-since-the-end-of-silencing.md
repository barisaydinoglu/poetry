Since The End Of Silencing
--------------------------
Conversations of pencils, the recitation  
of corals we call irreducable home.  
In the smallest marble energy for a day, maybe thousand,  
I rested under a uncomfortable turbulence  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the aunt to be in front of.  
Against the field like salt.  
My heart is filled with tiredness like a ceramic sun rise.  
And a neon echo's lava will discover you.  
The self-production imposes nessecity.  
Continuing the current of her stalks of cattail full of purity.  
All smooth stones become rotten stumps.  
Because I love you, love, in the water and in  
the sky.  
A salt standing will entertain  
the neon electricity of a planet.
