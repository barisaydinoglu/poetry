Breeding Absent Minded Affection
--------------------------------
You drink my hushed seperation  
like an arcane toucan to fresh lemon.  
Moonlit empire. The quadrangle functions to make an architecture  
to its system.  
Always you replace through the late afternoon  
toward the twilight brainwashing lighthouses.  
A eyelids and an arm  
forming the area.  
For forest was molested and morally negative.  
Conversations of fountains, the recitation  
of miracles we call iridescent saxophone.  
  
You are going  
to ask where are the fill?  
And the sensual productivities?  
And the thunder fresh splattering its wreaths and invading them full of  
archipeligos and cat?  
Full stop.  
Transformed and then conducted in the area.  
An odor has made under the bird feather,  
a mixture of grave and body, a perfuming  
mirror that brings agony.  
When you respond inherited like a tiger.  
You blossom my tremulous bloody feather  
like a plumed iguana to fresh plum.
