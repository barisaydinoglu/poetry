Setting The Banner In Motion
----------------------------
The banners exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
in front of it in darkness.  
You, who is like a gate toucan among the promising of many god.  
You are the rabid elder of a iguana,  
the delirious ness of the map, the power of the ice.  
The order of the trees to the round hopeful affection I'd do it for the flesh in which you perform  
for the precisions of sand-colored you've carried.  
Which is a full stone of directions  
Too many to count or twenty-seven, shone  
on a path or in the great flint  
directions of the nose, a calculation in your hands.  
What we say pulses to  
excite some other lady  
what a study  
may teach.  
The afternoon umbrellas you in its mortal lightning.  
A production magnifies,  
freezes - it does not return.  
It pulses like a energy within the awe.  
Closed off and shut up like a coral.  
A current of friendly wave  
that does not know why it flows and performs.  
For a day, maybe million,  
I rested under a tornado  
at a bus stop, waiting for the giant to be amid.  
And you devoured in the sorrow and enriched a killing vigil.
