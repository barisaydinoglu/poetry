Your Mouth Is Enough
--------------------
Draw from it the delirious  
identity of its own sequence.  
And love and kisses.  
And outside my hammock, during the sunrise, I woke up naked  
and full of love.  
When you develop like necklace heard by the earth.  
A energy focuses its dream  
of a ending, its new ending, the old ending of the fountain order -  
its sensible conglomerates.  
Uncle of the depths of my hips - your galloping  
stills your aquatic regard as though it were clay.  
The hidden echo gave it sincerity.  
The smooth dignity of the aroma!  
Pockets of broken glass converted into saphire.
