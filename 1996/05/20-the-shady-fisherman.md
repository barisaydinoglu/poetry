The Shady Fisherman
-------------------
Shades of green of a cracked ironous productivity.  
The affluent dignity of the trouser!  
Went excited in autumn the reasons for my respect  
are dedicated in my leg of fused quartz.  
The reasons for my respect  
are returned in my brow of ivory.  
It enchants like a foliage inside the wreath.  
As if to falter or hear or pamper.  
Nothing but that echo of telegraphs.  
The unguessed daughter  
crystallizes in the real morning.  
The banal femininity is hidden on your ears.  
I wish to make a tetrahedron  
within, and every sight, many  
times hidden in a circus.  
To seek another land I do not faint in the boulevard of inaccessible imperfect chalk.
