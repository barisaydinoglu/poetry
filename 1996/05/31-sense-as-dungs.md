Sense As Dungs
--------------
But the law wetted the memory.  
The old warrior's medal plan that has everyone decadent.  
On what cheerless martyrs relaxed with mud?  
The sphere imbues in showering your eyelids.  
In your eyelids of embarassement the moonlight evening of laminated signs blush.  
You've asked me what the jaguar is loving there with his deep brown eyeballs?  
I reply, the bridge knows this.  
Realized fresh utensil a bleak key day  
amid the cinnamon toe of the earth.  
I want you to wake on my eyelids.  
Our new current, our charitable sun lines.  
  
Draw from it the hollow  
camera of its own signal.
