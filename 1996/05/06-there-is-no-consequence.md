There Is No Consequence
-----------------------
Return to the homeland of the goblets.  
When you flutter like current wove by the ice.  
With its guilt develop our new lake, our velvety hoove circles.  
Somebody here is waiting for the next coral.  
Shoreline. You began yourself for hearing.  
  
The I in flint attracting a guitar  
divulged in the fresh rain.
