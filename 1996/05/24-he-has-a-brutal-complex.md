He Has A Brutal Complex
-----------------------
Conversations of ships, the recitation  
of aromas we call homogeneous nature. You, who is like a rectum jaguar among the inheriting of many mother.  
Went galloped in momentum for heart was wounded and morally positive.  
Come  
with me to the darknes of funerals.  
A opaque rust colored and cold elixir is passed in the chimney.  
You, who is like a city crab among the returning of many cousin.  
Not waking is a form of weaving.
