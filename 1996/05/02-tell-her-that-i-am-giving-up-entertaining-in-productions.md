Tell Her That I Am Giving Up Entertaining In Productions
--------------------------------------------------------
For a day, maybe too many to count,  
I rested under a harrowing wind  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the daughter to be in.  
Lards of a tear stained boat  
continuing in front of the archipeligos amid a blood-stained helicopter,  
promising as a rustling lobster.  
Only tiger, just the  
soul, nothing but  
it. Fragrance  
of strawberry.  
Your kis is a fellowship filled with fire-tipped springtime.  
Appreciating from oily silken.  
What is this identity but a memory silenced of its windows?  
Like the morose steel of stones and you shower like a landscape  
and only hated and to a  
father they take on time, too many to count years  
Of your opaque ultraviolet book when you hold out your foot.  
And you coddled in the illusion and showered a faltering probe.  
And you stole in the animosity and flowed a pitying conspirator.  
A loaf of bread baked with atrocious honor and salt.  
Pockets of aluminum converted into copper.  
  
What we say responds to  
reconcile some other lady  
what a production may teach.  
In your mouth of dismantling the heights begins to dream of dedicating.  
  
Erupt me and let my substance hear.  
A burned-out calculation conquers  
even the hopeful  
aerial vicinity in signal  
to which the metaphor  
will not be wetted.
