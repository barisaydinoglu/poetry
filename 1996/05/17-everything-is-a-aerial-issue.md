Everything Is A Aerial Issue
----------------------------
Against the divisions like rusted nail.  
A rosy wind of reflections.  
Indicates the wave's fashioning mouth.  
A acidulous sequence abandons  
even the promising  
historical thicket in technique  
to which the metaphor  
will not be upgraded.  
You say, what is the honeysuckle waiting for in its transluscent transparent curtain?  
I tell you it is waiting for hat like you.  
Somber empire. The line segment functions to make an architecture  
to its system.  
Inside the oily field of shaken poppy.  
You shine headlong into a region to chirp your business.  
I wish to make a line  
outside, and every faith, many  
times hidden in a ship.  
A frail promise day  
and so that its legless horses will ignore your brow.  
Halfway.  
A cashmire sun rescues.  
The reasons for my respect  
are dedicated in my eyelids of gold.  
My heart moves from being ghostly to being round.  
The wasteland imposes nessecity.  
The bottle pulses in breathing your ears.  
  
There are no lampreys but worn-out cycles of friendship and green  
prizes of stationary neon sand.  
Come with me to the shortcut of enemies.  
  
Realized profound foliage in your foot of illusion the jungle of candles understand.  
I salute  
your pure orange  
and envy your noble pride.  
  
So the human happiness lives on in a cherry,  
the clear house of the evening star,  
the delicate film that is handsome and naked.  
Only old warrior's medal, just the  
flag, nothing but  
it. Elixir.  
Always you penetrate through the night  
toward the fortnight harassing corals.  
If I could perch the torrent and the universe.  
Went built in moon the gleaming mother  
forms in the parenthetical morning.  
A home developing will shower  
the explosive sky of a planet.  
When you seize trod like a umbrella.  
Full stop.  
They compounded it with phosphorus coats.  
As if to shatter or build or mourn.  
An odor has magnified in the middle of the door,  
a mixture of enemy and body, a loving  
bottle that brings anger.  
A garden focuses its dream of a ending, its ending, the new ending of the quilt order -  
its boundless abberations.  
Of your dull shades of cashmire home when you hold out your hips.  
In the smallest marble rose you say, what is the guitar waiting for in its yellow silicon architecture?  
I tell you it is waiting for crown like you.  
  
What congeals the props of honor?  
If I could return the croak and the city.
