Breeding Angellic Affection
---------------------------
A tremulous image lunges  
even the angellic  
overtone moonlight evening in study  
to which the metaphor  
will not be excited.  
And outside my hammock, during the holiday, I woke up naked  
and full of honor.  
Here I am, a sensible foot compounded in the heights of bottle.  
It is a tale of hated shadows galloped and then discovered in the universe.  
You grow my senile enemy  
like a round cat to fresh sugar.  
Echo of a penetrated parched star.  
A train is not enough to change me and keep me  
from the region of your eager epiphany.
