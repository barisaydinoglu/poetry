A Lemon
-------
Burnt umber cummerbunds of yeast,  
yellow seams above a lashed banner.  
In the undulating shadows.  
Crystallizing a grace  
recovered in the manly snow.  
For a day, maybe too many to count,  
I rested under a uncomfortable turbulence  
at a post office, waiting for the father to be around.  
  
If you were not the orange the slender moon  
cooks, sprinkling its sugar across the universe.  
Full stop.  
It was a skeleton business of torrent and eternities.  
The lighthouse conducting from my finger.  
Dawning from bitter silken.  
Where muscles meet  
aspens meet, within and behind and the sound  
of howls, to reach out and mix in confusion.  
The domestic dignity of the path!
