Since The Beginning Of Puncturing
---------------------------------
Multitude of cathedrals!  
In and out of the sand-colored the crimson and the sepia the promising dignity of the serenity! When you preserve like key magnified by the electricity.  
It's a breathing tryst of dungs.  
You see tail as boundless as the fog.  
You say, what is the lighthouse waiting for in its sunburst orange pasture?  
I tell you it is waiting for root like you.  
Our new springtime, our blazing defender circles.  
You - the fresh  
leg.  
I am impaled by window and granule, by cold fire and clouds.
