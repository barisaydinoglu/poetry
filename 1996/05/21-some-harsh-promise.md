Some Harsh Promise
------------------
The necklace plan that has everyone fuming. A lonely  
snow day  
in the smallest copper map someone here is waiting for the next time.  
Quilt. You sought yourself for creating.  
From her leg and her fingernails refresh  
mists of the earth.  
  
You - the sensual heart.  
My heart is filled with respect like a gold salt.
