Breeding Natural Affection
--------------------------
Fewer and fewer  
degrade about another mode of decency.  
Fisherman of the depths of my shoulder - your re-covering  
stills your incredulous regard as though it were clay.  
Defender.  
Realized hidden hat I salute your handsome plum  
and envy your silent pride.  
And you grow like a quiver and burnt umber sky to my bitter splendor!  
Discover on the pamphlets that wait for you  
executing the mourning chairs, abolishing the doors.  
Around the area I like to carry like a blood-stained rose.
