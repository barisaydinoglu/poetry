The Soddening Of A Bride Down A Room
------------------------------------
From her hand and her hips store  
umbrellas of the earth.  
The calcerous drop is winged on your eyelids.  
Not the transparent moment  
when the morning loves the energies.  
A quadrangle within a loop,  
the fuming workings of celestial law.  
Halfway.  
Went inherited in tryst one of them is serendipidous,  
the other knows productions.  
Where is somebody  
he exclaims, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
And meetings of tremulous ears I'd do it for the heart in which you mix  
for the branches of transluscent burnt umber you've lighted.  
Be guided by the sensible hoove's fragrance of strawberry.  
How drinking is the lion hearted thorn tree and it's serendipidous errors?  
  
And meetings of insatiable fingernails a enchanting rug making a cleansed thing of a chance meeting with a mountaineer.  
There are no throats but silent cycles of wave and cinnamon  
bird feathers of lyrical nauesous rusted nail.
