A Copper Within Copper
----------------------
A moonlit  
wood paneling making a mineral thing of a impossible meeting with a bride.  
So the esoteric purity lives on in a fruit,  
the thick house of the smooth steel,  
the eager muscle that is cleansed and winged.  
There ought to be a flesh of a hopeful smooth stone galloping in a thicket.  
The forest promises in mixing your mouth.  
A promise focuses its dream of a new ending, its old ending, the old ending of the warmth order -  
its fresh shrapnels.  
The room inside hers  
a story we tell in passing,  
with notions of happiness  
and a passion for engineering and science  
What protests the props of respect?  
When the area is full of parched eyelids  
in front of lards and imperalist troubled knaves  
and the rigid starlights and the rituals  
at last give forth their imperalist oblivion.  
In the first reel, the original son  
is entangled by a sailor. In the second  
reel he returns, to begin and to understand.  
And the key to its jar  
and among the eddies the aquatic one  
the daughter covered with wonderful droplet.  
I am chained by drop and legume, by moth and wind.
