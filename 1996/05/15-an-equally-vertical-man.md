An Equally Vertical Man
-----------------------
Once there was a hollow stranger who  
reconciled at parties, sitting in a square, among  
doors.  
All doors become pamphlets.  
A thirsty detail mutates  
even the wonderful  
algorithmic vicinity in detail  
to which the metaphor  
will not be trusted.  
Sand-colored vinegars of wounded soldier,  
blue seams above a shady planetarium.  
The kis protects in kissing your hand. Towards those maps of yours that wait for me.  
Nothing but your sensible mouth.  
Draw from it the silent  
computer of its own metaphor.  
Starry empire. The line segment functions to make a environment  
to its system.
