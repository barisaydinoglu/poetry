Sticks About The Production He Inherited
----------------------------------------
A rust colored and difficult root is condemned in the region.  
My heart is filled with pride like a silk wreath.  
In your toe of embarassement the moonlight evening of lunars enrich.  
And meetings of troubled ears the nauesous echo that transforms in your blue lake.  
To seek another land child of the depths of my hand - your rising  
stills your changeless regard as though it were mud.  
The lake knows this,  
that life in it's glass boxes is as endless as the phemonana.  
And meetings of silent brow I saw how awes are pulsed  
by the cordial muscle.  
A current of acerb shades of sepia  
that does not know why it flows and  
begins.  
Against the negligent universe of crooked mirror.  
With its wounded carry under the room like ash.  
Some blush but I protect your salt like kiss.  
  
And the current to its breakfast  
and among the essences the natural one  
the sailor covered with stationary guitar.  
The starry sky knows this,  
that life in it's silken boxes is as endless as the ribbon.
