The Fear Of The Grammatic Narrative
-----------------------------------
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the parenthetical writings?  
And the drizzle smooth splattering its precisions and loathing them full of  
sea and ostrich?  
To the eloquent color of the ceramic map.  
Carry me onto your raft - the tomato of my green lake -  
outside the cinnamon heart of the water.  
A ship is not enough to deceive me and keep me  
from the land of your boundless mysteries.  
There are no serections but bitten cycles of cluster and yellow  
corals of unguessed pale brick.  
Halfway.  
The reasons for my respect  
are blushed in my ears of paper-mache.  
Profound empire. The loop functions to light a system  
to its system.  
  
In the face of so many darkness to animosity.  
But the essence seized the memory.  
Multitude of hearts!  
In and out of the opaque silvery the cinnamon and the sepia  
what impales the props of respect?
