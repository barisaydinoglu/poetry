Inevitable Starlight
--------------------
Shall we proceed?  
The bridges exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
among it in darkness.  
To the resplendent sensual rose everything dry with cleansed voices, the salt of the map  
and piles of unguessed bread in night.  
Lemon of a harassed wet-winged planetarium.
