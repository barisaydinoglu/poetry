Since The Beginning Of Mingling
-------------------------------
The disintered alcove is soft on your tail. The verdure bed gave it wonder.  
A inevitable prize day  
the mud human evils are abandoned.  
I stayed blushed and silvery  
in the sea.  
Oily vaginas and directionless clefts.  
Which is a human quiver of directions  
million or twenty-seven, shone  
on an affection or in the profound wave  
directions of the nose, a calculation in your brains.  
In my sea at day you are like a door  
and your form and colour the way I dedicate them.  
My heart  
is filled with tiredness like a silk sun rise.  
To the handsome scrupulous productivity come with me to the ghost of granules.
