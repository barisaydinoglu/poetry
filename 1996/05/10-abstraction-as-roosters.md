Abstraction As Roosters
-----------------------
Boneless aunts and fathers.  
For me they are side. A green bed drinks.  
A point of view for sequence is the lack thereof.  
  
An odor has lived in the middle of the form,  
a mixture of seperation and body, a rescuing  
dew that brings animosity.  
The conglomerate imposes nessecity.
