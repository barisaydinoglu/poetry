Rusted Thread

We get the sight  
they must lots to blossom  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but wounded soldiers.  
Perhaps they are not crushed.  
It understands like a love amid the pencil.  
A inevitable identity entangles  
even the profound  
side night in metaphor  
to which the metaphor  
will not be connected.  
Not exciting is a form of dawning.  
On what weak flasks rescued with sky?  
The praise breathing from my curves.  
An odor has flowed among the land,  
a mixture of torrent and body, a crystallizing  
forest that brings animosity.  
Because I love you, love, next to the water and outside the lava.  
So the deedy felicity lives on in a lemon,  
the nocturnal house of the foam,  
the resplendent splendor that is indespensable and fleeting.
