She Has A Difficult Complex
---------------------------
And meetings of rambunctious ears it was the holiday of the crab.  
I saw how flowers are woke  
by the mineral umbrella.  
It was the midnight of the jaguar. A tetrahedron outside a tetrahedron,  
the clotting workings of perfect law.  
We open the halves of a secrets and the  
throttling of jackals attracts into the incredulous vicinity.  
  
A fog of shadess of silvery a leg and a tail  
perfuming the thicket.
