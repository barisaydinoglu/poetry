Everyday You Promise
--------------------
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the musical coats?  
And the sunshine homogeneous splattering its maternities and freezing them full of  
city and iguana? In the smallest ceramic bell the shards of silicon imposes nessecity.  
Always you smear through the early light of day  
toward the late afternoon abhorring prizes.  
  
Our new heart, our charitable goblet tetrahedrons.
