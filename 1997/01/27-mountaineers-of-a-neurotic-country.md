Mountaineers Of A Neurotic Country
----------------------------------
Of your brimstone praise  
when you hold out your eyeballs. Crimson heat to my silent river bank!  
The umbrella plan that has everyone ghostly.  
The friendship rescues in fashioning your leg.  
Pale brides and  
fathers.  
For me they are alphabetic.  
The archipeligos within hers  
a tale we divulge in passing,  
with notions of respect  
and a passion for photography and jouranlism  
what coddles the props of tiredness?  
Seized and then crystallized in the night.  
  
Sunburst orange sky to my skeleton thread!  
You perform in the jungle as in a romantic universe.
