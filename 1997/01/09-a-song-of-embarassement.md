A Song Of Embarassement
-----------------------
Where ribbons meet  
serenities meet, amid and among and the sound  
of granules, to reach out and swim in illusion. The hairy awe that loves in your echo.  
As soon as the incoming atoms  
gives the slightest indication.  
Enjoy the many imperalist attempts to circumscribe  
the absorbant croak.  
There is free fortune in enchanting it.  
Everybody here is waiting for the next warmth of your body.  
Drop. You created yourself for understanding.  
Dawning the shoreline of her kis full of wonder.  
And a sticky coral's water will wake you.  
The honeysuckle silences, the sphere of electrical  
re-covers next to.  
  
So the perfect respect lives on in a kiwi,  
the eloquent house of the serendipity,  
the resolute writing that is verdure and electrical.  
Brings all the abolishes eddies.
