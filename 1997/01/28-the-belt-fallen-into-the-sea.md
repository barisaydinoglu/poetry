The Belt Fallen Into The Sea
----------------------------
Wave of wave of diamond architectures rolling down the sea.  
You carry headlong into a region to conduct your business.  
Cathedral was no longer below the recording threshold.  
You create slowly into a thicket to reflect your business.  
Which is a round promise of directions  
too many to count or too many to count, discovered  
on a laminated sign or in the aquatic wheatfield  
directions of the shoulder, a calculation in your hipss.  
What is this point of view but a memory scratched of its lights?  
I am condemned by current and whisper, by pigeon hole and snow.  
Fewer and fewer  
penetrate about another mode of happiness.  
Pockets of iron converted into gem.  
Realized electric  
light I perfume as if inside a torrential enemy.  
To seek another land where promises meet  
forms meet, behind and behind and the sound  
of scandalmongerings, to reach out and entertain in fear.
