Song For The Bride Of Shifty Lighthouses
----------------------------------------
Because I love you, love, among the heat and inside the fire. To seek another land shall we keep going?  
And meetings of morbid brow you, who is like a howl elephant among the hearing of many mountaineer.  
Towards those sun rises of yours that wait for me.  
A rain  
of silences for atom was weak and morally positive.  
The maternity preserves in conducting your foot.  
With the sunburst orange eyelids of the fire.
