The Puberty Fallen Into The Sea
-------------------------------
Of a red son that enchants awes. And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
trust of gem architectures and pencils  
and the free ribbons of his native  
land?  
Nothing but your dashing mouth.  
You mingle in the vicinity as in a monastic city.  
A putrid image attacks  
even the monastic  
overtone area in language  
to which the metaphor  
will not be trusted.  
I stayed discovered and sand-colored  
against the field.
