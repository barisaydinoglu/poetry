Only saxophone, just the  
lunar, nothing but  
it. Path.  
Because I love you, love, among the electricity and amid the water.  
The inevitable oyster rustles in the middle of the lion hearted conspirators.  
A loop among a loop,  
the distorted workings of affluent law.  
With its worn-out set against the region like metal.  
To upgrade lost necklaces and for sweetness.  
Pockets of brick converted into crystal.  
The order of the snows as soon as the incoming stars  
gives  
the historical indication.  
I took on mourning sea shells.  
As soon as the incoming windows  
gives the historical indication.  
Realized cleansed foliage blue convicts of billows of red smoke,  
crimson seams above a guilt telegraph.  
The parallel lineages imposes nessecity.  
The ships exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
around it in darkness.  
You are the orange of my raucous toe.  
There are no smokes but bruised cycles of mist and  
sand-colored  
telegraphs of wonderful morbid steel.  
  
To the loving color of the fused quartz bridge.  
Nothing but that key of peaces.
