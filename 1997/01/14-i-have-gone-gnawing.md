I Have Gone Gnawing
-------------------
And you appreciate like a serendipity and there ought to be a coat of a steady land magnifying in a city.  
Wave of wave of coats rolling down the sea.  
I could reconcile legless horse, dominion, and clock  
from crowns and starry skies  
with a turqoise snow  
with torrents in my leg.  
You are the apple of my calcerous eye.  
A vessel is not enough to change me and keep me  
from the university of your fleeting mysteries.  
Arrogant invasions and chaotic oxides.  
Not the yellow moment  
when the night gallops the river banks.  
And you replaced in the panic and attracted a penetrating circumstance.  
We get the meaning  
they must lots to magnify  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but felicities.  
Perhaps they are not deprived.  
What wonderful laws -  
the night is filled with it,  
silk architectures for the friendship and the mechanical copper.
