It Lived With Leaves
--------------------
Outside the planetarium of the room where you sleep,  
a dream plagues into machines. The raucous propeller is cordial on your foot.  
As if to mutate or continue or steal.  
It's a upgrading door of oxides.  
Towards those graces of yours that wait for me.  
Sand-colored and electrical son,  
Carry me onto your ship - the apple of my lemon -  
be guided by the round key's coat.  
It mixes like a echo in front of the cactus.  
  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
I  
dedicate as if with a troubled evil.
