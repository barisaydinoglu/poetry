Everyday You Grow
-----------------
You are the tomato of my tremulous nose.  
What phenomena does the iguana contain?  
How little we awaken and how much it circumscribes the secrets of this computer simulation.  
The man smiles at the goddess  
but the one does not smile  
when he looks at the jaguar stranger  
and the whirlwinds of ocean.  
For a day, maybe too few to count,  
I rested under a uncomfortable turbulence  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the lady to be in.  
Only banner, just the  
pencil, nothing but  
it. Book.  
A writing focuses its dream of a ending, its beginning, the old ending of the film order -  
its indespensable dusts.  
Electrical empire. The triangle functions to transform an architecture  
to its architecture.  
Of incredulous nectarine, spirit  
of the lights,  
abhorred gentleman blood, your kisses  
respond into exile  
and a droplet of ivory, with remnants of the room.  
I stayed rustled and opaque sunburst orange  
behind the thicket.  
Which is a eloquent candle of directions  
twenty-seven or thousand, stood  
on a salt or in the irreducable book  
directions of the brain, a calculation in your earss.  
When you tread like fragrance of strawberry played by the ice.  
  
He is in the middle of us at this moment of first hearing.
