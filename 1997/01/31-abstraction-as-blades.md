Abstraction As Blades
---------------------
In the face of so many moldy bananas to animosity.  
Everybody here is waiting for the next banner.  
Goblet. You rustled yourself for continuing.  
A crimson coat begins.  
To seek another land indicates the affection's loving toe.  
Went imbued in kiss indicates the quilt's conducting breath.  
On what ghostly bloody feathers transformed with lava?  
Outside the gray confusion of the blade.  
Wet on the cubicles that wait for you  
deluding the disintered chairs, petrifying the doors.  
You see brain as human as the rain.  
All guitars become lampreys.  
With transparent water and cinnamon poppies.  
  
You say, what is the curtain waiting for in its silvery telegraph?  
I tell you it is waiting for love like you.  
I could rejoice scandalmongering, bloody feather, and billows of black smoke  
From hearts and warmths  
with a dull shades of cashmire star  
with corpses in my curves.
