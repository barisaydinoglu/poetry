Setting The Path In Motion
--------------------------
So the soft sincerity lives on in a cherry,  
the starry house of the map,  
the eager telegraph that is lyrical and moonlit.  
Has the field been appreciated with mysteries?  
Went rose in forest I took on calculating lands.  
In my land at night you are like a peace  
and your form and colour the way I flutter them.  
I'd do it for the glass architecture in which you entertain  
for the sea water of cashmire you've divulged.
