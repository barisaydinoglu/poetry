The Curiosities Of The University
---------------------------------
Silence me and let my substance expand.  
And so that its seperations will ignore your mouth.  
Around the chimney I like to light like a muzzled telegraph.  
In the middle of the hollow region of mourning productivity.  
Brings all the overflows propellers.  
There are no trash barges but fractious cycles of faucet and blue  
keys of dashing neurotic brick.  
A loaf of bread baked with barbaous honor and salt.
