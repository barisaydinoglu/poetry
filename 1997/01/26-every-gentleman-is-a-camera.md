Every Gentleman Is A Camera
---------------------------
A chorus of elephants at early light of day un fluttered un sobbed  
comes to a halt before a river.  
In the smallest paper-mache necklace behind cinnamon water and transparent wine bottles.  
When the field is full of ironous arm  
inside enemies and barbaous arrogant poppies  
and the frightened roots and the forms  
at last give forth their weak ego.  
Indicates the bird feather's pacifying curves.
