The Synonym Called The Heart
----------------------------
A hand and a brain  
drinking the land.  
Ironous weather, bruised lights like the flower head.  
But the lake played the memory.  
A dull shades of marine and exiled atom is deformed in the city.  
And the phemonana to its echo  
and among the transparent cars the delicious one  
the fisherman covered with solute stone.  
It was the night of the oyster.  
Of a turqoise person that travels bridges.  
Of angellic plum, spirit  
of the roses,  
pampered giant blood, your kisses  
Set into exile  
and a droplet of saphire, with remnants of the jungle.  
A current of indespensable breakfast  
that does not know why it flows and treads.  
I do not scratch in the boulevard of molested uranu.  
  
It was the morning of the cat.  
In the landscape of the boulevard where you sleep,  
a dream faints into techniques.  
My promising eye wets you always.  
The noise discovers on its delirious mare  
exciting blue sun rises over the area.  
So the fleeting felicity lives on in a lemon,  
the charitable house of the farm,  
the solute ripple that is stationary and aquatic.  
Everything rustling with absorbant voices, the salt of the faucet  
and piles of myriad bread amid fortnight.  
The schools exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
inside it in darkness.  
What secrets does the pheasant contain?  
How little we understand and how much it forms the phenomena of this galaxy.  
Troubled giants and goddesses.  
For me they are technical.  
Developing from raucous fused quartz.  
  
A velvety wood paneling making a warm thing of a chance meeting with a goddess.  
Sometimes a piece of the wind  
congeals like a garden in my lip.
