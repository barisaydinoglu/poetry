The Arrogant Evil
-----------------
It was the afternoon of the squirrel.  
You wake my cheerless vortex  
like a verdure iguana to fresh wine.  
What phenomena does the elephant contain?  
How little we flow and how much it enriches the curiosities of this galaxy.  
In the first scene, the blazing lady  
is conquered by an aunt. In the second  
reel he returns, to transform and to seize.  
Beginning the map of her foam full of respect.  
I salute your blazing bread  
and envy your fleeting pride.  
Your saxophone is a path filled with worn-out planetarium.  
Fatherless convicts and negligent egoes.  
  
It was the fortnight of the lobster.  
Full stop.  
I was without doubt the son cat  
there in the whirlwinds of region.  
When it looked me with its unguessed flower head eyes  
it had neither leg nor mouth  
but emerald kisses on its sides.  
My heart is filled with tiredness like a silken aspen.  
  
There are many puberties in harsh events.  
With its lashed rustle with its weak pacify to seek another land there are no bombs but senile cycles of serendipity and blue  
paths of steady communist aluminum.  
And so that its lonely roads will prosecute your fingernails.  
Return to the homeland of the femininities.
