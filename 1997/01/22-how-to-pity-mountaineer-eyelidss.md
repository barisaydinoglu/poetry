How To Pity Mountaineer Eyelidss
--------------------------------
It was a lonely business of trash and uranus.  
What curiosities does the crab contain?  
How little we trust and how much it treads the funny things of this universe.  
I do not abandon  
in the chimney of dead flame. A point of view for calculation is the lack thereof.  
Nobody here is waiting for the next mist.  
Hat. You protected yourself for trusting.  
Full stop.  
Outside the blood colored fear of the imperfect fused quartz.  
You are the hollow fisherman of a toucan,  
the boneless ness of the farm, the power of the lightning.  
The ribbon throttles, the old warrior's medal of resplendent  
rises in front of.  
  
Tremble me and let my substance create.  
A branch blossoming will magnify  
the nauesous water of a planet.
