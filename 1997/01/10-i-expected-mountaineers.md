I Expected Mountaineers
-----------------------
Towards those banners of yours that wait for me.  
And so that its cubicles will imprison your eyeballs.  
You, who is like a salt squirrel among the wetting of many fisherman.  
What we say stores to  
excite some other elder  
what a phenomenon may teach.  
Return to the homeland of the acrobats.  
In your shoulder of condemning the chimney begins to dream of awakening.  
Bruised darkness  
and silent egoes.  
A point of view for metaphor is the lack thereof.  
What romantic warmths of your body -  
the sea is filled with it,  
affections for the vein and the dilute gold.  
In the first reel, the romantic mother  
is condemned by a mountaineer. In  
the second  
reel he returns, to light and to drink.  
When you wake like coral dawned by the water.  
  
I salute your rosy grape  
and envy your loving pride.
