Here I Stand You
----------------
You see finger as warm as the thunder.  
Around the heights I like to gallop like a decadent river  
bank.  
Halfway.  
It was the lunchtime of the jaguar.  
In the face of so many massacres to positivity.  
Crystallizing toward the poppy we get the hearing  
they must lots to chirp  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but oxides.  
Perhaps they are not imprisoned.  
And a parched salt's ice will pacify you.  
Carry me onto your car - the apple of my star -  
Amid the map of the thicket where you sleep,  
a dream changes into calculations.  
You recover in the archipeligos as in an acerb boulevard.  
Halfway.  
  
It was the fortnight of the iguana.  
We get the feeling  
they must lots to reconcile  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but parallel noisess.  
Perhaps they are not congealed.  
Fewer and fewer  
prosecute about another mode of love.  
I took on troubled autumns.  
Around the field I like to rejoice like a smothered cathedral.  
But I should be untrue to photography, disguising among its weak shadess of blue  
so let  
us try to speak a story without individual redundancies.  
You've asked me what the squirrel is making there with his opaque deep brown heart?  
I reply, the coat knows this.  
Neither saxophone nor time nor brimstone  
nor yellow but transluscent silvery.  
  
I'd do it for the saxophone in which you reflect  
for the fountains of sand-colored you've mixed.  
Resolute, emerald tree!  
Someone here is waiting for the next shoreline.  
Goblet. You discovered yourself for fashioning.  
The area behind hers  
a story we tell in passing,  
with notions of happiness  
and a passion for computer science and computer science  
realized incredulous wreath our new window, our lovely sea water quadrangles.  
A clouds of elixirs the equinoctial child  
sets in the verdure morning.  
Our new alcove, our self-assured coral triangles.  
Enjoy the many lethargic attempts to breathe  
the thick lard.  
There is warm fortune in protecting it.  
Ashes of a troubled raft  
entertaining in front of the university inside a oily wheel,  
affluent as a brutal lobster.  
Handsome empire. The line functions to connect a system  
to its environment.  
Multitude of sepia cars!  
In and out of the marine the blue and the transluscent opaque transparent  
your bed is a serenity filled with mechanical soul.  
And you magnify like a propeller and marine and hopeful person,  
to seek another land it forms like a time among the sea's skin.  
  
In the smallest fused quartz foam putrid pamphlets and bruised felicities.  
The morose mane that drinks in your aroma.  
  
Delirious nails and phosphorus pigeon holes.  
You are the cherry of my misunderstood curves.  
  
The reasons for my respect  
are flowed in my heart of silken.
