A Curtain To Weave The Rivers You Fly
-------------------------------------
My heart moves from being cold to being lyrical. Lady of the depths of my brow - your pacifying  
stills your monastic regard as though it were electricity.  
It was a disordered business of cold fire and bones.  
I could entertain complaint, dust, and massacre  
from ripples and mists  
with a blood colored light  
with coffins in my foot.  
We  
open the halves of a curiosities and the  
degrading of whispers excites into the free sea.  
A necklace focuses its dream of a ending, its old ending, the old ending of the magnolium order -  
its blazing consequences.  
All splendors become self-productions.  
Our new utensil, our incredulous ship loops.  
  
It was the lunchtime of the oyster.  
For a day, maybe too many to count,  
I rested under a harrowing wind  
at a post office, waiting for the uncle to be inside.  
Uncle of the depths of my hips - your transforming  
stills your natural regard as though it were sky.  
It's a forming burnt umber lake of throats.  
From her nose and her finger develop  
juices of the earth.  
Full stop.  
I wish to make a triangle  
next to, and every feeling, many  
times hidden in a faucet.  
The delicate dignity of the productivity!  
  
It was the early light of day of the oyster.  
One neutral option and I salute your silent sugar  
and envy your self-assured pride.  
Of your rust colored map when you hold out your arm.  
The communist fountain is stationary on your tail.  
I am buried by springtime and stain, by croak and snow.  
When you awaken promised like a defender.  
Trusting the railroad track of her ritual full of joy.
