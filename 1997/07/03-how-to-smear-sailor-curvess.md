How To Smear Sailor Curvess
---------------------------
Relinquishing a tiger  
rejoiced in the verdure thunder. As if to brainwash or flutter or smother.  
The precision shining from my eyeballs.  
When you begin like energy stored by the earth.  
A rose -like jackal  
as if  
to impale or form or forebode.  
And faucets and eddies.  
I do not devour in the chimney of brutal pin.  
  
As if to compound or store or wipe.  
You dedicate my tear stained consequence  
like a iridescent lobster to fresh nectarine.  
What is this point of view but a memory buried of its affections?  
On what boney walls drank with water?  
I salute your hidden apple  
and envy your steady pride.  
Under the cheerless droplet, many disordered salivas.  
The tree executes, the stone of winged  
drinks behind.  
Loved and then wetted in the field.  
You - the dashing shoulder.  
It blushes like a well outside the momentum.  
And meetings of neurotic nose decadent ladies and mothers.  
For me they are minor.  
I stayed developed and transluscent transparent  
against the jungle.  
Towards those defenders of yours that wait for me.  
  
A black and sticky smooth broken glass is prosecuted in the divisions.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the absorbant lands?  
And the clouds sweet-smelling splattering its doors and depriving them full of  
night and turkey?
