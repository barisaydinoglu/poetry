Metaphor Without The Vagina
---------------------------
Full stop.  
Draw from it the atrocious  
synonym of its own signal.  
Pulsing toward the land for a day, maybe too many to count,  
I rested under a blade of grass  
at a post office, waiting for the cousin to be around.  
Shall we recount?  
A opaque gray and inevitable bottle is drowned in the universe.  
The morning sweetness you in its mortal jungle.  
And behind my hammock, during the morning, I woke up naked  
and full of pride.  
They are all pioneers  
professional vagabonds in whose absent minded atoms originate.  
  
A serendipity -like extinction  
I do not hate in the vicinity of mourning salt.  
You say, what is the snow waiting for in its transluscent sunburst orange aspen?  
I tell you it is waiting for dew like you.  
This disintered mane and discovering miracle mutates me  
with it's naked lights like lip and foot  
and red miracles like eye and knaves. Wave of wave of bird feathers rolling down the sea.  
The earth poetic graves are congealed.  
And movies and doves.  
I could wake uranu, bloodied graphite, and martyr  
from elixirs and stones  
with a turqoise river  
with gates in my shoulder.  
A mechanical trouser day  
And so that its conglomerates will deceive your hand.  
Shall we set forth?  
The clenched silence that makes in your home.
