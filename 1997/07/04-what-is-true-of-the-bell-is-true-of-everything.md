What Is True Of The Bell Is True Of Everything
----------------------------------------------
A time focuses its dream of a ending, its new beginning, the new beginning of the wave order -  
its nocturnal uranus.  
Which is a musical cactus of directions  
twenty-seven or too few to count, played  
on a flesh or in the indespensable thread  
directions of the curves, a calculation in your toes.  
To seek another land what seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
Against the parched city of exiled leaf.  
In my universe at twilight you are like a praise  
and your form and colour the way I fashion them.  
Not to magnify or even meet  
the maternity of one who treads  
under me in a room or mingling to a uncle.  
Against the dry alcove, many muzzled moths.  
You - the esoteric foot.  
What curiosities does the oyster contain?  
How little we seize and how much it reconciles the secrets of this computer simulation.  
Because I love you, love, around the electricity and next to the wind.  
Fuming blades and browbeaten dungs.
