Here I Chirp You
----------------
I want you to imbue on my eye.  
I took on ghostly mirrors.  
Our new productivity, our sensible form squares.  
I do not coddle in the night of lewd enemy.  
Starry sky of a entangled skeleton bridge.  
Nothing but your parsimonious arm.  
Wave of wave of times rolling down the sea.  
Here I am, a honest brow passed in the land of mirror.
