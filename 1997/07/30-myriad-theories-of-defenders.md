Myriad Theories Of Defenders
----------------------------
You rustle my boney moth  
like a resplendent jaguar to fresh peach.  
Always you die through the night  
toward the early light of day erupting apples.  
In the transluscent blue heart of the earth.  
Be guided by the romantic thread's promise.  
When the modern office is full of calcerous curves  
outside stalactites and tenacious sordid veins  
and the communist fellowships and the momenta  
at last give forth their morbid wall.  
In my jungle at day you are like a nature  
and your form and colour the way I drink  
them.  
I do not mutate in the chimney of lewd vagina.
