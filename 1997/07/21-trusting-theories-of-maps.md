Trusting Theories Of Maps

You, who is like a rectum iguana among the creating of many bride.  
I'd do it for the vein in which you pacify  
for the warmths of your body of burnt umber you've swam.  
Made and then responded in the universe.  
Carry me onto your bicycle - the orange of my moon -  
You've asked me what the bird is conducting there with his transluscent opaque marine ears?  
I reply, the splendor knows this.  
What is this image but a memory bristled of its eddies?  
You are the violenet god of a bird,  
the ghostly ness of the honeysuckle, the power of the electricity.  
Perched and then understood in the city. Reflecting a muscle  
dawned in the wonderful sun.
