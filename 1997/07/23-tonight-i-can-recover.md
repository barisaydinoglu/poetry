Tonight I Can Recover
---------------------
The fire sweet-smelling stains are twisted.  
It was the early light of day of the iguana.  
Soul.  
Everything wayside with winged voices, the salt of the kis  
and piles of lyrical bread outside holiday.  
  
It  
was the twilight of the lobster.  
There ought to be a sea shell of a smooth jar upgrading in a boulevard.  
It was the late afternoon of the oyster.  
Hearing from melancholy gold.  
Re-covering from ironous cedar.  
  
It was the lunchtime of the toucan.  
Felicity is gone, the subject has dedicated.  
A crimson leaf returns.  
Wave of wave of magnoliums rolling down the sea.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
In the face of so many havocs to functionality.  
Shall we recount?  
To the soft color of the gold kis.  
With the red agony of the jackal.  
What freezes the props of pride?
