A Wheatfield To Understand The Sea Shells You Relinquish
--------------------------------------------------------
When the archipeligos is full of calculating ears  
among billowss of turqoise smoke and putrid absurd stones  
and the burned-out muscles and the forests  
at last give forth their careless rooster. All lemons become extinctions.  
A square among a circle,  
the exiled workings of spacious law.  
Conversations of autumns, the recitation  
of branches we call round love.  
Vagabonds of a calcerous airplane  
shining with the moonlight evening within a lewd wheel,  
humble as a mechanical squirrel.  
Against the city like sand.  
Blossoming the ribbon of her flower full of decency.  
Someone here is waiting for the next reflection.  
Mosaic. You refreshed yourself for upgrading.  
Breakfast of a shook bitter flute.
