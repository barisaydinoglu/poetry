The Billow Of Black Smoke Fallen Into The Sea
---------------------------------------------
I'd do it for the muscle in which you live  
for the rituals of yellow you've stood.  
With its frightened circumscribe we open the halves of a secrets and the  
pampering of vortices understands into the affluent region.  
Nothing but your clear lip.  
The parsimonious mountaineer  
grows in the winged morning.  
They impaled it with calculating precisions.  
Not circumscribing is a form of crystallizing.  
Not the sunburst orange moment  
when the lunchtime plays the clusters.  
You magnify headlong into a jungle to pulse your business.
