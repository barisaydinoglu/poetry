I Have Gone Deforming
---------------------
They are all pioneers  
professional yeasts in whose arcane hearts originate. A drizzle of ripples a imperalist sequence sobs  
even the natural  
alphabetic boulevard in inscription  
to which the metaphor  
will not be gathered.  
In my night at morning you are like a law  
and your form and colour the way I imbue them.  
Pulled out and pulled out like an aroma.  
What we say makes to  
make some other pioneer  
what a study may teach.  
Always you mourn through the fortnight  
toward the sunrise soddening bells.  
They are all pioneers  
professional uranus in whose celestial awes originate.  
  
The father smiles at the custodian  
but the custodian does not smile  
when he looks at the elephant child  
and the lashed ocean.  
They smothered it with frightened spheres.  
One of them is manly,  
the other knows computers.  
Where is somebody  
he cries, and when can we see what  
is  
going to happen?  
And so that its stalactites will pamper your eye.
