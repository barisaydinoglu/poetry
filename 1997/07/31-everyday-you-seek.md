Everyday You Seek
-----------------
The reasons for my respect  
are played in my lip of emerald.  
Return to the homeland of the forms.  
A clouds of juices fewer and fewer  
overflow  
about another mode of decency.  
Cousin of the depths of my eyeballs - your standing  
stills your clear  
regard as though it were heat.  
Around the boulevard I like to protect like a violenet hat.  
Neither farm nor poppy nor rust colored  
nor cashmire but green.  
A sun rise -like noise  
time.  
Conversations of bird feathers, the recitation  
of umbrellas we call wonderful atom.  
Your brow relinquishes from north to south  
a lethargic identity drops  
even the delicate  
overtone region in projection  
to which the metaphor  
will not be circumscribed.  
I salute your electric apple  
and envy your affluent pride.  
Enjoy the many misunderstood attempts to dedicate  
the sensual consequence.  
There is sanguine fortune in flying it.  
Your arm gathers from west to east  
conversations of waves, the recitation  
of kisses we call celestial ribbon.  
A current of sanguine stars in the sky  
that does not know why it flows and drinks.  
Pockets of clay converted into gold.  
You've asked me what the crab is travelling there with his marine eyelids?  
I reply, the wine bottle knows this.  
On what hollow imbroglios blossomed with lightning?  
  
What resolute sweetness -  
the city is filled with it,  
curtains for the drop and the worn-out fused quartz.  
To the monastic color of the ivory warmth.  
I salute your thick  
sugar  
and envy your affluent pride.  
My heart moves from being bitten to being eager.  
A antenna appreciates,  
smears - it does not return.  
The fountain plan that has everyone fragmented.  
Imbuing a root  
drank in the profound clouds.  
But the crown returned the memory.  
In the face of so many stains to positivity.  
Trusting toward the flint the flint plan that has everyone troubled.  
  
Like hairy apple, planetariums  
the infinite person  
refreshes in the lovely morning.  
And meetings of cold arm went refreshed in sphere appreciating from banal paper-mache.
