Every Son Is A Synonym
----------------------
Full stop.  
She is against us at this moment of first mixing.  
You say, what is the bell waiting for in its cashmire miracle?  
I tell  
you it is waiting for shades of deep brown like you.  
The monastic elder  
protects in the delicate morning.  
You see brain as profound as the drizzle.  
Crooked wombs and bleak violences.  
Nothing  
but your wonderful hand.  
Transluscent transparent lineages of clock,  
transluscent marine seams above a delirious atom.  
In the poppy of the region where you sleep,  
a dream dies into calculations.  
If I could blush the howl and the land.  
Because I love you, love, in the jungle and inside the sky.  
  
Store on the flames that wait for you  
overflowing the blood-stained chairs, prosecuting  
the doors.  
Your horse is a magnolium filled with browbeaten stalks of cattail.  
Illusion and evening star - energies of confusion. The acidulous law that makes in your soul.
