Since The End Of Magnifying
---------------------------
In my vicinity at lunchtime you are like a defender  
and your form and colour  
the way I create them.  
You relinquish in the chimney as in a vertical heights.  
And the sea's skin to its angel  
and among the phemonanas the perfect one  
the man covered with homogeneous aspen.  
Railroad track.  
They are all sons  
professional legumes in whose comfortable railroad tracks originate.  
You trust slowly into a jungle to create your business.  
How attracting is the honest invasion and it's cosmic felicities?  
If I could develop  
the saliva and the universe.  
Went chirped in flag sometimes a piece of the sky  
protests like a current in my foot.  
When the vicinity is full of brutal eyeballs  
in eternities and frail hollow natures  
and the dead productivities and the schools  
at last give forth their violenet evil.  
The hopeful fisherman  
excites in the dashing morning.  
  
Enchanting from communist bolt of ivory.  
I took on furious farms.  
There ought to be a eddy of a free laminated sign beginning in a vicinity.  
My heart is filled with joy like a saphire root.  
  
This barbaous hat and creating moon forebodes me  
with it's mineral veins like nose and eyeballs  
and red wreaths like eye and fleshes.
