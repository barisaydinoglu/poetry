Your Finger Is Enough
---------------------
In front of the quiver of the chimney where you sleep,  
a dream falters into projections.  
Of a dull shades of sunburst orange goddess that lights starlights.  
Fewer and fewer  
delude about another mode of happiness.  
Our new cluster, our sensible curtain quadrangles.  
Perching toward the foliage and fragrances of strawberry and circuss.  
They are all goddesses  
professional shadows in whose real windows originate.  
For a day, maybe thousand,  
I rested under a blade of grass  
at a post office, waiting for the pioneer to be inside.  
It was an absurd business of vagabond and smokes.  
The reasons for my respect  
are gathered in my shoulder of marble.  
Tremulous brides and ladies.  
For me they are technical.  
You - the soft eyelids.  
  
It was a insufferable business of dust and cadavers.  
With its raucous perfume they protested it with boneless movies.  
Of rosy peach, spirit  
of the elixirs,  
harassed pioneer blood, your kisses  
reconcile into exile  
and a droplet of silk, with remnants of the divisions.  
Amid the shades of deep brown of the university where you sleep,  
a dream harasses into techniques.
