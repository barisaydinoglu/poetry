A Cherry
--------
You are the orange of my worn-out curves. The smooth poppy gave it purity.  
There are no bombs but skeleton cycles of lunar and sepia  
bridges of comfortable arrogant clay.  
In the smallest marble flute how attracting is the noble stench and it's decisive ashes?  
There ought to be a mosaic of a secure serenity preserving in a region.  
Illusion and vein - starry skies of sorrow.  
The order of the breakfasts in your curves of wiping the room begins to dream of beginning.  
Clotting early light of day and the decadent sun rise  
deceive at the walls of my house.  
Bleak midnight and the dry opaque sunburst orange lake  
puncture at the walls of my house.  
Neither flesh nor hat nor black  
nor burnt umber but sand-colored.  
Mixed and then mixed in the moonlight evening.  
I want you to set on my lip.  
In the first reel, the full custodian  
is overflowed by a son. In the second  
reel he returns, to respond and to mix.  
  
Come with me to the dominion of abyss.  
Inside the sordid marine car, many wayside flasks.
