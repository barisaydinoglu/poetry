Antenna With The Twisting Lonely Road
-------------------------------------
Come with me  
to the extinction of walls. There ought to be a well of a great quilt circumscribing in a field.  
Like conspirators replacing behind maps.  
  
Like wombs chaining next to ribbons.  
To the enduring color of the gem map.  
If I could gather the smoke and the moonlight evening.  
An odor has pulsed outside the burnt umber car,  
a mixture of legless horse and body, a seeking  
sea water that brings embarassement.  
In the first reel, the cordial mountaineer  
is abducted by a cousin. In the second  
scene he returns, to imbue and to travel.  
We open the halves of a curiosities and the  
disguising of traps mixes into the loving universe.  
Nothing but your dashing arm.
