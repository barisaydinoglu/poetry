The Funny Things Of The Archipeligos
------------------------------------
Realized electric phemonana  
Imbue on the lonely roads that wait for you  
throttling the lonely chairs, replacing the doors. And you flow like a ripple and return to the homeland of the foliages.  
Nobody here is waiting for the next reflection.  
Key. You pacified yourself for weaving.  
Outside the opaque turqoise agony of the rotten stump.  
If you were not the lemon the velvety moon  
cooks, sprinkling its grape across the vicinity.
