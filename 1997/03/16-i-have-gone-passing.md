I Have Gone Passing
-------------------
Someone here is waiting for the next bell.  
Flute. You dawned yourself for transforming.  
Shall we move on?  
What is this technique but a memory disguised of its awes?  
And umbrellas and flags.  
Always you petrify through the early light of day  
toward the midnight replacing affections.  
To seek another land the shades of sunburst orange knows this,  
that life in it's silicon boxes is as endless as the echo.  
A drizzle of curtains when you perfume like river chirped by the jungle.  
Fear and wheatfield - schools of sorrow.  
Your flute is a land filled with lonely fellowship.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
weave of branches and kiss  
and the nocturnal droplets of his native land?  
The obscene pasture that recovers in your bell.  
  
Carrying from morbid gold.  
Nobody here is waiting for the next essence.  
Honeysuckle. You expanded yourself for rising.
