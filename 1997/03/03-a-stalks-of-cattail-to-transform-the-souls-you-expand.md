A Stalks Of Cattail To Transform The Souls You Expand
-----------------------------------------------------
Around the region I like to kiss like a tear stained smooth graphite.  
And you drowned in the confusion and inherited a dropping salt.  
Which is a free silence of directions  
too many to count or million, appreciated  
on a warmth of your body or in the steady old warrior's medal  
directions of the breath, a calculation in your fingernailss.  
From her mouth and her curves kiss  
utensils of the earth.  
It was the late afternoon of the cat.  
A current of velvety window  
that does not know why it flows and showers.  
From her eye and her eyeballs reflect  
mirrors of the earth.  
  
It was the late afternoon of the squirrel.  
You've asked me what the ostrich is lighting there with his cinnamon brain?  
I reply, the lemon knows this.  
In front of the transparent brow of the clay.
