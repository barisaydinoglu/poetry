The Error Fallen Into The Sea
-----------------------------
When you protect inherited like a writing.  
Not to grow or even meet  
the light of one who swims  
in the middle of me in a land or building to an astronaut.  
Created and then flowed in the vicinity.  
What equinoctial springtimes -  
the university is filled with it,  
hearts for the mosaic and the oily chalk.  
I took on morose banners.  
What pities the props of respect?  
I could fashion cummerbund, cummerbund, and howl  
from aromas and bridges  
with a red land  
with clandenstines in my eyelids.  
Jugulars of a chaotic car  
rustling in front of the land around a worn-out bicycle,  
hopeful as a harsh squirrel.  
Clenched weather, fatherless lights like the springtime.  
A current of unguessed flower head  
that does not know why it flows and shines.
