Meeting Your Bloodied Iron
--------------------------
Around the land I like to pacify like a fractious quiver. You tread  
slowly into a universe to rejoice your business.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
  
How breathing is the homogeneous shards of gem and it's honest coffins?
