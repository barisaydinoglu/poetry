Proof Of Stationary Sight
-------------------------
The books exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
among it in darkness.  
Shall we recount?  
Went loved in kiss neither sun nor current nor gray  
nor burnt umber but burnt umber. Not the deep brown moment  
when the sunset enriches the praises.  
To drink lost wheatfields and for waves.
