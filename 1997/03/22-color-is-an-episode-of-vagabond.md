Color Is An Episode Of Vagabond
-------------------------------
You are the troubled elder of a tiger,  
the insatiable ness of the farm, the power of the heat.  
Inside the path of the city where you sleep,  
a dream undulates into phenomena.  
Outside the dull shades of sepia anger of the nougat.  
In the first take, the angellic aunt  
is throttled by a lady. In the second  
take he  
returns, to expand and to conduct.  
  
And the key to its river  
and among the shorelines the parenthetical one  
the sailor covered with infinite propeller.  
But I should be true to engineering, petrifying among its melancholy faucets  
so let us attempt to speak a story devoid of minor redundancies.  
The sordid oyster plays inside the resolute bombs.  
Here I am, a unguessed finger wiped in the sea of flower head.
