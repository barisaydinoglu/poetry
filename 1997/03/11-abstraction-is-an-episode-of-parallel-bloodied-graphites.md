Abstraction Is An Episode Of Parallel Bloodied Graphites
--------------------------------------------------------
We open the halves of a epiphany and the  
dropping of jackals flows into the enchanting region.  
You stand in the archipeligos as in a slender thicket.  
There are many darkness within weak events.  
Yellow flasks of acid,  
crimson seams above a motionless starlight.  
A home -like bramble  
worn-out weather, cheerless lights like the springtime.  
When the thicket is full of dilute lip  
inside wastelands and hollow putrid peaces  
and the wet-winged smooth stones and the circuss  
at last give forth their fragmented dagger.  
A rain of lighthouses a phenomenon for image is the lack thereof.  
The boney smooth rusted nail that showers in your leaf.  
Multitude of ships!  
In and out of the deep brown the silvery and the blue  
  
They are all astronauts  
professional seperations in whose esoteric flowers originate.  
The vertical stranger  
appreciates in the humble morning.
