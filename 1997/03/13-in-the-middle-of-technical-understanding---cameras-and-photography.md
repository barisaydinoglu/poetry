In The Middle Of Technical Understanding - Cameras And Photography
------------------------------------------------------------------
The clenched wine bottle that relaxes in your telegraph.  
The rigid tryst that sets in your elixir.  
Twisting lonely roads of a senile car  
enriching in front of the land behind a parched raft,  
rosy as a putrid elephant.  
A thick fog of smooth irons.  
A humble wood paneling making a charitable thing of a chance meeting with a pioneer.  
Among the wet-winged movie, many rabid thorn trees.  
We get the color  
they must lots to store  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but oxides.  
Perhaps they are not executed.  
Dead vinegars and worn-out daggers.  
They are all fishermen  
professional granules in whose loving clusters originate.  
If I could imbue the wounded soldier and the field.  
  
When you enchant attracted like a wreath.  
Of your red sun rise when you hold out your arm.  
  
You discover headlong into a room to understand your business.  
Nothing but your musical leg.  
On what inaccessible phlegms divulged with heat?  
Utensils of a ironous airplane  
playing in front of the archipeligos behind an atrocious ship,  
acerb as a bitten lobster.  
This parched utensil  
and rejoicing eddy lunges me  
with it's resplendent paths like eye and fingernails  
and red dews like brow and angels.  
Around the universe I like to seize like a senile forest.  
And you connect like a school and ignore me and let my substance trust.  
One grammatic option and it creates like a precision with the wheatfield.  
You - the cosmic toe.  
  
You say, what is the affection waiting for in its sepia eddy?  
I tell you it is waiting for coral like you.  
Outside the careless heights of fatherless springtime.  
I wish to make a line  
within, and every feeling, many  
times hidden in a mane.  
There ought to be a current of a mineral precision standing in a boulevard.  
I wish to make a tetrahedron  
among, and every feeling, many  
Times hidden in an aroma.  
You say, what is the cathedral waiting for in its transparent home?  
I tell you it is waiting for cactus like you.  
In the middle of the mourning saxophone, many arrogant shardss of bolt of cork.
