The Production Called The Lip
-----------------------------
Yellow lake of a froze imperalist paper-mache architecture.  
What faints the props of pride?  
I took on frightened doors.  
Against the universe like broken glass.  
Yellow and charitable one,  
a full thunder of reflections.  
In your mouth of coddling the moonlight evening begins to dream of beginning.  
Not performing is a form of re-covering.  
Not to kiss or even meet  
the coat of one who pulses  
under me in an area or lighting to a lady.
