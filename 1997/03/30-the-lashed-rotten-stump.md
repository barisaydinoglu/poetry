The Lashed Rotten Stump
-----------------------
All starry skies become ghosts.  
And a disordered foam's water will carry you.  
Dedicating a lunar  
circumscribed in the thick rain.  
Halfway.  
How loving is the wonderful throat and it's steady stains?  
If I could attract the coal and the divisions.  
You travel in the moonlight evening as in a poetic room.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the fleeting schools?  
And the drizzle free splattering its knaves and bristling them full of  
jungle and squirrel?  
  
And so that its enemies will coagulate your mouth.  
Your tail seizes from west to north  
bitterest weather, boney lights like the railroad track.  
Full stop.  
The velvety wells changed only sepia lake, just the  
ripple, nothing but  
it. Atom.  
Multitude of awes!  
In and out of the green the marine and the green  
which is a moonlit juice of directions  
million or twenty-seven, connected  
on a bed or in the rosy sea's skin  
directions of the eyelids, a calculation in your curvess.
