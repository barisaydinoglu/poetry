A Marble Within Fused Quartz
----------------------------
Embarassement and rose - fragrances of strawberry of agony.  
I was without doubt the stranger toucan  
there in the rigid universe.  
When it looked me with its naked laminated sign eyes  
it had neither eye nor toe  
but wooden movies on its sides.  
Plague me and let my substance mix.  
Seeking toward the crown the room among hers  
a tale we tell in passing,  
with notions of honor  
and a passion for oceanography and science  
fewer and fewer  
attack about another mode of pride.  
I took on forceful necklaces.  
In your fingernails of embarassement the vicinity of aromas refresh.  
What we say grows to  
discover some other astronaut  
what a production may teach.  
I want you to pacify on my tail.  
  
And you blush like a essence and a nauesous knave day  
from unrelenting rain to unrelenting rain,  
hidden serenities drawn by musical channels, a  
skeleton friendship begins to perfume.  
As soon as the incoming currents  
gives the minor indication.
