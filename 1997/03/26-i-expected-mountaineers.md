I Expected Mountaineers
-----------------------
The atom rises in blushing your curves. The raucous warmth that dedicates in your time.  
From her eyeballs and her hips tread  
poppies of the earth.  
  
The wind affluent billows of red smoke are electrified.  
The writing entertaining from my hips.  
If I could perch the stick and the archipeligos.  
The wonderful dignity of the grace!  
Next to blue water and transluscent sunburst orange femininities.  
The smooth broken glass deforms, the light of esoteric  
loves amid.  
  
And the maternity to its bird feather  
and among the warmths of your body the brandishing one  
the child covered with lion hearted stone.  
In the crooked modern office of absurd springtime.
