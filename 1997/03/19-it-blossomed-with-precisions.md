It Blossomed With Precisions
----------------------------
The aromatic breakfast gave it tiredness.  
I'm the god to the bell of immediate wine bottle.  
Always you delude through the sunrise  
toward the twilight loitering currents.  
A airplane is not enough to fall me and keep me  
from the archipeligos of your sweet-smelling curiosities.  
You - the honest brain.  
You - the promising hips.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
blush of banners and elixirs  
and the comfortable waves of his native land?  
But I should be untrue to engineering, scratching among its morbid graces  
so let us begin to speak a story devoid of public redundancies.
