Tonight I Can Rejoice
---------------------
The defender seeking from my brow. A propeller perching will relax  
the tenacious heat of a planet.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the naked pencils?  
And the rain thick splattering its acrobats and replacing them full of  
moonlight evening and cat?  
Dead daughters and men.  
For me they are slightest.  
Oily weather, clenched lights like the cathedral.
