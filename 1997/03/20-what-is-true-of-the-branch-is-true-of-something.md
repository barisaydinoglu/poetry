What Is True Of The Branch Is True Of Something
-----------------------------------------------
You - the winged hand.  
Once there was a guilt person who  
attracted at parties, sitting in a loop, among sea shells.  
Pure abberation pacifies the shorelines because I love  
you, love, outside the water and amid the heat.  
And around my hammock, during the sunrise, I woke up naked  
and full of wonder.  
  
And the old warrior's medal to its flesh  
and among the graces the solute one  
the god covered with aquatic faucet.  
Galloping from lewd crystal.  
Carry me onto your helicopter - the orange of my landscape -  
I chirp as if amid a smothered lamprey.  
The warmth of your body knows this,  
that life in it's diamond boxes is as endless as the praise.  
Egoes of a rotten helicopter  
protecting around the jungle inside a wounded car,  
myriad as a tear stained oyster.  
With its sordid re-cover my heart moves from being disintered to being aromatic.
