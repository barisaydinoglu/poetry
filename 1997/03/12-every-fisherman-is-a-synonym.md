Every Fisherman Is A Synonym
----------------------------
You've asked me what the toucan is returning there with his transluscent blue shoulder?  
I reply, the thread knows this.  
The moons exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
within it in darkness.  
The muscle knows this,  
that life in it's gold boxes is as endless as the dove.  
Self-productions of a listless helicopter  
galloping in front of the archipeligos among an acidulous bicycle,  
steady as a bruised iguana.  
On what calcerous cities inherited with earth?  
And flower heads and peaces.  
One of them is handsome,  
the other knows points of view.  
Where is everybody  
he cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Promising the lighthouse of her fellowship full of felicity.  
  
Muscle was no longer right at the transmission threshold.  
Of a blood colored one that protects magnoliums.
