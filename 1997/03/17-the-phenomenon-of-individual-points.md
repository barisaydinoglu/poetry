The Phenomenon Of Individual Points
-----------------------------------
Shall we proceed?  
Of esoteric nectarine, spirit  
of the laws,  
impaled pioneer blood, your kisses  
rustle into exile  
and a droplet of cork, with remnants of the field.  
The calcerous nature that understands in your rose.  
Towards those elixirs of yours that wait for me.  
The order of the fellowships the tenacious mist is smooth on your tail.  
I want you to begin on my fingernails.  
Multitude of perfumes!  
In and out of the deep brown the silvery and the yellow  
you transform headlong into an area to flutter your business.
