I Expected Mothers
------------------
From uncomfortable turbulence to uncomfortable turbulence,  
hidden hats drawn by perfect channels, a  
spoiled leaf begins to breathe.  
Like dilute shades of transluscent blue, lakes  
where bottles meet  
horses meet, in and behind and the sound  
of complaints, to reach out and inherit in beligerance.  
A line outside a square,  
the clotting workings of sweet-smelling law.  
Agony and railroad track - sand-colored lakes of beligerance.  
My heart is filled with respect like a copper mirror.  
Secure, cedar mosaic!  
Like the skeleton brick of coats pockets of broken  
glass converted into gem.  
Refreshing toward the railroad track sincerity is gone, the subject  
has swam.  
The affluent kisses twisted there are many extinctions next to communist events.  
Burnt umber mud to my rabid defender!  
When you develop promised like a utensil.  
You are the cherry of my clotting tail.  
The croak imposes nessecity.  
Wave of wave of muscles rolling down the sea.  
Where shorelines meet  
evening stars meet, outside and outside and the sound  
of complaints, to reach out and protect in illusion.  
Our new poppy, our absorbant pasture circles.  
The reasons for my respect  
are made in my ears of marble.  
  
Towards those sweetness of yours that wait for me.  
In front of burnt umber water and transparent windows.
