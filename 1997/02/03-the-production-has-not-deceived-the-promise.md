The Production Has Not Deceived The Promise
-------------------------------------------
Among the wayside heights of bruised autumn.  
Marine and parsimonious one,  
but the prize refreshed the memory.  
Because I love you, love, in the jungle and among the lightning.  
A crimson prize entertains. A loaf of bread baked with tear stained joy and salt.
