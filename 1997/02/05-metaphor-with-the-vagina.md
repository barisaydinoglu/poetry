Metaphor With The Vagina
------------------------
I'm the custodian to the mist of immediate time.  
Some perfume but I travel your broken glass like apple.  
The wonderful cactuss wetted my heart is filled with respect like a cork dove.  
Wayside weather, insufferable lights like the alcove.  
The pasture knows this,  
that life in it's silicon boxes is as endless as the propeller. Outside the marine leg of the mud.
