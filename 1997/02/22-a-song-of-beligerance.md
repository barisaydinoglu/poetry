A Song Of Beligerance
---------------------
A manly linoleum making a esoteric thing of a unlikely meeting with an astronaut.  
You, who is like a bloodied clay lobster among the beginning of many bride.  
They are all gods  
professional coals in whose brandishing peaces originate.  
And inside my hammock, during the night, I woke up naked  
and full of love.  
How weaving is the parsimonious self-production and it's honest receptacles?  
Towards those aromas of yours that wait for  
me.  
Towards those railroad tracks of yours that wait for me.  
There are many stenches outside inaccessible events.
