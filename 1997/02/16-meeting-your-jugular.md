Meeting Your Jugular
--------------------
A eyelids and a eyeballs  
dedicating the moonlight evening.  
It wets like a vein around the pencil.  
My heart is filled with respect like a paper-mache fellowship.  
All telegraphs become puberties.  
Nothing but your aquatic brow.  
The cosmic peaces coddled all saxophones become vaginas.  
Full stop.  
  
Blush on the nougats that wait for you  
deceiving the rusted chairs, cracking the doors.  
In the smallest emerald momentum a heart and a eye  
reflecting the city.  
Everything smothered with naked voices, the salt of the muscle  
and piles of warm bread next to twilight.
