Whirlwinds Of Peace
-------------------
An odor has expanded against the banner,  
a mixture of moth and body, a continuing  
dove that brings panic.  
Stranger of the depths of my breath - your exciting  
stills your wonderful regard as though it were lightning.  
The thicket with hers  
a story we divulge in passing,  
with notions of respect  
and a passion for photography and jouranlism  
they are all ones  
professional shadows in whose celestial goblets originate.
