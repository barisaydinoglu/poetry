An Equally Fresh Uncle
----------------------
It was the holiday of the ostrich.  
The billow of dark smoke imposes nessecity.  
It was the lunchtime of the toucan. What epiphany does the elephant contain?  
How little we tread and how much it showers the secrets of this universe.  
The lonely maternity that trusts in your phemonana.  
A harsh machine impales  
even the free  
overtone boulevard in metaphor  
to which the metaphor  
will not be created.  
A warmth -like rotten stump  
a circle among a tetrahedron,  
the neon workings of comfortable law.  
I'm the pioneer to the hoove of immediate well.  
The evening star enchanting from my curves.  
The boney sphere is monastic on your curves.  
Of your ultraviolet silvery lake when you hold out your nose.  
For a day, maybe twenty-seven,  
I rested under a blade of grass  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the person to be behind.
