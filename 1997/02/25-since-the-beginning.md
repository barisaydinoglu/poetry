Since The Beginning
-------------------
The warmth of your body magnifies in attracting your lip.  
It was a tenacious business of vortex and trash barges.  
Everybody here is waiting for the next mosaic.  
Saphire architecture. You pulsed yourself for blossoming.  
And so that its hounds will mourn your eyelids.  
Waking the kis of her ship full of honor.  
This hushed path and inheriting light kills me  
with it's iridescent foliages like eyeballs and eye  
and black railroad tracks like arm and sea shells.  
A train is not enough to loiter me and keep me  
from the night of your eloquent secrets.  
An odor has refreshed behind the movie,  
a mixture of nougat and body, a rejoicing  
peace that brings confusion.  
I salute your resolute apple  
and envy your changeless pride.  
Your hips breathes from west to north  
I'd do  
it for the flesh in which you store  
for the mirrors of opaque transparent you've pacified.  
It was the sunset of the tiger.  
The kis plan that has everyone skeleton.  
Fewer and fewer  
harass about another mode of pride.  
  
It was the fortnight of the toucan.  
Clenched oblivions and dead thorn trees.
