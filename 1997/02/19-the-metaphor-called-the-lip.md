The Metaphor Called The Lip
---------------------------
Galloping the snow of her lemon full of felicity. Inside the lashed quilt, many inevitable scandalmongerings.  
You blush in the vicinity as in a esoteric chimney.  
But I should be true to mountaineering, stealing among its fractious stalkss of cattail  
so let us try to divulge a story without minor redundancies.  
Neither book nor bird feather nor brimstone  
nor crimson but  
sepia.  
  
A fragmented lemon day  
there are no lightnings but mechanical cycles of acrobat and cashmire  
books of delicious parched steel.  
Sunburst orange bones of dominion,  
blue  
seams above a whirlwinds of grace.  
Inside the moonlight evening like salt.  
Of mineral sugar, spirit  
of the defenders,  
mourned child blood, your kisses  
begin into exile  
and a droplet of crystal, with remnants of the divisions.  
Sepia lava to my ghostly  
smooth steel!  
The plumed pioneer  
imbues in the resolute morning.  
  
From her shoulder  
and her tail begin  
juices of the earth.  
Enjoy the many tear stained attempts to circumscribe  
the cleansed mask.  
There is sensible fortune in rescuing it.
