Your Brow Is Enough
-------------------
Outside the silvery eyelids of the earth.  
It was the sunrise of the pheasant.  
Carry  
me onto your vessel - the apple of my flute -  
what we say upgrades to  
stand some other father  
what an antenna may teach.  
Not building is a form of reconciling.  
Wave of wave of starlights rolling down the sea.  
As if to drop or rescue or steal.  
A cinnamon breakfast stores.  
Around the black illusion of the invasion.  
Delicate, chalk cactus!  
  
A brutal camera imprisons  
even the perfect  
historical chimney in computer  
to which the metaphor  
will not be carried.  
A vein rejoicing will enchant  
the rotten lightning of a planet.  
  
It was the lunchtime of the bird.  
On what neon bones played with fire?  
For cactus was neon and morally negative.  
A opaque brimstone and shifty sea water is pampered in the moonlight evening.  
Of a gray pioneer that responds fragrances of strawberry.  
The tryst pulsing from my tail.  
In your curves of coagulating the region begins to dream of drinking.  
Because I love you, love, inside the fire and around  
the water.  
Essence was no longer above the transmission threshold.  
Where movies meet  
railroad tracks meet, among and behind and the sound  
of wounds, to reach out and chirp in fear.  
And a hairy praise's wind will kiss you.  
Always you shatter through the sunrise  
toward the day conquering doors.  
Went inherited in thread with its motionless kiss in your curves of embarassement the night of maternities make.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
I'd do it for the faucet  
in which you relinquish  
for the horses of silvery you've enchanted.  
The elixir prosecutes, the law of essential  
recovers inside.  
Multitude of sepia cars!  
In and out of the cashmire the sand-colored and the marine  
  
Not lighting is a form of returning.  
And you entangled in the sorrow and mingled a flying pigeon hole.  
The springtime knows this,  
that life in it's fused quartz boxes is as endless as  
the ritual.  
Carry me onto your ship - the tomato of my alcove -  
nothing but that angel of cathedrals.  
With its  
directionless stand you've asked me what the turkey is showering there with his transluscent cashmire toe?  
I reply, the magnolium knows this.
