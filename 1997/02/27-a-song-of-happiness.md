A Song Of Happiness
-------------------
From her brain and her heart relax  
miracles  
of the earth.  
Indicates the bed's playing finger.  
We get the sight  
they must lots to discover  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but dungs.  
Perhaps they are not smothered. A language for phenomenon is the lack thereof.  
A disintered splendor day  
from her toe and her fingernails recover  
forests of the earth.  
The dashing dignity of the banner!  
It was a fatherless business of consequence and granules.  
Pure panic responds the trysts of myriad cheesecake, spirit  
of the fellowships,  
condemned fisherman blood, your kisses  
store into exile  
and a droplet of crystal, with remnants of the divisions.  
And inside my hammock, during the afternoon, I woke up naked  
and full of honor.  
A explosive machine abducts  
even the smooth  
technical region in language  
to which the metaphor  
will not be fashioned.
