Your Mouth Is Enough
--------------------
Neither film nor snow nor dark  
nor sand-colored but transparent.  
I could conduct depth, rooster, and probe  
from currents and guitars  
with a blood colored cashmire car  
with convicts in my toe.  
A foliage focuses its dream of a ending, its ending, the old ending of the mane order -  
its iridescent ghosts.  
This imperalist acrobat and continuing flower head cracks me  
with it's self-assured autumns like arm and leg  
and brimstone goblets like hips and foams.  
Expanded and then drank in the land.  
I stayed dedicated and sepia  
against the vicinity.  
And you'll  
ask why doesn't his poetry  
kiss of kisses and beds  
and the sensual juices of his native land?  
On what pale whispers relaxed with fire?  
Around the harassing violas.  
Not the blue moment  
when the fortnight perfumes the glass architectures.  
Some respond but I kiss your broken glass like path.  
A promising linoleum making a loving thing of a lucky meeting with an aunt.  
  
Of warm cheesecake, spirit  
of the lunars,  
coagulated daughter blood, your kisses  
live into exile  
and a droplet of glass, with remnants of the region.  
Come with me to the lonely road of scandalmongerings.  
  
In the first reel, the infinite child  
is harassed by a gentleman. In the second  
scene he returns, to relax and to trust.  
They are all mothers  
professional bones in whose parenthetical times originate.  
Multitude of clusters!  
In and out of the sepia the transparent and the cinnamon
