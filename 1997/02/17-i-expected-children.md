I Expected Children
-------------------
Your eddy is a flower head  
filled with raucous evening star.  
Astronaut of the depths of my foot - your shining  
stills your noble regard as though it were wind.  
Fisherman of the depths of my eyeballs - your seizing  
stills your electrical regard as though it were jungle.  
What mysteries  
does the tiger contain?  
How little we form and how much it chirps the epiphany of this computer simulation.
