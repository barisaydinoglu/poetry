Tell Them That I Am Giving Up Re-covering In Signals
----------------------------------------------------
Only parched and to a  
pioneer they take on time, twenty-seven years  
atom was no longer above the recording threshold.  
You say, what is the quiver waiting for in its marine bottle?  
I tell you it is waiting for breakfast like you.  
Behind the elixir of the land where you sleep,  
a dream decays into studies.  
One individual option and not enchanting is a form of building.  
Wave of wave of crowns rolling  
down the sea.  
A synonym lights,  
wets - it does not return.  
Like raucous evening star, droplets  
a red and lethargic time is prosecuted in the city.  
Draw from it the insatiable  
technique of its own signal.  
One of them is perfect,  
the other knows productions.  
Where is noone  
he says, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
My loving eye refreshes you always.  
Femininity of a chained tremulous praise.  
A phenomenon for point of view is the lack thereof.
