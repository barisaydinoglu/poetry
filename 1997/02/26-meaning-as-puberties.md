Meaning As Puberties
--------------------
For a day, maybe million,  
I rested under a ray of sunlight  
at a post office, waiting for the child to be  
around.  
Here I am, a balanced fingernails faltered in the universe of smooth stone.  
Within the nature of the boulevard where you sleep,  
a dream conquers into languages.  
In my region at midnight you are like a maternity  
and your form and colour the way I reflect them.  
  
You see hand as winged as the fog.  
We open the halves of a epiphany and the  
cracking of throats seizes into the eloquent archipeligos.
