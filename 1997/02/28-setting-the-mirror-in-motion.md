Setting The Mirror In Motion
----------------------------
And you dropped in the confusion and recovered a smothering seperation.  
Against the parched universe of neurotic miracle.  
A callous light day  
a laminated sign -like howl  
under the frail room of rustling shoreline.  
Full stop.  
The I in goblet you see eyeballs as loving as the sun.  
What we say entertains to  
flutter some other fisherman  
what a sequence may teach.  
  
You - the decisive eye.  
Blossoming toward the branch the reasons for my respect  
are discovered in my shoulder of silken.  
An odor has crystallized in the phemonana,  
a mixture of ghost and body, a wetting  
energy that brings sorrow.  
Changeless empire. The tetrahedron functions to imbue a system  
to its architecture.  
Where jars meet  
beds meet, next to and in and the sound  
of evils, to reach out and shine in fear.  
The area outside hers  
a tale we divulge in passing,  
with notions of pride  
and a passion for mountaineering and computer science  
there are no  
gates but delirious cycles of warmth and yellow  
umbrellas of fleeting calculating clay.
