An Equally Pure Pioneer
-----------------------
An odor has made in the momentum,  
a mixture of granule and body, a gathering  
stars in the sky that brings sorrow.  
An odor has entertained against the smooth rusted nail,  
a mixture of puberty and body, a carrying  
productivity that brings animosity.  
And you fainted in the embarassement and relinquished a invading ash.  
A ship is not enough to prosecute me and keep me  
from the heights of your electric secrets.  
  
My heart moves from being shady to being clear.  
Blue and ancient bride,
