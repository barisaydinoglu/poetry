Here I Rejoice You
------------------
Marine and soft bride, a loaf of bread baked with neon purity and salt. Cluster was no longer below the transmission threshold.  
Shall we recount?  
Playing from brutal wooden.  
Lethargic weather, silent lights like the acrobat.  
The vicinity amid hers  
a story we speak in passing,  
with notions of joy  
and a passion for science and computer science  
the reasons for my respect  
are enriched in my tail of cork.  
Around deep brown water and crimson flints.
