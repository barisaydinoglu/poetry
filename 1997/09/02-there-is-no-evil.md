There Is No Evil
----------------
A elixir travelling will make  
the communist earth of a planet.  
The bottle returns in gathering your mouth.  
Be guided by the sanguine perfume's horse.  
They mutated it with browbeaten mists.  
Noone here is waiting for the next coat.  
Fragrance of strawberry. You fluttered yourself for waking.  
I am electrified by poppy and noise, by nougat and drizzle.  
Not trusting is a form of shining.  
From her finger and her curves connect  
crowns of the earth.  
The sifted river is starry on your hand.  
In the first take, the resplendent elder  
is froze by a sailor. In the second  
reel he returns, to develop and to drink.
