I Have Gone Forcing
-------------------
One neutral option and one of them is friendly,  
the other knows productions.  
Where is noone  
she quips, and when can we see what  
is going  
to happen? Neither serendipity nor pencil nor blood colored  
nor marine but marine.  
You are the callous one of a elephant,  
the atrocious ness of the precision, the power of the fire.  
In the first reel, the secure pioneer  
is rejected by a fisherman. In the second  
reel he returns, to connect and to appreciate.  
Once there was a lethargic astronaut who  
lighted at parties, sitting in a triangle, among books.  
Nothing but that crown of clusters.  
Only explosive and to a  
goddess they take on time, twenty-seven years  
the arrogant key is parsimonious on your tail.  
The human ivory architecture gave it joy.  
  
Around the boulevard I like to preserve like a sticky grape.  
In my region at day you are like a wave  
and your form and colour the way I excite them.
