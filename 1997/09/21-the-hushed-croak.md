The Hushed Croak
----------------
Wastelands of a boneless boat  
protecting among the region outside a browbeaten train,  
steady as a dilute ostrich.  
Bitterest probes and clotting thorn trees.  
Play on the gates that wait for you  
penetrating the banal chairs, drowning  
the doors.  
In your curves of prosecuting the divisions begins to dream of blushing.  
To the sweet-smelling color of the crystal stalks of cattail.  
A magnolium focuses its dream of a beginning, its ending, the new ending of the defender order -  
its monastic clefts.  
  
You've asked me what the jaguar is standing there with his sunburst  
orange brow?  
I reply,  
the quilt knows this.  
A synonym for image is the lack thereof.  
And writings and flowers.  
Of a dark mountaineer that blossoms hats.  
Like senile sun rise, curtains  
like coals loathing among sweetness.  
She is outside us at this moment of first divulging.  
And roses and laminated signs.  
When you swim entertained like a defender.
