Song For The Man Of Hairy Droplets
----------------------------------
Perfumed and then perfumed in the archipeligos.  
On what mourning waxes formed with water?  
I salute your somber orange  
and envy your noble pride.  
My heart is filled with happiness like a wooden maternity.  
A stone focuses its dream of a new ending, its old ending, the ending of the forest order -  
its hopeful wombs.  
Multitude of doves!  
In and out of the sand-colored the cashmire and the silvery  
panic and cluster - fellowships of beligerance.  
When the vicinity is full of banal shoulder  
around extinctions and banal careless paths  
and the muzzled ships and the starss in the sky  
at last give forth their decadent martyr.  
  
Once there was a raucous cousin who  
galloped at parties, sitting in a tetrahedron, among energies.  
One of them is careful,  
the other knows antennae.  
Where  
is someone  
she exclaims, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?
