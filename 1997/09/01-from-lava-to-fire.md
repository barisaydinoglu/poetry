From Lava To Fire
-----------------
In the sea like rusted nail.  
The lyrical fisherman  
upgrades in the thick morning.  
In my sea at fortnight you are like a maternity  
and your form and colour the way I magnify them. Someone here is waiting for the next dove.  
Star. You pulsed yourself for transforming.  
A camera rejoices,  
steals - it does not return.
