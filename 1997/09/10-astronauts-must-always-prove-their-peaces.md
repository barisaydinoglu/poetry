Astronauts Must Always Prove Their Peaces
-----------------------------------------
I stayed enriched and deep brown  
against the archipeligos.  
Indicates the promise's reflecting hips.  
And you trembled in the beligerance and crystallized a plaguing lard.  
Against the boneless moonlight evening of forceful sweetnes.  
I could continue trash barge, seperation, and panic  
from laminated signs and magnoliums  
with a dark quiver  
with cold fires in my foot.  
A sequence weaves,  
deceives - it does not return.  
Our new transparent car, our verdure wave triangles.
