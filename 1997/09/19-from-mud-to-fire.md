From Mud To Fire
----------------
There are no funerals but muzzled cycles of bird feather and sand-colored  
salts of human rustling salt.  
I was without doubt the mountaineer pheasant  
there in the acidulous modern office.  
When it looked me with its soft tree eyes  
it had neither shoulder nor hand  
but glass dews on its sides.  
A loaf of bread baked with sterile purity and salt.  
They smothered it with cold knaves.
