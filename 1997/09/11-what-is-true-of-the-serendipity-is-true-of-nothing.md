What Is True Of The Serendipity Is True Of Nothing
--------------------------------------------------
The clotting farm is cleansed on your finger. A hushed flower day  
like morbid jar, energies  
some seek but I circumscribe your brick like breakfast.  
Showering a fragrance of strawberry  
seized in the winged fog.  
  
I want you to upgrade on my heart.
