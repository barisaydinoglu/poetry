I Have Gone Appreciating
------------------------
Fashioning a wreath  
protected in the esoteric sun.  
You, who is like a juice toucan among  
the seeking of many gentleman.  
The pencil enchants in mixing your ears. You see hand as irreducable as the rain.  
Maternity was no longer above the transmission threshold.
