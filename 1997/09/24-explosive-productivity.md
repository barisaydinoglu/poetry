Explosive Productivity
----------------------
A green saxophone pulses.  
A soft rug making a humble thing of a unlikely meeting with an astronaut.  
A ship is not enough to falter me and keep me  
from the boulevard of your brandishing mysteries.  
I saw how drops are refreshed  
by the resplendent sweetnes.  
A incredulous carpet making a dashing thing of a probable meeting with a mother.  
Be guided by the warm wave's mosaic.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the enchanting rivers?  
And  
the thunder moonlit splattering its lemons and shaking them full of  
heights and oyster?
