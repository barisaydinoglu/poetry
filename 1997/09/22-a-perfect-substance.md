A Perfect Substance
-------------------
The bone mixes on its absurd mare  
recovering burnt umber fellowships over the universe.  
Loving from bruised glass.  
Conversations of wreaths, the recitation  
of hooves we call decisive smooth rusted nail.  
On what smothered wounds responded with jungle?
