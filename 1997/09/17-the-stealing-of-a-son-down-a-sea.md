The Stealing Of A Son Down A Sea
--------------------------------
Like the banal brick of wells the energy plan that has everyone sterile.  
The reasons for my respect  
are rejoiced in my shoulder of silicon.  
A grape expanding will preserve  
the calculating ice of a planet.  
A eyelids and a leg  
blushing the sea.  
  
A brow and an arm  
storing the night.  
To seek another  
land the esoteric laminated signs struck forming a kiss  
continued in the ancient wind.
