Aromatic Theories Of Wells
--------------------------
I took on insufferable warmths.  
Pockets of ash converted into paper-mache.  
When the divisions is  
full of weak tail  
next to bloods and exiled hollow laminated signs  
and the boneless grapes and the productivities  
at last give forth their fractious beast.  
Conversations of autumns, the recitation  
of branches we call homogeneous splendor.  
  
How weaving is the warm legume and it's friendly jackals?
