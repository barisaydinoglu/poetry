The Image Called The Breath
---------------------------
The somber quivers entangled and sunburst orange cars and beds. Realized promising warmth a sea's skin -like ghost  
I could appreciate torrent, ego, and nougat  
from energies and pencils  
with a gray friendship  
with lineages  
in my lip. I carry as if inside a chaotic lightning.
