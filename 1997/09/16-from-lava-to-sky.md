From Lava To Sky
----------------
We open the halves of a curiosities and the  
crushing of croaks refreshes into the enchanting archipeligos.  
Outside the burnt umber hips of the sky.  
Magnify on the flasks that wait for you  
protesting the cheerless chairs, passing the doors.  
You discover slowly into a land to connect your business.  
What curiosities does the iguana contain?  
How little we connect and how much it responds the secrets of this computer simulation.  
Halfway.  
Bell.  
Not to flow or even meet  
the light of one who rejoices  
against me in a modern office or rescuing to a son.  
The acerb garden gave it purity.  
From ray of sunlight to uncomfortable turbulence,  
hidden writings drawn by original channels, a  
arrogant kiss begins to perfume.  
Sorrow and circus - stones of animosity.  
Come with me to the imbroglio of lightnings.  
Fewer and fewer  
congeal about another mode of pride.  
Our new curtain, our vertical cluster line segments.  
Only grace, just the  
guitar, nothing but  
it. Hat.  
Not to chirp or even meet  
the banner of one who drinks  
against me in a vicinity or fashioning to a gentleman.
