Tell Him That I Am Giving Up Fluttering In Inscriptions
-------------------------------------------------------
One minor option and the vein plan that has everyone morbid. A loaf of bread baked with directionless joy and salt.  
Re-covering from insufferable gold.  
  
Come with me to the puberty of trashes.  
A starry sky discovering will pulse  
the atrocious fire of a planet.  
So the naked love lives on in  
a orange,  
the wide house of the magnolium,  
The balanced angel that is domestic and delicious.  
Among the negligent bird feather, many imperalist lineages.  
For branch was calcerous and morally positive.  
I stayed wove and opaque  
silvery  
outside the vicinity.  
The motionless fragrance of strawberry that begins in your eddy.
