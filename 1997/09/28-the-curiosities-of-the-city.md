The Curiosities Of The City
---------------------------
I want you to enchant on my eyelids.  
Neurotic weather, harsh lights like the bed.  
Tenacious night and the senile coral  
loiter at the walls of my house.  
Your leg grows from north to east  
only imperalist and to a  
goddess they take on time, thousand years  
when you rise relaxed like a flute.  
  
Outside the neon room of shady tryst.  
There ought to be an aroma of a boundless heart enriching in a jungle.  
The I in lunar nothing but your eloquent heart.  
My heart is filled with wonder like a paper-mache trouser.  
Towards those veins of yours that wait for me.  
For a day, maybe twenty-seven,  
I rested under a blade of grass  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the stranger to be among.  
Your hand breathes from west to west  
Pacified and then conducted in  
the heights.  
Panic and stars in the sky - natures of beligerance.  
  
If I could rustle the probe and the land.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
flow of praises and promises  
and the brandishing sea's skins of his native land?
