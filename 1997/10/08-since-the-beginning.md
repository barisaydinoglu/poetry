Since The Beginning
-------------------
In your brain of panic the divisions of praises wake.  
In your tail of animosity the moonlight evening of forests enrich.  
I'm the mountaineer to the nature of immediate nature.  
A delicious wood paneling making a mineral thing of a probable meeting with a cousin.  
Around the coddling flasks.  
As soon as the incoming films  
gives the technical indication.  
A vein -like hound  
and you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
enchant of bridges and corals  
and the warm echoes of his native land?  
You see curves as full as the clouds.  
And behind my hammock, during the early light of day, I woke up naked  
and full of sincerity.  
Fewer and fewer  
sodden about another mode of love.  
A loaf of bread baked with clotting decency and salt.  
Not the cinnamon moment  
when the night returns the starry skies.  
Draw from it the putrid  
point of view of its own inscription.
