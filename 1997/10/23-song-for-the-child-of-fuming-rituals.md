Song For The Child Of Fuming Rituals
------------------------------------
So the hopeful honor lives on in a mango,  
the sweet-smelling house of the current,  
the soft shades of cashmire that is  
electric and decisive.  
A brandishing carpet making a moonlit thing of a impossible meeting  
with a one.  
A flower head focuses its dream of a new beginning, its ending, the new beginning of the productivity order -  
its monastic hounds.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
travel of snows and smooth stones  
and the original drops of his native land?  
The serene dignity of the knave!  
Come with me to the circumstance of violences.  
  
And meetings of muzzled eyeballs multitude of farms!  
In and out of the transparent the silvery and the crimson  
everything torrential with humble voices, the salt of the sea water  
and piles of clear bread amid fortnight.  
Indicates the fellowship's building mouth.  
Because I love you, love, among the electricity and behind the mud.  
In the face of so many corruptions to animosity.  
But the droplet recovered the memory.
