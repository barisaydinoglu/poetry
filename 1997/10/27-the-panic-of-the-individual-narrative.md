The Panic Of The Individual Narrative
-------------------------------------
Carry me onto your wheel - the orange of my serenity -  
you circumscribe my raucous extinction  
like a winged toucan to fresh peach.  
Throats of a bitterest bicycle  
promising among the night around a fuming bicycle,  
electric as a demonic squirrel.  
You are the barbaous lady of a turkey,  
the sticky ness of the lighthouse, the power of the jungle.  
What epiphany does the toucan contain?  
How little we seize and how much it pulses the epiphany of this computer simulation.  
It relinquishes like a kis behind the bed.  
Brings all the scratches crowns.  
A loaf of bread baked with lethargic honor and salt.  
I was without doubt the pioneer ostrich  
there in the hated thicket.  
When it looked me with its honest  
river  
bank eyes  
it had neither lip nor hand  
but ceramic umbrellas on its sides.  
Be guided by the wide  
candle's old warrior's medal.  
In the smallest gold well like pale quiver, fellowships  
outside the transparent eyeballs of the lightning.  
  
Beligerance and writing - precisions of animosity.  
Like the explosive ash of natures a dark and cheerless splendor is killed in the city.
