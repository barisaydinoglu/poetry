Proof Of Secure Sense
---------------------
Giant of the depths of my breath - your drinking  
stills your thick regard as though it were clay.  
Continuing from raucous cedar.  
Where fragrances of strawberry meet  
wreaths meet, within and within and the sound  
of hearts, to reach out and pacify in beligerance.  
My celestial eyelids pulses you always.  
  
But the affection understood the memory.
