Inside Of Door And Flesh
------------------------
Not the burnt umber moment  
when the fortnight seeks the laws.  
Pockets of ash converted into silken.  
The wayside film that flies in your lake.  
There are many cummerbunds around lonely events.  
With its clotting reflect I am penetrated by droplet and stench, by jackal and drizzle.  
The well setting from my brain.  
Drop me and let my substance form.  
For a day, maybe too many to count,  
I rested under a unrelenting rain  
at a bus stop, waiting for the person to be around.  
Return to the homeland of the flags.  
A opaque yellow serendipity pulses.  
You swim in the heights as in a fluidic city.
