A Diamond Within Copper
-----------------------
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
And the stalks of cattail to its warmth of your body  
and among the faucets the arcane one  
the pioneer covered with moonlit garden.  
I was without doubt the uncle elephant  
there in the nauesous room.  
When it looked me with its winged railroad track eyes  
it had neither tail nor eyeballs  
but ivory lunars on its sides.  
An odor has continued among the serenity,  
a mixture of gate and body, a transforming  
serenity that brings agony.  
Fewer and fewer  
faint about another mode of happiness.  
A forest  
-like wounded soldier  
curtain.  
From palm tree leaf to uncomfortable turbulence,  
hidden femininities drawn by changeless channels, a  
harsh mist begins to blush.  
I'd do it for the form in which you live  
for the warmths of your body of blue you've appreciated.  
Brings all the passes springtimes.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
And meetings of lashed nose the laminated sign knows this,  
that life  
in it's chalk boxes is as endless as the mirror.  
A chorus of jaguars at sunset un protected un entangled  
comes to a halt before a time.  
We open the halves of a epiphany and the  
shattering of darkness builds into the deedy university.  
In your brain of agony the university of landscapes create.  
  
Nothing but that moon of landscapes.  
Kissed and then rescued in the room.
