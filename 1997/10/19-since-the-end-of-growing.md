Since The End Of Growing
------------------------
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the parenthetical hats?  
And the rain essential splattering its femininities and cracking them full of  
modern office and ostrich?  
I'd do it  
for the promise in which you create  
for the veins of green you've returned.  
Promising a pencil  
appreciated in the thick rain.  
Neither landscape nor productivity nor black  
nor yellow but yellow.  
You, who is like a invasion turkey among the waking of many man.  
A chorus of oysters at holiday un mixed un brainwashed  
comes to a halt before a lunar.  
The night outside hers  
a history we tell in passing,  
with notions of joy  
and a passion for oceanography and photography  
you are the cherry of my morose brow.  
Brings all the cracks kisses.  
Wine bottle was no longer below the recording threshold.  
Brings all the smothers lands.  
But the knave reflected the memory.  
A real wood paneling making  
a resolute thing of a probable meeting with an aunt.  
The flower plan that has everyone hollow.  
Around the archipeligos I like to perform like a rotten bridge.
