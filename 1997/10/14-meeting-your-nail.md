Meeting Your Nail
-----------------
Among the lashed serenity, many ghostly violences.  
Among the home of the region where you sleep,  
a dream coddles into projections.  
A crimson smooth stone relaxes.  
Once there was a windy god who  
performed at parties, sitting in a loop, among fountains.  
The railroad track knows this,  
that life in it's paper-mache boxes is as endless as the starlight.  
I do not bury in the field of clotting trash.  
Wave of wave of starss in the sky rolling down the sea.  
Closed off and closed off like a forest.  
When you flutter like ship refreshed by the water.  
My starry brow seeks you always.
