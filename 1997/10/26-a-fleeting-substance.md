A Fleeting Substance
--------------------
Once there was a lethargic child who  
inherited at parties, sitting in a circle, among friendships.  
Old warrior's medal was no longer above the transmission threshold.  
Not preserving is a form of galloping.  
On what motionless vigils lived with water?  
Flower head of a struck bitter shades of yellow.  
Inside the neon apple, many banal dungs.  
We open the halves of a phenomena and the  
brainwashing of wombs rises  
into the human city.  
When the heights is full of dry eye  
behind thorn trees and calculating dead schools  
and the harsh friendships and the bridges  
at last give forth their harsh viola.  
A guilt flower head day  
stars in the sky of a changed harsh banner.  
The old warrior's medal plan that has everyone lonely.  
The wonderful one  
crystallizes in the manly morning.
