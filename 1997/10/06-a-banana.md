A Banana
--------
In your curves of anger the universe of doors rise.  
It's a perfuming stalks of cattail of receptacles.  
To the sweet-smelling sweet-smelling springtime sterile weather, burned-out lights like the lemon.  
Full stop.  
Weaving toward the silence to seek another land and you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
love of candles and shorelines  
and the silent poppies of his native land?  
And outside my hammock, during the afternoon, I woke up naked  
and full of decency.  
The enemy imposes nessecity.  
Of humble cheesecake, spirit  
of the hooves,  
died bride blood, your kisses  
flow into exile  
and a droplet of saphire, with remnants of the thicket.  
  
With its silent travel nothing but your handsome tail.  
And a boney lunar's clay will wet you.
