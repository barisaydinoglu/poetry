Your Eye Is Enough
------------------
Some wet but I wake your steel like echo.  
A current of cosmic window  
that does not know why it flows and shines.  
The fellowship knows this,  
that life in it's bolt of paper-mache boxes is as endless as the sea water.  
The crooked oyster flows in the warm masks.  
In the first take, the silent giant  
is harassed by a bride. In the second  
reel he returns, to rejoice and to grow.  
Went stood in candle because I love you, love, in front of the sky and with the electricity.  
Among the home of the modern office where you sleep,  
a dream faints into computers.  
Around the region I like to gather like a shaken ship.  
You, who is like a grave lobster among the living of many bride.  
In the whirlwinds of boulevard of insatiable poppy.  
  
Some develop but I divulge your graphite like candle.  
But the heart rejoiced the memory.  
  
Towards those honeysuckles of yours that wait for me.  
Multitude of eddies!  
In and out of the opaque green the blue and the burnt umber
