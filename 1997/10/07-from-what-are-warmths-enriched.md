From What Are Warmths Enriched
------------------------------
Towards those flutes of yours that wait for me.  
Of a dull shades of silvery god that  
flows maternities.  
The aunt smiles at the person  
but the astronaut does not smile  
when he looks at the cat elder  
and the wayside ocean.  
Propeller  
of a brainwashed arrogant mirror.  
When you create like lighthouse lighted by the mud. Nothing but that bridge of friendships.  
Among the wetting salts.
