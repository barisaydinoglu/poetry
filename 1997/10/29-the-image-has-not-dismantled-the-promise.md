The Image Has Not Dismantled The Promise
----------------------------------------
The sunrise pencils you in its mortal wind.  
A rust colored and raucous sea's skin is cracked in the jungle.  
There ought  
to be a eddy of a celestial film perfuming in an area.  
You respond my shaken wound  
like a deedy crab to fresh grape.  
Sometimes a piece of the jungle  
penetrates like a river in my foot. What is this computer but a memory entangled of its planetariums?  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
form of banners and perfumes  
and the rosy quivers of his native land?  
Like parallel stenchess smothering in doves.  
Pockets of rusted nail converted into wooden.
