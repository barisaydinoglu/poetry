What Is True Of The Horse Is True Of Something
----------------------------------------------
Recovering toward the magnolium when the area is full of motionless eyeballs  
with legless horses and bitterest hollow quilts  
and the frightened droplets and the quilts  
at last give forth their skeleton convict.  
Come with me to the vagina of bloody feathers.  
A wayside identity pities  
even the sensible  
slightest jungle in phenomenon  
to which the metaphor  
will not be appreciated.  
The order of the fountains towards those grapes of yours that wait for me.  
A musical wood paneling making an aromatic thing of a likely meeting with a god.  
An odor has promised under the aspen,  
a mixture of whisper  
and body, a gathering  
coral that brings illusion.  
Fire-tipped midnight and the dead tiger  
deceive at the walls of my house.  
The acidulous toucan rejoices inside the angellic shrapnels.  
Next to the mosaic of the thicket where you sleep,  
a dream condemns into languages.  
  
I was without doubt the one tiger  
there in the fire-tipped night.  
When it looked me with its handsome nature eyes  
it had neither finger nor ears  
but fused quartz cathedrals on its sides.
