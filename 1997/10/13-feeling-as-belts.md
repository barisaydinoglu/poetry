Feeling As Belts
----------------
I  
do not deceive in the moonlight evening of hollow viola. In the face of so many violas to functionality.  
So the aromatic purity lives on in a kiwi,  
the acerb house of the river,  
the moonlit smooth sand that is vertical and stationary.  
  
The clear custodian  
re-covers in the blazing morning.  
Around the divisions I like to relinquish like a motionless sphere.  
Has the land been heard with mysteries?  
Not flowing is a form  
of divulging.  
The sailor smiles at the uncle  
but the custodian does not smile  
when he looks at the cat lady  
and the hollow ocean.  
Halfway.  
A transparent flint creates.
