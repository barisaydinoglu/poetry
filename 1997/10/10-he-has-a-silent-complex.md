He Has A Silent Complex
-----------------------
She is among us at this moment of first  
imbuing.  
I salute your mineral wine  
and envy  
your enchanting pride.  
You are the bitterest uncle of a cat,  
the demonic ness of the starry sky, the power of the lightning.  
The spacious mane gave it joy.  
The I in ritual a boneless sequence passes  
even the fluidic  
algorithmic modern office in metaphor  
to which the metaphor  
will not be formed.  
Shut up and closed off like an atom.  
Went conducted in horse and you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
form of echoes and breakfasts  
and the electric banners of his native land?  
A current of friendly promise  
that does not know why it flows and continues.  
Inside transparent water and sepia stars.  
Of your gray saxophone when you hold out your brow.  
And next to my hammock, during the morning, I woke up naked  
and full of purity.  
The lion hearted dignity of the current!  
A pure snow  
of fountains.  
  
Recovered and then transformed in the field.  
Multitude of echoes!  
In and out of the blue the sand-colored and the yellow  
In your heart of taunting the jungle begins to dream of upgrading.  
Always you delude through the day  
toward the night dying autumns.  
Pure vigil flows the kisses if I could reconcile the serection and the sea.  
Felicity is gone, the subject has fashioned.  
Enchanting, crystal silicon architecture!  
The enduring droplets coagulated the legume imposes nessecity.  
What we  
say grows to  
tread some other father  
what a signal may teach.  
You chirp my obscene havoc  
like a humble crab to fresh grape.  
All wine bottles become convicts.  
On what atrocious shortcuts carried with heat?  
Where fountains meet  
rivers meet, within and in front of and the sound  
of conglomerates, to reach out and promise in fear.  
  
And a lashed foliage's fire will swim you.  
A cathedral focuses its dream of a new beginning, its new beginning, the new beginning of the warmth of your body order -  
its manly shortcuts.
