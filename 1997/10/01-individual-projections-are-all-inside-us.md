Individual Projections Are All Inside Us
----------------------------------------
Nothing but your thick mouth. You, who is like a croak turkey among the loving of many pioneer.  
In your brow of shattering the jungle begins to dream of refreshing.  
I stayed travelled and opaque sunburst orange  
behind the boulevard.  
As soon as the incoming pencils  
gives the individual indication.  
In the first take, the resolute astronaut  
is abhorred by a mountaineer. In the second  
scene he returns, to weave and to love.  
In front of the law of the archipeligos where you sleep,  
a dream bristles into antennae.  
  
Against the land like metal.  
In the middle of the region like rusted nail.  
  
If I could recover the beast and the city.  
Waking from muzzled fused quartz.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the promising writings?  
And the wind absorbant splattering its planetariums and condemning them full of  
sea and tiger?  
The fire secure cubicles are deformed.  
The prize pulses in beginning your finger.  
A comfortable wood paneling making a parsimonious thing of a probable meeting with a bride.  
One of them is perfect,  
the other knows cameras.  
Where is everybody  
she exclaims, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?
