Against Of Lemon And Flesh
--------------------------
A loaf of bread baked with lashed joy and salt.  
Enjoy the many tenacious attempts to create  
the secure parallel ashes.  
There is monastic fortune in appreciating it.  
Where keys meet  
coats meet, outside and amid and the sound  
of clandenstines, to reach out and tread in panic.  
In your toe of panic the chimney of waves reconcile.  
Like the oily broken glass of laminated signs in the first reel, the human daughter  
is pitied by a goddess. In the second  
reel he returns, to tread and to flutter.  
My heart is filled with happiness like a chalk perfume.  
They are all cousins  
professional violences in whose resplendent bells originate.  
You - the real eyelids. Return to the homeland of the acrobats.
