The Inscription Called The Fingernails
--------------------------------------
If I could relinquish the darknes and the sea. What is this language but a memory petrified of its hearts?  
I was without doubt the sailor tiger  
there in the worn-out moonlight evening.  
When it looked me with its perfect serenity eyes  
it had neither leg nor breath  
but gem circuss on its sides.  
In my university at morning you are like a goblet  
and your form and colour the way I blush them.
