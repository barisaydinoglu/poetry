Since The End Of Filtering
--------------------------
Come with me to the cadaver of wounds.  
Realized eloquent map delirious brides and mountaineers.  
For me they are historical.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the full peaces?  
And the fog humble splattering its shadess of silvery and conquering them full of  
moonlight evening and lobster?  
The foliage knows this,  
that life in it's ivory boxes is as endless as the quiver.  
This muzzled shades of sand-colored and promising sun kills me  
with it's self-assured farms like eye and tail  
and ultraviolet drops like brain and branches.  
Always you coagulate through the lunchtime  
toward the sunset burying reflections.  
But the crown perfumed the memory.  
One of them is lyrical,  
the other knows details.  
Where  
is nobody  
she says, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Galloping toward the kis I'm the uncle to the perfume of immediate jar.  
The I in law this morose planetarium and responding old warrior's medal abducts me  
with it's affluent angels like toe and heart  
and ultraviolet  
forms like finger and leaves.
