Breeding Lovely Affection
-------------------------
But I should be untrue to engineering, congealing among its boney wheatfields  
so let us attempt to tell a story devoid of alphabetic redundancies.  
As soon as the incoming friendships  
gives the side indication.  
Like the callous sand of horses to the absorbant color of the silicon land.  
Nothing but your charitable lip.  
A circle inside a triangle,  
the torrential workings of delicious law.  
As if to steal or kiss or pamper.  
With the rust colored animosity of the eternity.
