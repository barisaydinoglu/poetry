Meeting Your Viola
------------------
Here I am, a balanced shoulder devoured in the thicket of flower.  
A phenomenon dawns,  
kills - it does not return.  
All transluscent burnt umber cars become deaths.  
Only putrid and to a  
lady they take on time, too many to count years  
circumscribing the autumn of her crystal architecture full of honor.  
When you flow played like a river.  
  
And meetings of callous eye outside the root of the night where you sleep,  
a dream crushes into machines.  
Continuing toward the window so the gleaming pride lives on in a mango,  
the delicate house of the pencil,  
the perfect hat  
that is blazing and cosmic.
