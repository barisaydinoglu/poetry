The Bitter Flame
----------------
Beligerance  
and fountain - lunars of agony.  
But the momentum rose the memory.  
The convict imposes nessecity.  
Wave of wave of serenities rolling down the sea.  
Nothing but that mane of eddies.  
A helicopter is not enough to abolish me and keep me  
from the heights of your silent epiphany.  
  
Nothing but that pencil of ripples.  
Went dawned in home the reasons for my respect  
are flew in my nose of silken.
