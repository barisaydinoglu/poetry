Technique With The Blade
------------------------
Sepia vortices of salt,  
blue seams above a weak writing.  
All love become belts.  
As soon as the incoming waves  
gives the aerial indication.  
You see breath as aquatic as the clouds.  
  
Drink on the oxides that wait for you  
foreboding the obscene chairs, crushing the doors.
