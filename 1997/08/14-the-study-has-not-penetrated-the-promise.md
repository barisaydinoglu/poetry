The Study Has Not Penetrated The Promise
----------------------------------------
The late afternoon schools you in its mortal mud.  
A sunburst orange curtain connects.  
One of them is honest,  
the other knows cameras.  
Where is nobody  
she says, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Only river bank, just the  
opaque silvery car, nothing but  
it. Saxophone.  
Perfume.  
Shone and then stood in the city.  
It was a spoiled business of flame and salivas.  
Domestic empire. The loop functions to form a system  
to its architecture.  
Your perfume is a vein filled with sticky farm.  
Within the laminated sign of the area where you sleep,  
a dream prosecutes into computers.
