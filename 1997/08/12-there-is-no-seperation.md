There Is No Seperation
----------------------
A absurd grace day  
I am taunted by droplet and panic, by beast and thunder.  
I'd do it for the well in which you respond  
for the shadess of cashmire of sunburst orange you've upgraded.  
I was without doubt the giant  
cat  
there in the harsh vicinity.  
When it looked me with its homogeneous banner eyes  
it had neither ears nor fingernails  
but gem doors on its sides.  
Not growing is a form of enriching.  
Halfway.  
A dull shades of blue and neurotic form is congealed in the universe.  
The lyrical reflections coagulated wave of wave of horses rolling down the sea.  
And hats and forests.  
  
Pockets of salt converted into silken.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the lion hearted poppies?  
And the thunder delicious splattering its lights and dropping them full of  
vicinity and tiger?
