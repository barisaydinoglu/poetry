Tell Her That I Am Giving Up Mixing In Productions
--------------------------------------------------
Pockets of sand converted into glass.  
On what tremulous self-productions crystallized with jungle?  
Of a dull shades of burnt umber uncle that rustles hats.  
Like muzzled reflection, sun rises  
they are all people  
professional oxides in whose comfortable sun rises originate.  
Flute of a rejected insufferable transluscent transluscent cashmire car.  
Unguessed, marble elixir!
