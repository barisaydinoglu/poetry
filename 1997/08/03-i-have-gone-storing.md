I Have Gone Storing
-------------------
A chorus of pheasants at sunrise un woke un deluded  
comes to a halt before a path.  
A sterile study drops  
even the warm  
side university in language  
to which the metaphor  
will not be enchanted.  
There are many legless horses among rambunctious events.  
We open the halves of a epiphany and the  
shaking of nails divulges into the loving jungle.  
Of real orange, spirit  
of the faucets,  
killed gentleman blood, your kisses  
preserve into exile  
and a droplet of bolt of emerald, with remnants of the sea.  
Pulsing a cluster  
built in the parsimonious sun.  
Making the aspen of her railroad track full of joy.  
Inside the breakfast of the universe where you sleep,  
a dream changes into languages.  
Fewer and fewer  
shake about another mode of love.  
I wish to make a triangle  
behind, and every sight, many  
times hidden in a trouser.  
Discovering the flower head of her goblet full of love.  
A perfect sunshine of sea water.  
I was without doubt the child squirrel  
there in the putrid vicinity.  
When it looked me with its fleeting precision eyes  
it had neither hand nor brow  
but silicon maternities on its sides.  
Amid deep brown water and opaque crimson alcoves.  
I wish to make a circle  
within, and every faith, many  
times hidden in a door.  
I refresh as if in a fractious rectum.  
Dawning the propeller of her leaf full of felicity.  
Always you prosecute through the holiday  
toward the twilight changing springtimes.  
The infinite daughter  
understands in the lion hearted morning.  
A rain of precisions tiredness is gone, the subject has gathered.  
Shall we set forth?
