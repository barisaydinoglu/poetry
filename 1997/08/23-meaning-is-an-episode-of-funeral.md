Meaning Is An Episode Of Funeral
--------------------------------
The reasons for my respect  
are built in my curves of cork.  
Callous strangers and uncles.  
For me they are grammatic.  
In the red beligerance of the bloodied salt.  
The snow hearing from my foot.  
Come with me to the croak of granules.  
This phosphorus flower and blossoming fragrance of strawberry changes me  
with it's full forests like fingernails and leg  
and dull shades of sunburst orange bells like breath  
and curtains.  
Of moonlit plum, spirit  
of the graces,  
throttled man  
blood, your kisses  
travel into exile  
and a droplet of ivory, with remnants of the night.  
Indicates the writing's standing nose.  
Fluttering the guitar of her productivity full of decency.  
Outside blue water and transluscent opaque cashmire bird feathers.  
I saw how rivers are imbued  
by the honest laminated sign.  
  
One of them is somber,  
the other knows languages.  
Where is somebody  
she exclaims, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Inheriting from sordid ivory.  
A raft is not enough to compound me and keep me  
from the area of your honest phenomena.  
Where banners meet  
flutes meet, outside and among and the sound  
of hearts, to reach out and seize in illusion.  
  
If I could  
return the wound and the boulevard.  
What secrets does the turkey contain?  
How little we build and how much it rejoices the epiphany of this galaxy.
