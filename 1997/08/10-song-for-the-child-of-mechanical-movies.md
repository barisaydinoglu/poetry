Song For The Child Of Mechanical Movies
---------------------------------------
I'm the stranger to the breakfast of immediate atom.  
You are the tomato of my rotten fingernails.  
Conversations of awes, the recitation  
of gardens we call electrical  
splendor.  
A dark and rambunctious affection is buried in the jungle.  
  
A raft is not enough to erupt me and keep me  
from the boulevard of your scrupulous epiphany.  
Blue  
receptacles of bone,  
transluscent deep brown seams above a shifty flag.
