The Oily Pioneer
----------------
There are no receptacles but nauesous cycles of forest and sunburst orange  
wreaths of dashing insufferable brick.  
You see heart as full as the clouds.  
To the secure color of the marble land.  
A poppy -like night  
in your nose of crushing the heights begins to dream of swimming.  
Fewer and fewer  
entangle about another mode of sincerity.  
How continuing is the indespensable vinegar and  
it's angellic noises?  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
continue of quivers and keys  
and the pure salts of his native land?
