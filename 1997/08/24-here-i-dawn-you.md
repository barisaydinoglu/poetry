Here I Dawn You
---------------
Our new smooth stone, our deedy friendship tetrahedrons.  
When you grow like ribbon dedicated by the earth.  
Burnt umber and absent minded man,  
Pure seperation enchants the times what fleeting wheatfields -  
the archipeligos is filled with it,  
angels for the diamond architecture and the tremulous saphire.  
You swim slowly into a jungle to set your business.  
Wave of wave of femininities rolling down the sea.  
A deep brown wine bottle breathes.  
The decadent lemon is stationary on your arm.  
  
Around the city I like to rejoice like a ironous mane.  
They are all pioneers  
professional circumstances in whose romantic ribbons originate.  
Full stop. The I in heart but the miracle entertained the memory.
