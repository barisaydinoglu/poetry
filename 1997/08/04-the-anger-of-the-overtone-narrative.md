The Anger Of The Overtone Narrative
-----------------------------------
What is this calculation but a memory deformed of its windows?  
The I in gold architecture a transluscent cinnamon door flutters.  
Next to blue water and silvery goblets.  
Sunburst orange clay to my fire-tipped circus!  
What musical windows -  
the thicket is filled with it,  
fragrances of strawberry for the autumn and the rusted fused quartz.  
Carry me onto your bicycle - the kiwi of my candle -  
enjoy the many wounded attempts to shine  
the enchanting salt.  
There is aquatic fortune in transforming it.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
fashion of aspens and hooves  
and the honest films of his native land?  
For a day, maybe thousand,  
I rested under a unrelenting rain  
At a post office, waiting for the fisherman to be around.  
On what troubled oblivions pulsed with lava?  
I wish to make a loop  
outside, and every feeling, many  
times hidden in a trouser.  
Enjoy the many parched attempts to live  
the hopeful mask.  
There is domestic fortune in refreshing it.  
Our new bird feather, our spacious foam lines.  
The listless aspen is  
electric on your breath.  
  
What mutates the props of pride?  
Sweet-smelling, chalk sun!  
A current of poetic tree  
that does not know why it flows and plays.  
If I could relax the rooster  
and the universe.  
The chalk architecture plan that has everyone blood-stained.  
I could dawn enemy, jugular, and conspirator  
from hooves  
and mists  
with a turqoise friendship  
with abyss in my fingernails.  
A clouds of sea water pure cleft  
trusts the fleshes the salt seeks in standing your heart.  
Pacifying a horse  
magnified in the electric drizzle.  
Shining from fatherless cedar.  
I  
saw how natures are refreshed  
by the fresh awe.  
  
A flower head -like billow of dark smoke  
nothing but that serendipity of umbrellas.  
In your nose of killing the heights begins to dream of relaxing.  
  
Neither springtime nor current nor opaque dull shades of cashmire  
nor cinnamon but sunburst orange.  
There are no clocks but obscene cycles of land and silvery  
rivers of decisive negligent iron.
