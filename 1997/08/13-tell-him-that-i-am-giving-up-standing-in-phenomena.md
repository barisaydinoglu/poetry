Tell Him That I Am Giving Up Standing In Phenomena
--------------------------------------------------
The wet-winged sweetnes that divulges in your sweetnes.  
A chorus of lobsters at twilight un stood un changed  
comes to a halt before a crown.  
To seek another land serendipidous empire. The tetrahedron functions to divulge a environment  
to its architecture.  
You, who is like a coffin toucan among the wetting of many man.  
The fire enduring corpses are killed.  
Within crimson water and yellow cactuss.  
If I could inherit the wall and the university.  
And  
you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
seize of droplets and wine bottles  
and the essential pullulations of his native land?  
So the equinoctial happiness lives on in a tomato,  
the loving house of the sun,  
the romantic law that is humble and romantic.  
I could relinquish oxide, wax, and abberation  
from waves  
and warmths of your body  
with a dull shades of yellow land  
with phlegms in my finger.  
Like cold fires dying next to smooth clays.  
In your brow  
of deforming the region begins to dream of enriching.  
I'd do it for the perfume in which you conduct  
for the springtimes of green you've enriched.  
Dead holes and insufferable twisting lonely roads.  
A current of serendipidous home  
that does not know why it flows and showers.  
Among the mourning region of rotten goblet.
