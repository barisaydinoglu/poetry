Hearing Is An Episode Of Pamphlet
---------------------------------
Full stop.  
Sometimes a piece of the sky  
electrifies like a river in my heart.  
Marine polyps of noise,  
green seams above a shifty femininity.  
Like the bitter  
graphite of serendipities everything shifty with honest voices, the salt of the sea shell  
and piles of real bread inside night.  
Has the area been wove with secrets?  
A tear stained projection abducts  
even the irreducable  
slightest room in antenna  
to which the metaphor  
will not be galloped.  
In the middle of the land like clay.  
Fewer and fewer  
gnaw about another mode of purity.  
Trusted and then magnified in the archipeligos.  
This rabid writing and relaxing serendipity abhors me  
with it's winged autumns like hand and eye  
and ultraviolet lemons like mouth and lighthouses.  
Of your opaque brimstone bridge when you hold out your toe.  
A sequence magnifies,  
deforms - it does not return.  
Among the bird feather of the chimney where you sleep,  
a dream bristles into sequences.  
How preserving is the stationary conspirator and it's homogeneous massacres?  
And a sifted river bank's water will magnify you.
