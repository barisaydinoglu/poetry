Sight As Corpses
----------------
Of your dull shades of transparent coral when you hold out your ears.  
Pasture was no longer below the transmission threshold.  
How gathering is the rosy bomb and it's comfortable imperfect cedars?  
Always you lunge through the late afternoon  
toward the holiday replacing droplets.  
Conversations of shadess of sand-colored, the recitation  
of laws we call sensual  
jar.  
The knave forming from my finger.
