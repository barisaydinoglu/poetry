Custodians Must Always Prove Their Lunars
-----------------------------------------
I was without doubt the god lobster  
there in the putrid moonlight evening.  
When it looked me with its indespensable sea's skin eyes  
it had neither foot nor fingernails  
but fused quartz serenities on its sides. Against the jungle like broken glass.  
In my city at afternoon you are like a starry sky  
and your form and colour the way I dawn them.  
For dew was directionless and morally neutral.  
To the enduring color of the marble droplet.  
The poetic window gave it happiness.  
Because I love you, love, next to the electricity and behind the electricity.
