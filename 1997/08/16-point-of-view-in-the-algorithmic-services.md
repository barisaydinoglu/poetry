Point Of View In The Algorithmic Services
-----------------------------------------
Everybody here is waiting for the next serenity.  
Eddy. You woke yourself for playing. Be guided by the perfect sphere's serendipity.  
Someone here is waiting for the next productivity.  
Crown. You transformed yourself for transforming.  
For a day, maybe twenty-seven,  
I rested under a ocean wave  
at a bus stop, waiting for the sailor to be with.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
fly of candles and forms  
and the aquatic aspens of his native land?  
To the acerb color of the silken kiss.  
A deedy rug making a lovely thing of a likely meeting with a son.
