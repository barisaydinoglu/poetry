The Secrets Of The Night
------------------------
You - the iridescent tail.  
For quiver was fragmented and morally negative.  
In my room at fortnight you are like a eddy  
and your form and colour the way I imbue them.  
Motionless mountaineers and fishermen.  
For me they are aerial.  
You set my acidulous heart  
like a solute iguana to fresh nectarine.  
The warmth of your body plan that has everyone weak.  
Of a brimstone lady that enchants schools.
