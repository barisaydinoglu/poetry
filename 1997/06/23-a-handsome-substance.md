A Handsome Substance
--------------------
Realized handsome ripple my essential finger  
stores you always.  
The ripple storing from my toe.  
If you were not the plum the domestic moon  
cooks, sprinkling its nectarine across the university.  
The serection mixes on its rambunctious mare  
swimming yellow precisions over the moonlight evening.  
Puncture me and let my substance dawn.  
It stores like a horse within the saxophone.  
Amid the abolishing shortcuts.  
The femininities exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
within it in darkness.  
  
A difficult study wipes  
even the delicious  
side modern office in camera  
to which the metaphor  
will not be discovered.  
You say, what is the ribbon waiting for in its burnt umber praise?  
I tell you it is waiting for branch  
like you.  
  
The flower rustling from my leg.  
In my land at morning you are like a perfume  
and your form and colour the way I create them.
