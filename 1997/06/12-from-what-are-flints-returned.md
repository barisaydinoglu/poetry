From What Are Flints Returned
-----------------------------
It was a tremulous business of stalactite and vaginas. A loaf of bread baked with fractious wonder and salt.  
Our new silence, our steady precision loops.  
My affluent brow crystallizes you always.  
Nothing but that sweetnes of laws.  
Pure eternity responds the veins a coral -like trapdoor  
a branch -like coal  
beginning toward the warmth and meetings of lonely breath your heart transforms from north to south.  
What careful veins -  
the university is filled with it,  
productivities for the goblet  
and  
the cold fused quartz.  
Not the sepia moment  
when the afternoon relaxes the crowns.  
A chorus of ostriches at early light of day un magnified un foreboded  
comes to a halt before a mane.  
  
In the face of so many phlegms to positivity.  
What changes the props of honor?
