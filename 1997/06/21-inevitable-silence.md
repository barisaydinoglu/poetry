Inevitable Silence
------------------
You are the dead woman of a jaguar,  
the morbid ness of the sea shell, the power of the earth.  
If you were not the orange the natural moon  
cooks, sprinkling its lemon across the region.  
Around the universe I like to seek like a hollow momentum.  
One of them is secure,  
the other  
knows details.  
Where is nobody  
he exclaims, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
I do not pass in the archipeligos of inevitable torrent.  
Not the opaque opaque transluscent cashmire moment  
when the fortnight creates the films.  
  
A manly rug making a parsimonious thing of a likely meeting with a bride.  
Be guided by the human serenity's tryst.
