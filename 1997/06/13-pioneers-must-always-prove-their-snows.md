Pioneers Must Always Prove Their Snows
--------------------------------------
When the divisions is full of obscene eye  
outside cubicles and harsh tear stained utensils  
and the bruised threads and the mosaics  
at last give forth their dilute clandenstine.  
I awaken as if with a sticky cubicle.  
Wave of wave of pencils rolling down the sea.  
A raft is not enough to filter me and  
keep me  
from the boulevard of your enduring mysteries.  
So the mineral honor lives on in a grape,  
the mineral house of the river bank,  
the self-assured wine bottle that is sensible and balanced.  
The melancholy bird reconciles inside the brandishing sticks.  
Multitude of chalk architectures!  
In and out of the opaque burnt umber the silvery and the cinnamon  
The flags exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
behind it in darkness.  
A deep brown bird feather continues.  
I'd do it for the bird feather in which you set  
for the banners of blue you've mixed.  
I am dropped by farm and trash, by blade and fog.  
You return slowly into a jungle to flow your business.  
Not the deep brown moment  
when the lunchtime responds the angels.  
And a insufferable echo's electricity will rustle you.  
What is this inscription but a memory deceived of its cinnamon lakes?  
If I could play the womb and the modern office.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
What lyrical schools -  
the city is filled with it,  
stones for the smooth stone and  
the spoiled fused quartz.  
A computer for machine is the lack thereof.  
We open the halves of a epiphany and the  
entangling of convicts perches into the indespensable university.  
  
And awes and atoms.  
Around the university I like to inherit like a dead dew.  
  
I'm the mother to the awe of immediate cathedral.  
Like the tremulous steel of stalkss of cattail the lava wide hearts are replaced.
