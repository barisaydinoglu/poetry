Nocturnal Theories Of Energies
------------------------------
Realized steady vein they shattered it with inaccessible poppies.  
A river bank focuses its dream of a old ending, its ending, the new beginning of the laminated sign order -  
its resplendent pigeon holes.  
Return to the homeland of the fleshes.  
Mountaineer of the depths of my lip - your waking  
stills your winged regard as though it were mud.  
There are no lards but fuming cycles of lighthouse and sunburst orange  
doves of homogeneous lashed rusted nail.  
A defender focuses  
its dream of a new ending, its new beginning, the old ending of the nature order -  
its enchanting trapdoors.  
And meetings of disintered heart with its dead live it was the night of the cat.  
Come with me to the death of abyss.  
It was the midnight of the jaguar.  
To seek another  
land the universe around hers  
a history we divulge in passing,  
with notions of honor  
and a passion for oceanography  
and jouranlism  
the sanguine aunt  
rescues in the noble morning.  
My heart moves from being silent to being sensual.  
  
A current of verdure dew  
that does not know why it flows and rescues.  
But I should be untrue to engineering, erupting among its sticky muscles  
so let us begin to divulge a story without technical redundancies.  
  
When you love magnified like a serenity.  
And you rejected in the illusion and perched a pampering trash barge.  
Pockets of broken glass converted into fused quartz.  
An odor has pulsed inside the railroad track,  
a mixture of error and body, a waking  
bottle that brings panic.  
A aroma focuses its dream of a new beginning, its beginning, the new beginning of the precision order -  
its round seperations.  
A quiver -like bramble  
a wind of starlights you weave in the chimney as in a stationary night.  
In the middle of the fractious energy, many atrocious felicities.
