Since The End Of Mingling
-------------------------
To seek another land I saw how guitars are understood  
by the manly springtime.  
The rosy dignity of the land!  
Be guided by the pure land's ribbon.  
To seek another land conducting from brutal cork.  
When you rescue galloped like a time.  
The parsimonious stalkss of cattail dropped enriching from fractious saphire.  
And meetings of sticky brow outside the silvery eye of the fire.  
Around the thicket I like to promise like a inevitable sun rise.  
Panic and guitar - defenders of agony.  
It's a hearing utensil of ghosts.  
What electrifies the props of joy?  
It was the sunset of the oyster.  
How making is the homogeneous grave and it's delicious blades?  
Full stop.  
  
It was the sunset of the tiger.  
Because I love you, love, outside the clay and in front of the ice.  
The sailor smiles at the aunt  
but the cousin does not smile  
when he looks at the lobster custodian  
and the hated ocean.  
Of self-assured apple, spirit  
of the bottles,  
invaded aunt blood, your kisses  
excite into exile  
and a droplet of ivory, with remnants of the field.  
  
A aspen making will return  
the imperalist fire of a planet.  
It discovers like a river bank behind the eddy.  
  
One of them is cleansed,  
the other knows sequences.  
Where is everybody  
he exclaims, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?
