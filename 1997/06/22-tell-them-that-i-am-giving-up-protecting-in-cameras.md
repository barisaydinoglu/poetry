Tell Them That I Am Giving Up Protecting In Cameras
---------------------------------------------------
Indicates the hat's perfuming hand.  
What replaces the props of tiredness?  
A chorus of oysters at afternoon un transformed un congealed  
comes to a halt before a miracle. And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
enrich of times and currents  
and the scrupulous roses of his native land?  
To live lost kiss and for landscapes.
