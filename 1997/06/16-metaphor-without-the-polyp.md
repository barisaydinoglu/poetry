Metaphor Without The Polyp
--------------------------
All bridges become vortices.  
Of solute bread, spirit  
of the honeysuckles,  
pampered stranger blood, your kisses  
perfume into exile  
and a droplet of ivory, with remnants of the vicinity.  
On what parched ashes lived with clay?  
Because I love you, love, around the wind and next to the earth.  
Outside cashmire water and sunburst orange warmths of your body.  
From uncomfortable turbulence to harrowing wind,  
hidden old warrior's medals drawn by serendipidous channels, a  
lewd guitar begins to weave.  
  
To the delicate color of the cork tiger.  
A ears and a eyeballs  
perching the field.
