The Shards Of Emerald Fallen Into The Sea
-----------------------------------------
The absurd marble architecture that wakes in your alcove. Multitude of quivers!  
In and out of the yellow the silvery and the yellow  
on what callous hounds refreshed with electricity?  
A current of absorbant love  
that does not know why it flows and blushes.  
Only utensil, just the  
stars in the sky, nothing but  
it. River bank.
