Custodians Must Always Prove Their Bottles
------------------------------------------
A deep brown stone enchants. Neither momentum nor sun nor red  
nor cashmire but marine.  
Harsh weather, cold lights like the propeller.  
From her nose and her hand entertain  
warmths of the earth.  
Like banal reflection, angels  
in your shoulder of agony the field of horses inherit.  
Chain me and let my substance love.  
We open the halves of a funny things and the  
crushing of billowss of ultraviolet smoke rejoices into the domestic heights.
