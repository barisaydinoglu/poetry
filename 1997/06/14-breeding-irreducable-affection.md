Breeding Irreducable Affection
------------------------------
And you forced in the sorrow and rejoiced an abhorring scandalmongering. Everything obscene with original voices, the salt of the shades of sand-colored  
and piles of fresh bread next to morning.  
Enjoy the many tear stained attempts to dedicate  
the blazing uranu.  
There is solute fortune in carrying it.  
Among the faltering abyss.  
The cluster trusting from my mouth.  
I saw how beds are perfumed  
by the vertical garden.  
Joy is gone, the subject has attracted.  
  
Sometimes a piece of the electricity  
erupts like a writing in my arm.  
Our new friendship, our steady telegraph circles.  
  
When you build like rose awakened by the fire.
