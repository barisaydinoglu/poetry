A Song Of Confusion
-------------------
I was without doubt the god jaguar  
there in the skeleton night.  
When it looked me with its slender mirror eyes  
it had neither eyelids nor heart  
but chalk evening stars  
on its sides.  
She is outside us at this moment of first kissing.  
My electrical hand creates you always.  
Muzzled depths and dead wastelands.  
Shades of sunburst orange.  
Of your black soul when you hold out your hips.  
Shall we proceed?  
Spacious, copper umbrella!  
  
Indicates the fragrance of strawberry's discovering toe.  
Respect is gone, the subject has developed.  
Amid the plaguing clocks.  
Marine juices of twisting lonely road,  
transluscent transparent seams above a motionless leaf.  
You see foot as fluidic as the rain.  
What conquers the props of joy?  
From her heart and her brain dawn  
phemonanas of the earth.  
The fleeting sun rise gave it tiredness.  
  
The lightning imposes nessecity.  
The pioneer smiles at the one  
but the cousin does not smile  
when he looks at the elephant person  
and the wet-winged ocean.
