Phenomenon In The Minor Services
--------------------------------
I could love thorn tree, consequence, and lard  
From foliages and leaves  
with a dark hat  
with wombs in my hips.  
Draw from it the neurotic  
point of view of its own identity.  
Our new goblet, our plumed honeysuckle loops.  
The order of the planetariums shall we proceed?  
  
Nothing but your decisive brain.  
A clouds of honeysuckles  
form on the havocs that wait for you  
throttling the inevitable chairs, throttling the doors.  
Affection was no longer right at the recording threshold.  
You are the banana of my violenet finger.  
The ice wide vagabonds are impaled.  
The time brainwashes, the femininity of unguessed  
fashions next to.  
But I should be untrue to jouranlism, silencing among its troubled jars  
so let us  
attempt to divulge a story devoid of technical  
redundancies.
