A Tomato

Behind the lighthouse of the university where you sleep,  
a dream gnaws into phenomena.  
It is a tale of insatiable massacres they are all cousins  
professional imbroglios in whose charitable flower heads originate.  
Multitude of gardens!  
In and out of the deep brown the sepia and the burnt umber burnt umber cities of error,  
cashmire seams above a mourning cluster.
