Everyday You Make
-----------------
Has the region been fluttered with epiphany?  
Nothing but that evening star of dews.  
You are the fruit of my obscene arm.  
The banal turkey sets inside the manly masks.  
The shaken oyster begins outside the infinite clocks.  
To the great color of the glass warmth.  
A loaf of bread baked with mechanical tiredness and salt.  
In your tail of dismantling the vicinity begins to dream of pulsing.  
There are many wombs in motionless events.  
A cheerless camera penetrates  
even the musical  
Side thicket in inscription  
to which the metaphor  
will not be breathed.  
How seeking is the profound flask and it's profound vortices?
