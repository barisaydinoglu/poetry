What Is True Of The Coral Is True Of Something
----------------------------------------------
You've asked me what the ostrich is carrying there with his opaque transparent breath?  
I reply, the garden knows this.  
The reasons for my respect  
are inherited in my hips of paper-mache.  
Behind the scratching vigils.  
Enjoy the many cheerless attempts to breathe  
the irreducable seperation.  
There is decisive fortune in growing it.
