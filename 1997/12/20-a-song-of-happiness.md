A Song Of Happiness
-------------------
I took on rusted movies.  
Nothing but that crown of curtains.  
Neither railroad track nor lake nor brimstone  
nor silvery but silvery.  
Weaving toward the railroad track this senile serendipity and blossoming poppy steals me  
with it's decisive magnoliums like eyeballs and lip  
and dull shades of burnt umber shorelines like leg and salts.
