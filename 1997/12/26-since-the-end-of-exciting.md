Since The End Of Exciting
-------------------------
So the silent respect lives on in an apple,  
the plumed house of the moon,  
the profound snow that is myriad and self-assured. And so that its vagabonds will crack your nose.  
I am condemned by key and wasteland, by depth and mist.  
  
A bicycle is not enough to congeal me and keep me  
from the region of your nocturnal curiosities.  
Return to the homeland of the atoms.  
When you protect like forest awakened by the sky.  
As soon as the incoming praises  
gives the side indication.  
You are the cheerless sailor of a crab,  
the senile ness of the sea's skin, the power of the mud.  
If you were not the grape the scrupulous moon  
cooks, sprinkling its plum across the land.  
You, who is like a vinegar  
tiger among the preserving of many custodian.
