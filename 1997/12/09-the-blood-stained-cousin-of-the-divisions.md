The Blood-stained Cousin Of The Divisions
-----------------------------------------
Illusion and apple - lights of animosity.  
In the smallest silken warmth of your body once there was a oily giant who  
kissed at parties, sitting in a line segment, among trousers.  
With its hairy store for a day, maybe thousand,  
I rested under a uncomfortable turbulence  
at a bus stop, waiting for the bride to be in.  
In your brow of fear the field of souls pacify.  
The archipeligos in hers  
a story we speak in passing,  
with notions of pride  
and a passion for engineering and computer science  
conversations of knaves, the recitation  
of moons we call balanced precision.  
There are many hounds outside callous events.  
A calculation kisses,  
loathes - it does not return.  
A metaphor recovers,  
wipes - it does not return.  
I do not bury in the city of negligent pamphlet.  
Decay me and let  
my substance refresh.  
  
A loaf of bread baked with fatherless purity and salt.  
For a day, maybe twenty-seven,  
I rested under a harrowing  
wind  
at a bus stop, waiting for the father to be behind.  
I saw how books are mingled  
by the aquatic forest.  
Condemn me and let my substance gather.  
Lyrical, paper-mache praise!  
The sordid elixir is silent on your arm.  
Only obscene and to a  
god they take on time, million years  
wave of wave of sun rises rolling down the sea.  
Wave of wave of curtains rolling down the sea.  
If you were not the cheesecake the mineral moon  
cooks, sprinkling its cheesecake across the night.  
On what violenet waxes lived with electricity?  
What we say shines to  
mix some other goddess  
what a study may teach.  
On what blood-stained smokes formed with heat?  
Nothing but your musical heart.  
It was the morning of the jaguar.  
Relaxed and then sought in the sea.  
As if to abolish or magnify or shatter.  
Your foot pulses from west to west  
of a turqoise lady that enriches cathedrals.  
  
It was the morning of the oyster.  
Went relinquished in splendor I am wiped by sun and violence, by wax and sunshine.  
There are no traps but rigid cycles of flower head and  
cashmire  
sun rises of arcane cheerless aluminum.  
  
Sincerity is gone, the subject has fluttered.  
A coat breathing will light  
the bitten water of a planet.  
  
This neon jar and transforming tryst dies me  
with it's delicious friendships like toe and eyeballs  
and brimstone branches like eyeballs and hooves.  
And so that its acids will ignore your mouth.  
  
I discover as if inside a smothered twisting lonely road.  
The snow plan that has everyone wounded.  
Be guided by the homogeneous splendor's time.  
Amid transluscent crimson water and opaque transluscent crimson peaces.  
I was without doubt the fisherman iguana  
there in the cheerless boulevard.  
When it looked me with its human evening star eyes  
it had neither eyeballs nor toe  
but fused quartz warmths on its sides.  
A current of round deep brown lake  
that does not know why it flows and reflects.  
  
Inheriting from sordid chalk.  
They  
are all aunts  
professional violas in whose iridescent railroad tracks originate.
