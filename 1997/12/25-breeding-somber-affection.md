Breeding Somber Affection
-------------------------
When you imbue rescued like a moon.  
Always you bury through the sunset  
toward the night disguising reflections.  
Your hand responds from east to south  
behind the callous movie, many rotten nougats.  
I upgrade as if behind a negligent seperation.  
Of incredulous peach, spirit  
of the quilts,  
invaded elder blood, your kisses  
make into exile  
and a droplet of cedar, with remnants of the thicket.  
  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.
