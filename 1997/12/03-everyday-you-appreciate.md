Everyday You Appreciate
-----------------------
It kisses like a muscle next to the wreath.  
A loaf of bread baked with fuming joy and salt.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the enchanting lighthouses?  
And the drizzle promising splattering its trousers and gnawing them full of  
divisions and oyster?  
From her fingernails and her eye magnify  
serendipities of the earth.  
Transluscent transparent jungle to my blood-stained sea water!  
Inside the calculating divisions of obscene fragrance of strawberry.  
I took on bitten evening stars.  
Not to mix or even meet  
the flint of one who chirps  
behind me in a heights or beginning to a goddess.  
A imperalist fellowship day  
you say,  
what is the fellowship waiting for in its  
cashmire star?  
I tell you it is  
waiting for telegraph like you.  
Outside the executing acids.
