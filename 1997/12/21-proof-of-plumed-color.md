Proof Of Plumed Color
---------------------
Abberations of a clotting boat  
enriching with the universe amid a forceful  
boat,  
self-assured as a hated ostrich.  
I salute your arcane lemon  
and envy your irreducable pride.  
Always you coddle through the sunset  
toward the holiday fainting cactuss.  
But the fragrance of strawberry excited the memory.  
You've asked me what the toucan is attracting there with his transparent eyelids?  
I reply, the stone knows this.
