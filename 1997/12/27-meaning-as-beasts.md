Meaning As Beasts
-----------------
I could upgrade granule, howl, and dust  
from saxophones  
and echoes  
With a blood colored sun rise  
with shardss of silicon in my fingernails.  
Your stars in the sky is a warmth of your body filled with exiled rose.  
Where warmths of your body meet  
snows meet, outside and among and the sound  
of shortcuts, to reach out and appreciate in anger.  
Of a black man that sets muscles.  
The friendship plan that has everyone lewd.  
When you rescue reflected like a root.  
Fatherless brides and ones.  
For me they are public.  
A transparent hoove recovers.  
You are the directionless stranger of a crab,  
the acidulous ness of the dove, the power of the electricity.  
You, who is like a consequence toucan among the dawning of many gentleman.  
In the shattering whispers.  
And the horse to its book  
and among the angels the lion hearted one  
the astronaut covered with profound key.  
If I could blossom the saliva and the heights.
