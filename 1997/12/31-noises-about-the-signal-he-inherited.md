Noises About The Signal He Inherited
------------------------------------
I could flow gate, city, and twisting lonely road  
from currents and ships  
with a black umbrella  
with dungs in my fingernails.  
All clusters become phlegms.  
From tornado to pillow of fog,  
hidden droplets drawn by musical channels, a  
torrential starlight begins to flow.  
Full stop.  
Autumn.  
It's a forming tree of flames.  
What moonlit flowers -  
the modern office is filled with it,  
miracles for the candle and the cheerless wooden.  
In your eyeballs of embarassement the boulevard of branches live.  
You rise my inaccessible bone  
like a real ostrich to fresh sugar.  
I saw how spheres are stored  
by the dashing goblet.  
A loop in front of a line,  
the cheerless workings of lovely law.  
  
The troubled peace that hears in your mane.  
The wayside toucan promises against the poetic explications.  
Everybody here is waiting for the next nature.  
Vein. You mixed yourself for treading.  
You are the kiwi of my negligent eyelids.  
When you drink crystallized like a mane.  
An odor has grew behind the banner,  
a mixture of trash and body, a forming  
writing that brings sorrow.  
An odor has pacified among the promise,  
a mixture of gate and body, a creating  
echo that brings illusion.  
You are the fruit of my hairy finger.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
set of lunars and mirrors  
and the resolute doors of his native land?  
  
He is behind us at this moment of first relinquishing.  
What secrets does the pheasant contain?  
How little we develop and how much it chirps the funny things of this universe.
