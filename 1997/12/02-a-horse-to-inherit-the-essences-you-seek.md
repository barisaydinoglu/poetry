A Horse To Inherit The Essences You Seek
----------------------------------------
In my region at midnight you are like a telegraph  
and your form and colour the way I tread them. Not the marine moment  
when the late afternoon rises the love.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the electric trousers?  
And the fog equinoctial splattering its smooth stones and lunging them full of  
area and crab?  
This sticky flag and fluttering path bristles me  
with it's unguessed goblets like fingernails and breath  
and dull shades of silvery lakes like breath and kiss.  
Connecting a hat  
perched in the soft clouds.  
  
Of enchanting apple, spirit  
of the kiss,  
Killed child blood, your kisses  
mingle into exile  
and a droplet of ceramic, with remnants of the thicket.  
When the city is full of worn-out mouth  
inside whispers and rotten sordid poppies  
and the guilt precisions and the starry  
skies  
at last give forth their sterile legless horse.  
Petrify me and let my substance gallop.  
Of your turqoise ship when you hold out your toe.  
We get the feeling  
they must lots to pacify  
to each other  
or perhaps  
nothing but salts.  
Perhaps they are not drowned.  
Making toward the garden all bridges become oxides.  
Like mourning star, peaces  
a eye and an arm  
weaving the jungle.
