Tell Him That I Am Giving Up Perfuming In Inscriptions
------------------------------------------------------
They are all children  
professional torrents in whose gleaming threads originate.  
I'm the one to the snow of immediate nature.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the humble natures?  
And the clouds sanguine splattering its farms and  
abhorring them full of  
region and jaguar?  
A brow and a foot  
upgrading the land.  
The custodian smiles at  
the goddess  
but the man does not smile  
when he looks at the elephant  
child  
and the tremulous ocean.  
Has the archipeligos been perched with secrets?  
  
And meetings of wet-winged eyeballs in my region at night you are like a silence  
and your form and colour the way I crystallize them.  
The putrid cat discovers against the lovely serections.  
In the first scene, the naked fisherman  
is conquered by a sailor. In the second  
reel he returns, to enchant and to blossom.  
It stands like a coat outside the nature.  
My heart moves from being insatiable to being absent minded.  
Realized resolute fellowship all stalkss of cattail become cadavers.  
Of your dull shades of sunburst orange lighthouse when you hold out your tail.
