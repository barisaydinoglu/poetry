From What Are Peaces Circumscribed
----------------------------------
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
Obscene midnight and the callous pencil  
erupt at the walls of my house.  
Only coat, just  
the  
path, nothing but  
it. Sweetnes.  
Halfway.  
I took on molested eddies.  
Chaotic pioneers and sailors.  
For me they are technical.  
How protecting is the changeless hole and it's noble massacres?  
And  
meetings of decadent nose multitude of energies!  
In and out of the burnt umber the burnt umber and the green
