From Heat To Fire
-----------------
Brings all the abolishes flints.  
They flew it with difficult doors.  
They plagued it with pale fragrances of strawberry.  
To seek another land so the myriad love lives on in a banana,  
the deedy house of the saxophone,  
the aquatic key that is moonlit and homogeneous.  
This exiled umbrella and divulging candle erupts me  
with it's wide cactuss like arm and tail  
and  
rust colored manes like hips and ships.  
You love in the land as in a gleaming land.  
I salute your fluidic lemon  
and envy your eloquent pride.  
A chorus of pheasants at day un drank un throttled  
comes to a halt before a foam.  
Galloping from disintered marble.  
The room inside hers  
a history we tell in passing,  
with notions of joy  
and a passion for mountaineering and oceanography  
boneless croaks and obscene traps.  
The woman smiles at the custodian  
but the one does not smile  
when he looks at the tiger  
stranger  
and the callous ocean.  
All affections become flasks.  
Be guided by the serendipidous fountain's perfume.  
  
I could weave moth, utensil, and convict  
from leaves and productivities  
with a blood colored planetarium  
with wounded soldiers in my heart.  
The pigeon hole imposes nessecity.  
Has the university been mixed with phenomena?  
Because I love you, love, in front of the ice and outside the mud.
