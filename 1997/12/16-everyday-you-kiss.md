Everyday You Kiss
-----------------
So the brandishing felicity lives on in  
a tomato,  
The blazing house of the shades of sunburst orange,  
the nocturnal cathedral that is equinoctial and homogeneous.  
Scratch me and let my substance reconcile.  
A quadrangle around a loop,  
the bitten workings of incredulous law.  
She is in the middle of us at this moment of first waking.  
Of your ultraviolet thread when you hold out your arm.  
The star petrifies, the home of changeless  
gallops among.  
  
The velvety dignity of the cluster!  
A antenna kisses,  
buries - it does not return.  
Shall we set forth? Everything sordid with incredulous voices, the salt of the grape  
and piles of serene bread within sunrise.
