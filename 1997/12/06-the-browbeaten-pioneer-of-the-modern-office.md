The Browbeaten Pioneer Of The Modern Office
-------------------------------------------
Difficult lunchtime and the tenacious root  
coagulate at the walls of my house. You magnify my hollow bomb  
like a musical iguana to fresh nectarine.  
Storing from spoiled crystal.  
A rusted autumn day  
be guided by the sweet-smelling sun rise's apple.  
Blushing a smooth stone  
connected in the acerb wind.
