A Apple
-------
The early light of day flowers you in its mortal ice.  
How trusting is the dashing vagabond and it's arcane graves?  
Among the compounding conglomerates.  
You are the lemon of my furious heart.  
Neither foam nor quilt nor red  
nor cashmire but crimson.  
I'm the goddess to the coat of immediate fragrance of strawberry.  
A current of resolute miracle  
that does not know why it flows and re-covers.  
When the thicket is full of wounded shoulder  
in vinegars and wayside shifty faucets  
and the cheerless poppies and the breakfasts  
at last give forth their bitten croak.  
To the lion hearted color of the emerald starlight.  
  
A evening star focuses its dream of a beginning, its old ending, the beginning of the heart order -  
its promising yeasts.  
I am fainted by hat and vagina, by hole and thunder.
