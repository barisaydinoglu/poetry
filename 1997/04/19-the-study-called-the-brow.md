The Study Called The Brow
-------------------------
Neither droplet nor snow nor rust colored  
nor sunburst orange but blue.  
Shut up and shut up like a kiss.  
Fuming gods and uncles.  
For me they are alphabetic.  
What we say preserves to  
transform some other one  
what a metaphor may teach.  
Around the crushing utensils.  
Be guided by the enduring path's door.
