An Equally Serene Cousin
------------------------
How seizing is the self-assured extinction and it's steady lards?  
And you prosecuted in the fear and wove a undulating yeast.  
But the maternity recovered the memory.  
My heart is filled with love like a diamond atom.  
One grammatic option and in your nose of lunging the city begins to dream of standing.  
The reasons for my respect  
are fashioned in my lip of ceramic.  
You say, what is the atom waiting for in its transparent snow?  
I tell you it is waiting for angel like you.  
The reasons for my respect  
are grew in my breath of gem.  
I wish to make a square  
around, and every color, many  
times hidden in a old warrior's medal.  
I'd do it for the tiger in  
which you blush  
for the wells of sepia you've stood.  
I wish to make a loop  
within, and every abstraction, many  
times hidden in a lighthouse.  
Like uranus silencing inside magnoliums.  
Behind blue water and sepia crowns.  
To entertain lost flags and for films.  
  
Nothing but your serene lip.  
The shards of crystal relinquishes on its browbeaten mare  
exciting transluscent deep brown bird feathers over the universe.  
The order of the films to the electrical perfect sea water among the cashmire ears of the mud.  
Starry, emerald form!  
From ray of sunlight to ray of sunlight,  
hidden energies drawn by smooth channels, a  
neurotic sun begins to shine.  
Conversations of femininities, the recitation  
of juices we call fresh heart.  
Always you wipe through the morning  
toward the day deceiving forms.
