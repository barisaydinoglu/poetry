She Has A Bitterest Complex
---------------------------
This hated stars in the sky and crystallizing forest  
deludes me  
With  
it's electrical starry skies like finger and leg  
and dark windows like curves and poppies.  
Not trusting is a form of seeking.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
trust of aspens and forms  
and the scrupulous roots of his native land?  
Here I am, a manly shoulder dismantled in the land of faucet.
