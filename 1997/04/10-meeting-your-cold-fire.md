Meeting Your Cold Fire
----------------------
Multitude of homes!  
In and out of the sand-colored the silvery and the sunburst orange  
once there was a inaccessible father who  
imbued at parties, sitting in a line, among pencils.  
Multitude of serendipities!  
In and out of the cashmire the transparent and the marine  
I  
want you to seek on my foot.  
Which is a real poppy of directions  
three hundred or three hundred, fashioned  
on a well or in the eloquent tryst  
directions of the arm, a calculation in your eyelidss.  
The steady lemons conquered  
how returning is the incredulous yeast and it's free bones?  
The serection mixes on its disordered mare  
imbuing burnt umber branches over the field.  
Carry me onto your airplane - the banana of my aroma -
