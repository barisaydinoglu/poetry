Camera Without The Martyr
-------------------------
I'm the bride to the mist  
of immediate lighthouse.  
Not to dawn or even meet  
the current of one who stores  
in the middle of me in a universe or rustling to a mountaineer.  
And among my hammock, during the afternoon, I woke up naked  
and full of sincerity.  
You are the lemon of my rigid eye.  
Of round orange, spirit  
of the cathedrals,  
shook astronaut blood, your kisses  
connect into exile  
and a droplet of copper, with remnants of the night. I do not abolish in the city of wayside ghost.  
She is in us at this moment of first seizing.  
For miracle was lashed and morally positive.  
The smothered tiger conducts under the pure cities.
