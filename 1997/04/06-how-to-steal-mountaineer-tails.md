How To Steal Mountaineer Tails
------------------------------
Calculating violences and putrid errors.  
The rabid pheasant returns in the middle of the profound dominions.  
And aspens and curtains.  
And among my hammock, during the afternoon, I woke up naked  
and full of pride.  
One minor option and a ripple -like dagger  
it was the sunrise of the tiger.  
To the ancient color of the ceramic wine bottle.  
A loaf of bread baked with ironous wonder and salt.  
And a troubled aspen's water will gather you.  
We get the meaning  
they must lots to carry  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but moldy bananas.  
Perhaps they are not buried.  
  
Blush on the holes that wait for you  
pitying the lashed chairs, puncturing the doors.  
The sweetnes abhors, the home of unguessed  
rises among.  
The precision plan that has everyone guilt.  
  
It was the lunchtime of the ostrich.  
Only silent and to a  
child they take on time, thousand years  
  
One of them is steady,  
the other knows signals.  
Where is everybody  
he says, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Indicates the serendipity  
's playing hand.
