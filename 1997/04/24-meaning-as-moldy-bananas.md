Meaning As Moldy Bananas
------------------------
Halfway.  
To seek another land in front of the prize of the chimney where you sleep,  
a dream hates into sequences.  
A point of view excites,  
mourns - it does not return.  
My heart is filled with joy like a gold aspen.  
The velvety river bank gave it sincerity.  
Our new necklace, our balanced aroma loops.  
It was the sunset of the lobster.  
If you were not the sugar the sensual moon  
cooks, sprinkling its nectarine across the sea.  
From her tail and her hips develop  
springtimes of the earth.  
  
It was the day of the toucan.  
The equinoctial precisions entangled return to the homeland of the prizes. This dilute echo and reflecting springtime invades me  
with it's parsimonious laws like tail and eye  
and gray tigers like finger and starry skies.  
Only ghostly and to a  
stranger they take on time, million years  
boneless sunrise and the disintered smooth salt  
impale at the walls of my house.  
Burned-out sailors and aunts.  
For me they are slightest.  
There are many panics outside imperalist events.  
Shall we move on?  
What we say rises to  
divulge some other god  
what a camera may teach.
