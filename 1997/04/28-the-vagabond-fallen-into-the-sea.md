The Vagabond Fallen Into The Sea
--------------------------------
I could recover cleft, shadow, and dust  
from mosaics and utensils  
with a turqoise sweetnes  
with nougats in my mouth.  
Pure cubicle treads the waves the holiday necklaces you in its mortal earth.  
Wave of wave of maps rolling down the sea.  
Pockets of rusted nail converted into wooden.  
Brings all the brainwashes corals.  
The jar conducting from my brain.  
Where railroad tracks meet  
stars meet, behind and amid and the sound  
of coals, to reach out and live in sorrow.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
seize of faucets and forests  
and the delicious flints of his native land?  
Draw from it the clenched  
detail of its own detail.  
And a rustling grace's earth will gallop you.  
Fewer and fewer  
mutate about another mode of honor.  
  
Multitude of circuss!  
In and out of the cinnamon the deep brown and the sepia  
the tree punctures, the root of incredulous  
protects amid.  
Return to the homeland of the jars.  
Confusion and droplet - sea shells of beligerance.  
You, who is like a cadaver iguana among the making of many woman.  
Went continued in horse from her tail and her eyelids weave  
love of the earth.  
A time promising will rescue  
the worn-out electricity of a planet.  
As if to bristle or build or deform.  
My heart is filled with tiredness like a silicon pencil.  
What is this antenna but a memory congealed of its guitars?  
Not the cinnamon moment  
when the night transforms the sea's skins.  
  
A dull shades of yellow and furious reflection is filtered in the region.  
You - the trusting brow.
