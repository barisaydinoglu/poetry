But I should be untrue to photography, falling among its bitten elixirs  
so let us try to tell a story devoid of aerial redundancies.  
A technique for metaphor is the lack thereof.  
In the mourning flasks.  
Perfuming from torrential diamond.  
My heart  
moves from being troubled to being fresh.  
The mud sweet-smelling bloods are changed.  
  
Pulled out  
and shut up like a cork architecture.  
Realized rosy moon a car is not enough to smear me and keep me  
from the university of your humble mysteries.  
They are all people  
professional pamphlets in whose affluent defenders originate.  
Not the cinnamon moment  
when the holiday relinquishes the lands.  
I stayed recovered and cashmire  
behind the universe.  
Not the marine moment  
when the day perfumes the silken architectures.
