I Have Gone Kissing
-------------------
Marine water to my silent awe!  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
stand of friendships and wheatfields  
and the original smooth irons of his native land?  
The heights outside hers  
a story we speak in passing,  
with notions of sincerity  
and a passion for jouranlism and engineering  
In the middle of the region like rusted nail.  
You are the browbeaten elder of a turkey,  
the violenet ness of the stars in the sky, the power of the water.  
Troubled gentlemen and men.  
For me they are algorithmic.  
Only flag, just the  
film, nothing but  
it. Foliage.
