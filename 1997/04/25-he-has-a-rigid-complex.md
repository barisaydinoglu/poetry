He Has A Rigid Complex
----------------------
One alphabetic option and an arm and a fingernails  
carrying the archipeligos.  
You dedicate in the room as in a somber heights.  
With silvery water and burnt umber muscles.  
The stars in the sky preserves in beginning your leg.  
Conversations of promises, the recitation  
of marble architectures we call hidden precision.  
A juice focuses its dream of a new beginning, its new beginning, the ending of the atom order -  
its vertical vagabonds.  
What we say flows to  
build some other father  
what a camera may teach.
