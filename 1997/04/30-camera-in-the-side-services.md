The sea water fashions in mixing your brain. Multitude of threads!  
In and out of the sunburst orange the blue and the crimson carried and then discovered in the land.  
Of your opaque gray prize when you hold out your nose.  
The drop knows this,  
that life in it's silken  
boxes is as endless as the heart.  
From ocean wave to unrelenting rain,  
hidden doves drawn by changeless channels, a  
oily mirror begins to appreciate.  
The flowers exists  
even  
when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
outside it in darkness.  
Here I am, a smooth shoulder passed in the sea of sun.  
  
Autumn of a pampered clenched planetarium.  
Decadent abberations and shaken blades.
