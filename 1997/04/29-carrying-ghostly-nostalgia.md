Carrying Ghostly Nostalgia
--------------------------
The order of the elixirs  
when the jungle is full of worn-out brain  
around violas and barbaous neon writings  
and the disintered drops and the flower heads  
at last give forth their frail legless horse.  
If you were not the grape the handsome moon  
cooks, sprinkling its cheesecake across the region.  
My heart moves from being frightened to being hidden.  
A bicycle is not enough to electrify me and keep me  
from the area of your gleaming epiphany.  
We get the color  
they must lots to gallop  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but flames.  
Perhaps they are not condemned.  
Drop.  
And you taunted in the panic and crystallized a sobbing wound.  
The absorbant door gave it decency.  
Harsh weather, motionless lights like the root.  
And a sterile flower head's heat will attract you.
