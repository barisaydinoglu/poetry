A Lemon
-------
It's a gathering maternity of daggers.  
Disintered pioneers and women.  
For me they are technical.  
Serendipidous, paper-mache rose!  
Always you steal through the sunrise  
toward the twilight trembling coats.  
  
Conversations of curtains, the recitation  
of sea shells we call mineral femininity.  
A nature expanding will crystallize  
the bitter wind of a planet.
