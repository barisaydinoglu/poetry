The Antenna Has Not Executed The Promise
----------------------------------------
I mix as if among a inevitable flame.  
They are all uncles  
professional acids in whose lion hearted precisions  
originate.  
The midnight energies you in its mortal jungle.  
If I could relinquish the lonely road and the divisions.  
Shall we set forth?  
For a day, maybe too many to count,  
I rested under a harrowing wind  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the goddess to be in.  
Among the red sorrow of the hound.  
Inside the star of the region where you sleep,  
a dream mutates into phenomena.  
This tremulous book and making planetarium steals me  
with it's noble starlights like hand and eye  
and rust colored echoes like lip and starry skies.  
Which is a friendly river of directions  
too many to count or thousand, stored  
on a wheatfield or in the enduring railroad track  
directions of the shoulder, a calculation in your breaths.  
I saw how flints are kissed  
by the affluent thread.  
Went performed in foam not to play or even meet  
the shoreline of one who continues  
in the middle of me in a land or wetting to a elder.  
You weave my directionless belt  
like a naked squirrel to fresh grape.  
And you swim like a perfume and sepia ice to my fire-tipped guitar!  
  
The bitterest cat performs inside the brandishing polyps.  
What funny things does the crab contain?  
How little we imbue and how much it awakens the funny things of this universe.
