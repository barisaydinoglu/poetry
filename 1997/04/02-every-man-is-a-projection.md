Every Man Is A Projection
-------------------------
The insatiable faucet that blushes in your bell.  
And flags and forms.  
From her toe and her lip re-cover  
tigers of the earth.  
Be guided by the gleaming foliage's branch.  
Mourning night and the tremulous atom  
erupt at the walls of my house.  
You are the insatiable fisherman of a turkey,  
the tear stained ness of the soul, the power of the water.
