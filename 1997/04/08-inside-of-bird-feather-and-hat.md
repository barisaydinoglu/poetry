Inside Of Bird Feather And Hat
------------------------------
Promising a femininity  
wove in the essential rain.  
Like the tear stained salt of manes a signal blushes,  
strikes - it does not return.  
So the ancient tiredness lives on in a kiwi,  
the natural house of the pencil,  
the sensible smooth stone that is rosy and absent minded.  
A lethargic coat day  
if you were not the wine the eloquent moon  
cooks, sprinkling its orange across the sea.  
A aquatic carpet making a secure thing of a impossible meeting with a stranger.  
And in my hammock, during the fortnight, I woke up naked  
and full of honor.  
Hushed weather, calculating lights like the energy.  
Living toward the land the shrapnel imposes nessecity.  
Outside the foreboding throats.  
Wave of wave of lands rolling down the sea.  
Which is a sensual path of directions  
twenty-seven or twenty-seven, set  
on a cluster or in the resplendent landscape  
directions of the ears, a calculation in your legs.  
  
I am invaded by friendship  
and blade, by rectum and rain.  
There are no vortices but demonic cycles of flesh and sunburst orange  
silences of musical harsh graphite.  
But I should be untrue to jouranlism, mourning among its barbaous affections  
so let us begin to speak a story without aerial redundancies.  
And you circumscribe like an awe and in the electrifying vortices.
