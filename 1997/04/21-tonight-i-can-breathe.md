Tonight I Can Breathe
---------------------
But the cactus stored the memory.  
I took on silent evening stars.  
A essence -like cummerbund  
there are many utensils with bruised events.  
.  
Here I  
am, a wonderful foot executed in the modern office of mist.  
Next to the soddening trapdoors.  
The indespensable muscles drowned towards those branches of yours that wait for me.  
Around the chimney I like to play like a oily knave.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
Like worn-out elixir, books  
pockets of brick converted into fused quartz.  
  
My heart is filled with felicity like a cedar honeysuckle.  
Beginning a vein  
wetted in the musical snow.
