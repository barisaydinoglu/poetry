Tonight I Can Perch
-------------------
All  
fragrances of strawberry become hounds.  
I was without doubt the astronaut elephant  
there in the worn-out vicinity.  
When it looked me with its self-assured faucet eyes  
It had neither nose nor leg  
but diamond lighthouses on its sides. The human tigers forced and next to my hammock, during the afternoon, I woke up naked  
and full of pride.  
Among the harsh region of fuming branch.  
There ought to be a smooth iron of a deedy fellowship magnifying in a universe.  
It was the sunset of the toucan.  
A transluscent sand-colored soul blossoms.  
It was the afternoon of the crab.  
A sweetnes focuses its dream of a beginning, its new ending, the beginning of the goblet order -  
its stationary oxides.  
Here I am, a verdure nose twisted in the region of candle.  
  
I am forced by autumn and invasion, by wall and sunshine.  
The shifty squirrel pulses inside the friendly salivas.
