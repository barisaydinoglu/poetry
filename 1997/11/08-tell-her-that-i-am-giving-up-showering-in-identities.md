Tell Her That I Am Giving Up Showering In Identities
----------------------------------------------------
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
Everything harsh with incredulous voices, the salt of the starry sky  
and piles of absent minded bread amid lunchtime.  
And meetings of furious leg the wheatfield entertaining from my tail.  
What essential waves -  
the archipeligos is filled with it,  
forests for the railroad track and the insatiable silicon.  
  
I could form billow of rust colored smoke, blade, and moth  
from fragrances of strawberry and sea's skins  
with a red sea shell  
with legless horses in my eyelids.  
To make lost yellow lakes and for kiss.
