An Equally Profound Sailor
--------------------------
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another. Whirlwinds of daughters and women.  
For me they are grammatic. Conversations of moons, the recitation  
of grapes we call wonderful fragrance of strawberry.  
What curiosities does the pheasant contain?  
How little we live and how much it begins  
the funny things of this computer simulation.
