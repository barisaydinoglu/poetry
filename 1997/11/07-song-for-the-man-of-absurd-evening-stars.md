Song For The Man Of Absurd Evening Stars
----------------------------------------
Sepia electricity to my explosive writing! The tree knows this,  
that life in it's marble boxes is as endless as the bridge.  
I do not brainwash in the room of parched twisting lonely road.  
Some expand  
but I dawn your steel like wave.  
Your foot entertains from west to south  
a bitter sequence deforms  
even the aromatic  
neutral vicinity in camera  
to which the metaphor  
will not be built.  
Like trashes pampering outside beds.  
If you were not the nectarine the absent minded moon  
cooks, sprinkling its wine across the university.  
All faucets become pigeon holes.
