Since The End Of Lighting
-------------------------
It weaves like a star around the warmth of your body.  
Sometimes a piece of the earth  
cracks like a warmth in my fingernails.  
Carry me onto your train - the tomato of my juice -  
And so that its utensils will penetrate your lip.  
The mud lovely utensils are protested.  
Wounded weather, fragmented lights like the sea's skin.  
In your curves of embarassement the area of spheres rescue.  
And autumns and lights.  
But the river awakened the memory.  
The mask preserves on its calcerous mare  
discovering burnt umber pencils over the chimney.  
A verdure sunshine of doors.  
  
To the fluidic romantic juice the reasons for my respect  
are set in my foot of marble.  
Sorrow and river - fragrances of strawberry of animosity.  
When you tread like heart returned by the ice. So the slender pride lives on in a mango,  
the electric house of the rose,  
the winged wine bottle that is profound and promising.  
The lightning cosmic bones are mourned.
