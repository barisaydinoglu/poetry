The Language Has Not Deluded The Promise
----------------------------------------
Like hairy rose, bird feathers  
which is a humble law of directions  
too few to count or thousand, woke  
on a forest or in the soft kis  
directions of the brain, a calculation in your feet.  
To fly lost echoes and for wheatfields.  
A land -like flame  
imbuing from dead cedar.  
To the esoteric plumed book in the middle of the bitter propeller, many rotten belts.  
On what forceful wombs circumscribed with water?  
As soon as the incoming wreaths  
gives the alphabetic indication.  
Dilute men and women.  
For me they are technical.  
You say, what is the vein waiting for in its transluscent cashmire  
door?  
I tell you it is waiting for old warrior's medal like you.  
Sunburst orange bones of mask,  
transluscent cashmire seams above a raucous starlight.  
It circumscribes like a mosaic  
outside the bottle.  
Some light but I blossom your broken glass like splendor.  
A neurotic landscape day  
of your red hoove when you hold out your eyelids.  
My heart moves from being brutal to being domestic.  
I salute your ancient bread  
and envy your honest pride.  
  
Nothing but your free brain.  
To the equinoctial  
color of the ivory nature.
