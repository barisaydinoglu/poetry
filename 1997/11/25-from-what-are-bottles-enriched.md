From What Are Bottles Enriched
------------------------------
A current of natural lunar  
that does not know why it flows and reconciles.  
I was without doubt the god cat  
there in the dilute university.  
When it looked me with its careful moon eyes  
it had neither curves nor foot  
but copper lights on its sides.  
Be guided by the plumed mosaic's atom.  
I took on brutal shorelines.  
Pockets of metal converted into cork.  
In your eyeballs of cracking the archipeligos begins to dream of seeking.  
Like wet-winged magnolium, manes  
I'm the uncle to the aspen of immediate serendipity.  
Among deep brown water and opaque transparent railroad tracks.  
Everything barbaous with domestic voices, the salt of the moon  
and piles of smooth bread inside morning.  
For a day, maybe too many to count,  
I rested under a blade of grass  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the mountaineer to be around.
