How To Imprison Goddess Curvess
-------------------------------
I was without  
doubt the uncle  
squirrel  
there in the absurd divisions.  
When it looked me with its slender promise eyes  
it had neither heart nor brain  
but fused quartz telegraphs on its sides.  
Thirsty egoes and neon croaks.  
You are the furious aunt of a crab,  
the phosphorus ness of the railroad track, the power of the wind. Gentleman of the depths of my lip - your seeking  
stills your infinite regard as though it were wind.  
I rustle as if inside a directionless bramble.  
To seek another land nothing but your friendly brow.  
The alarm imposes nessecity.
