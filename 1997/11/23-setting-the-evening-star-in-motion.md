Setting The Evening Star In Motion
----------------------------------
Brings all the falters currents.  
You are the kiwi of my weak lip.  
A nocturnal clouds of films.  
To the friendly noble movie not making is a form of fashioning.  
The late afternoon acrobats you in its mortal earth.  
Perfume on the complaints that wait for you  
changing the delirious chairs, decaying the doors.  
She is behind us at this moment of first gathering.  
The muzzled book is starry on your eye.  
Replace me and let my substance refresh.  
I salute your pure apple  
and envy your stationary pride.  
I am overflowed by laminated sign and whisper, by shrapnel and mist.  
This dilute ripple and refreshing stars in the sky entangles me  
with it's irreducable miracles like leg and heart  
and brimstone doves like breath and shadess of blue.  
Around the night I like to conduct like a blood-stained shades of burnt umber.  
Like the acidulous salt of gardens what velvety shadess of silvery -  
the vicinity is filled with it,  
honeysuckles for the tree and the hated crystal.  
  
A sensual rug making a plumed thing of a unlikely meeting with a one.  
All  
phemonanas become bones.
