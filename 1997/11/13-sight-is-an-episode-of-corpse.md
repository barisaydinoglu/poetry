Sight Is An Episode Of Corpse
-----------------------------
The eager ship gave it purity.  
I wish to make a quadrangle  
next to, and every hearing, many  
times hidden in a drop.  
Only coat, just the  
path, nothing but  
it. Bird feather.  
My cordial toe understands you always.  
In my universe at late afternoon you are like a knave  
and your form and colour the way I tread them.  
Secure, wooden grape!  
The flint builds in understanding your curves.  
The reasons for my respect  
are crystallized in my finger of ceramic.  
Breathe on the serections that wait for you  
petrifying the inevitable chairs, electrifying the doors.  
  
It is a tale of cold stains a crimson ripple drinks.
