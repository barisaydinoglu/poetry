Setting The Tryst In Motion
---------------------------
The jungle acerb vinegars are petrified.  
Angellic empire. The quadrangle functions to connect an architecture  
to its environment.  
I'd do it for the atom in which you awaken  
for the tigers of deep brown you've connected.  
I want you to re-cover on my arm.  
What cordial poppies -  
the thicket is filled with it,  
trees for the cathedral and the imperalist crystal.  
Nothing but your parenthetical heart.  
You see tail as sensible as the sun.
