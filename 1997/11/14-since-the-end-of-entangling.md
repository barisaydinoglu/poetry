Since The End Of Entangling
---------------------------
You've asked me  
what the cat is reflecting there with his green fingernails?  
I reply, the writing knows this.  
Around the university I like to fashion like a barbaous hat.  
The evening star plan that has everyone bitten.  
To seek another land I salute your acerb plum  
and envy your absorbant pride.  
A muzzled awe day  
a crimson sea water weaves.  
And you dropped in the confusion and imbued a dropping city.  
You see foot as delicious as the wind.
