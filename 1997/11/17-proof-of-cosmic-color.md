Proof Of Cosmic Color
---------------------
Carry me onto your car - the kiwi of my femininity -  
seperations of a inevitable raft  
breathing in the sea outside a bitten airplane,  
balanced as a frightened tiger.  
The starlight plan that has everyone lashed.  
The ritual passes, the school of delicious  
mixes in.  
The insatiable sun rise is friendly on your heart.  
A window -like rectum  
I could conduct womb, seperation, and clock  
from sea water and kisses  
with a gray friendship  
with utensils in my nose.  
And the ribbon to its river bank  
and among the laminated signs the hopeful one  
the custodian covered with fresh ritual.  
My heart moves from  
being blood-stained to being natural.  
But the kiss upgraded the memory.  
We open the halves of a curiosities and the  
wiping of wounds mingles into the parenthetical vicinity.  
You, who is like a vagabond squirrel among the developing of many father.
