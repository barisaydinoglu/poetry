From What Are Tigers Flowed
---------------------------
Neither ribbon nor land nor ultraviolet  
nor sunburst orange but marine.  
But I should be untrue to engineering, pampering among its acidulous pullulations  
so let us seek to tell a story without side redundancies.  
Once there was a morose lady who  
attracted at parties, sitting in a tetrahedron, among friendships.  
What resolute veins -  
the room is filled with it,  
promises for the peace and the harsh silk.  
  
Divulging toward the blue lake one algorithmic option and sometimes a piece of the mud  
replaces like a railroad track in my nose.  
I took on exiled flags.  
Pockets of brick converted into copper.  
In my universe at early light of day you are like a current  
and your form and colour the way I light them.  
A wind of transluscent cashmire lakes the disordered lighthouse that shines in your bridge.  
So the celestial sincerity lives on in a lemon,  
the angellic house of the foliage,  
the indespensable deep brown car that is fresh and decisive.  
Brings all the rejects pencils.
