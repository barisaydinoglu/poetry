It Enriched With Rivers
-----------------------
The son smiles at the mother  
but the custodian does not smile  
when he looks at the crab daughter  
and the barbaous ocean.  
A triangle next to a line segment,  
the banal workings of serendipidous law.  
Which is a parsimonious stalks of cattail of directions  
million or twenty-seven, breathed  
on a lunar or in the parenthetical alcove  
directions of the breath, a calculation in your brains.  
The wound showers on its guilt mare  
responding green veins over the universe.  
Nocturnal, paper-mache quilt!  
Your lip returns from north to east  
behind the burnt umber arm of the ice.
