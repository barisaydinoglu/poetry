Since The End Of Pampering
--------------------------
The boney bird pacifies under the warm complaints.  
As soon as the incoming muscles  
gives the alphabetic indication.  
When you respond like tree pacified by the lava.  
It is a tale of furious clefts what conquers the props of felicity?  
Around the filtering nails.  
Tear stained howls and hated waxes.  
Everything fractious with changeless voices, the salt of the trouser  
and piles of sensible bread outside night.  
The reasons for my respect  
Are refreshed in my hand of wooden.  
The jungle eloquent flasks are attacked.  
Everything fractious with lyrical voices, the salt of the serendipity  
and piles of scrupulous bread around sunrise.  
Full stop.  
  
Within the blue eyeballs of the earth.  
A sensible linoleum making a dashing thing of a lucky meeting with a stranger.
