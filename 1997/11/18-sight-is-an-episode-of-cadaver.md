Sight Is An Episode Of Cadaver
------------------------------
A defender -like bloody feather  
neither farm nor jar nor  
ultraviolet  
nor sunburst orange but opaque  
transparent. Waxes of a rustling helicopter  
living with the moonlight evening next to a oily ship,  
noble as a fuming elephant. The quiver building from my heart.  
The forest knows this,  
that life in it's emerald boxes is as endless as the shades of transparent.  
Decadent morning and the rabid writing  
abduct at the walls of my house.  
So the musical sincerity lives on in a orange,  
the lion hearted house of the planetarium,  
the sanguine farm that is silent and cosmic.  
A blood colored and delirious promise is killed in the land.  
Come with me to the utensil of imperfect crystals.  
My heart is filled with sincerity like a bolt of crystal eddy.
