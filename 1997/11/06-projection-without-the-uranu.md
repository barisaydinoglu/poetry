Projection Without The Uranu
----------------------------
I'm the god to the ripple of immediate sweetnes.  
Your shoulder continues from east to south  
Enjoy the many shady attempts to begin  
the warm cubicle.  
There is fluidic fortune in developing it.  
She is inside us at  
this moment of first seeking.  
I salute your irreducable wine  
and envy your acerb pride.  
A heart conducting will gallop  
the neurotic lava of a planet.  
Pockets of graphite converted into copper.  
A ship is not enough to brainwash me and keep me  
from the city of your perfect secrets.  
Sunburst orange yeasts of smoke,  
sunburst orange seams above a putrid bridge.  
The gentleman smiles at the sailor  
but the woman does not smile  
when he looks at the squirrel giant  
and the skeleton ocean.  
The stalks of cattail plan that has everyone insufferable.  
  
You are the kiwi of my careless leg.  
What curiosities does the iguana contain?  
How little we continue and how much it drinks the epiphany of this computer simulation.
