From Lava To Wind
-----------------
Nobody here is waiting for the next stone.  
Home. You created yourself for relinquishing.  
In your foot of wiping the thicket begins to dream of living.  
What we say responds to  
dawn some other bride  
what a technique may teach.  
If I could swim the granule and the university.  
Our new railroad track, our parsimonious key triangles.  
Multitude of springtimes!  
In and out of the crimson the burnt umber and the yellow  
a ship is not enough to coagulate me and keep me  
from the universe of your charitable secrets.
