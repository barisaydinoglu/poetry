From Mud To Wind
----------------
What naked horses -  
the field is filled with it,  
femininities for the lake and the smothered cork.  
You are the grape of my wayside eye.  
In your heart of changing the night begins to dream of circumscribing.  
A miracle focuses its dream of a beginning, its new beginning, the ending of the river bank order -  
its esoteric thorn trees.  
It was a obscene business of cleft and puberties.  
As soon as the incoming telegraphs  
gives the minor indication.  
  
Multitude of coats!  
In and out of the cinnamon the blue and the sunburst orange  
a drizzle of roots everything crooked with verdure voices, the salt of the apple  
and piles of round bread around twilight.  
And a smothered snow's clay will develop you.  
Went flowed in nature a toe and a hand  
perfuming the city.  
The affection plan that has everyone parched.  
You divulge in the region as in an angellic university.  
Everything raucous with charitable voices, the salt of the silence  
and piles of arcane bread amid morning.  
Only muzzled and to a  
god they take on time, too few to count years  
the reasons for my respect  
are drank in my brow of fused quartz.  
And meetings of hairy hips a chorus of pheasants at twilight un rustled un deluded  
comes to a halt before a bird feather.  
The flute crystallizing from my eyelids.
