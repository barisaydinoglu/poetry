Clenched Crown
--------------
Only bruised and to a  
sailor they take on time, too many to count years  
I was without doubt the mother bird  
there in the burned-out land.  
When it looked me with its parenthetical door eyes  
it had neither nose nor fingernails  
but silicon hats on its sides.  
Nothing but your self-assured brain.  
A current of hopeful moon  
that does not know why it flows and awakens.  
My heart moves from being oily to being cosmic.  
A elixir travelling will rise  
the furious ice of a planet.  
Not lighting is a form of loving.
