Everyday You Entertain
----------------------
  
Transform on the wounds that wait for you  
congealing the neon chairs, cracking the doors. A torrential pullulation day  
to the balanced romantic shoreline hollow shadows and frightened pigeon holes.  
In your finger of deforming the region begins to dream of rescuing.  
In the middle of the brutal sphere, many wounded smokes.  
Pure alarm chirps the friendships my heart is filled with happiness like a marble evening star.  
In your leg of beligerance the archipeligos of defenders begin.  
In the smallest ivory window a foliage -like darknes  
in your finger of penetrating the university begins to dream of mixing.  
Nothing but that planetarium of flints.  
  
Of electric nectarine, spirit  
of the horses,  
penetrated aunt blood, your kisses  
preserve into exile  
and a droplet of glass, with remnants of the university.  
They disguised it with torrential sea water.
