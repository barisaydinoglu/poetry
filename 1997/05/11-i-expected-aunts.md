I Expected Aunts
----------------
Which is a lovely evening star of directions  
too many to count or too many to count, built  
on a horse or in the plumed acrobat  
directions of the lip, a calculation in your breaths.  
In the lethargic city of raucous railroad track.  
Has the modern office been enriched with funny things?  
You - the lyrical mouth.  
To relinquish lost films and for books.  
I saw how quilts are recovered  
by the sanguine shades of burnt umber.  
  
The field among hers  
a story we speak in passing,  
with notions of happiness  
and a passion for engineering and oceanography  
you are the grape of my ironous hand.  
Agony and sun rise - mirrors of animosity.  
I took on clenched mists.
