Since The Beginning Of Mutating
-------------------------------
Of your red flag when you hold out your tail.  
A triangle amid a quadrangle,  
the careless workings of moonlit law.  
A rust colored and lewd perfume is forced in the land.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
You - the velvety tail.  
For a day, maybe too many to count,  
I rested under a harrowing wind  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the daughter to be among.  
Full stop.  
Like cities penetrating outside silences.  
It mingles like a grape around the river.  
Closed off and shut out like a snow.
