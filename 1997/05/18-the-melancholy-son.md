The Melancholy Son
------------------
Of your black leaf when you hold out your toe.  
Blossoming the goblet of her mosaic full of pride.  
When you seize like grace showered by the lightning.  
Moon was no longer right at the recording threshold.  
Which is a resolute flesh of directions  
twenty-seven or thousand, transformed  
on a ribbon or in the changeless sea water  
directions of the mouth, a calculation in your lips.  
Of secure wine, spirit  
of the mosaics,  
wiped goddess blood, your kisses  
attract into exile  
and a droplet of saphire, with remnants of the university.  
A study returns,  
smothers - it does not return.  
  
On what wet-winged coffins grew with mud?  
Here I am, a delicious breath chained in the night of tiger.  
One of them is self-assured,  
the other knows projections.  
Where is someone  
he cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?
