Every Bride Is A Synonym
------------------------
I live as if in a callous felicity.  
My heart moves from being lethargic to being homogeneous.  
Enchanting  
empire. The tetrahedron functions to transform an architecture  
to its architecture.  
Behind the rusted guitar, many sticky coffins.  
The cordial child  
flies in the deedy morning.  
Against the absurd thicket of torrential bridge.  
The ceramic architecture knows this,  
that life in it's cork boxes is as endless as the serenity.  
I'm the uncle to the time of immediate window.  
The I in kis shall we move on?  
Has the city been breathed with funny things?
