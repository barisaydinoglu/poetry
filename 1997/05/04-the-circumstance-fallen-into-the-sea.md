The Circumstance Fallen Into The Sea
------------------------------------
And  
a parched angel's lava will light you.  
Amid the green lip of the water.  
From tornado to blade of grass,  
hidden candles drawn by warm channels, a  
tear stained fragrance of strawberry begins to awaken.  
In my boulevard at day you are like a mirror  
and your form and colour the way I divulge them.
