Feeling As Invasions
--------------------
Pockets of iron converted into glass.  
A current of full rose  
that does not know why it flows and recovers.  
On what calculating oxides connected with fire?  
Not weaving is a form of relinquishing.  
You've asked me what the lobster is mingling there with his sunburst orange lip?  
I reply, the ship knows this.  
And you bristled in the sorrow and relaxed a wetting blood.  
There ought to be a river bank of a hopeful window rejoicing in a land.  
Everything shady with naked voices, the salt of the mirror  
and piles of hidden bread among night.  
Multitude of beds!  
In and  
out of the opaque burnt umber the yellow and the transparent  
  
The reasons for my respect  
are stored in my ears of ivory.
