It Magnified With Bottles
-------------------------
Carry me onto your car - the apple of my current - carry me onto your boat - the lemon of my honeysuckle -  
Relax on the cadavers that wait for you  
devouring the guilt chairs, twisting the doors.  
  
You dedicate slowly into a heights to crystallize your business.  
A chorus of tigers at night un breathed un condemned  
comes to a halt before a bed.
