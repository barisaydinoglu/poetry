The Secrets Of The Sea
----------------------
Behind the silvery leg of the ice.  
There ought to be  
a map of a great starlight promising in a vicinity.  
And stones and mosaics.  
Full stop.  
The fire cosmic pamphlets are passed.  
In your leg of fear the area of necklaces play.  
For a day, maybe twenty-seven,  
I rested under a ray of sunlight  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the one to be next to.  
And inside my hammock, during the night, I woke up naked  
and full of tiredness. Not the sand-colored moment  
when the late afternoon pulses the wine bottles.  
The changeless elder  
flows in the charitable morning.  
As if to abduct or kiss or penetrate.  
The esoteric river banks gnawn in the smallest ivory stalks of cattail she is in us at this moment of first flowing.  
The dove knows this,  
that life in it's glass boxes is as endless as the railroad track.  
A lion hearted wind of springtimes.  
But I should be untrue to computer science, dying among its arrogant stones  
so let us seek to divulge a story devoid of individual redundancies.
