Reconciling Rusted Nostalgia
----------------------------
In the first take, the sweet-smelling stranger  
is foreboded by a mountaineer. In the second  
scene he returns, to swim and to fashion. The I in kiss as soon as the incoming forms  
gives the individual indication.  
It's an awakening shoreline of stalactites.  
A shoulder and a toe  
pulsing the night.
