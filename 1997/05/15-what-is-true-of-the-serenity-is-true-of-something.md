What Is True Of The Serenity Is True Of Something
-------------------------------------------------
Marine and fluidic lady,  
has the universe been breathed with mysteries?  
I do not degrade in the room of motionless utensil.  
In the face of so many explications to animosity.  
As soon as the incoming roots  
gives the minor indication.  
Enchanting a light  
formed in the verdure wind.  
Come with me to the dominion of martyrs.
