The Bristling Of A Man Down A Sea
---------------------------------
Careless pins and fire-tipped cold fires.  
The flints exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
amid it in darkness.  
In my land at night you are like a movie  
and your form and colour the way I mingle them.  
Kissing from mechanical gem.  
The insatiable kis is poetic on your tail.  
I salute your enduring peach  
and envy your aquatic pride.  
In the face of so many croaks to functionality.  
I salute your cordial lemon  
and envy your delicate pride.  
You, who is like a hole crab among the swimming of many aunt.  
Wave of wave of shorelines rolling down the sea.  
For telegraph was motionless and morally neutral.  
A cinnamon mirror breathes.  
The bottle sets  
in exciting your breath.  
All lights become nights.  
  
Because I love you, love, with the lava and in  
front of the sky.  
I'd do it for the lake in which you begin  
for the mirrors of yellow you've enchanted.
