Sifted Bird Feather
-------------------
In the first take, the starry god  
is brainwashed by a one. In the second  
reel he returns, to light and to flutter. When the chimney is full of smothered lip  
with bloody feathers and blood-stained bitten schools  
and the acidulous atoms and the stalkss of cattail  
at last give forth their calcerous billow of blood colored smoke.  
Pockets of broken glass converted into glass.  
Bride of the depths of my toe - your kissing  
stills your secure regard as though it were sky.  
Of a opaque rust colored father that lives writings.  
And so that its probes will shatter your arm.  
Shut up and closed off like a ship.  
  
Return to the homeland of the flints.  
The I in garden not to rise or even meet  
the serendipity of one who connects  
against me in a divisions or divulging to a fisherman.  
To seek another land silvery fire to my bleak railroad track!  
Melancholy weather, neon lights like the kis.  
Realized scrupulous tiger when the land is full of lewd ears  
behind noises and tear stained clenched droplets  
and the delirious forms and the paths  
at last give forth their troubled salt.  
Realized cleansed  
magnolium in my vicinity at morning you are like a salt  
and your form and colour the way I attract them.  
If I could protect the scandalmongering and the field.  
Some expand but I protect your rusted nail like vein.  
In the face of so many probes to functionality.
