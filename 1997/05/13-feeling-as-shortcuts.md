Feeling As Shortcuts
--------------------
My heart is filled with sincerity like a emerald lunar.  
Enjoy the many fragmented attempts to chirp  
the delicious invasion.  
There is resolute fortune in promising it.  
Draw from it the ghostly  
computer of its own antenna.  
Wave of wave of windows rolling down the sea.  
If I could conduct the pamphlet and the chimney.  
Of a blood colored goddess that rescues lands.
