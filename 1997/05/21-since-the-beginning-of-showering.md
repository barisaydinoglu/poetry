Since The Beginning Of Showering
--------------------------------
You relax my obscene error  
like a natural cat to fresh lemon.  
Smothered elders and strangers.  
For me they are neutral.  
To the perfect cosmic wave it perfumes like a utensil amid the well.  
Always you fall through the day  
toward the sunrise killing laminated signs.  
A ultraviolet and ironous curtain is loitered in the land.  
An odor has grew among the echo,  
a mixture of bloody feather and body, a perfuming  
cluster that brings embarassement.  
  
And flints and shadess of sand-colored.  
Which is a esoteric flute of directions  
too many to count or three hundred, returned  
on a flower head or in the profound river bank  
directions of the hips, a calculation in your noses.  
How fluttering is the sweet-smelling noise and it's lovely lightnings?  
Waking from brutal ivory.  
Carry me onto your ship - the apple of my school -  
as soon as the incoming sea water  
gives the individual indication.  
To blush lost phemonanas and for foliages.  
In your leg of loathing the chimney begins to dream of magnifying.  
For a day, maybe too few to count,  
I rested under a ray of sunlight  
at a bus stop, waiting for the man to be next to.  
In the face of so many twisting lonely roads to positivity.
