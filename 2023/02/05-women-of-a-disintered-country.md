Women Of A Disintered Country
-----------------------------
From her hips and her hips chirp  
starry skies of the earth.  
It was a banal business of cubicle and clandenstines.  
Because I love you, love, among the wind and in front of the sky.  
The jungle inside hers  
a story we speak in passing,  
with notions of joy  
and a passion for photography and jouranlism
