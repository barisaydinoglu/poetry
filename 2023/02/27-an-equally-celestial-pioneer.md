An Equally Celestial Pioneer
----------------------------
The prize plan that has everyone absurd.  
I could promise abberation, explication,  
and salt  
from planetariums and trousers  
with a blood colored heart  
with errors in my foot.  
A wind of threads not the sand-colored moment  
when the lunchtime imbues the saxophones.  
The foliages exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
inside it in darkness.  
Here I am, a dashing hips ignored in the field of salt.
