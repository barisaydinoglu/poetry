I Have Gone Harassing
---------------------
Only peace, just the  
writing, nothing but  
it. Foliage.  
In the smallest silk affection not the transluscent transluscent sunburst orange moment  
when the afternoon pulses the waves.  
When the modern office is full of oily hips  
behind lances and muzzled exiled ships  
and the bitter pastures and the umbrellas  
at last give forth their listless bramble.  
Of musical bread, spirit  
of the foams,  
shattered child blood, your kisses  
swim into exile  
and a droplet of fused quartz, with remnants of the field.  
The ships exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
around it in darkness.  
I am harassed by school and flame, by abberation and snow.  
  
Within yellow water and burnt umber acrobats.
