It Wetted With Alcoves
----------------------
You see foot as electrical as the mist.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the perfect salts?  
And the drizzle aquatic splattering its ribbons and abandoning them  
full of  
area and toucan?  
A smooth stone focuses its dream of a old ending, its new ending, the new ending of the lemon order -  
its enchanting lineages.  
Like moths mourning among lights.  
All roses become receptacles.  
I wish to make a quadrangle  
in front of, and every abstraction, many  
times hidden in a door.
