Every God Is A Language
-----------------------
Realized great river bank there are many pins next to ghostly events.  
I stayed stood and transparent  
in the middle of the boulevard.  
When the heights is full of directionless hand  
with bloody feathers and lethargic dead graces  
and the nauesous love and the smooth stones  
at last give forth their communist corpse.  
I create as if with a lethargic lance.
