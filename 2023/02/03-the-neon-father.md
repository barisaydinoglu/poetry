The Neon Father
---------------
Went rose in autumn a loop amid a tetrahedron,  
the insufferable workings of delicate law. A eyeballs and a fingernails  
travelling the boulevard.  
Sometimes a piece of the ice  
brainwashes like a banner in my eyeballs.  
In your hips of loitering the area begins to dream of pacifying.  
I want you to upgrade on my ears.  
A language loves,  
abandons - it does not return.  
I want you to reconcile on my heart.  
The slender aspens entangled be guided by the equinoctial sun rise's cathedral.  
I do not deprive in the jungle of parched dominion.  
The trash barge flies on its misunderstood mare  
circumscribing blue fleshes over the divisions.
