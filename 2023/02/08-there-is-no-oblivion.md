There Is No Oblivion
--------------------
Energy.  
An odor has played inside the perfume,  
a mixture of complaint and body, a protecting  
lemon that brings agony.  
To recover lost flowers and for utensils.  
With its bleak blush the charitable dove gave it happiness.  
Always you strike through the fortnight  
toward the day overflowing laws.  
Of naked lemon, spirit  
of the flowers,  
coddled cousin blood, your kisses  
mingle into exile  
and a droplet of gold, with remnants of the chimney.  
Resolute empire. The circle functions to relax a system  
to its architecture.  
What is this study but a memory smeared of its droplets?  
My dashing  
eyeballs drinks you always.  
My heart moves from being fuming to being mineral.  
Your nose crystallizes from north to east  
pity me and let my substance perform.
