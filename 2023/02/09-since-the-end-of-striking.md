Since The End Of Striking
-------------------------
Here I am, a cosmic mouth faltered in the jungle of stars in the sky. The blazing bridge gave it pride.  
The sailor smiles at the stranger  
but the pioneer does not smile  
when he looks at the pheasant aunt  
and the dead ocean.  
Your evening star is a saxophone  
filled with mechanical stone.  
Outside the affection of the universe where you sleep,  
a dream imprisons into computers.  
A chorus of jaguars at day un excited un executed  
comes to a halt before a film.  
I'd do it for the stalks of cattail in which you swim  
for the ripples of sunburst orange you've  
heard.  
  
Acidulous weather, blood-stained lights like the nature.  
I could rejoice stalactite, conglomerate, and parallel funerals  
from springtimes and rituals  
with a opaque black wine bottle  
with polyps in my brow.  
  
You trust in the boulevard as in an ancient modern office.  
You see tail as enchanting as the wind.
