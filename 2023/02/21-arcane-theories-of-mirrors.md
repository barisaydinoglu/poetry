Arcane Theories Of Mirrors
--------------------------
Wave of wave of breakfasts rolling down the sea.  
Wave of wave of suns rolling down the sea.  
The reasons for my respect  
are set  
in my leg of silicon.  
A loaf of bread baked with cheerless respect and salt.  
You store in the thicket as in  
a soft region.  
It's a exciting railroad track of cubicles.  
Someone here is waiting for the next thread.  
Serendipity. You relinquished yourself for playing.  
My heart is filled with tiredness like a cork aroma.  
Because I love you, love, within the water and among the lava.  
A film -like beast  
there are no dominions but furious cycles of horse and sunburst orange  
drops of dashing wet-winged sand.
