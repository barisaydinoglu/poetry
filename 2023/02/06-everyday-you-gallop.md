Everyday You Gallop
-------------------
This shaken railroad track and waking perfume faints me  
with it's resolute autumns like fingernails and eyeballs  
and blood colored flints like arm and jars.  
Wave of wave of smooth stones rolling down the sea.  
The havoc imposes nessecity.  
And starss in the sky and awes.  
He is outside us at this moment of first creating.  
Not appreciating is a form of reflecting.  
Parenthetical empire. The tetrahedron functions to store a system  
to its environment.  
But I should be true to oceanography, passing among its disordered fleshes  
so let us try to divulge a story devoid of technical redundancies.  
Within transluscent crimson water and cashmire love.  
  
Pockets of aluminum converted into chalk.  
The chimney behind hers  
a tale we tell in passing,  
with notions of pride  
and a passion for computer science and oceanography
