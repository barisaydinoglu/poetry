Machine In The Minor Services

I was without doubt the mother turkey  
there in the disordered university.  
When it looked me with its wide salt eyes  
it had neither heart nor finger  
but ivory lunars on its sides.  
And the sun rise to its forest  
and among the momenta the eloquent one  
the aunt covered with smooth warmth of your body.  
A loaf of bread  
baked with bitter purity and salt. As if to die or upgrade  
or condemn.
