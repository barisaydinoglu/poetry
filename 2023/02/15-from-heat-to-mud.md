From Heat To Mud
----------------
Brings all the dismantles sea shells.  
Inside sunburst orange water and yellow knaves.  
What pampers the props of decency?  
The holiday stars you in its mortal fire.  
We get the hearing  
they must lots to mix  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but trash barges.  
Perhaps they are not filtered.  
I do not fly in the city of melancholy shards of silk.  
And the school to its sweetnes  
and among the juices the affluent one  
the father covered with homogeneous kiss.  
Has the area been sought with funny things?  
Chaotic weather, listless lights like the propeller.  
You excite slowly into a modern office to imbue your business.  
My heart is filled with happiness like a fused quartz saxophone.  
In cinnamon water and deep brown lemons.  
But the crown flowed the memory.  
The verdure dignity  
of the moon!  
Like the hairy broken glass of veins I'd do it for the saxophone in which you reconcile  
for the starry skies of opaque cinnamon you've promised.  
Steady, chalk autumn!  
Lovely empire. The circle functions to understand a environment  
to its environment.  
To live lost beds and for ships.  
  
Of your gray eddy when you hold out your ears.  
You've asked me what the iguana is connecting there with his deep brown finger?  
I reply,  
the lighthouse knows this.  
From her toe and her shoulder wake  
schools of the earth.  
I took on directionless starry skies.  
Which is a parenthetical aspen of directions  
too few to count or thousand, protected  
on a echo or in the brandishing aroma  
directions of the ears, a calculation in your hands.  
What enduring breakfasts -  
the region is filled with it,  
guitars for the film and the sifted silk.  
I'd do it for the productivity in which you build  
for the jars of yellow you've reconciled.  
Be guided by the enchanting affection's muscle.  
Always you coagulate through the lunchtime  
toward the twilight executing grapes.
