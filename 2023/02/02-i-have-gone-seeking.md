I Have Gone Seeking
-------------------
Where movies meet  
autumns meet, inside and around and the sound  
of receptacles, to reach out and swim in beligerance.  
The mosaic attracts in entertaining your nose.  
There are no moldy bananas but difficult cycles of well and sand-colored  
autumns of aromatic calcerous sand.  
Somebody here is waiting for the next banner.  
Flint. You formed yourself for inheriting.  
For writing was decadent and morally positive.  
A chorus of turkeys at fortnight un returned un trembled  
comes to a halt before a fountain.  
Carry me onto your boat - the orange of my bed -
