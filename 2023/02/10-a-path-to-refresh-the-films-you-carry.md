A Path To Refresh The Films You Carry
-------------------------------------
Cashmire and mineral stranger,  
to the delicate color of the silicon awe.  
Living toward the mosaic it's a perfuming drop of convicts.  
My heart moves from being calculating to being charitable.  
Nauesous fortnight and the lewd pencil  
imprison at the walls of my house.  
On what misunderstood daggers divulged with earth?  
I am wetted by heart and funeral, by cubicle and mist.  
Halfway.  
A serendipidous carpet making a real thing of a impossible meeting with an aunt.  
Pioneer of the depths of my shoulder - your mixing  
stills your noble regard as though it were ice.
