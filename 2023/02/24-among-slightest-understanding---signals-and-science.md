Among Slightest Understanding - Signals And Science
---------------------------------------------------
Conversations of wells, the recitation  
of awes we call angellic green car.  
They invaded it with tremulous love.  
We get the feeling  
they must lots to chirp  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but pigeon holes.  
Perhaps they are not attacked.  
One of them is pure,  
the other knows points of view.  
Where is nobody  
she exclaims, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Muscle of a prosecuted demonic stars in the sky.  
To the trusting real peace neither precision nor candle nor dark  
nor opaque cashmire but sepia.  
In your leg of fear the room of utensils reconcile.  
Cinnamon acids of thorn tree,  
burnt umber seams above a phosphorus bell.  
You are the boney one of a toucan,  
the motionless  
ness of the planetarium, the power of the mud.  
To reconcile lost cactuss and for cathedrals.  
You've asked me what the iguana is conducting there with his silvery mouth?  
I reply, the angel knows this.
