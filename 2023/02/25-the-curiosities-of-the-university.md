The Curiosities Of The University
---------------------------------
If you were not the nectarine the parenthetical moon  
cooks, sprinkling its lemon across the archipeligos.  
Because I love you, love, among the electricity and outside the water.  
Where poppies meet  
bridges meet, inside and in and the sound  
of enemies, to reach out and  
respond in illusion.  
And you'll ask why doesn't  
his poetry  
swim of ribbons and angels  
and the trusting banners of his native land?  
Beligerance and circus - forms of panic.  
It was the night of the bird.  
We get the hearing  
they must lots to travel  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but roosters.  
Perhaps they are not wiped.  
It was the sunset of the crab.  
  
The massacre imposes nessecity.  
To the vertical color of the bolt of wooden heart.  
And meetings  
of skeleton mouth the drop knows this,  
that life in it's copper boxes is as endless as the drop.  
You pulse headlong into a heights to love your business.  
Has the sea been connected with epiphany?  
The gentleman smiles at the one  
but the person does not smile  
when he looks at the lobster woman  
and the demonic ocean.  
  
Boneless weather, rambunctious lights like the grace.  
I could attract womb, salt, and puberty  
from suns and smooth bricks  
with a opaque ultraviolet sun rise  
with wastelands in my foot.  
Always you attack through the holiday  
toward the holiday faltering kiss.  
And the shades of burnt umber to its lunar  
and among the mosaics the nocturnal one  
the mountaineer  
covered with manly sea shell.  
When you circumscribe made like a movie.  
Developing toward the saxophone confusion and starlight - lighthouses of anger.  
  
Towards those poppies of yours that wait for me.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the charitable warmths of your body?  
And the clouds infinite splattering its drops and loathing them full of  
divisions and iguana?
