Outside Of Hat And Mirror
-------------------------
If I could perch the billows of red smoke and the boulevard.  
Towards those stars of yours that wait for me.  
I do not gnaw in the night of decadent bloody feather.  
I want you to discover on my brow.  
The twilight prizes you in its mortal wind.  
To the plumed cordial fountain an odor has continued under the stars in the sky,  
a mixture of enemy and body, a crystallizing  
guitar that brings confusion.  
Everything rambunctious with deedy voices, the salt of the moon  
and piles of humble bread next to sunrise.
