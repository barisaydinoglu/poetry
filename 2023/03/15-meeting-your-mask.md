Meeting Your Mask
-----------------
And so that  
its hearts will abduct your breath.  
A chorus of oysters at night un sought un imprisoned  
comes to a halt before an atom.  
You promise in the universe as in a irreducable heights.  
The complaint imposes nessecity.  
A brimstone and fragmented energy is mourned in the room.  
Outside the explosive wine bottle, many rusted salts.  
  
In my jungle at late afternoon you are like a cedar architecture  
and your form and colour the way I light them.  
There ought to be a praise of a infinite wine bottle chirping in a night.
