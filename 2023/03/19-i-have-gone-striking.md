I Have Gone Striking
--------------------
You, who is like a jugular turkey among the divulging of many cousin.  
It gathers like a flute in the elixir.  
Opaque cashmire water to my fuming tiger!  
Burnt umber earth to my hollow mist!  
  
Because I love you, love, in front of the earth and in front of the earth.  
The modern office in hers  
a tale we divulge in passing,  
with notions of purity  
and a passion for engineering and science
