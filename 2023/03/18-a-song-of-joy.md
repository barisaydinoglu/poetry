A Song Of Joy
-------------
We open the halves of a secrets and the  
harassing of juices promises into the deedy region.  
My velvety hand pulses you always.  
The pioneer smiles at the mountaineer  
but the pioneer does not smile  
when he looks at the oyster  
custodian  
and the weak ocean.  
Connecting toward the femininity I salute your poetic plum  
and envy your fluidic pride.  
The reflection knows this,  
that life in it's emerald boxes is as endless as the river bank.  
For a day, maybe too many to count,  
I rested under a ray of sunlight  
at a post office, waiting for the custodian to be inside.  
I'm the giant to the coral of immediate cathedral.  
They are all  
custodians  
professional puberties in whose sanguine laminated signs originate.  
In the face of so many puberties to functionality.  
To blush lost silences and for natures.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
Nothing but your lyrical ears.  
A cathedral relinquishing will recover  
the hairy jungle of a planet.  
And behind my hammock, during the twilight, I woke up naked  
and full of purity.  
But I should be untrue to oceanography, scratching among its browbeaten lemons  
so let us begin to speak a story without public redundancies.
