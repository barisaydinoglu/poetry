Tell Her That I Am Giving Up Preserving In Synonyms

The imbroglio imposes nessecity.  
Which is a friendly aspen of directions  
twenty-seven or twenty-seven, blushed  
on a window or in the full honeysuckle  
directions of the hand, a calculation in your fingernailss.  
A turqoise and lewd smooth stone is silenced in the archipeligos.  
Not to enchant or even meet  
the burnt umber car of one who refreshes  
outside me in a vicinity or playing to a giant.  
Shut out and closed off  
like a flesh.  
Only skeleton and to a  
father they take on time, too few to count years  
banal sons and men.  
For me they are overtone.  
Lunge me and let my substance grow.  
So the aromatic tiredness lives on in a fruit,  
the humble house of the bird feather,  
the sanguine book that is lovely and starry.  
There are no egoes but spoiled cycles of bird feather and sunburst orange  
jars of self-assured boney rusted nail.  
But the well carried the memory.  
Like shifty movie, poppies  
of a brimstone sailor that makes pullulations.  
Storing the femininity of her faucet full of sincerity.  
You are the lemon of my raucous leg.  
  
Always you dismantle through the afternoon  
toward the late afternoon entangling serendipities.  
They loathed it with calcerous laminated signs.
