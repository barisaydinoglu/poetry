Men Must Always Prove Their Pencils
-----------------------------------
Indicates the lemon's reflecting eyeballs.  
Not the blue moment  
when the midnight relaxes the corals.  
  
Promise on the bones that wait for you  
abducting the silent chairs, petrifying the doors.  
You see brow as noble as the rain.  
They are all mountaineers  
professional lineages in whose infinite laminated signs originate.  
For sea's skin was worn-out and morally positive.  
The reasons for my respect  
are kissed in my curves of glass.  
You are the fruit of my misunderstood mouth.  
And so that its granules will reject your eye.  
You are the wounded gentleman of a lobster,  
the rustling ness of the coat, the power of the lava.  
Of your rust colored crimson car when you hold out your breath.  
Always you change through the afternoon  
toward the twilight decaying mists.  
You pulse headlong into a thicket to awaken your business.  
  
I am ignored by foliage and billows of red smoke, by depth and snow.  
The ritual plan that has everyone rambunctious.  
A arrogant grace day  
to the lovely color of the gem coral.  
The I in stalks of cattail to the musical color of the crystal dove.  
What eloquent quilts -  
the archipeligos is filled with it,  
roses for the cluster and the negligent ceramic.  
Against the worn-out vicinity of ghostly well.  
A eyeballs and a breath  
pacifying the jungle.  
Of a red fisherman that mixes homes.  
Shades of opaque cinnamon.
