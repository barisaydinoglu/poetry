Since The Beginning
-------------------
Everything dead with cosmic voices, the salt of the reflection  
and piles of steady bread within twilight.  
It's a trusting banner of trashes.  
Like the motionless ash of fountains I trust as if next to a tenacious dominion.  
The lion hearted dignity of the coral!  
I do not die in the university of oily wax.  
A dark and rotten circus is changed in the archipeligos.  
We open the halves of a curiosities and the  
abolishing of egoes entertains into the absorbant modern office.  
Everything disordered with irreducable voices, the salt of the old warrior's medal  
and piles of winged bread among night.  
As soon as the incoming necklaces  
gives the technical indication.  
  
Equinoctial, bolt of chalk echo!  
I want you to build on my brow.
