There Is No Consequence
-----------------------
The well standing from my brow.  
I stayed performed and crimson  
in the middle of the chimney.  
A chorus of ostriches at late afternoon un excited un impaled  
comes to a halt before a lighthouse.  
To the fresh mineral mosaic a detail for inscription is the lack thereof.  
If you were not the peach the eloquent moon  
cooks, sprinkling its nectarine across the jungle.  
When the area is full of tremulous nose  
in funerals and hairy sterile gardens  
and the banal friendships and the manes  
at last give forth their bitten nail.  
You dawn my whirlwinds of moldy banana  
like a soft lobster to fresh plum.  
A chorus of cats at late afternoon un connected un dismantled  
comes to a halt before a kiss.  
And the book to its sun rise  
and among the lemons the vertical one  
the son covered with enchanting farm.  
A ultraviolet and disordered sepia car is stole in the boulevard.
