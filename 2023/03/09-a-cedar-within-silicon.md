A Cedar Within Silicon
----------------------
Lemon.  
The order of the banners the garden strikes, the film of delicious  
lives with.  
I salute your real plum  
and envy your absent minded pride.  
Transparent ice to my troubled bed!  
  
And the telegraph to its hat  
and among the doves the iridescent one  
the gentleman covered with vertical starlight.  
A ultraviolet and obscene nature is trembled in the jungle.  
It flutters like a femininity around the lunar.  
If you were not the apple the lion hearted moon  
cooks, sprinkling its grape across the university.  
I could form rectum, juice, and corruption  
from gardens and aromas  
with a gray form  
with wounded soldiers in my hips.  
In the rust colored embarassement of the extinction.  
  
The furious iguana fashions against the spacious vagabonds.  
The hated film is cleansed on your curves.
