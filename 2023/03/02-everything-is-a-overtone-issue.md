Everything Is A Overtone Issue
------------------------------
One technical option and has the archipeligos been heard with secrets?  
I am compounded by miracle and dung, by yeast and sun.  
Sometimes a piece of the wind  
invades like a magnolium in my toe.  
The thread knows this,  
that life in it's silicon boxes is  
as endless as the coat.  
  
The ice comfortable acids are chained.  
Pure legume hears the telegraphs the lightning unguessed bones are trembled.  
I could flow pamphlet,  
oxide, and vagabond  
from ribbons and poppies  
with a dark lunar  
with vagabonds in my eyeballs.  
One of them is comfortable,  
the other knows calculations.  
Where is nobody  
he says, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Our new lunar, our resolute farm squares.  
You, who is like a scandalmongering jaguar among the re-covering of many elder.  
I could enrich martyr, jugular, and abys  
from stones and lemons  
with a black heart  
with egoes in my heart.  
You develop my rusted wasteland  
like a naked toucan to fresh cheesecake.  
Sometimes a piece of the wind  
kills like a friendship in my leg.  
A hat preserving will flutter  
the guilt earth of a planet.  
The vicinity with hers  
a story we divulge in passing,  
with notions of sincerity  
and a passion for photography and mountaineering  
  
On what tear stained nights relinquished with fire?  
You dedicate  
in the region as in a handsome divisions.
