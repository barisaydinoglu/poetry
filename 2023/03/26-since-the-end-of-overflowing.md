Since The End Of Overflowing
----------------------------
Within the kis of the moonlight evening where you sleep,  
a dream falls into metaphors.  
I stayed reconciled and silvery  
outside the room.  
Which is a warm old warrior's medal of directions  
million or three hundred, created  
on a quilt or in the fluidic magnolium  
directions of the eyeballs, a calculation in your feet.  
  
For dew was boneless and morally positive.  
It was a delirious business of lonely road and shortcuts.  
Like holes mutating with aspens.  
Once there was a demonic mountaineer who  
pacified at parties, sitting in a square, among femininities.  
In the first scene, the delicate daughter  
is harassed by a stranger. In the second  
scene he returns, to connect and to respond.  
A perfect sun of elixirs.  
What friendly foliages -  
the divisions is filled with it,  
autumns for the phemonana and the insufferable paper-mache.  
I upgrade as if amid a ironous bramble.  
  
Smother me and let my substance dedicate.  
Conversations of wreaths, the recitation  
of jars we call deedy  
film.  
For land was chaotic and morally neutral.  
Harsh puberties and furious daggers.  
The I in propeller a calcerous identity abandons  
even the iridescent  
overtone archipeligos in technique  
to which the metaphor  
will not be relinquished.  
You build slowly into a region to discover your business.  
Shall we move on?  
We open the halves of a epiphany and the  
ignoring of ashes chirps into the homogeneous chimney.  
Dove was no longer below the recording threshold.  
What rejects the props of respect?  
Joy is gone, the subject has set.  
A directionless time day  
I saw how opaque deep brown cars are appreciated  
by the loving precision.  
And a dilute lemon's jungle will respond you.  
  
You shower my phosphorus trash barge  
like a serendipidous iguana to fresh nectarine.  
From her heart and her eye hear  
fragrances of strawberry of the earth.  
  
My heart  
moves from being torrential to being unguessed.  
A fractious bed day  
nauesous weather, dry lights like the river.  
A hips and a leg  
flying the chimney.  
A rain of honeysuckles in your arm of burying the land begins to dream of awakening.
