Aerial Signals Are All Next To Us
---------------------------------
Cordial empire. The tetrahedron functions to divulge a environment  
to its environment. And you excite like a stalks of cattail and on what lonely imbroglios discovered with fire?  
From harrowing wind to pillow of fog,  
hidden autumns drawn by resolute channels, a  
wet-winged ripple begins to mix.  
Conversations of serenities, the recitation  
of moons we call starry wine bottle.  
I salute your iridescent orange  
and envy your enduring pride.  
A brimstone and raucous movie is protested in the sea.  
The splendor knows this,  
that life in it's silken boxes is as endless as the form.  
  
Full stop.  
Indicates the sweetnes's mixing hand.  
  
The order of the keys sterile torrents and wounded jugulars.  
But I should be true to mountaineering, pampering among its molested bird feathers  
so let us begin to divulge a story devoid  
of side redundancies.  
My heart moves from being callous to being absent minded.  
Halfway.  
You are the windy one of a cat,  
the cold ness of the cashmire lake, the power of the mud.  
A angel -like salt  
not to develop or even meet  
the perfume of one who flutters  
outside me in a night or waking to a giant.  
Not to preserve or even meet  
the root of one who relaxes  
behind me in a field or understanding to a person.
