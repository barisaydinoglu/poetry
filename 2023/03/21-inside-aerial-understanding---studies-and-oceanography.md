Inside Aerial Understanding - Studies And Oceanography
------------------------------------------------------
Pockets of steel converted into silicon.  
Has the heights been developed with epiphany?  
The star chirps in expanding your leg.  
For a day, maybe too few to count,  
I rested under a pillow of fog  
at a post office, waiting for the mountaineer to be amid.  
I wish to make a circle  
with, and every color, many  
times hidden in a sea's skin.  
There are many billowss of red smoke inside lewd events.  
Love is gone, the subject has breathed.
