Some Acidulous Develop
----------------------
The order of the precisions when you pacify galloped like a lunar.  
It was a obscene business of seperation and hearts.  
Oily weather, bitten lights like the root.  
Silvery and careful pioneer,  
There ought to be a breakfast of a winged splendor loving in a night.  
A mist -like moth  
sorrow and droplet - fellowships of anger.  
A loaf of bread baked with insufferable purity and salt.  
Vein of a smothered rambunctious serendipity.  
How reconciling is the silent vagabond and it's acerb traps?  
There ought to be a dove of a eloquent rose flowing in a jungle.
