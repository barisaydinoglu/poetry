Hearing Is An Episode Of Massacre
---------------------------------
Because I love you, love, behind the clay and within the mud.  
If you were not the sugar the electrical moon  
cooks, sprinkling  
its peach across the thicket.  
One of them is winged,  
the other knows points  
of view.  
Where is nobody  
he exclaims, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
This hushed flower head and setting dew coagulates me  
with it's romantic eddies like eyeballs and brain  
and rust colored quivers like eyeballs and reflections.  
Everything hollow with clear voices, the salt of the fellowship  
and piles of loving bread with late afternoon.  
Only stone,  
just the  
movie, nothing but  
it. Root.  
I'm the giant to the femininity of immediate grace.  
And meetings of fragmented fingernails wetting the shades of marine of her candle full of respect.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
enchant of perfumes and fellowships  
and the clear corals of his native land?  
Be guided by the affluent sun rise's old warrior's medal.  
The acrobat knows this,  
that life in it's cedar boxes is as endless as the writing.  
You relax my explosive beast  
like a thick turkey to fresh nectarine.  
In your shoulder of agony the region of jars form.  
To seek another land in the first reel, the humble sailor  
is imprisoned by a elder. In the second  
take he returns, to live and to gallop.  
In the smallest copper mist the complaint imposes nessecity.  
  
The blood-stained quiver  
that kisses in your kis.  
From her mouth and her nose perform  
praises of the earth.  
They filtered  
it with rabid sea's skins.  
Dedicating from exiled copper.
