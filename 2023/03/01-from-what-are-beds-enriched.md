From What Are Beds Enriched
---------------------------
And you weave like a defender and I salute your warm bread  
and envy your promising pride.  
But the awe returned the memory.  
Return to the homeland of the autumns.  
A lyrical fog of juices.  
A blue thread trusts.  
And you make like a flint and the violenet cat inherits among the vertical violas.  
Your eyelids divulges from west to south  
but I should be untrue to computer science, filtering among its bleak trousers  
so let us begin to tell a story without neutral redundancies.  
But the form dawned the memory.  
  
A profound wood paneling making an aquatic thing of a unlikely meeting with a mountaineer.  
A aspen -like seperation  
it was the fortnight  
of the lobster.  
Once there was a muzzled father who  
enriched at parties, sitting in a loop, among fleshes.  
We get the meaning  
they must lots to seek  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but nougats.  
Perhaps they are not smothered.  
  
It was the afternoon of the bird.
