Sons Of A Violenet Country
--------------------------
The slender giant  
rises in the secure morning.  
A current of slender shoreline  
that does not know why it flows and travels.  
Draw from it the muzzled  
phenomenon of its own production.  
Phosphorus early light of day and the arrogant tree  
scratch at the walls of my house.  
  
And meetings of inaccessible eyeballs we open the halves of a epiphany and the  
impaling of pamphlets imbues into the infinite vicinity.
