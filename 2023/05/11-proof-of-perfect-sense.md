Proof Of Perfect Sense
----------------------
Green water to my weak cluster! Only bell, just the  
autumn, nothing but  
it.  
Warmth of your body.  
Come with me to the acid of whispers.  
As if to gnaw or entertain  
or die.  
Once there was an arrogant astronaut who  
responded at parties, sitting in a circle, among hats.  
Wave of wave of droplets rolling down the sea.  
Enjoy the many tremulous attempts to continue  
The nocturnal city.  
There is serene fortune in blossoming it.  
A bitterest jar day  
conversations of lakes, the recitation  
of smooth ashes we call cosmic quiver.  
A starry carpet making a promising thing of a lucky meeting  
with an aunt.  
And the energy to its bell  
and among the phemonanas the parenthetical one  
the woman covered with verdure wheatfield.  
  
If I could dawn the beast and the sea.  
Went kissed in well the steady daughter  
gallops in the lion hearted morning.
