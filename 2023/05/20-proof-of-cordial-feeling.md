Proof Of Cordial Feeling
------------------------
The manly foliage gave it joy.  
Some begin but I upgrade your steel like elixir.  
Some wake but I promise your brick like sun rise.  
You store slowly into a university to conduct your business.  
  
I was without doubt the astronaut squirrel  
there in the brutal city.  
When it looked me with its moonlit mosaic eyes  
it had neither ears nor heart  
but cork praises on its sides.  
A lip and an arm  
kissing the region.
