I Have Gone Lighting
--------------------
Full stop.  
If you were not the peach the scrupulous moon  
cooks, sprinkling its nectarine across the jungle.  
Because I love you, love, outside the lava and behind the fire. To develop  
lost kisses and for roots.  
And a bleak stars in the sky's clay will shine you.  
A star -like twisting lonely road  
some blush but I fashion your salt like wave.  
In the first reel, the infinite goddess  
is prosecuted by a mother. In the second  
reel he returns, to dedicate and to blush.  
Of cordial wine, spirit  
of the pencils,  
deformed mother blood, your kisses  
blush into exile  
And a droplet of silicon, with remnants of the boulevard.  
In my heights at day you are like a coat  
and your form and colour the way I expand them.  
Of your brimstone banner when you hold out your eyelids.
