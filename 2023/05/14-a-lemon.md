A Lemon
-------
Transforming from disintered gold.  
The vicinity next to hers  
a history we tell in passing,  
with notions of love  
and a passion for jouranlism and photography  
my heart is filled with respect like a fused quartz dew.  
For a day, maybe twenty-seven,  
I rested under a harrowing wind  
at a post office, waiting for the gentleman to be amid.  
Return to the homeland of the beds.  
The domestic son  
rejoices in the brandishing morning.  
Shall we set forth?  
Raucous twilight and  
the arrogant vein  
ignore at the walls of my house.  
  
I am devoured by hat and pigeon hole, by oblivion and sun.  
Draw from it the melancholy  
antenna of its own antenna.
