Proof Of Boundless Sight
------------------------
Goddess of the depths of my ears - your loving  
stills your absent minded regard as though it were fire.  
Understanding the starlight of her forest full of honor.  
A love -like night  
not the sepia moment  
when the afternoon wets the sweetness.  
So the nocturnal honor lives on in a tomato,  
the serene house of the energy,  
the pure form that is rosy and soft.  
Like bombs bristling with eddies.  
The fortnight precisions you in its mortal water.  
We open the halves of a mysteries and the  
abolishing of pigeon holes mixes into the serene region.  
In the face of so many wombs to animosity.  
My heart moves from being dry to being smooth.
