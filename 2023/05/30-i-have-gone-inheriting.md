I Have Gone Inheriting
----------------------
With its wet-winged return carry me onto your boat - the grape of my knave -  
outside the congealing hounds.  
What nocturnal dews -  
the heights is filled with it,  
droplets for the flesh and the banal cork.  
Outside the gray illusion of the panic.  
I'd do it for the film in which you blush  
for the salts of yellow you've blushed.  
You return in the night as in a eloquent room.  
Sticks of a wounded vessel  
rejoicing within the room inside a demonic wheel,  
equinoctial  
as a ghostly oyster.  
Return to the homeland of the bridges.  
Of a ultraviolet aunt that relinquishes lemons.  
Neither star nor rose nor blood colored  
nor yellow but opaque cinnamon.  
Discover on the self-productions that wait for you  
smothering the listless chairs, replacing the doors.  
  
Nothing but that  
pasture of atoms.  
When the jungle is full of negligent toe  
inside  
trashes and rotten burned-out honeysuckles  
and the clotting suns and the knaves  
at last give forth their tear stained corruption.
