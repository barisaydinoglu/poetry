Your Leg Is Enough
------------------
Wave of wave of gardens rolling down the sea. You upgrade in the room as in a solute field.  
I stayed expanded and green  
against the modern office.  
A utensil -like parallel conspirators  
it was a cheerless business of pin and bloods.  
I  
stayed stood and yellow  
in the region.  
A chorus of toucans at day un responded un invaded  
comes to a halt before a praise.
