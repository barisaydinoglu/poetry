Study In The Minor Services
---------------------------
And moons and promises.  
A sensual thunder of writings.  
Not to relinquish or even meet  
the ritual of one who recovers  
behind me in a chimney or standing to a mother.  
Behind the sordid aroma, many senile billows of brimstone smoke.  
Which is a brandishing stars in the sky of directions  
three hundred or too few to count, protected  
on a sphere or in the real sweetnes  
directions of the arm, a calculation in your fingers.  
But I should be untrue to jouranlism, deceiving among its clenched kiss  
so let us begin to tell a story devoid of neutral redundancies.  
Shut up and shut out like a starry sky.  
Once there was a insufferable giant who  
understood at parties, sitting in a triangle, among warmths.  
The starry sky knows this,  
that life in it's wooden boxes is as endless as the femininity.  
My heart moves from being misunderstood to being sensible.  
An odor has drank behind the lemon,  
a mixture of blood and body, a enriching  
banner that brings panic.  
A thunder of shadess of yellow from ray of sunlight to ray of sunlight,  
hidden springtimes drawn by enchanting channels, a  
disintered flesh begins to dawn.  
I am struck by saxophone and parallel legless horses, by blood and fog.  
I want you to appreciate on my eye.  
You blossom my barbaous vinegar  
like a cosmic bird to fresh bread.
