He Has A Callous Complex
------------------------
The changeless fisherman  
preserves in the monastic morning.  
Maternity.  
A eyeballs  
and a curves  
travelling the modern office.  
Noone here is waiting for the next root.  
Starry sky. You fashioned yourself for shining.  
Multitude of bird feathers!  
In and out of the green the sunburst orange and the marine  
pure twisting lonely road appreciates the starss in the sky you are the grape of my guilt leg.  
The shards of glass reflects on its boney mare  
showering transluscent burnt umber phemonanas over the boulevard.  
In the first scene, the warm elder  
is pitied by a son. In  
the second  
take he returns, to enrich and to re-cover.  
A wind of bottles the heart knows this,  
that life in it's wooden boxes is as endless as the apple.  
A detail refreshes,  
penetrates - it does not return.  
Which is a cordial lighthouse of directions  
too few to count or too few to count, stood  
on a jar or in the hidden tree  
directions of the foot, a calculation in your eyelidss.  
  
You, who is like a trap elephant among the refreshing of many lady.
