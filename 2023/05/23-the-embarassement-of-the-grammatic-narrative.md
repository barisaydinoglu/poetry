The Embarassement Of The Grammatic Narrative
--------------------------------------------
Come with me to the flame of shardss of fused quartz.  
I salute your sanguine lemon  
and envy your smooth pride.  
With the mist of the boulevard where you sleep,  
a dream changes into antennae.  
I could crystallize noise, violence, and explication  
from elixirs and kisses  
with a dull shades of transparent propeller  
with cadavers in my curves.  
I was without doubt the gentleman jaguar  
there in the motionless divisions.  
When it looked me with its real coat eyes  
it had neither finger nor eye  
but bolt of ivory fused quartz architectures on its sides.  
Like the rigid steel of prizes wave of wave of miracles rolling down the sea.  
  
Nothing but your celestial finger.  
In the smallest gold flower head not to divulge or even meet  
the elixir of one who stores  
in the middle of me in a university or galloping to a child.
