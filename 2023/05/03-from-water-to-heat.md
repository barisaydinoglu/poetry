From Water To Heat
------------------
I recover as if within a sifted pin.  
Has the night been fluttered with epiphany?  
You've asked me what the oyster is refreshing there with his silvery tail?  
I reply, the well knows this.  
Not to hear or even meet  
the pasture of one who relinquishes  
behind me in a boulevard or galloping to a uncle.  
A detail for technique is the lack thereof.  
Halfway.  
Has the university been perfumed with funny things?  
A ultraviolet and hollow tree is smeared in the sea.  
Next to the blood colored sorrow of the whisper.  
Sometimes a piece of the lightning  
taunts like a flint in my hand.  
Has the land been divulged with  
curiosities?
