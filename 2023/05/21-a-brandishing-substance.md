A Brandishing Substance
-----------------------
Once there was a wayside sailor who  
refreshed at parties, sitting in a tetrahedron, among fountains.  
The magnolium electrifies, the bird feather of equinoctial  
fashions outside.  
The modern office in hers  
a tale we divulge in passing,  
with notions of happiness  
and a passion for mountaineering and oceanography  
and among my hammock, during the midnight, I woke up naked  
and full of sincerity.  
For a day, maybe twenty-seven,  
I rested under a pillow of fog  
at a post office, waiting for the child to be behind.  
I wish to make a loop  
among, and every faith, many  
times hidden in a lake.  
And meetings of calculating curves conversations of love, the recitation  
of aspens we call essential stone.
