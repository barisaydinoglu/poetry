Faith Is An Episode Of Receptacle
---------------------------------
I return as if outside a forceful vortex.  
So the slender joy lives on in a fruit,  
the perfect house of the pullulation,  
the enchanting apple that is friendly and friendly.  
Apple of a smothered bitterest sea water.  
Once there was an absurd lady who  
perfumed at parties, sitting in a square, among mists.  
Because I love you, love, behind the lava and in front of the lava.  
Everything shifty with free voices, the salt of the stars in the sky  
and piles of spacious bread around morning.  
Nothing but your changeless fingernails.  
And pullulations and schools.  
The incredulous pioneer  
recovers in the honest morning.
