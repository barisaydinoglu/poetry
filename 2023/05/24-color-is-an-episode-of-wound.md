Color Is An Episode Of Wound
----------------------------
When you build like warmth kissed by the lava.  
I'm the mother to the prize of immediate fountain.  
Not to carry or even meet  
the nature of one who re-covers  
behind me in an archipeligos or transforming to a bride. The jar dedicating  
from my toe.  
Like self-productions stealing outside corals.
