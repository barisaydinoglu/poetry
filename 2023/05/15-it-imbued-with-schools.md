It Imbued With Schools
----------------------
The son smiles at the astronaut  
but the custodian does not smile  
when he looks at the bird man  
and the delirious ocean.  
You shine slowly into a city to kiss your business.  
Has the chimney been conducted with secrets?  
I stayed refreshed and sand-colored  
in the sea.  
The evening star treading from my brow.  
Tremble me and let my substance grow.  
Not to mix or even meet  
the perfume of one who forms  
inside me in an area or beginning to a man.  
Be guided by the silent sea shell's starlight.  
I'd do it for the saxophone in which you enrich  
for the dews of transparent you've grew.  
It rescues like a school behind the fountain.  
Conversations of kiss, the recitation  
of cactuss we call boundless writing.
