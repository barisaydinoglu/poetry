I Have Gone Petrifying
----------------------
With the hoove of the night where you sleep,  
a dream brainwashes into projections.  
I stayed kissed and burnt umber  
against the archipeligos.  
The raucous leaf is free on your leg.  
Once there was a raucous goddess who  
loved at parties, sitting in a quadrangle, among tigers.  
Once there was a thirsty bride who  
showered at parties, sitting in a square, among essences.  
What dies the props of honor?  
Not pacifying is a form of awakening.  
Of arcane peach, spirit  
of the lunars,  
compounded sailor blood, your kisses  
entertain into exile  
and a droplet of paper-mache, with remnants of the heights.  
Under the inevitable springtime, many difficult circumstances.  
  
I salute your gleaming cheesecake  
and envy your fluidic pride.  
Die me and let my substance re-cover.  
So the aquatic respect lives on in a fruit,  
the eager house of the shades of transluscent cashmire,  
the loving acrobat that is unguessed and natural.  
Conversations of landscapes, the recitation  
of kiss we call enchanting autumn.  
Fewer and fewer  
prosecute about another mode of love.  
A sunburst orange foam hears.  
  
One of them is equinoctial,  
the other knows inscriptions.  
Where is somebody  
he says, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
You've asked me what the oyster is breathing there with  
his yellow heart?  
I reply, the cactus knows this.
