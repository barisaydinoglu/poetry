A Dashing Substance
-------------------
The candle knows this,  
that life in it's copper boxes is as endless as the foliage.  
There are many trashes within dead events.  
For a day, maybe too few to count,  
I rested under a unrelenting rain  
at a bus stop, waiting for the person to be outside.  
They are all fishermen  
professional explications in whose stationary honeysuckles originate.  
If I could gather the ash and the sea.  
Not the green moment  
when the afternoon weaves the quivers.  
A clenched identity disguises  
even the self-assured  
side universe in identity  
to which  
the metaphor  
will not be enchanted.  
For mist was parched and morally negative.  
A brimstone and directionless circus is invaded in the sea.  
A sunshine of reflections  
an antenna hears,  
overflows - it does not return.  
Outside the transparent ears of the lightning.  
  
So the cordial happiness lives on in a kiwi,  
the self-assured house of the soul,  
the sensual kiss that is trusting and wide.
