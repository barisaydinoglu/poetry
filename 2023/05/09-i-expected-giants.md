I Expected Giants
-----------------
In front of the shaking receptacles.  
Always you smother through the day  
toward the afternoon abhorring telegraphs.  
There are no clocks but rotten cycles of branch and transparent  
peaces of velvety exiled sand.  
Behind the sepia lip of the heat.  
The order of the cactuss outside cinnamon water and transluscent cashmire writings.  
Everything rustling with vertical voices, the salt of the jar  
and piles of decisive bread inside holiday.  
The guitar blushing from my tail.
