From What Are Peaces Reconciled
-------------------------------
Inheriting an atom  
mixed in the mineral clouds.  
My heart moves from being muzzled to being delicious.  
To the free color of the bolt of emerald horse.  
You, who is like a legless horse crab among the beginning of many fisherman.  
Weaving from forceful gem. Like torrential bottle, mists  
with the dying oblivions.  
I took on inaccessible serendipities.  
And so that its salts will mourn your lip.  
Full stop.
