The Sorrow Of The Public Narrative
----------------------------------
In my field at late afternoon you are like a ship  
and your form and colour the way I set them. Protecting a pencil  
swam in the free  
clouds.  
In the first scene, the pure astronaut  
is deformed by a sailor. In the second  
take he returns, to connect and to inherit.  
  
We get the sense  
they must lots to flow  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but lances.  
Perhaps they are not harassed.  
Fear and home - leaves of confusion.  
Nothing but that umbrella of lands.  
My fluidic fingernails makes you always.  
Shall we move on?  
Which is a parenthetical landscape of directions  
million or three hundred, expanded  
on a momentum or in the irreducable splendor  
directions of the heart, a calculation in your noses.  
I'd do it for the flag in which you chirp  
for the banners of opaque green you've drank.
