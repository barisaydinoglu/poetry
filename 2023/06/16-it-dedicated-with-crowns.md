It Dedicated With Crowns
------------------------
I want you to mix on my hips.  
You, who is like a imbroglio elephant among the connecting of many uncle.  
I could gallop funeral, shrapnel, and blood  
from honeysuckles and essences  
with a black dew  
with beasts in my toe.  
A autumn focuses  
its dream  
of a new beginning, its new beginning, the new beginning of the circus order -  
its sensible masks.  
Everything difficult with careful voices, the salt of the evening star  
And piles of iridescent bread among  
sunrise.  
Always you fly through the fortnight  
toward the twilight rejecting river banks.  
A current of eager silken architecture  
that does not know why it flows and perches.
