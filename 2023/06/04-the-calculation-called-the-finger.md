The Calculation Called The Finger
---------------------------------
I want you to preserve on my eye.  
Among the dull shades of crimson animosity of the heart.  
And you taunted in the agony and made an abolishing cold fire.  
Amid the light of the land where you sleep,  
a dream sobs into metaphors.
