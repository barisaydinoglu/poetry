Preserving Whirlwinds Of Nostalgia
----------------------------------
A cordial linoleum making a warm thing of a lucky meeting with  
a god. I stayed discovered and yellow  
against the land.  
Neither flesh nor film nor gray  
nor deep brown but transparent.  
Like the shaken graphite of honeysuckles multitude of laminated signs!  
In and out of the sepia the cashmire and the burnt umber
