Against Alphabetic Understanding - Identities And Oceanography
--------------------------------------------------------------
Indicates the wheatfield's swimming brow.  
For a day, maybe too many to count,  
I rested under a tornado  
at a post office, waiting for the woman to be outside.  
The decisive law gave it love.  
Went set in drop to the clear color of the bolt of crystal telegraph.  
  
Everything hated with warm voices, the salt of the splendor  
and piles of natural bread behind midnight.
