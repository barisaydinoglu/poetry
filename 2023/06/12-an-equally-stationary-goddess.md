An Equally Stationary Goddess
-----------------------------
There are no wastelands but communist cycles of starlight and transparent  
yellow lakes of lion hearted rotten sand. A image makes,  
gnaws - it does not return.  
Like explosive coat, books  
motionless weather, tremulous lights like the root.  
You see ears as humble as the rain.  
Nothing but your mineral  
curves.  
Anger and evening star - momenta of fear.  
You - the infinite fingernails.  
Among the bleak thicket of nauesous well.  
A thirsty antenna cracks  
even the deedy  
minor boulevard in calculation  
to which the metaphor  
will not be circumscribed.  
You - the poetic hand.  
Only smothered and to a  
astronaut they take on time, too many to count years  
They crushed it with disintered jars.  
Not pacifying is a form of shining.  
My heart is filled with decency like a silicon energy.  
I do not strike in the jungle of absurd rooster.  
Outside sand-colored water and marine awes.  
  
I took on thirsty wreaths.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.
