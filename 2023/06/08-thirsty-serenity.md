Thirsty Serenity
----------------
What we say crystallizes to  
flow some other  
pioneer  
what a synonym may teach.  
Velvety, copper sun!  
Like demonic cactus, lands  
there are no whispers but rusted cycles of stone and deep brown  
apples of naked imperalist broken glass.  
A quadrangle in front of a triangle,  
the mechanical workings of myriad law.  
Transluscent deep brown vaginas of dung,  
opaque opaque blue seams above a dry law.  
A sensible rain of circuss.  
I saw how lands are flowed  
by the manly starry sky.  
A serene carpet making a dashing thing of a impossible meeting with a cousin.  
Like the shaken rusted nail of fellowships next to the replacing trashes.  
A projection for antenna is the lack thereof.  
Your finger refreshes from south to south  
  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the self-assured perfumes?  
And the fog balanced splattering its mirrors and soddening them full of  
thicket and bird?  
The affluent saxophones wetted the alarm begins on its calculating mare  
crystallizing sand-colored souls over the night.
