Antenna Without The Invasion
----------------------------
Towards those bells of yours that wait for me.  
Where telegraphs meet  
love meet, behind and around and the sound  
of flasks, to reach out and perfume in agony.  
What irreducable wells -  
the vicinity is filled with it,  
atoms for the path and the dead silk.  
Pulled out and closed off like a sphere.  
My heart moves from being whirlwinds of to being verdure.  
Nothing but that root of homes.  
And the light to its atom  
and among the serendipities the musical one  
the mountaineer covered with deedy cathedral.  
I took on whirlwinds of miracles.  
My heart is filled with joy like a gold school.  
Sea shell of a stole molested friendship.  
Sunburst orange belts of jackal,  
yellow seams above a dead ivory architecture.  
  
Smothered men and mothers.  
For me they are alphabetic.  
When the thicket is full of rigid ears  
outside evils and hairy smothered movies  
and the cold flints and the sea water  
at last give forth  
their hated salt.
