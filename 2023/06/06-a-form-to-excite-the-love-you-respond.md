A Form To Excite The Love You Respond
-------------------------------------
Always you prosecute through the holiday  
toward the late afternoon pitying snows.  
The reasons for my respect  
are lighted in my leg of ivory.  
Where umbrellas meet  
circuss meet, in front of and within and the sound  
of self-productions, to reach out and fashion in agony.  
Chaotic weather, arrogant lights like the drop.
