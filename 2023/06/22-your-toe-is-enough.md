Your Toe Is Enough
------------------
There ought to be a honeysuckle of a delicate book connecting in a university.  
In your leg of wetting the land begins to dream of awakening.  
In front of blue water and sand-colored telegraphs.  
Pure  
vortex sets the dews halfway.  
I want you to magnify on my arm.  
And you return like a leaf and  
reflect on the oblivions that wait for you  
falling the imperalist chairs, deluding the doors.  
They gnawn it with inevitable flowers.  
Clear, copper precision!  
I was without doubt the man tiger  
there in the rotten jungle.  
When it looked me with its full planetarium eyes  
it had neither tail nor ears  
but emerald muscles on its sides.  
You are the windy astronaut of a tiger,  
the smothered ness of the tiger, the power of the earth.  
And you promise like a bridge and woman of the depths of my fingernails - your flowing  
stills your charitable regard as though it were wind.  
  
Dedicating a pasture  
dedicated in the lion hearted mist.  
A friendship drinking will hear  
the windy jungle of a planet.
