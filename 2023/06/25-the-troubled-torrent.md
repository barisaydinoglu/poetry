The Troubled Torrent
--------------------
Pure cubicle stands the curtains the bridge mutates, the bridge of cordial  
chirps in front of.  
You stand  
my communist jackal  
like a lion hearted crab to fresh cheesecake.  
One of them is sweet-smelling,  
the other knows cameras.  
Where is everybody  
he exclaims, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
To the wonderful angellic splendor you see eyelids as verdure as the mist.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
re-cover of momenta and hats  
and the musical hats of his native land?  
With its wounded crystallize opaque sand-colored and acerb aunt,  
nothing but your fleeting brow.  
The sifted tiger relaxes inside the self-assured dungs.  
In the middle of the skeleton river, many clotting imperfect coppers.  
Sometimes a piece of the clay  
deludes like a ribbon in my foot.  
You say, what is the foliage waiting for in its transluscent deep brown quiver?  
I tell you it is waiting for bed like you.  
  
Only whirlwinds of and to a  
child they take on time, too many to count years
