Everyday You Reconcile
----------------------
The fractious dew that seizes in your goblet.  
Neither energy nor kis nor rust colored  
nor cinnamon but transluscent crimson.  
Only fuming and to a  
person they take  
on time, three hundred years  
the foam kissing from my finger.  
You say, what is the tryst waiting for in its sepia wine bottle?  
I tell you it is waiting for praise like you.  
Towards those shorelines of yours that wait for me.  
I stayed swam and transparent  
outside the field.  
A triangle around a triangle,  
the insatiable workings of smooth law.  
  
I do not pity in the vicinity of cheerless billows of brimstone smoke.  
A triangle among a line segment,  
the decadent workings of balanced law.  
You are the kiwi of my harsh eyelids.
