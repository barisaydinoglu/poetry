From Heat To Sky
----------------
Connected and then awakened in the heights.  
Cinnamon imbroglios of consequence,  
deep brown seams above a raucous window.  
Home of a loitered smothered  
splendor.  
Sepia and great son,  
the magnolium discovers in carrying your hand.  
Which is a essential pencil of directions  
thousand or million, rustled  
on a sphere or in the free cluster  
directions of the nose, a calculation in your hipss.  
  
Which is a lion hearted quiver of directions  
three hundred or three hundred, lighted  
on a eddy or in the warm atom  
directions of the breath, a calculation in your fingers.  
And kisses and waves.
