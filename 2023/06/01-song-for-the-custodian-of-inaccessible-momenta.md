Song For The Custodian Of Inaccessible Momenta
----------------------------------------------
  
Blush on the juices that wait for you  
wetting the rambunctious chairs, dropping the doors.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
pulse of peaces and paths  
and the absorbant tigers of his native land?
