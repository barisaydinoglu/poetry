A Tomato
--------
Around the heights I like to mix like a lewd cathedral.  
We open the halves of a epiphany and the  
killing of vortices builds into the pure divisions.  
And meetings of bruised ears you've asked me what the iguana is loving there with his blue shoulder?  
I reply, the book knows this.  
To the stationary color of the fused quartz splendor.  
In the shady  
region of explosive energy.  
If I could recover the pigeon hole and the field.  
  
What is this projection but a memory flew of its rivers?  
Carry me onto your car - the cherry of my lemon -  
a brandishing linoleum making a honest thing of a chance meeting with a custodian.  
What aromatic perfumes -  
the thicket is filled with it,  
warmths for the sand-colored lake and the forceful silken.  
The suns exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
around it in darkness.  
Inside the silvery brain of the earth.  
  
And in my hammock, during the morning, I woke up naked  
and full of happiness.  
The land crushes, the lake of promising  
magnifies in front of.
