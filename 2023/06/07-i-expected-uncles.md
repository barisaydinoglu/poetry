I Expected Uncles
-----------------
To the delicate color of the crystal lemon.  
To the decisive color of the gold path.  
What we say shines to  
weave some other cousin  
what a production may teach.  
In the transparent foot of the clay.  
Burnt umber and perfect goddess,  
entertaining a love  
refreshed in the silent sunshine.  
Beligerance and  
alcove - hearts of panic.  
Of your blood colored book when you hold out your fingernails.  
What mysteries does the cat contain?  
How little we preserve and how much it perches the phenomena of this universe.  
Magnifying toward the pasture I took on thirsty jars.  
And with my hammock, during the day, I woke up naked  
and full of joy.  
Next to the loitering jugulars.  
A distorted production condemns  
even the gleaming  
aerial moonlight evening in inscription  
to which the metaphor  
will not be enchanted.  
Pure howl swims the sea water I do not crush in the sea of communist scandalmongering.  
Travelling from raucous bolt of saphire.  
I perform as if next to a blood-stained mask.
