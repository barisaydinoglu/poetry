The Agony Of The Algorithmic Narrative
--------------------------------------
If you were not the peach the round moon  
cooks, sprinkling its peach across the thicket.  
There are many bones inside difficult events.  
A chorus of crabs at midnight un refreshed un trembled  
comes to a halt before a sun rise.  
Always you coddle through the twilight  
toward the day compounding pullulations.  
A tetrahedron outside a quadrangle,  
the rustling workings of myriad law.  
The shifty toucan plays under  
the hopeful parallel cummerbundss.  
All ships become panics.  
If I could excite the blood and the boulevard.  
Not the deep brown moment  
when the lunchtime shines the kiss.
