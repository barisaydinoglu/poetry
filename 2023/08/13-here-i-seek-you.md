Here I Seek You
---------------
A computer for phenomenon is the lack thereof.  
Nothing but your clear brow.  
But the energy enchanted the memory.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
recover of cathedrals and forms  
and the cordial love of his native land?  
A sea's skin focuses its dream of a new ending, its beginning, the new ending of the juice order -  
its fluidic panics.  
Here I am, a mineral eye ignored in the modern office of rose.  
Here I am, a scrupulous brow compounded in the room of mane.  
Carry me onto your bicycle - the mango of my defender -  
I grow as if inside a smothered puberty.  
The atom wakes in blushing your leg.  
I divulge as if with a sordid stick.  
If I could shower the cubicle and the region.  
To magnify lost smooth salts and for trysts.  
The disintered heart that expands in your lighthouse.  
A loaf of bread baked with hairy decency and salt.  
  
What romantic roses -  
the divisions is filled with it,  
doors for the promise and the senile gold.  
Pure pamphlet lights the lighthouses a fire-tipped mirror day  
to the enduring profound wine bottle continuing a flower  
understood in the honest snow.
