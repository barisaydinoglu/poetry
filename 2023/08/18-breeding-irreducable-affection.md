Breeding Irreducable Affection
------------------------------
She is under us at this moment of first inheriting.  
Sometimes a piece of the clay  
loiters like a love in my heart.  
The early light of day movies you in its mortal mud.  
I preserve as if within a smothered puberty.  
You say, what is the bridge waiting for in its deep brown vein?  
I tell you it is waiting for  
flower like you.  
In front of the blood colored agony of the acid.
