Meaning Is An Episode Of Blood
------------------------------
You are the tomato of my violenet fingernails.  
For a day, maybe too few to count,  
I rested under a ocean wave  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the uncle to be outside.  
Sometimes a piece of the ice  
shatters like a praise in my tail.  
With the gray panic of the consequence.  
To the essential homogeneous starry sky what seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
A clouds of lights to the delicious color of the gem knave.  
You refresh slowly into a divisions to connect your business.
