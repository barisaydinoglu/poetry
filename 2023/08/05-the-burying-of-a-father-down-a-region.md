The Burying Of A Father Down A Region
-------------------------------------
Come with me to the thorn tree of enemies.  
All starss in the sky become hearts.  
Nothing but your real hand.  
Here I am, a cleansed  
ears drowned in the heights of circus.  
A sensible fog of sea water.  
In my room at holiday you are like a peace  
and your form and colour the way I respond them.  
I was without doubt the child elephant  
there in the fragmented archipeligos.  
When it looked  
me with its friendly utensil eyes  
it had neither heart nor foot  
but silken mirrors on its sides.  
The giant smiles at the mountaineer  
but the fisherman does not smile  
when he looks at the elephant woman  
and the cheerless ocean.  
A calculation gathers,  
invades - it does not return.  
  
Multitude of river banks!  
In and out of the deep brown the cashmire and the sand-colored  
I wish to make a quadrangle  
outside, and every feeling, many  
times hidden in a poppy.
