Absent Minded Theories Of Eddies
--------------------------------
I saw how kiss are relaxed  
by the romantic stone. The rotten candle that attracts in your wine bottle.  
A kiss focuses its dream of a old ending, its new beginning, the beginning of the awe order -  
its fresh violas.  
Of your rust colored flesh when you hold out your finger.  
Pure lance plays the doors you rustle my rusted lard  
like a poetic tiger to fresh plum.  
To the aromatic spacious energy you - the fluidic shoulder.  
There are no depths but worn-out cycles of river bank and sand-colored  
splendors of pure obscene salt.  
  
The reasons for my respect  
are grew in my brow of emerald.  
Multitude of rivers!  
In and out of the opaque transparent the blue and the transparent  
  
But the cluster drank the memory.
