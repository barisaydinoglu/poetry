Setting The Star In Motion
--------------------------
Nights of a lethargic helicopter  
flying among the university around a listless train,  
gleaming as a torrential crab.  
Erupt me and let my substance fashion.  
I saw how sea water are imbued  
by the clear trouser.  
I took on mechanical writings.  
For window was wet-winged and morally positive.  
For a day, maybe three hundred,  
I rested under a uncomfortable turbulence  
at a bus stop, waiting for the lady to be next to.  
  
I am killed by heart and receptacle, by oblivion and sunshine.  
Which is a irreducable tree of directions  
too few to count or too many to count, inherited  
on a maternity or in the myriad writing  
directions of the fingernails, a calculation in your brows.
