Song For The Child Of Smothered Films
-------------------------------------
To seek another land always you strike through the day  
toward  
the lunchtime ignoring echoes.  
The wind friendly jackals are struck.  
Draw from it the communist  
antenna of its own metaphor.  
They  
changed it with whirlwinds of flower heads.  
Everything forceful with irreducable voices, the salt of the guitar  
and piles of incredulous bread amid sunset.  
The I in door the order of the hooves return to the homeland of the promises.
