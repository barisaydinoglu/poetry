A Song Of Confusion
-------------------
Which is a sanguine flute of directions  
million or thousand, loved  
on a praise or in the enduring door  
directions of the heart, a calculation in your shoulders.  
Here I am, a iridescent heart brainwashed in the university of silence.  
I saw how flags are rejoiced  
by the wonderful energy.  
It's a breathing planetarium of cold fires.  
The disintered ritual is starry on your brow.  
In your hand of illusion the land of horses tread.  
Multitude of leaves!  
In and out of the marine the cashmire and the marine  
you are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the round flints?  
And the snow plumed splattering its bottles and sobbing them full of  
city and toucan?  
I salute your spacious lemon  
and envy your esoteric pride.  
Like harsh foliage, mirrors  
you - the iridescent eyelids.  
Because I love you, love, outside the heat and among the earth.  
Nothing but your lion hearted  
arm.  
The fisherman smiles  
at the pioneer  
but the god does not smile  
when he looks at the bird elder  
and the bitterest ocean.  
Fewer and fewer  
twist about another mode of wonder.  
Gnaw me and let my substance mingle.
