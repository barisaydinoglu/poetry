Performed and then rustled in the region.  
Went refreshed in bed has the night been made with secrets?  
Here I am, a steady eye throttled in the modern office

And the indespensable miracles?  
And the mist friendly splattering its moons and congealing them full of

Lashed probes and shaken salivas.  
  
Around the modern office I like to connect like an acidulous movie.  
A vessel is not enough to throttle me and keep me  
from the moonlight evening of your careful mysteries.
