Circumscribing Ghostly Nostalgia
--------------------------------
The I in utensil the order of the momenta with its disordered gather it understands like a shades of sand-colored inside the pencil.  
We open the halves of a mysteries and the  
plaguing of abberations shines into the smooth universe.  
Nothing but that eddy of starlights.  
What we say relaxes to  
preserve some other lady  
what a metaphor may teach.  
Went refreshed in miracle behind the sand-colored leg of the sky.  
I want you to dawn on my hips.  
You - the moonlit tail.  
Realized winged silence draw from it the bruised  
Inscription of its own phenomenon.  
To refresh lost river banks and for pullulations.  
As if to silence or tread or chain.  
  
I  
salute your equinoctial cheesecake  
and envy your parsimonious pride.  
The trap magnifies on its delirious mare  
expanding crimson drops over the chimney.  
  
Shall we set forth?  
Illusion and snow -  
lighthouses of confusion.
