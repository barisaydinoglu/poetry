There Is No Massacre
--------------------
Dew was no longer above the transmission threshold.  
It was the morning of the squirrel.  
The order of the starlights rotten twilight and the morbid shades of yellow  
lunge at the walls of my house.  
Indicates the flute's setting eyeballs.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the serendipidous salts?  
And the snow great splattering its utensils and attacking them full of  
modern office and cat?  
They brainwashed it with skeleton perfumes.  
  
It was the day of the crab.  
Your praise is a momentum filled with wet-winged wheatfield.  
When you dedicate appreciated like a mirror.  
Sterile late afternoon and the demonic wave  
protest at the walls of my house.  
Wave of wave of affections rolling down the sea.  
Recovered and then trod in the boulevard.  
On what atrocious wounds dedicated with fire?  
Key of a sobbed bitten autumn.  
  
You are the mango of my hated heart.  
Under the jungle like aluminum.  
Next to the black animosity of the havoc.  
As if to pass or  
perfume or crack.
