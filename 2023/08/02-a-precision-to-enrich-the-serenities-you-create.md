A Precision To Enrich The Serenities You Create
-----------------------------------------------
If you were not the cheesecake the essential moon  
cooks, sprinkling its sugar across the archipeligos.  
In your brain of illusion the boulevard of flags reconcile.  
Nothing but that smooth stone of perfumes.  
Come with me to the bone of howls.  
Yellow electricity to my shady juice!  
Not the sunburst orange moment  
when the sunrise perches the flints.  
  
Full stop.  
Upgrading a goblet  
galloped in the serene drizzle.
