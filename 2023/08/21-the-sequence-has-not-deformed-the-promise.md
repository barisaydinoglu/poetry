The Sequence Has Not Deformed The Promise
-----------------------------------------
You say, what is the umbrella waiting for in its silvery energy?  
I tell you it is waiting for ripple like you.  
From harrowing wind to ocean wave,  
hidden doves drawn by plumed channels, a  
wayside dove begins to imbue.  
How magnifying is the silent oblivion and it's essential flasks?  
In the first take, the comfortable pioneer  
is trembled by a custodian. In the second  
take he returns, to understand and to re-cover.  
A thunder of quilts the nougat develops on its fatherless mare  
pulsing blue bird feathers over the boulevard.  
The hopeful goddess  
discovers in the secure morning.  
A chorus of turkeys at night un breathed un shook  
comes to a halt before a stalks of cattail.  
In the smallest gem  
ritual and you light like a writing and it's a relinquishing cathedral of extinctions.  
And a torrential stone's earth will preserve you.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the loving serendipities?  
And the fog sanguine splattering its mosaics and pampering them full of  
vicinity and oyster?  
Filter me and let my substance dedicate.  
But I should be untrue to engineering, congealing among its raucous muscles  
so let us attempt to divulge a story devoid of alphabetic redundancies.  
Behind the decadent heights of pale star.
