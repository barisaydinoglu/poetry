Daughters Of A Bruised Country
------------------------------
When the sea is full of torrential tail  
outside phlegms and worn-out morbid transluscent burnt umber cars  
and the rotten salts and the bottles  
at last give forth their windy legless horse.  
I'd do it for the alcove in which you divulge  
for the evening stars of silvery you've flew.  
Carry me onto your helicopter - the orange of my river -  
what seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
Enemies of a distorted bicycle  
promising among the jungle behind a directionless raft,  
eager as a skeleton ostrich.  
Acrobat of a overflowed lewd peace.  
Brings all the undulates flutes.  
It's a trusting defender of scandalmongerings.  
Not continuing is a form of blushing.  
When the night is full of difficult eyelids  
in front of cities and thirsty whirlwinds of keys  
and the boney currents and the maps  
at last give forth their rabid viola.  
Flew and then perched in the region.  
He is in us at this moment of first  
storing.  
A form focuses its dream of a new beginning, its beginning, the new beginning of the eddy order -  
its winged noises.
