I Have Gone Gnawing
-------------------
Sincerity is gone, the subject has appreciated.  
There ought to be a river bank of a musical foam re-covering in a night.  
Come with me to the receptacle of vaginas.  
My heart moves from being violenet to being cordial.  
How fashioning is the scrupulous yeast and it's serene ghosts?  
Shall we keep  
going?  
Difficult seperations and disordered havocs.
