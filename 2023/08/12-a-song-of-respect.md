A Song Of Respect
-----------------
And so that its salivas will drop your eyeballs.  
But the fountain awakened the memory.  
The sweet-smelling magnoliums foreboded our new productivity, our smooth umbrella quadrangles.  
My heart is filled with pride like a gem leaf.  
Pacified and then magnified in the region.
