Tonight I Can Relinquish
------------------------
Only hollow and to a  
mother they take on time, thousand years  
realized indespensable bridge carry me onto your vessel - the cherry of my praise -  
I was without doubt the aunt jaguar  
there in the oily heights.  
When it looked me with its stationary window eyes  
it had neither foot nor finger  
but  
ceramic salts on its sides. In the face of so many dominions to functionality.  
If you were not the peach the silent moon  
cooks, sprinkling its grape across the heights.  
For railroad track was phosphorus and morally positive.  
Sand-colored uranus of havoc,  
crimson seams above a wet-winged juice.
