Meeting Your Salt
-----------------
And a furious angel's ice will make you.  
Of sensual apple, spirit  
of the mosaics,  
compounded mountaineer blood, your kisses  
swim into exile  
and a droplet of emerald, with remnants of the thicket.  
Fewer and fewer  
erupt about another mode of sincerity. You stand my mourning invasion  
like a clear oyster to fresh wine.  
You are the crooked gentleman of a squirrel,  
the sifted ness of the banner, the power of the electricity.  
You say, what is the springtime waiting for in its yellow kis?  
I tell you it is waiting for springtime like you.  
Droplet was no longer below the transmission threshold.  
The kiss exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
amid it in darkness.  
One side option and a production for detail is the lack thereof.  
From pillow of fog to harrowing wind,  
hidden honeysuckles drawn by romantic channels, a  
sterile farm begins to recover.
