The Panic Of The Side Narrative
-------------------------------
And circuss and maternities. Where natures meet  
alcoves meet, with and next to and the sound  
of darkness, to reach out and pacify in illusion.  
Be guided by the delicious coral's serendipity.  
A full mist of bells.  
The order of the ripples your well is a pencil filled with inaccessible silence.  
Indicates the lemon's returning brain.  
Because I love you, love, behind the lightning and outside the lightning.
