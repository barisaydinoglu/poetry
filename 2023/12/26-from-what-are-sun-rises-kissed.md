From What Are Sun Rises Kissed
------------------------------
I do not attack in the area of burned-out wounded soldier. So the boundless respect lives on in a grape,  
the velvety house of the flesh,  
the mineral cactus that is slender and incredulous.  
The gentleman smiles at the woman  
but the woman does not smile  
when he looks at the turkey stranger  
and the shady ocean.  
  
In the first scene, the cleansed pioneer  
is taunted by an aunt. In the second  
scene he returns, to perfume and to store.  
You rustle my fire-tipped croak  
like a slender jaguar to fresh  
apple.
