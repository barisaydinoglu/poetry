I Have Gone Continuing
----------------------
Nobody here is waiting for the next apple.  
Candle. You developed yourself for pacifying.  
Nothing but that thread of ships.  
Wave of wave of grapes rolling down the sea.  
What coagulates the props of purity?  
And the essence to its silence  
and among the maternities the absent minded one  
the bride covered with delicate laminated sign.  
In the first reel, the parsimonious goddess  
is congealed by a pioneer. In the second  
take he returns, to seize and to rustle.  
The custodian smiles at the child  
but the person does not smile  
when he looks at the squirrel daughter  
and the imperalist ocean.  
Which is an absent minded lemon of directions  
twenty-seven or too many to count, lighted  
on a rose or in the wide prize  
Directions of the nose, a calculation in your shoulders.  
Cinnamon and pure daughter,  
you are the negligent person of a squirrel,  
the spoiled ness of the splendor, the power of the wind.  
A banal signal twists  
even the homogeneous  
public boulevard in metaphor  
to which the metaphor  
will not be stood.  
  
When the sea is full of clenched tail  
next to dusts and tear stained molested serenities  
and the careless drops and the echoes  
at last give forth their fatherless violence.  
Realized celestial farm enjoy the many rigid attempts to shower  
the changeless dung.  
There is lyrical fortune in preserving it.
