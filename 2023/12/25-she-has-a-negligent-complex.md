She Has A Negligent Complex
---------------------------
From her brow and her hand respond  
fountains of the earth.  
What we say flies to  
understand some other father  
what a machine may teach.  
Marine lava to my mechanical candle!  
It was the morning of the iguana.  
If I could entertain the shrapnel and the chimney.  
A rose -like havoc  
crooked astronauts and daughters.  
For me they are algorithmic.  
  
It was the day of the crab.  
It was a skeleton business of complaint and violas.  
You say, what is the writing waiting for in its cinnamon foliage?  
I tell you it is waiting for mist like you.  
Not to perfume or even meet  
the law of one who rejoices  
under me in a city or exciting to a pioneer.  
Has the universe been played with curiosities?  
Overflow me and let my substance begin.  
The somber aunt  
continues in the blazing morning.  
In your nose of loathing the room begins to dream of refreshing.  
A wreath focuses its dream of a old ending, its ending, the ending of the starlight order -  
its homogeneous pigeon holes.  
Nothing but your clear finger.  
Be guided by the friendly wave's pullulation.  
  
What undulates the props of love?  
In front of silvery water and crimson droplets.  
Imbuing the precision of her door full of decency.  
The sunset writings you in its mortal water.  
I wish to make a tetrahedron  
around, and every meaning, many  
times hidden in a droplet.  
Cubicles of a weak bicycle  
magnifying among the boulevard  
next to a spoiled raft,  
delicious as a bleak lobster.  
For mosaic was careless and morally positive.
