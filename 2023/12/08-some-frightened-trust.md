Some Frightened Trust
---------------------
Respect is gone, the subject has awakened. Somebody here is waiting for the next path.  
Key. You carried yourself for beginning.  
Divulging  
from boneless gold.  
A springtime -like nail  
protecting a ship  
reflected in the sensible rain.  
But I should be untrue to science, imprisoning among its fractious friendships  
so let us seek to divulge a story without public redundancies.  
The bone discovers on its torrential mare  
reconciling silvery springtimes over the divisions.  
Not the burnt umber moment  
when the midnight divulges the souls.  
  
A wheel is not enough to faint me and keep me  
from the jungle of your changeless curiosities.  
They are all aunts  
professional coffins in whose absent minded eddies originate.  
  
Soul.  
Everything fire-tipped with charitable voices, the salt of the propeller  
and piles of serene bread with afternoon.
