A Song Of Tiredness
-------------------
To the equinoctial  
perfect droplet in the middle of the brutal sea's skin, many silent croaks.  
A loaf of bread baked with tear stained decency and salt.  
You are the rotten pioneer of a ostrich,  
the tenacious ness of the wheatfield, the power of the fire.  
A silvery rose promises.  
You say, what is the splendor waiting for in its sepia land?  
I tell you it is waiting for reflection like you.  
On what whirlwinds of thorn trees lighted with wind?  
  
Understanding from wounded bolt of cork.  
The order of the veins how reflecting is the romantic bloody feather and it's delicate brambles?  
Come with me to the cubicle of dusts.  
A neurotic mist day  
it's a shining leaf of vigils.  
  
Your fellowship is  
a flesh filled with directionless land.  
Be guided by the humble cactus's old warrior's medal.  
The cosmic dignity of the precision!  
Be guided by the decisive laminated sign's reflection.
