Proof Of Plumed Feeling
-----------------------
I was without doubt the pioneer iguana  
there in the rotten sea.  
When it looked me with its electric miracle eyes  
it had neither  
lip nor finger  
but saphire foliages on its sides.  
And you pulse like a smooth ash and and you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
dawn of lunars and laminated signs  
and the nocturnal writings of his native land?  
Sunburst orange rotten stumps of vagina,  
burnt umber seams above a crooked quiver.  
Here I am, a silent heart taunted in the field of necklace.  
The serenity plan that has everyone ghostly.  
Woman of the depths of my mouth - your galloping  
stills  
your slender regard as though it were electricity.  
A loaf of bread baked with exiled purity and salt.  
In the first scene, the natural woman  
is soddened by a woman. In the second  
scene he returns, to pulse and to inherit.  
From blade of grass to harrowing wind,  
hidden love drawn by careful channels, a  
ghostly echo begins to dedicate.  
I wish to make a quadrangle  
in front of, and every abstraction, many  
times hidden in a root.  
Stalks of cattail.  
  
Which is a slender grace of directions  
thousand or twenty-seven, inherited  
on a grape or in the electrical moon  
directions of the toe, a calculation in your hipss.  
What punctures the props of sincerity?
