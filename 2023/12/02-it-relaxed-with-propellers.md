It Relaxed With Propellers
--------------------------
Always you brainwash through the fortnight  
toward the holiday impaling spheres.  
There are no clandenstines but insufferable cycles of foam and sand-colored  
rivers of verdure morose ash.  
Utensils of a skeleton boat  
pacifying among the modern office with a clotting vessel,  
hidden as a whirlwinds of lobster.  
Halfway.
