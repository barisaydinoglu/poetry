What Is True Of The Sea's Skin Is True Of Everything
----------------------------------------------------
From blade of grass to tornado,  
hidden landscapes drawn by real channels, a  
skeleton essence begins to make.  
A mineral sunshine of branches.  
Shining from communist diamond.  
The order of the fountains not to set or even meet  
the hat  
of one who develops  
under me in a modern office or dedicating to a gentleman.  
Multitude of currents!  
In and out of the sand-colored the sand-colored and the transparent there ought to be an apple of a lyrical evening star enriching in an archipeligos.  
A arcane clouds of graces.  
You carry slowly into a land to pacify your business.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
fly of kiss and angels  
and the spacious propellers of his native land?  
Circumstances of a silent bicycle  
beginning within the chimney with a nauesous wheel,  
balanced as a brutal squirrel.  
In the face of so many gates to functionality.  
They hated it with fire-tipped maps.
