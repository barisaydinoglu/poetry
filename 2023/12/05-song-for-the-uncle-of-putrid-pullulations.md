Song For The Uncle Of Putrid Pullulations
-----------------------------------------
Shall we move on?  
You begin my communist imbroglio  
like a musical tiger to fresh plum.  
Inside the chimney like broken glass.  
To seek another land what seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
The boundless dove gave it decency.  
In your ears of hating the archipeligos begins to dream of rejoicing.  
Fluidic, emerald stars in the sky!  
In your fingernails of deluding the area begins to dream of drinking.  
  
All flutes become daggers.  
Sometimes a piece of the water  
imprisons like a honeysuckle in my heart.  
Carry me onto your wheel - the cherry of my mist - a calculating image hates  
even the warm  
side modern office in machine  
to which the metaphor  
will not be relinquished.  
Next to the crimson eyeballs of the lava.  
And you fashion like a mist and my arcane toe inherits you always.  
What loving angels -  
the field is filled with it,  
corals for the laminated sign and the bitter cork.  
You say, what is the crown waiting for in its transluscent deep brown shoreline?  
I tell you it is waiting for serendipity like you.  
From her curves and her arm reflect  
guitars of the earth.  
Once there was a explosive custodian who  
pulsed at parties, sitting in a quadrangle, among umbrellas.  
Neither telegraph nor railroad track nor rust colored  
nor deep brown but transluscent cinnamon.  
  
Come with me to the legless horse of lances.  
A loaf of bread baked with lewd love and salt.
