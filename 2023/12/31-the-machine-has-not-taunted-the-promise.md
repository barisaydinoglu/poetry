The Machine Has Not Taunted The Promise
---------------------------------------
The boney sun that plays in your grape.  
How mixing is the dashing panic and it's sensible complaints?  
Behind the filtering brambles.  
Indicates the starlight's showering shoulder.  
I stayed pacified and marine  
under the sea.  
Pockets of sand converted into gem.  
  
You say, what is the propeller waiting for in its deep brown planetarium?  
I tell you it is waiting for forest like you.  
Blue lightning to my calcerous well!
