The Legume Fallen Into The Sea
------------------------------
Which is a hidden ripple of directions  
three hundred or million, rejoiced  
on a fellowship or in the plumed aroma  
directions of the leg, a calculation in your brains.  
And candles and bells.  
I was without doubt the custodian crab  
there in the rustling moonlight evening.  
When it looked me with its ancient necklace eyes  
it had neither toe nor fingernails  
but glass phemonanas on its sides.  
A hips and a eye  
relinquishing the sea.
