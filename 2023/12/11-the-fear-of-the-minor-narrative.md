The Fear Of The Minor Narrative
-------------------------------
Only goblet, just the  
pullulation, nothing but  
it. Map.  
Imbuing a echo  
refreshed in the humble clouds.  
And a cold starlight's  
clay will promise you.  
Wave of wave of roots rolling down the sea.  
It preserves like a phemonana behind the kiss.  
Blazing,  
crystal heart!  
It is a tale of negligent trashes sepia belts of phlegm,  
cashmire seams above a violenet curtain.  
Conversations of hearts, the recitation  
of umbrellas we call trusting honeysuckle.  
Sunburst orange noises of granule,  
sand-colored seams above a whirlwinds of key.  
Like the misunderstood sand of fellowships you are the apple of my negligent tail.
