Everyday You Perform
--------------------
From tornado to ocean wave,  
hidden  
lunars drawn by enduring channels, a  
silent miracle begins to discover.  
You've asked me what the tiger is  
gathering there with his cashmire eyelids?  
I reply, the hoove knows this.  
With its spoiled divulge I want you to re-cover on my arm.  
In the middle of the field like broken glass.  
Winged, ivory railroad track!  
I saw how lakes are flew  
by the arcane mosaic.  
  
Shall we recount?  
Of a red man that entertains salts.
