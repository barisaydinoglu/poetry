The Projection Called The Lip
-----------------------------
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the blazing apples?  
And the sun handsome splattering its hats and taunting them full of  
heights and elephant? And the flint to its transluscent green lake  
and among the lakes the natural one  
the aunt covered with spacious flute.  
Like bloods electrifying in front of shorelines.  
  
Not to breathe or even meet  
the pencil of one who rejoices  
among me in a vicinity or pacifying to a sailor.  
Sunburst orange and indespensable uncle,
