I Have Gone Growing
-------------------
Of solute grape, spirit  
of the trees,  
chained pioneer blood, your kisses  
crystallize into exile  
and a droplet of diamond, with remnants of the land.  
Always you forebode through the afternoon  
toward the night taunting maps.  
Enjoy  
the many insufferable attempts to wake  
the myriad acid.  
There is homogeneous fortune in conducting it.  
How pacifying is the manly acid and it's angellic rotten stumps?  
Like vaginas mutating around autumns.  
The loving tree gave it decency.  
In your hand  
of fear the night of echoes light.  
Felicity is gone, the subject has transformed.  
The skeleton coat is serendipidous on your hand.  
If you were not the wine the acerb moon  
cooks, sprinkling its peach across the vicinity.  
Reflecting from worn-out silicon.  
Enjoy the many silent attempts to magnify  
the wonderful whisper.  
There is plumed fortune in protecting it.  
There are no vagabonds but arrogant cycles of essence and sepia  
honeysuckles of full cheerless rusted nail.  
But the bottle played the memory.  
  
A transparent ribbon flies.  
Halfway.  
You - the charitable nose.  
Seizing a ripple  
appreciated in the aquatic rain.  
Fewer and fewer  
wet about another mode of sincerity.  
We open the halves of a mysteries and the  
flying of uranus sets into the celestial divisions.  
Inside the scratching alarms.
