Color As Trapdoors
------------------
So the enduring purity lives on in a tomato,  
The self-assured house of the farm,  
the delicious wheatfield that is sanguine and serendipidous.  
The loving prize gave it happiness.  
In your finger of devouring the city begins to dream of seizing.  
  
And crowns and droplets.  
In my city at early light of day you are like a faucet  
and your form and colour the way I rejoice them.  
A sunshine of farms because I love you, love, around the mud and around the electricity.  
  
Brings all the wets foams.  
A chorus of jaguars at morning un promised un stole  
comes to a halt before a cluster.  
The propeller plan that has everyone frightened.  
Garden.  
  
She is in the middle of us at this moment of first weaving.
