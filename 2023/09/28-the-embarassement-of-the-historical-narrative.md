The Embarassement Of The Historical Narrative
---------------------------------------------
A inscription treads,  
rejects - it does not return.  
My heart is filled with decency like a silk movie.  
Pass me and let my substance begin.  
Hearing a fellowship  
carried in the lyrical sunshine.  
A serendipity focuses its dream of a beginning, its new beginning, the new beginning of the book order -  
its cordial stalactites.  
When the divisions is full of communist eyelids  
with vigils and frail communist prizes  
and the neurotic maps and the grapes  
at last give forth their tremulous dust.  
Next to the turqoise fear of the smoke.
