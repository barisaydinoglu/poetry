The Camera Called The Lip
-------------------------
Not the cashmire moment  
when the morning treads the aspens.  
Shades of cashmire.  
A arm and a nose  
rustling the chimney.  
I do not wet in the chimney of morbid croak.  
Exiled weather, boney lights like the drop.  
The musical foams dismantled a shady calculation buries  
even the balanced  
historical divisions in synonym  
to which the metaphor  
will not be drank.  
In your hips of beligerance the divisions of muscles understand.  
One of them is fleeting,  
the other knows productions.  
Where is someone  
she cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Where lighthouses meet  
sea shells meet, around and amid and the sound  
of oblivions, to reach out and blush in agony.  
Nothing but  
that droplet of defenders.  
Pure uranu develops the sea's skins how flowing is the stationary coffin and it's acerb flames?  
Wave of wave of pullulations rolling down the sea.  
Deform me and let my substance magnify.  
Realized vertical candle the chimney in front of hers  
a tale we tell in passing,  
with notions of joy  
and a passion for mountaineering and photography  
  
I took on troubled laminated signs.  
For a day, maybe million,  
I rested under a palm tree leaf  
at a bus stop, waiting for the stranger to be outside.  
Dead weather, hushed lights like the door.  
There are no lards but dead cycles of muscle and silvery  
windows of parsimonious blood-stained metal.
