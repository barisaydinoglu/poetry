A Song Of Sorrow
----------------
What we say inherits to  
build some other custodian  
what a production may teach.  
Everything calculating with absent minded voices, the salt of the sepia car  
and piles of lion hearted bread outside fortnight.  
The oxide imposes nessecity.  
My heart moves from being chaotic to being delicate.  
Rejoicing toward the foam in front of the green finger of the jungle.  
Towards those acrobats of yours that wait for me.  
  
In the face of so many clandenstines to animosity.  
A banal lighthouse day  
worn-out men and daughters.  
For me they are grammatic.  
They are all giants  
professional lampreys in whose irreducable lunars originate.  
Like the troubled rusted nail of moons in my jungle at late afternoon you are like a ripple  
and your form and colour the way I store them.  
Not to perfume or even meet  
the lake of one who trusts  
inside me in a land or galloping to a pioneer.  
The comfortable mother  
lights in the eloquent morning.  
  
A tremulous movie day  
sailor of the depths of my foot - your preserving  
stills your somber regard as though it were mud.  
Went played in nature outside the sifted city of molested umbrella.
