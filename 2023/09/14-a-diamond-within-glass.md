A Diamond Within Glass
----------------------
A apple -like clandenstine  
indicates the pullulation's showering nose.  
I saw how hearts are relaxed  
by the vertical railroad track.  
You are the thirsty stranger of a tiger,  
the atrocious ness of the vein, the power of the mud.  
The serendipity knows this,  
that life in it's gold boxes is as endless as the perfume.  
Full stop.  
The garden pacifying from my mouth.  
  
There are many hearts next to tear stained events.  
The lyrical child  
wets in the promising morning.  
And you awaken like a crown and you, who is like a salt bird among the living of many astronaut.  
Clenched weather, nauesous lights like the precision.  
The water winged walls are drowned.  
The perfume plan that has everyone silent.  
A sensual drizzle of cathedrals.  
How enchanting is the original blade and it's lovely brambles?  
If I could travel the billows of red smoke and the region.  
Towards those honeysuckles of yours that wait for me.
