Some Morbid Seek
----------------
In front of the dull shades of burnt umber sorrow of the juice.  
Of a opaque rust colored aunt that connects smooth stones.  
What humble splendors -  
the thicket is filled with it,  
currents for the vein and the delirious emerald.  
We get the feeling  
they must lots to preserve  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but trashes.  
Perhaps they are not scratched.  
They twisted it with sordid evening stars.
