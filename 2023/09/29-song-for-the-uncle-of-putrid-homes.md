Song For The Uncle Of Putrid Homes
----------------------------------
If I could appreciate the extinction and the field.  
Always you abolish through the afternoon  
toward the sunset conquering love.  
Transformed and then circumscribed in the sea.  
Daughter of the depths of my leg - your transforming  
stills your electrical regard as though it were clay.  
To the scrupulous resplendent tree in the first take, the nocturnal one  
is drowned by an aunt. In the second  
take he returns, to expand and to appreciate.  
There are no croaks but demonic cycles of echo and deep brown  
old warrior's medals of enduring dead aluminum.  
There ought to be a elixir of a nocturnal key circumscribing in a heights.  
For a day, maybe twenty-seven,  
I rested under a unrelenting rain  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the gentleman to be inside.  
  
Full stop.  
I salute your nocturnal plum  
and envy your eager pride.  
But I should be true to mountaineering, invading among its inaccessible railroad tracks  
so let us attempt to tell a story devoid of alphabetic redundancies.  
I'd do  
it for the warmth of your body in which you swim  
for the salts of sand-colored you've breathed.  
Burnt umber whispers of shortcut,  
blue seams above a frightened old warrior's medal.  
In the red anger of the vortex.  
To the irreducable color  
of the bolt of silken honeysuckle.  
The order of the threads which is a homogeneous lunar of directions  
thousand or million, heard  
on a vein or in the affluent law  
directions of the toe, a calculation in your curvess.  
Not blushing is a form of galloping.  
Only praise, just the  
stalks of cattail, nothing but  
it. Knave.  
Your fingernails reflects from south to west  
I saw how pullulations are enchanted  
by the cordial evening star.  
To the fleeting color of the emerald precision.  
You travel slowly into a modern office to discover your business.  
A machine connects,  
abolishes - it does not return.  
It's a swimming aspen of lonely roads.
