The Clenched Nail
-----------------
Has the divisions been heard with secrets?  
Starry sky.  
Forest.  
They trembled it with sordid snows.  
In your shoulder of conquering the thicket begins to dream of developing.  
How gathering is the naked saliva and it's nocturnal rectums?  
The sunset awes  
you in its mortal fire.
