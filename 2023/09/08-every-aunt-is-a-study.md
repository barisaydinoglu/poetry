Every Aunt Is A Study
---------------------
It's an awakening sun of seperations.  
Multitude of shadess of sand-colored!  
In and out of the transluscent green the deep brown and the silvery  
To seek another land gathering toward the vein always you loiter through the afternoon  
toward the late afternoon penetrating silences.  
Of a ultraviolet aunt that breathes flowers.  
Reconciling toward the magnolium our new starlight, our starry flag circles.  
On what fragmented graves fluttered with jungle?  
From her eyeballs and her mouth build  
awes of the earth.  
What boundless reflections -  
the city is filled with it,  
shorelines for the forest and the skeleton chalk.  
The dominion pacifies on its dilute mare  
trusting sepia laminated signs over the night.  
  
The clotting time is loving on your arm.  
In the first take, the poetic god  
is  
impaled by a woman. In the second  
reel he returns, to flutter and to gallop.  
I chirp as if next to a bleak invasion.  
Enjoy the many neurotic attempts to imbue  
the sanguine panic.  
There is comfortable fortune in breathing it.  
When you rise like banner enriched by the lava.  
I saw how flutes are seized  
by the incredulous femininity.  
Lady of the depths of my toe - your magnifying  
stills your changeless regard as though it were clay.
