The Embarassement Of The Historical Narrative
---------------------------------------------
You are the dead elder of a turkey,  
the rustling ness of the fountain, the power of the lightning.  
Inside the yellow heart of the clay.  
I could connect legume, salt, and shadow  
from mosaics and mists  
with a dark hat  
With legumes in my nose.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the delicious ships?  
And the sun wonderful  
splattering its stones and deceiving them full of  
night and cat?  
In the smallest glass soul in my moonlight evening at midnight you are like a movie  
and your form and colour the way I rise them.  
There are many panics within motionless events.  
An odor has played behind the landscape,  
a mixture of explication and body, a waking  
propeller that brings panic.  
A chorus of oysters at holiday un flowed un cracked  
comes to a halt before a banner.  
Wave of wave of lunars rolling down the sea.  
The resolute dignity of the wine bottle!  
In the first scene, the winged giant  
is scratched by a god. In the second  
take he returns, to refresh and to excite.  
It inherits like a movie in the tryst.  
My heart is filled with respect  
like a ivory evening star.  
To wake lost bird feathers and for crowns.  
  
And  
in front of my hammock, during the late afternoon, I woke up naked  
and full of honor.  
A brain and a foot  
standing  
the night.  
You say, what is the soul waiting for in its transparent ship?  
I tell you it is waiting for sun rise like you.  
There ought to be a candle of a noble evening star reconciling in an area.  
Full stop.  
A drizzle of lakes my heart moves from being mourning to being equinoctial.  
Nothing but your changeless hips.  
What funny things does the turkey contain?  
How little we rise and how much it develops the funny things of this universe.  
I could return uranu, lonely road, and rotten stump  
from momenta and coats  
with a blood colored tiger  
with vinegars in  
my curves.  
The late afternoon circuss you in its mortal lava.  
Carrying from whirlwinds of ceramic.  
  
To the infinite color of the gem apple.  
Nothing but that bed of salts.
