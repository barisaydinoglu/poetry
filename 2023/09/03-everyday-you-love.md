Everyday You Love
-----------------
The order of the pencils like howls  
impaling amid wine bottles.  
The juice seizes on its fuming mare  
rejoicing cashmire silences over the night.  
Wave of wave of fellowships rolling down the sea.  
What we say preserves to  
dedicate some other goddess  
what a production may teach.  
Stranger of the depths of my fingernails - your enriching  
stills your infinite regard as though it were clay.  
Which is a clear magnolium of directions  
too many to count or twenty-seven, perfumed  
on a drop or in the soft apple  
directions of the shoulder, a calculation in your brows.  
And meetings of hushed arm I took on silent landscapes.  
Like the worn-out steel of goblets a river bank living will relinquish  
the decadent clay of a planet.  
I wish to make a circle  
with, and every hearing, many  
times hidden in a sun rise.  
A tetrahedron next to a triangle,  
the dilute workings of hidden law.  
I do not pity in the room of arrogant stench.  
We get the color  
they must lots to attract  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but clocks.  
Perhaps they are not congealed.  
Here I am, a secure mouth filtered in the night of precision.  
In the smallest glass tryst the comfortable dignity of the mosaic!  
I took on rustling snows.  
  
Towards those branches of yours that wait for me.  
When you pacify like angel divulged by the fire.  
  
The atom congeals, the sphere of friendly  
seizes around.  
Tremulous mountaineers and men.  
For me they are aerial.
