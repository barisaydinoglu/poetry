Pioneers Of A Dead Country
--------------------------
To seek another land a silent sequence abducts  
even the monastic  
overtone land in point of view  
to which the metaphor  
will not be conducted.  
Which is  
a deedy tiger of directions  
too few to count or three hundred, dawned  
on a time or in the dashing dew  
directions of the eye, a calculation in your fingers.  
A lashed shoreline day  
convicts of a dead airplane  
recovering inside the university with a neon vessel,  
delicate as a boney tiger.  
Draw from it the calculating  
sequence of its own projection.  
How refreshing is the aquatic trash and it's somber acids?  
In the smallest saphire warmth rotten astronauts and pioneers.  
For me they are slightest.
