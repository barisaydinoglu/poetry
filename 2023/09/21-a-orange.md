A Orange
--------
Of a gray stranger that pulses telegraphs.  
The violence imposes nessecity.  
It gathers like a time in front of the branch.  
I wish to make a square  
outside, and every faith, many  
times hidden in an aspen.  
Not to refresh or even meet  
the elixir of one who stands  
outside me in a chimney or wetting to a gentleman.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
continue of muscles and lighthouses  
and the changeless wine bottles of his native land?  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
crystallize of schools and defenders  
and the blazing hats of his native land?
