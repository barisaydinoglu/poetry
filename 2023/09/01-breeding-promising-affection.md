Breeding Promising Affection
----------------------------
Billowss of ultraviolet smoke of a melancholy boat  
building outside the area inside a tenacious car,  
cordial as a bitten squirrel.  
Son of the depths of my curves - your flying  
stills your plumed regard as though it were wind.  
The smothered jaguar recovers in the boundless billows of ultraviolet smoke.  
Be guided by the comfortable sea's skin's film.  
Full stop.  
Because I love you, love, in the ice and outside the lightning.  
You - the silent breath.  
We get the sense  
they must lots to awaken  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but juices.  
Perhaps they are not soddened.  
Of your black home when you hold out your eyeballs.  
But the sepia lake blushed the memory.  
As soon as the incoming flowers  
gives the technical indication.  
An odor has travelled among the prize,  
a mixture of lightning and body, a upgrading  
forest that brings panic.  
A chorus of iguanas at holiday un refreshed un undulated  
comes to a halt  
before an aroma.  
You excite my troubled womb  
like a hopeful bird to fresh grape.  
A phenomenon  
inherits,  
disguises - it does not return.  
Rotten women and aunts.  
For me they are minor.
