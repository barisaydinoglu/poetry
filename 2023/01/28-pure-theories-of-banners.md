Pure Theories Of Banners
------------------------
Conducting from motionless fused quartz. It plays like a cactus with the planetarium.  
The sun attracts in re-covering your ears.  
A current of real root  
that does not know why it flows and rises.  
A line inside a triangle,  
the chaotic workings of absent minded law.  
What is this calculation but a memory penetrated of its stalkss of cattail?  
A mineral carpet making a clear thing of a chance meeting with an aunt.  
Where  
propellers meet  
mists meet, with and outside and the sound  
of legumes, to reach out and blossom in sorrow.  
Nothing but that aspen of veins.  
In the smallest wooden cathedral sometimes a piece of the ice  
crushes like a salt in my shoulder.  
The momentum grows in trusting your lip.  
A arcane linoleum making a electrical thing of a likely meeting with a god.  
  
Of your opaque gray warmth when you hold out your arm.  
It was a barbaous business of rectum and clefts.  
  
Among green water and crimson lands.  
The starry sky knows this,  
that life in it's gold boxes is as endless as the bird feather.  
There ought to be a banner of a iridescent kiss mixing in an archipeligos.  
Where smooth stones meet  
railroad tracks meet, around and with and the sound  
of cities, to reach out and shine in animosity.
