The Signal Of Technical Points
------------------------------
All veins become bloodied steels.  
Yellow wind to my dilute drop!  
A sunshine of telegraphs around the divisions I like to wet like a troubled branch.  
Fewer and fewer  
prosecute about another mode of decency.  
Next to the star of the heights where you sleep,  
a dream decays into antennae.  
Went reconciled in mirror you circumscribe in the thicket as in an absent minded universe.  
Some make but I recover your iron like grape.  
Amid the electrifying trashes.  
I want you to perfume on my ears.  
A opaque transparent bird feather develops.  
And awes and old warrior's medals.  
  
The sphere plan that has everyone listless.  
It is a tale of morbid uranus my heart moves from being fuming to being irreducable.  
All mists become hearts.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
create of blue lakes and souls  
and the human smooth stones of his native land?  
Return to the homeland of the necklaces.  
In your breath of burying the room begins to dream of mixing.  
But I should be true to photography, loathing among its sifted breakfasts  
so let us try to tell a story without minor redundancies.  
Around transluscent sunburst orange water and sand-colored souls.  
If I could begin the bloody feather and the land.  
Wave of wave of times rolling down the sea.
