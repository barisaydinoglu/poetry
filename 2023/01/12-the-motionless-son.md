The Motionless Son
------------------
If you were  
not the bread the serene moon  
cooks, sprinkling its bread across the chimney.  
Only callous and to a  
aunt they take on time, million years  
As soon as the incoming atoms  
gives the public indication.  
A loaf of bread baked with whirlwinds of felicity and salt.  
You dawn slowly into a divisions to imbue your business.  
A sordid sphere day  
but I should be untrue to science, compounding among its listless jars  
so let us seek to speak a story without technical redundancies.
