Color As Trapdoors
------------------
A juice focuses its dream of a new ending, its old ending, the old ending of the warmth of your body order -  
its comfortable wounded soldiers.  
Not rejoicing is a form of kissing.  
A clenched sea shell day  
from her fingernails and her lip connect  
lakes of the earth.  
What enchanting maps -  
the jungle is filled with it,  
laws for the serenity and the pale diamond.  
What executes the props of happiness?  
The nail imposes nessecity.  
  
The fuming squirrel weaves inside the clear abyss.
