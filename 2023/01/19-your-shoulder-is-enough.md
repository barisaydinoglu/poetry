Your Shoulder Is Enough
-----------------------
A vertical sunshine of silicon architectures.  
Form on the flasks that wait for you  
compounding the wet-winged chairs, taunting the doors.  
Return to the homeland of the droplets.  
Enriching from delirious gem.  
It perfumes like a productivity amid the evening star.  
As soon as the incoming farms  
gives the technical indication.  
Ignore me and let my substance reconcile.  
When you wake like star dedicated by the heat.  
Behind the black animosity of the blade.  
My  
fresh breath sets you always.  
The cordial dignity of the love!  
  
In your brain of congealing the modern office begins to dream of rising.  
I stayed lived and opaque deep brown  
in the middle of the chimney.
