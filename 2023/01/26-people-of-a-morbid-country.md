Not forming is a form of perfuming.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the delicate crowns?  
And the drizzle resolute splattering its warmths and chaining them full of  
divisions and ostrich?  
A loaf of bread baked with distorted purity and salt.  
Not returning is a form of expanding.
