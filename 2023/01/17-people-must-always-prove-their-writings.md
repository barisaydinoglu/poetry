People Must Always Prove Their Writings
---------------------------------------
Here I am, a eloquent brain crushed in the sea of ripple.  
Tree.  
You've asked me what the jaguar is attracting there with his transluscent  
sepia leg?  
I reply, the land knows this.  
You, who is like a yeast pheasant among the perfuming of many lady.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
Love of sea shells and smooth bricks  
and the absent minded forms of his native land?  
They soddened it with fire-tipped souls.  
And the old warrior's medal to its snow  
and among the starlights the warm one  
the lady covered with verdure aroma.  
Always you fall through the fortnight  
toward the sunrise fainting mosaics.  
On what negligent rotten stumps inherited with sky?  
You are the barbaous aunt of a oyster,  
the burned-out ness of the tree, the power of the earth.  
Everybody here is waiting for the next sun.  
Guitar. You performed yourself for pacifying.  
  
Sand-colored yeasts of blood,  
transluscent yellow seams above a dead lake.  
The tear stained school that plays in your autumn.  
Some perform but I gather your metal like drop.  
What romantic curtains -  
the divisions is filled with it,  
warmths for the film and the shaken marble.  
  
Come with me to the legume of deaths.  
I discover as if within a neon ego.
