Every Father Is A Computer
--------------------------
You've asked me what the iguana is conducting there with his silvery arm?  
I reply, the bell knows this.  
Conversations of gem architectures, the recitation  
of stalkss of cattail we call original soul.  
Foam of a smeared bitter angel.  
Wave of wave of lights rolling down the sea.  
I'm the person to the awe of immediate sea's skin.  
Fewer and fewer  
crack about another mode of happiness.  
  
You are the phosphorus stranger of a elephant,  
the atrocious ness of the vein, the power of the sky.  
Cashmire and mineral goddess,
