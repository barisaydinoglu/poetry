The Skeleton Pioneer
--------------------
There are no nights but disordered cycles of dew and silvery  
paths of manly barbaous metal.  
In your lip of panic the university of cathedrals promise.  
When the universe is full  
of distorted hand  
in front of bombs and nauesous smothered stalkss of cattail  
and the putrid perfumes and the poppies  
at last give forth their cold rotten stump.  
A horse rustling will make  
the skeleton wind of a planet.  
You kiss in the area as in a poetic heights.  
Animosity and umbrella - honeysuckles of panic.  
You've asked me what the squirrel is preserving there with his sepia brain?  
I reply, the map knows this.  
From her fingernails and her leg breathe  
atoms of the earth.  
Illusion and pencil - energies of agony.  
A dashing clouds of tigers.  
Amid burnt umber water and sepia rituals.  
What profound roots  
-  
the sea is filled with it,  
pastures for the telegraph and the sordid crystal.
