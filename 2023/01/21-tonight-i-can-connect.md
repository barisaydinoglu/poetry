Tonight I Can Connect
---------------------
A chorus of lobsters at lunchtime un trod un soddened  
comes to a halt before a sun.  
Because I love you, love, next to the heat and around the water.  
What verdure foliages -  
the night is filled with it,  
prizes for the wreath and the thirsty gold.  
The pioneer smiles at the man  
but the goddess does not smile  
when he looks at the bird elder  
and the mourning ocean.  
The fresh pioneer  
weaves in the naked morning.  
Nothing but your sensible eye.  
What we say relinquishes to  
seek some other sailor  
what a image may teach.
