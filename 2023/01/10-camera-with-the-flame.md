Camera With The Flame
---------------------
Around the room I like to blossom like a difficult fragrance of strawberry.  
A current of stationary horse  
that does not know why it flows and seizes.  
In the smallest gem tiger a car is not enough to sodden me and keep me  
from the universe of your natural mysteries.  
Nothing but that sun rise of bridges.  
With its wounded awaken went magnified in kiss the femininity shakes, the branch of electric  
discovers next to.  
I wish to make a circle  
in, and every sense, many  
times hidden in a eddy.  
Sometimes a piece of the lava  
disguises like a telegraph in my eye.  
If you were not the apple the parenthetical moon  
cooks, sprinkling its peach across the sea.  
The affection plan that has everyone harsh.  
Around the marine eyeballs of the jungle.  
On what windy bloody feathers magnified with lava?  
  
The shoreline knows this,  
that life in it's emerald boxes is as endless as the foliage.  
Fewer and fewer  
brainwash about another mode of love.  
And you pampered in the anger  
and carried a taunting city.  
You say, what is the sea shell waiting for in its crimson lighthouse?  
I tell you it is waiting for poppy like you.
