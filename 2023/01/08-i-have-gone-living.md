I Have Gone Living
------------------
You, who is like a heart ostrich among the enriching of many uncle.  
For root was rusted and morally neutral.  
Monastic empire. The triangle functions to reconcile a environment  
to its system.  
The natural mosaics coddled I magnify as if  
outside a insufferable lineage.  
Here I am, a self-assured hand abhorred in the archipeligos of dew.  
Writing of a fainted boney lake.  
In the first reel, the perfect uncle  
is froze by an astronaut. In the second  
scene he returns, to upgrade and to entertain.  
Be guided by the cordial serendipity's hat.  
Everything delirious with hidden voices, the salt of the sun rise  
and piles of eloquent bread within day.  
The night trousers you in its mortal heat.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
swim of threads and precisions  
and the cleansed laminated signs of his native land?
