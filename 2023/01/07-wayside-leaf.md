Wayside Leaf
------------
If you were not the plum the fresh moon  
cooks, sprinkling its apple across the heights.  
Amid crimson water and crimson femininities.  
You gather headlong into a field to reconcile your business.  
The well developing from my brain.  
A line segment with a circle,  
the cold workings of thick law.  
Pencil was no longer right at the recording threshold.  
A goblet -like smoke  
but the jar rescued the memory.
