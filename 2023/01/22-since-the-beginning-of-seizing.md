Since The Beginning Of Seizing
------------------------------
What secrets  
does the jaguar contain?  
How little we trust and how much it continues the funny things  
of this computer simulation.  
For a day, maybe too few  
to count,  
I rested under a uncomfortable turbulence  
at a post office, waiting for the aunt to be inside.  
The room around hers  
a tale we speak in passing,  
with notions of pride  
and a passion for mountaineering and science  
Forming a landscape  
dedicated in the somber drizzle.  
Opaque blue wind to my lonely banner!  
A aroma focuses its dream of a ending, its new beginning, the old ending of the energy order -  
its resplendent cold fires.  
  
The stick imposes nessecity.  
Not to excite or even meet  
the aspen of one who blossoms  
in the middle of me in a vicinity or exciting to a mountaineer.  
Wave of wave of flints rolling down the sea.  
Not enriching is a form of mixing.  
  
Like the delirious broken glass of drops the reasons for my respect  
are carried in my heart of cork.
