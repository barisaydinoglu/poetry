Song For The Goddess Of Misunderstood Springtimes
-------------------------------------------------
In the face of so many jugulars to animosity. Shall we proceed?  
Shall we move on?  
A black and cheerless praise is abolished in the boulevard.  
In the face of so many phlegms to functionality.  
Under the guilt sea of troubled pullulation.  
Halfway.
