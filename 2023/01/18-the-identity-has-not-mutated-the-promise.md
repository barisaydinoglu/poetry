The Identity Has Not Mutated The Promise
----------------------------------------
To the celestial color of the diamond awe.  
Where trees meet  
veins meet, outside and outside and the sound  
of abberations, to reach out and promise in embarassement.  
As if to harass or form or replace.  
You are the apple of my dead hand.  
A eyelids and a fingernails  
storing the modern office.  
You set slowly into a university to pulse your business.  
  
Fly me and let my substance discover.  
What we say shines to  
entertain some other woman  
What a phenomenon may teach.
