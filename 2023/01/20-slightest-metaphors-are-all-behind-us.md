Slightest Metaphors Are All Behind Us

I stayed dawned and blue  
under the archipeligos.  
Person of the depths of my  
shoulder - your swimming  
stills your decisive regard as though it were wind.  
My heart is filled with tiredness like a fused quartz cluster.  
From ocean wave to unrelenting rain,  
hidden utensils drawn by enduring channels, a  
fire-tipped bridge begins to circumscribe.
