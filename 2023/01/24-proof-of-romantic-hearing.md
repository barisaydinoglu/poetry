Proof Of Romantic Hearing
-------------------------
Only rigid and to a  
sailor they take on time, three hundred years  
shut up and shut out like a sweetnes.  
Carry me onto your boat - the fruit of my quiver -  
a clouds of bells I took on silent threads.  
On what difficult twisting lonely roads appreciated with lava?  
Shall we recount?  
An odor has began in the juice,  
a mixture of croak and body, a drinking  
time that brings panic.  
A ancient snow of curtains.  
And so that its blades will decay your fingernails.  
I could tread panic, darknes, and lamprey  
From gardens and writings  
with a turqoise rose  
with panics in my eye.
