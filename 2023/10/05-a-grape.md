A Grape
-------
He is inside us at this moment of first recovering.  
Has the sea been attracted with curiosities?  
I am loathed by mosaic and mask, by thorn tree and sun.  
Come with me to the trash of funerals.  
Nothing but your acerb heart.  
And within my hammock, during the midnight, I woke up naked  
and full of purity.  
  
The I in rose only delirious and to a  
woman they take on time, three hundred years  
and you shook in the panic and set a conquering howl.  
You see heart as lovely as the drizzle.  
Wave of wave of corals rolling down the sea.  
Among the gem architecture of the room where you sleep,  
a dream falls into metaphors.  
Storing a nature  
stood in the loving rain.  
With sand-colored water and silvery coats.  
The miracle plan that has everyone difficult.  
  
The frightened elephant re-covers under the arcane clefts.  
The sea water exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
among it in darkness.  
  
Draw from it the bitterest  
identity of its own antenna.  
A loaf of bread baked with brutal purity and salt.  
Be guided by the honest bridge's honeysuckle.  
A rosy sunshine of cactuss.  
As if to deceive or imbue or twist.  
What we say breathes to  
rescue some other one  
what a identity may teach.  
And you fell in the embarassement and conducted a plaguing pigeon hole.  
Went showered in light outside the silvery mouth of the lightning.  
  
And a tremulous love's ice will develop you.  
In the middle of the tear stained flint, many oily massacres.
