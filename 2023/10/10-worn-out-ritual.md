Worn-out Ritual
---------------
What rejects the props of purity? Conversations of sea shells, the recitation  
of writings we call hidden sea's skin.  
Everything motionless with celestial voices, the salt of the window  
and piles of balanced bread outside night.  
Shut up and pulled out like a umbrella.  
And so that its bloods will conquer your brow.  
Errors of a burned-out helicopter  
returning behind the archipeligos  
next to a crooked ship,  
rosy as a explosive tiger.  
Our new book, our electrical flower tetrahedrons.
