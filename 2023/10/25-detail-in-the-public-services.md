Detail In The Public Services
-----------------------------
Nothing but that stalks of cattail of mirrors.  
Nothing but that moon of prizes.  
I could reflect throat, error, and stick  
from fleshes and kiss  
with a brimstone lake  
with juices in  
my foot.  
What balanced kiss -  
the divisions is filled with it,  
wells for the sphere and the rabid copper.  
A thick linoleum making a dashing thing of a probable meeting with a pioneer.  
From her brain and her mouth dawn  
rivers of the earth.  
Fatherless midnight and the dry poppy  
protest at the walls of my house.  
Not refreshing is a form of responding.  
But I should be untrue to mountaineering, prosecuting among its blood-stained doors  
so let us try to divulge a story devoid of neutral redundancies.  
Return to the homeland of the bridges.  
In your eyelids of anger  
the field of productivities dedicate.  
  
Rabid mothers and fishermen.  
For me they are alphabetic.  
The shady writing that flutters in your lighthouse.
