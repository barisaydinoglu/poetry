Breeding Starry Affection
-------------------------
With its dry weave a point of view for study is the lack thereof.  
There are many alarms behind fuming events.  
A bicycle is not enough to shatter me and keep me  
from the universe of your parenthetical phenomena.  
I do not wipe in the field of wounded acid.  
  
Nothing but your homogeneous shoulder.  
It was a boneless business of puberty and havocs.  
Not the sand-colored moment  
when the fortnight seizes the ripples.  
What delicious aspens -  
the sea is filled with it,  
beds for the coral and the barbaous diamond.
