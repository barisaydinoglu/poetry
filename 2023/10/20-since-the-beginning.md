Since The Beginning
-------------------
Pockets of steel converted into marble.  
Enjoy the many rambunctious attempts to relinquish  
the sensible rotten stump.  
There is absorbant fortune in forming it.  
In the face of so many twisting lonely roads to animosity.  
To the domestic color of the silk form.  
Sometimes a piece of the clay  
soddens like a springtime in my nose.  
Like the dry clay of chalk architectures you see heart as round as the fog.  
How promising is the steady error and it's delicious cities?  
Once there was a skeleton gentleman who  
recovered at parties, sitting in a circle, among corals.  
And the starry sky to its aroma  
and  
among the poppies the enchanting one  
the astronaut covered with resolute pencil.  
If I could flow the lineage and the university.  
Draw from it the neon  
antenna of its own metaphor.  
Always you gnaw through the early light of day  
toward the sunrise degrading kisses.  
Pure shrapnel enchants the wheatfields only troubled and to a  
lady they take on time,  
three hundred years  
daughter of the depths of my fingernails - your flying  
stills your fresh regard as though it were heat.  
A dry identity falters  
even the serene  
grammatic thicket  
in projection  
to which the metaphor  
will not be stood.  
  
Neither promise nor light nor blood colored  
nor sepia but sepia.  
You say, what is the necklace waiting for in its green smooth clay?  
I tell you it is waiting for ripple like you.  
  
Because I love you, love, among the mud and behind the wind.  
Come with me to the darknes of lampreys.
