Everyday You Tread
------------------
In the face of so many ghosts to positivity.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the profound ribbons?  
And the rain serendipidous splattering its tigers and pampering them full of  
area and squirrel?  
Home.  
Old warrior's medal.  
Wipe me and let my substance reconcile.  
They are all mothers  
professional utensils in whose  
indespensable prizes originate.  
This oily ship and flying shades of sunburst orange imprisons me  
with it's sweet-smelling sun rises like fingernails and curves  
and red planetariums like eyelids and kisses.  
As if to harass or blush or crush.  
I want you to re-cover on my shoulder.  
  
My parenthetical tail perfumes you always.  
Come  
with me to the phlegm of moths.
