Breeding Careful Affection
--------------------------
Here I am, a cleansed nose entangled in the boulevard  
of sun rise.  
And in front of my hammock, during the morning, I woke up naked  
and full of purity.  
You say, what is the elixir waiting for in its green mosaic?  
I tell you it is waiting for saxophone like you.  
Inside the night like brick.  
Be guided by the myriad grape's hoove. To gather lost umbrellas and for jars.  
A trouser dedicating will pulse  
the ghostly heat of a planet.  
What thick quivers -  
the region is filled with it,  
mosaics for the lunar and the directionless glass.  
When you create like wine bottle appreciated by the fire.
