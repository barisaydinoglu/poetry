Calculation With The Martyr
---------------------------
Dismantle me and let my substance relax.  
It was the night of the oyster.  
When you enchant like path recovered by the fire.  
It was the twilight of the bird.  
A line segment outside a line segment,  
the frail workings of incredulous law.  
I stayed upgraded and blue  
outside the divisions.  
Not the transluscent deep brown moment  
when the midnight flutters the poppies.  
The stalks of cattail chirping from my lip.  
A green magnolium conducts.  
Transparent and eloquent woman,  
  
From ray of sunlight to blade of grass,  
hidden moons drawn by indespensable channels, a  
fuming ritual begins to trust.  
Nothing but your hopeful lip.  
In the dropping legumes.  
Neither book nor serenity nor rust colored  
nor blue but cashmire.
