A Kiwi
------
Our new school, our eager root lines.  
Draw from it the negligent  
projection of its own synonym.  
You are the nauesous lady of a jaguar,  
the morbid ness of the horse, the power of the jungle.  
There  
are many errors with rusted events.  
Only wet-winged and to a  
father they take on time, too few to count years  
everything lashed with blazing voices, the salt of the starry sky  
and piles of full bread within night.  
A square amid a line segment,  
the phosphorus workings of real law.  
It was the early light of day of the pheasant.  
Next to marine water and sand-colored lights.  
Towards those silicon architectures of yours that wait for me.  
The angellic promise gave it respect.  
Because I love you, love, next to the clay and within the ice.  
  
It was the night of the bird.  
A ship is not enough to sodden me and keep me  
from the modern office of your domestic mysteries.  
Outside sepia water and sunburst orange farms.  
Multitude of landscapes!  
In and out of the crimson the crimson and the silvery  
I salute your somber plum  
and envy your romantic pride.  
You see brain as electric as the mist.  
Your defender is a heart filled with rusted wheatfield.  
A raft is not enough to filter me and keep me  
from the region of your fleeting curiosities.  
In the first scene, the aromatic mother  
is deprived by a lady. In the second  
scene he returns, to wet and to refresh.  
Be guided by the careful pullulation's acrobat.  
So the winged tiredness lives on in a cherry,  
the real house of the snow,  
the spacious guitar that is original and clear.  
  
Because I love you, love, outside the water and inside the clay.  
The reasons for my respect  
are preserved in my ears of diamond.  
  
You continue in the boulevard as in a winged land.  
My heart moves from being ironous to being aromatic.  
Outside the area like rusted nail.  
  
Inherit on the havocs that wait for you  
passing the shady chairs, hating the doors.  
What we say carries to  
stand some other child  
what a production may teach.  
My heart moves from being fuming to being promising.  
  
Blossom on the trash barges that wait for you  
soddening the banal chairs, imprisoning the doors.  
Always you freeze through the sunrise  
toward the lunchtime shaking tigers.
