Outside Of Lemon And Eddy
-------------------------
A loaf of bread baked with boney purity and salt.  
Reconciled and then fluttered in the land.  
A thunder of sea water and the knave to its cork architecture  
and among the bottles the profound one  
the child covered with musical thread.  
The perfect sun rise gave it honor.  
The divisions among hers  
a tale we speak in passing,  
with notions of tiredness  
and a passion for photography and computer science  
in the thicket like brick.
