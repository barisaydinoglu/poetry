I Have Gone Decaying
--------------------
My stationary heart conducts you always.  
A arm and a tail  
divulging the archipeligos.  
The sordid kis that  
dedicates in your bird feather.  
In my modern office  
at lunchtime you are like a lighthouse  
and your form and colour the way I rise them.  
Homogeneous empire. The line segment functions to trust a environment  
to its architecture.  
You are the grape of my absurd lip.  
Reflect on the cadavers that wait for you  
falling the fractious chairs, coagulating the doors.  
A burnt umber autumn rejoices.  
What brainwashes the props of sincerity?  
For femininity was rustling and morally neutral.  
To hear lost breakfasts and for ripples.  
Penetrate me and let my substance travel.  
What is this technique but a memory electrified of its lands?  
Like torrents puncturing next to praises.  
To seek another land your eddy is a stars in the sky filled with whirlwinds of springtime.  
  
You crystallize in  
the city as in a lyrical field.  
A light focuses its dream of a new beginning, its ending, the old ending of the cathedral order -  
its delicate errors.  
  
You protect my neurotic massacre  
like a starry crab to fresh orange.
