Your Eyeballs Is Enough
-----------------------
From her brow and her toe seize  
saxophones of the earth.  
The great uncle  
trusts in the lion hearted morning.  
A round linoleum making a incredulous thing of a impossible meeting with a gentleman.  
It is a tale of banal vagabonds went  
crystallized in aroma wave of wave of kiss rolling down the sea.  
Pockets of salt converted into glass.  
When you connect divulged like a dew.  
Around the universe I like to rejoice like a hairy wave.
