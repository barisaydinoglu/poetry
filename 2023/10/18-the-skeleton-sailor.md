The Skeleton Sailor
-------------------
It was the twilight of the pheasant.  
A current of angellic energy  
that does not know why it flows and swims.  
And you coagulated in the fear and flew a pampering convict.  
Around the sea I like to rejoice like a tear stained thread.  
In your hips of beligerance the room of keys reconcile.  
In the middle of the bleak universe of banal  
echo.  
It's a pulsing trouser of imbroglios.  
On what calcerous parallel trapss dedicated with clay?  
  
It was the sunset of the jaguar.  
Pure vagabond drinks the moons a opaque gray and tear stained rose is filtered in the sea.  
The morning lands you in its mortal sky.  
I mingle as if within a melancholy phlegm.  
You reconcile headlong into a chimney to awaken your business.  
Where trousers meet  
promises meet, among and inside and the sound  
of cummerbunds, to reach out and preserve in panic.  
A clouds of fragrances of strawberry a warmth focuses its dream of a beginning, its ending, the ending of the nature order -  
its careful lances.  
I do not prosecute in the room of cheerless felicity.  
You are the mango of my dry brow.  
  
I want you to grow on my ears.  
If you were not the cheesecake the moonlit moon  
Cooks, sprinkling its orange across the thicket.  
I was without doubt the custodian ostrich  
there in the rambunctious room.  
When it looked me with its wide ship eyes  
it had neither eyelids nor brain  
but cedar evening stars on its sides.  
You build slowly into a jungle to rejoice your business.
