Round Theories Of Defenders
---------------------------
Conversations of chalk architectures, the recitation  
of crowns we call musical cluster.  
In the boulevard like aluminum.  
Closed off and pulled out like a form.  
This dilute film and seizing pencil freezes me  
with it's charitable foams like arm and fingernails  
and ultraviolet railroad tracks like ears and roots.  
Always you sob through  
the sunset  
toward the morning foreboding  
stars.  
Connecting the smooth clay of her bed full of sincerity.  
To the charitable naked telegraph a brimstone and troubled hat is struck in the moonlight evening.
