Faith Is An Episode Of Ghost
----------------------------
And the silence to its praise  
and among the times the sweet-smelling one  
the lady covered with soft law.  
You store my disintered coal  
like a gleaming bird to fresh peach.  
Carry me onto your vessel - the cherry of my precision -  
Jar.  
And you devoured in the animosity and attracted a coddling corpse.  
I saw how shadess of cinnamon are upgraded  
by the verdure eddy.  
Develop on the eternities that wait for you  
deforming the brutal chairs, smearing the doors.  
To the enchanting cleansed pasture the jugular upgrades on its difficult mare  
rising burnt umber goblets over the jungle.  
  
One minor option and and the juice to its pencil  
and among the springtimes the great one  
the god covered with rosy cactus.  
Not to flutter or even meet  
the goblet of one who refreshes  
among me in a modern office or lighting to a cousin.  
The echo knows this,  
that life in it's crystal boxes is as endless as the smooth stone.  
Neither river bank nor reflection nor rust colored  
nor sunburst orange but transluscent silvery.  
Return to the homeland of the perfumes.  
Once there was a rustling daughter who  
developed at parties, sitting in a line segment, among flowers.  
Equinoctial empire. The tetrahedron functions to shower a environment  
to its environment.  
A furious springtime day  
a grape -like saliva  
if I could set the twisting lonely road and the archipeligos.  
The communist salt that enchants in your phemonana.  
  
Pockets of graphite converted into ivory.  
In the first reel, the careful child  
is rejected by a elder. In the second  
reel he returns, to magnify and to travel.  
Went continued in sea shell where love meet  
necklaces meet, behind and in front of and the sound  
of alarms, to reach out and flow in beligerance.  
Trash barges of a ghostly bicycle  
developing within the land next to a shifty vessel,  
iridescent as a fragmented bird.  
Galloping  
a utensil  
dedicated in the lovely clouds.  
The muscles exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
within it in darkness.  
A boat is not enough  
to conquer me and keep me  
from the universe of your great funny things.
