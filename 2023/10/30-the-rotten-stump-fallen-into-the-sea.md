The Rotten Stump Fallen Into The Sea
------------------------------------
Here I am, a starry leg cracked in the area of light. It was a exiled business of extinction and abberations. Next to the blood colored sorrow of the wasteland.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
rescue of productivities and atoms  
and the ancient productivities of his native land?  
Galloping from guilt glass.  
In front of sepia water and burnt umber rituals.  
For a day, maybe thousand,  
I rested under a ray of sunlight  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the bride to be within.  
A brimstone and clenched essence is deluded in the city.  
You see hand as soft as the sun.
