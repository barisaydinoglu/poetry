Song For The Mountaineer Of Burned-out Magnoliums
-------------------------------------------------
Neither splendor nor flower nor dull shades of marine  
nor sand-colored but transparent. You are the cherry of my thirsty brow.  
A quilt -like extinction  
and a muzzled elixir's jungle will reflect you.  
I want you to pacify on my ears.  
The putrid toucan relaxes under the sensual felicities.  
  
Conversations of crowns, the recitation  
of telegraphs we call domestic tree.  
To the serene fleeting springtime carry me onto your ship - the fruit of my grace -
