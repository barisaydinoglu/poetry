Rusted Breakfast
----------------
Creating toward the cluster embarassement and fragrance of strawberry - reflections of animosity. I want you to rustle on my hips.  
Nothing but your clear eyelids.  
I grow as if next to a forceful thorn tree.  
In your hand of animosity the boulevard of railroad tracks chirp.  
The vicinity amid hers  
a history we tell in passing,  
with notions of honor  
and a passion for photography and engineering  
The neurotic time that flows in your sweetnes.  
Perfume on the brambles that wait for you  
coagulating the clenched chairs, overflowing the doors.  
Indespensable empire. The triangle functions to appreciate a environment  
to its architecture.
