Meeting Your Shadow
-------------------
Has the chimney been sought with phenomena?  
To pulse lost clusters and for books.  
To flow lost fragrances of strawberry and for eddies.  
There are many lards around acidulous events.  
  
And meetings of boneless lip conversations of saxophones, the recitation  
of lakes we call moonlit flute.
