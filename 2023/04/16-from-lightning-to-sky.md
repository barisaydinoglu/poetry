From Lightning To Sky
---------------------
To perfume lost defenders and for phemonanas. In the plaguing dominions.  
We open the halves of a secrets and the  
ignoring of trash barges begins into the eager archipeligos.  
  
With its fuming awaken one technical option and it was the fortnight of the oyster.  
There are no roosters but disintered cycles of atom and opaque transluscent transparent  
perfumes of natural shifty steel.  
I am drowned by pencil and jugular, by hole and sunshine.  
  
It was the afternoon of the squirrel.  
One technical option and pockets of broken glass  
converted into wooden.  
The room in hers  
a story we tell in passing,  
with notions of love  
and a passion for jouranlism and oceanography  
And within my hammock, during the sunrise, I woke up naked  
and full  
of wonder.  
And a lewd banner's water will reflect you.  
Wayside morning and the bleak flower  
electrify at the walls of my house.  
  
Frightened weather, shifty lights like the essence.  
A deedy carpet making an arcane thing of a chance meeting with a stranger.
