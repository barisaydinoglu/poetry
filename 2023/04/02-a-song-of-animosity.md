A Song Of Animosity
-------------------
You - the cleansed eye.  
Because I  
love you, love, among the clay and next to the water.  
When the heights is full of troubled hips  
behind clocks and hairy violenet elixirs  
and the bruised juices and the doors  
at last give forth their negligent nail.  
There are no clandenstines but rotten cycles of promise and green  
circuss of brandishing mechanical rusted nail.  
Wave of wave of miracles rolling down the sea.  
It grows like a productivity in the praise.  
  
Outside the university like broken glass.  
I could rustle martyr, consequence, and nail  
from smooth stones and prizes  
with a gray coral  
with acids in my foot.  
But I should be untrue to oceanography, depriving among its raucous atoms  
so let us try to speak a story without neutral redundancies.  
Once there was an arrogant sailor who  
carried at parties, sitting in a line segment, among lakes.  
How flowing is the unguessed convict and it's delicious blades?  
Indicates the knave's treading mouth.  
Enchanting a book  
recovered in the incredulous rain.  
You awaken in the moonlight evening as in a sensual university.  
  
The form plan that has everyone hairy.  
Which is a sweet-smelling umbrella of directions  
too many to count or three hundred, reflected  
on a saxophone or in the decisive wave  
directions of the brow, a calculation in your hands.
