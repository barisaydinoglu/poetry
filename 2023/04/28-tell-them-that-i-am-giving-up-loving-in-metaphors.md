Tell Them That I Am Giving Up Loving In Metaphors
-------------------------------------------------
Only leaf, just the  
lunar, nothing but  
it. Affection. You are the lemon of my tear stained hips.  
Some begin but I mingle your steel like candle.  
  
When you set wetted like a evening star.  
He is inside us  
at this moment of first perching.
