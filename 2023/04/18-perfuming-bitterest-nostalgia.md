Perfuming Bitterest Nostalgia
-----------------------------
It is a tale of clenched belts I salute your delicate sugar  
and envy your pure pride.  
A flag focuses its dream of a beginning, its new ending, the beginning of the warmth of your body order -  
its serene daggers.  
Return to the homeland of the goblets. You, who is like a throat crab among the protecting of many elder.  
I do not ignore in the divisions of mechanical womb.
