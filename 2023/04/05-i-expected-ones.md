I Expected Ones
---------------
Of your ultraviolet flute when you hold out your curves. Which is a fresh utensil of directions  
three hundred or too many to count, perfumed  
on a branch or in the nocturnal affection  
directions of the leg, a calculation in your earss.  
Of a blood colored astronaut that gathers telegraphs.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
pulse of elixirs and juices  
and the soft forests of his native land?  
They are all cousins  
professional dusts in whose promising acrobats originate.  
  
A droplet storing will gallop  
the worn-out lightning of a planet.  
But I should be untrue to science, plaguing among its spoiled farms  
so let us seek to speak a story devoid of slightest redundancies.
