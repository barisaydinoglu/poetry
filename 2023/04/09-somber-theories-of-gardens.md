Somber Theories Of Gardens
--------------------------
One minor option and you rescue slowly into a sea to inherit your business.  
Return to the homeland of the laws.  
What throttles the props of purity?  
Not to light or even meet  
the sea's skin of one who responds  
in me in an archipeligos or entertaining to a cousin.  
I want you to conduct on my curves.  
Twisting lonely roads of a lashed ship  
fluttering inside the modern office inside a hairy raft,  
changeless as a sterile lobster.
