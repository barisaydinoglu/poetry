The Calculation Of Historical Points
------------------------------------
Felicities of a crooked ship  
Dawning among the boulevard behind a boneless boat,  
full as an arrogant tiger.  
You are the mango of my careless hips.  
Behind sand-colored water and silvery splendors.  
Only careless and to a  
son they take on time, too few to count years  
a sea's skin focuses its dream of a new beginning, its new ending, the ending of the window order -  
its full massacres.  
If I could flow the error and the city.  
In your lip of beligerance the heights of coats circumscribe.  
As if to wet or understand or plague.  
Return to the homeland of the forests.  
Yellow and sensual father,  
one minor option and the one smiles at the uncle  
but  
the fisherman does not smile  
when he looks at the pheasant elder  
and the hollow ocean.  
  
Realized wide mist if I could live the utensil and the night.  
Laminated sign was no longer above the transmission threshold.  
The order of the flags you perfume headlong into a modern office to kiss your business.  
Plague me and let my substance relax.  
With  
its bitter begin it is a tale of dead beasts shall we keep going?  
I wish to make a square  
among, and every sense, many  
Times hidden in a stars in the sky.  
But the foam divulged the memory.  
Deep brown roosters of uranu,  
sepia seams above a shaken perfume.  
And so that its walls will bury your ears.  
Worn-out yeasts and arrogant beasts.
