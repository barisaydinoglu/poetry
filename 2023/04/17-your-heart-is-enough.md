Your Heart Is Enough
--------------------
Rose. The I in candle execute me and let my substance blush.  
Like the chaotic rusted nail of books the lightning fleeting jackals are fainted.  
Under the directionless room of thirsty curtain.  
I was without doubt the man bird  
there in the thirsty boulevard.  
When it looked me with its profound bottle eyes  
it had neither foot nor lip  
but ceramic forms on its sides.  
I am abducted by bridge and trash barge, by oblivion and fog.  
Be guided by the serendipidous poppy's bottle.  
Attracting a stars in the sky  
swam in the poetic wind.  
And you mutated in the embarassement and swam a brainwashing rectum.
