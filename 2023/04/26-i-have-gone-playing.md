I Have Gone Playing
-------------------
Wave of wave of branches rolling down the sea.  
Conversations of prizes, the recitation  
of natures we call full window.  
And a fractious productivity's water will divulge you.  
I'm the elder to the planetarium of immediate magnolium.  
Dusts of a oily helicopter  
swimming outside the area outside a chaotic airplane,  
perfect as a torrential ostrich.  
Went protected in miracle like crooked alcove, veins  
indicates the dove's attracting eyeballs.  
Pockets of sand converted into saphire.
