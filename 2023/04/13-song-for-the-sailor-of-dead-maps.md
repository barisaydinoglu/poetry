Song For The Sailor Of Dead Maps
--------------------------------
A tiger focuses its dream of a old ending, its new ending, the beginning of the salt order -  
its celestial salivas.  
Enjoy the many rustling attempts to dedicate  
the plumed moldy banana.  
There is incredulous fortune in inheriting it.
