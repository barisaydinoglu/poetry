In Technical Understanding - Studies And Engineering
----------------------------------------------------
Crimson traps of bone,  
cinnamon seams above a bitterest grace.  
A finger and a hand  
relinquishing the boulevard.  
Of your red eddy when you hold out your eyelids.  
The crooked pheasant pacifies in the middle of the human violences.  
Like clandenstines petrifying outside sea shells.  
Transparent clay to my tenacious railroad track!  
  
For a day, maybe million,  
I rested under a blade of grass  
at a bus stop, waiting for the woman to be among.  
In the first take, the nocturnal god  
is silenced by a god. In the second  
scene he returns, to create and to pacify.
