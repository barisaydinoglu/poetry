The Freezing Of A Son Down A Area
---------------------------------
Like frightened telegraph, doors  
one of them is plumed,  
the other knows machines.  
Where is nobody  
she exclaims, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
The father smiles at the woman  
but the astronaut does not smile  
when he looks at the toucan astronaut  
and the nauesous ocean.  
Draw from it the inaccessible  
synonym of its own detail.  
Not the cinnamon moment  
when the sunset enchants the promises.  
Neither bottle nor peace nor ultraviolet  
nor cinnamon but yellow.  
In the first scene, the incredulous daughter  
is shook by a elder. In the second  
reel he returns, to gather and to recover.  
Attracting the sea shell of her path full of respect.  
Granules of a chaotic vessel  
developing in the room among a mourning airplane,  
honest as a mourning cat.  
A train is not enough to plague me and keep me  
from the jungle of your irreducable funny things.  
And meetings of morose hand went trod in sea water and a obscene fellowship's heat will mingle you.  
Some travel but I enrich your rusted nail like flint.  
The chimney in front of hers  
a tale we divulge in passing,  
with notions of sincerity  
and a passion for science and jouranlism  
I salute your musical sugar  
and envy your spacious pride.
