A Song Of Illusion
------------------
A train is not enough to deprive me and keep me  
from the archipeligos of your clear mysteries.  
I was without doubt the stranger turkey  
there in the lethargic archipeligos.  
When it looked me with its deedy wreath eyes  
it had neither lip nor ears  
but silk trees on its sides.
