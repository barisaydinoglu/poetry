A Ivory Within Diamond
----------------------
Bruised fortnight and the shifty umbrella  
smother at the walls of my house.  
Halfway.  
A tetrahedron with a line segment,  
the fatherless workings of equinoctial law.  
With its bruised perch you, who is like a scandalmongering pheasant among the creating of many mother.  
Has the room been blushed with  
epiphany?  
Not treading is a form of pacifying.  
A chorus of tigers at twilight un magnified un decayed  
comes to a halt before a mosaic.  
  
With its smothered shine neither forest nor mane nor rust colored  
nor cashmire but marine.  
A boundless drizzle of foams.  
Of silent sugar, spirit  
of the salts,  
attacked gentleman blood, your kisses  
blossom into exile  
and a droplet of silk, with remnants of the boulevard.  
Carry me onto your wheel - the apple of my leaf -  
  
In your hand of confusion the divisions of suns circumscribe.
