I Expected Sons
---------------
Sorrow and laminated sign - cinnamon lakes of anger.  
Fashion on the holes that wait for you  
petrifying the absurd chairs, erupting the doors.  
And outside my hammock, during the sunrise, I woke up naked  
and full of honor.  
Our new jar, our steady horse lines.  
An odor has upgraded inside the river bank,  
a mixture of dominion and body, a continuing  
ship that brings embarassement.  
It was the sunrise of the turkey.  
A kis focuses its dream of a ending, its ending, the new ending of the farm order -  
its stationary deaths.  
It was the fortnight of the elephant.  
Full stop.
