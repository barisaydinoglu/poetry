It Continued With Elixirs
-------------------------
Wave of wave of utensils rolling down the sea. Be guided by the secure light's tree.  
Outside the tremulous room of rigid femininity.  
Round, diamond jar!  
The jungle soft billows of dark smoke are plagued.  
From unrelenting rain to blade of grass,  
hidden crowns drawn by humble channels, a  
bruised well begins to drink.  
The melancholy pheasant rescues  
inside the full evils.  
  
Loathe me and let my substance tread.  
Our new knave, our boundless dove quadrangles.  
  
In your lip of freezing the field begins to dream of developing.
