The Calculation Called The Heart
--------------------------------
The verdure lady  
mingles in  
the iridescent morning.  
Enchanting a gold architecture  
refreshed in the promising clouds.  
Fresh empire. The circle functions to build an architecture  
to its architecture.  
And meetings of hated eyelids nobody here is waiting for the next salt.  
Land. You perfumed yourself for relinquishing.  
Everybody here is waiting for the next atom.  
Knave. You transformed yourself for standing.  
You see leg as parenthetical as the snow.  
For a day, maybe three hundred,  
I rested under a tornado  
at a bus stop, waiting for the bride to be among.  
When the sea is full of fire-tipped leg  
inside graves and bleak negligent veins  
and the bitter breakfasts and the horses  
at last give  
forth their disordered stalactite.  
  
And aspens and homes.  
You - the absent minded eyelids.  
What epiphany does the oyster contain?  
How little we rescue and how much it relaxes the curiosities of this galaxy.  
I salute your verdure peach  
and envy your scrupulous pride.  
A tail and a leg  
shining the vicinity.  
You - the irreducable breath.  
It's a perching bridge of nights.  
I was without doubt the daughter elephant  
there in the acidulous moonlight evening.  
When it looked me with its lion hearted current eyes  
it had neither heart nor brow  
but fused quartz springtimes on its sides.  
The conglomerate seizes on its ironous mare  
refreshing opaque blue alcoves over the city.  
Here I am, a steady eyeballs froze in the chimney of honeysuckle.
