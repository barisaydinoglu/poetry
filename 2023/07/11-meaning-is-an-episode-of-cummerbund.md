Meaning Is An Episode Of Cummerbund
-----------------------------------
Fewer and fewer  
mutate about another mode of felicity.  
Has the vicinity been divulged with epiphany?  
You are the barbaous elder of a crab,  
the shady ness of the praise, the power of the wind.  
How responding is the pure lineage and it's arcane serections?  
Our new light, our ancient defender lines.  
It was a wayside business of lightning and clefts.  
The sensible dignity of the planetarium!  
So the resplendent purity lives on in a fruit,  
the scrupulous house of the elixir,  
the myriad grape that is secure and equinoctial.  
Like the shaken clay of railroad tracks conversations of laws, the recitation  
of love we call serendipidous farm.  
There are no conspirators but communist cycles of tree and marine  
candles of angellic guilt brick.
