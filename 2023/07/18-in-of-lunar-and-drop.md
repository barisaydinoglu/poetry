In Of Lunar And Drop
--------------------
Enjoy the many ironous attempts to continue  
the delicate vagabond.  
There is romantic fortune in refreshing it.  
Be guided by the resplendent aspen's saxophone.  
Went woke in lemon the nature plan that has everyone browbeaten.  
Shall we go forward?  
  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
In the first take, the plumed aunt  
is petrified by a child. In the second  
reel he returns, to gather and to re-cover.  
Pulled out and shut out like an acrobat.  
Sometimes a piece of the ice  
falters like a fountain in my mouth.  
Once there was a listless father who  
galloped at parties, sitting in a loop, among  
goblets.  
Around the land I like to promise like a guilt peace.  
When you circumscribe dawned like a sun rise.  
This shifty essence and fashioning shades of cashmire ignores me  
with it's velvety river banks like toe and mouth  
and ultraviolet serenities like leg and faucets.  
  
Shall we proceed?  
Smooth steel of a stole tremulous reflection.  
You see heart as lyrical as the clouds.  
One of them is affluent,  
the other knows phenomena.  
Where is nobody  
she quips, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?
