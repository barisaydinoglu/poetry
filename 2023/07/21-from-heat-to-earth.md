From Heat To Earth
------------------
You say, what is the nature waiting for in its burnt umber branch?  
I tell you it is waiting for fellowship like you.  
Pockets of aluminum converted into glass.  
Silent afternoon and the lewd crown  
plague at the walls of my house.  
A quadrangle among a line,  
the sticky workings of arcane law.  
  
But the autumn imbued the memory.  
In the face of so many conglomerates to animosity.  
Within the quiver of the moonlight  
evening where you sleep,  
a dream undulates into calculations.  
Nothing but that propeller of foams.
