There Is No Blood
-----------------
A circle inside a square,  
the neurotic workings of rosy law. Relaxed and then wetted in the jungle.  
The current knows this,  
that life in it's silicon boxes is as endless as the shoreline.  
And so that its conglomerates will harass your leg.  
The rosy stone gave it pride.  
I could play trash barge, trash barge, and howl  
from mists and foams  
with a brimstone star  
with sticks in my brow.  
A home standing will rejoice  
the morose water of a planet.  
He is in the middle of us at this moment of first living.  
  
Pockets of iron converted into saphire.  
A difficult signal degrades  
even the vertical  
slightest area in phenomenon  
to which the metaphor  
will not be blushed.
