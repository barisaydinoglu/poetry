A Kiwi
------
To tread lost roots and for pencils.  
It is a tale of worn-out croaks  
neither flower nor flint nor gray  
nor green but transparent.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
tread of pencils and umbrellas  
and the lovely landscapes of his native land?  
As soon as the incoming schools  
gives the public indication.  
A loaf of bread baked with demonic wonder and salt.  
In your hips of panic the chimney of alcoves blush.  
Sometimes a piece of the lava  
loiters like a path in my eyeballs.  
And you perfume like a echo and to make lost bells and for sea shells.  
Nothing but your electrical eye.  
And among my hammock, during the late afternoon, I woke up  
naked  
and full of pride.  
I want you to seek on my tail.  
Be guided by the blazing essence's law.  
Halfway.
