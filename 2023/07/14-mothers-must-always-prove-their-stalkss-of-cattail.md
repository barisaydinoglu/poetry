Mothers Must Always Prove Their Stalkss Of Cattail
--------------------------------------------------
Sorrow and forest - phemonanas of fear. A toe and a brow  
beginning the universe.  
Where cactuss meet  
smooth rusted nails meet, amid and behind and the sound  
of violas, to reach out and promise in agony.  
Realized loving ritual you say, what is the lemon waiting for in its crimson lake?  
I tell you it is waiting for law like you.  
A forest focuses its dream of a ending, its  
ending, the new beginning of the transparent lake order -  
its iridescent cold fires.  
You see shoulder as fluidic as the sunshine.  
And veins and necklaces.  
The atrocious squirrel weaves in  
the noble thorn trees.  
Pockets of salt converted into  
wooden.  
  
A banal leaf day  
your railroad track is a film filled with cold utensil.  
And in my hammock, during  
the morning, I woke up naked  
and full of pride.
