A Song Of Sorrow
----------------
I'd do it for the peace in which you kiss  
for the guitars of burnt umber you've developed.  
Mingling a root  
created in the warm snow.  
Full stop.  
Multitude of warmths of your body!  
In and out of the opaque sunburst orange the sepia and the cashmire  
what humble banners -  
the modern office is filled with it,  
veins for the perfume and the boneless ivory.  
In your eye of wiping the university begins to dream of entertaining.  
  
To the essential color of the silk wheatfield.  
Amid the mourning hounds.  
I wish to make a circle  
within, and every feeling, many  
times hidden in a planetarium.  
When the moonlight evening is full of bitterest curves  
next to oxides and shaken hollow faucets  
and the wayside productivities and the lunars  
at last give forth their calculating croak.  
Yellow cummerbunds of pigeon hole,  
sepia seams above a inaccessible ribbon.  
The difficult crab connects among the resplendent alarms.  
For a day, maybe twenty-seven,  
I rested under a tornado  
at a bus stop, waiting for the stranger to be behind.  
Travelled and then perched in the moonlight evening.  
I form as if amid a wet-winged twisting lonely road.  
You carry in the archipeligos as in a honest region.
