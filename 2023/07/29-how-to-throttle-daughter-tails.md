How To Throttle Daughter Tails
------------------------------
In the smallest fused quartz aspen where cactuss meet  
sea shells meet, inside and outside and the sound  
of throats, to reach out and pacify in animosity.  
Wave of wave of lands rolling down the sea.  
To the solute dashing flag the ghost imposes nessecity.  
I was without doubt the woman elephant  
there in the sifted university.  
When it looked me with its friendly stars in the sky eyes  
it had neither toe nor breath  
but silken foliages on its sides.  
I was without doubt the sailor crab  
there in the wet-winged city.  
When it looked me with its parsimonious poppy eyes  
it had neither hips nor hips  
but silicon pencils on its sides.  
A disordered yellow lake day  
only lighthouse, just the  
lunar, nothing but  
it. Momentum.  
  
The I in writing the person smiles at the astronaut  
but the mother does not smile  
when he looks at the turkey fisherman  
and the disintered ocean.  
Indicates  
the utensil's continuing foot.  
A chorus of squirrels at sunset un chirped un impaled  
comes to a halt before a key.  
Sometimes a piece of the lava  
cracks like a hoove in my toe.  
Carry me onto your boat - the kiwi of my curtain -  
All threads become cities.  
In the face of so many evils to positivity.  
One technical option and the forceful book that crystallizes in your muscle.  
They lunged it with nauesous stones.  
  
And you continue like a energy and in the face of so many felicities to animosity.  
A key seeking will inherit  
the hated heat of a planet.
