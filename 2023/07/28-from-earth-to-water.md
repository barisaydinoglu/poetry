From Earth To Water
-------------------
A calculation upgrades,  
condemns - it does not return.  
And the sea shell to its serenity  
and among the friendships the domestic one  
the cousin covered with friendly jar.  
Delude me and let my substance blossom.  
The love shatters, the smooth stone of cordial  
enchants next to.
