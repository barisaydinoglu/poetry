There Is No Scandalmongering
----------------------------
What coagulates  
the props of decency?  
To fashion lost ribbons and for candles.  
It is a tale of disordered eternities  
my thick eyeballs inherits you always.  
In my city at night you are like a light  
and your form and colour the way I  
connect them.  
Clear empire. The loop functions to blush a environment  
to its system.  
Only cathedral, just the  
echo, nothing but  
it. Candle.  
How flowing is the slender violence and it's hopeful shadows?  
To the arcane homogeneous fragrance of strawberry I could breathe alarm, lineage, and vinegar  
from trees and trysts  
with a blood colored quilt  
with vortices in my eye.
