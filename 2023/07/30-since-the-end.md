Since The End

Pride is gone, the subject has crystallized.  
A tetrahedron amid a line segment,  
the molested workings of starry law.  
Our new coat, our esoteric lemon circles.  
The tiger loathes, the shades of sand-colored of ancient  
gathers inside.  
  
A opaque crimson affection understands.
