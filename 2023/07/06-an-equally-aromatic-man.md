An Equally Aromatic Man
-----------------------
Return to the homeland of the keys. It was a frightened business of hole and jackals.  
Shut up and closed off like a transluscent blue lake.  
Brings all the strikes salts.  
I took on bitterest bells.  
Nothing but that starry sky of lunars.  
What we say rises to  
live some other goddess  
what a sequence may teach.  
A metaphor for detail is the lack thereof.  
I was without doubt the mountaineer lobster  
there in the callous modern office.  
When it looked me with its winged echo eyes  
it had neither ears nor leg  
but chalk warmths of your body on its sides.  
If I could refresh the cold fire and the divisions.  
In your heart  
of panic the modern office of starry skies flutter.  
A equinoctial sunshine of energies.  
  
On what furious belts conducted with heat?  
In your finger of panic the jungle of laws discover.  
  
And so that its blades will gnaw your heart.
