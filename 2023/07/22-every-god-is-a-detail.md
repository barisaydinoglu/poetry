Every God Is A Detail
---------------------
Because I love you, love, in front of the sky and in  
the sky. The bitter rose that plays in your essence.  
Indicates the lemon's enchanting mouth.  
Pulled out and shut out like a kiss.  
This parched crimson lake and perfuming warmth of your body silences me  
with it's fleeting banners like ears and brow  
and blood colored rivers like breath and forms.  
The daughter smiles at the elder  
But the gentleman does not smile  
when he looks at the bird custodian  
and the boney ocean.  
Loving a book  
reflected in the silent drizzle.  
The naked precisions buried she is under us at this moment of first playing.  
Next to the cashmire shoulder of the wind.
