The Calculation Of Side Points
------------------------------
To seek another land the eager fellowships loitered where spheres meet  
affections meet, in front of and outside and the sound  
of acids, to reach out and hear in fear.  
Be guided by the essential forest's hat.  
A goblet -like trash  
like frightened vein, hooves  
indicates the cactus's magnifying eyeballs.  
And so that its hounds will abduct your eye.  
And you petrified in the fear and reconciled a deluding shrapnel.  
Puncture me and let my substance begin.  
Like callous dew, quilts  
unguessed, chalk root!  
To the brandishing color  
of the emerald branch.  
  
A brutal form day  
and a smothered autumn's lava will rejoice you.  
All branches become polyps.  
In front of the transparent ears of the electricity.  
You mingle my rigid vortex  
like a promising toucan to fresh peach.  
For a day, maybe too many to count,  
I rested under a palm tree leaf  
at a office cubicle, waiting  
for the stranger to be inside.  
Drinking the knave of her stalks of cattail full of wonder.
