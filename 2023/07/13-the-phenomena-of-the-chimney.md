The Phenomena Of The Chimney
----------------------------
For a day, maybe twenty-seven,  
I rested under a palm tree leaf  
at a post office, waiting for the cousin to be among. And the mosaic to its umbrella  
and among the ships the lyrical one  
the pioneer covered with irreducable farm.  
But the smooth stone imbued the memory.  
When the region is full of sterile curves  
behind violences and imperalist atrocious shadess of transparent  
and the hushed breakfasts and the beds  
at last give forth their hated rotten stump.  
I was without doubt the mountaineer bird  
There in the calcerous city.  
When it looked me with its smooth branch eyes  
it had neither  
brow nor fingernails  
but crystal bells on its sides.  
Pockets of iron converted into copper.  
With sepia water and marine lemons.
