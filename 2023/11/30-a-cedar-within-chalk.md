A Cedar Within Chalk
--------------------
Not rejoicing is a form of creating.  
Boundless, copper aroma!  
Draw from it the bitten  
camera of its  
own machine.  
Building from listless chalk.  
Your brow awakens from south to north  
you are the grape of my hushed eyelids.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.
