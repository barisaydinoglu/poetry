The Curiosities Of The Jungle
-----------------------------
I salute your aquatic wine  
and envy your secure pride.  
The wave mingles in lighting your toe.  
Decency is gone, the subject has created.  
My heart moves from being melancholy to being sensual.  
Like harsh breakfast, peaces  
and gardens and doors.  
School.  
  
And so that its bloods will scratch your ears.  
A breath and a finger  
returning the region.
