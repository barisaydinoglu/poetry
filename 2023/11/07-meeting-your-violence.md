Meeting Your Violence
---------------------
Your umbrella is a splendor filled with rigid lunar. For a day, maybe too few to count,  
I rested under a ocean wave  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the custodian to be inside.  
The manly rivers conquered  
crystallize on the self-productions that wait for you  
bristling the violenet chairs, coagulating the doors.  
My heart is filled with pride like a cork hat.  
Breathing a kis  
attracted in the homogeneous mist.  
Of a opaque red fisherman that continues ribbons.  
The foliages exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
next to it in darkness.  
Against the ironous region of shady guitar.  
What is this projection but a memory chained of its evening stars?  
I could perch granule, evil, and granule  
from pullulations and green cars  
with a red river bank  
with howls in my mouth.
