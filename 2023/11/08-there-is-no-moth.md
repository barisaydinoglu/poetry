There Is No Moth
----------------
I wish to make a loop  
outside, and every abstraction, many  
times hidden in a mist.  
Only perfume, just the  
writing, nothing but  
it. Apple.  
Next to the changing pigeon holes.  
You make headlong into a chimney to rustle your business.  
Like shadows dying in front of manes.  
When you seize like elixir upgraded by the fire.
