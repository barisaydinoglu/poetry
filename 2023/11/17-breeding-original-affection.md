Breeding Original Affection
---------------------------
To flow lost productivities and for droplets. If I could preserve the havoc and the city.  
Everything delirious with friendly voices, the salt of the grape  
and piles of lion hearted bread inside morning.  
  
Behind silvery water and transparent praises.
