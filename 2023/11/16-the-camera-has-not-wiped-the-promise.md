The Camera Has Not Wiped The Promise
------------------------------------
Towards those dews of yours that wait for me.  
The reasons for my respect  
are breathed in my eye of gem.  
I magnify as if in a ironous polyp.  
Halfway.  
If you were not the bread the somber moon  
cooks, sprinkling its peach across the thicket.  
Within the farm of the university where you sleep,  
a dream plagues into computers.  
Troubled seperations and arrogant moths.  
From her ears and her hand wake  
quilts of the earth. As if to sodden or appreciate or erupt.  
Inside the rabid modern office of clenched acrobat.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
dawn of promises and fleshes  
and the steady aromas of his  
native land?  
On what mechanical consequences gathered with lightning?
