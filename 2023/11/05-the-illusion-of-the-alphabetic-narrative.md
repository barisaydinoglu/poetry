The Illusion Of The Alphabetic Narrative
----------------------------------------
A parched foam day  
awakened and then wove in the area.  
There ought to be a flute of a honest warmth of your body mixing in a universe.  
A chorus of squirrels at sunrise un lived un changed  
comes to a halt before a crown.  
The fellowship expands in loving your arm.  
In the face of so many receptacles to animosity.  
One technical option and here I am, a homogeneous nose harassed in the sea of ribbon.  
Father of the depths of my leg - your pulsing  
stills your equinoctial regard as though it were ice.
