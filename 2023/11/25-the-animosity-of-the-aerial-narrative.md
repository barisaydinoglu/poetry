The Animosity Of The Aerial Narrative
-------------------------------------
A loaf of bread baked with parched tiredness and salt.  
Once there was a wet-winged pioneer who  
shone at parties, sitting in a line, among waves.  
It's a relaxing umbrella  
of circumstances.  
A triangle within a square,  
the lashed workings of winged law.  
One slightest option and everything tear stained with aquatic voices, the salt of the bell  
and piles of verdure bread outside morning.  
Be guided by the serendipidous quiver's foliage.  
Draw from it the negligent  
camera of its own point of view.  
In the first take, the thick mountaineer  
is throttled by a mountaineer. In the second  
scene he returns, to transform and to pacify.
