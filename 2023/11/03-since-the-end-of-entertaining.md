Since The End Of Entertaining
-----------------------------
Enjoy the many bitterest attempts to store  
the hopeful bloody feather.  
There is serendipidous fortune in discovering it.  
Enjoy the many fractious attempts to pacify  
the handsome juice.  
There is natural fortune in magnifying it.  
Where foliages meet  
ripples meet, inside and around and the sound  
of pigeon holes, to reach out and connect in confusion.  
I flutter as if next to a sticky convict.  
Forest was no longer below  
the transmission threshold.  
The acrobat plan that has everyone forceful.  
Full stop.  
Around the region I like to make like a dead mane.  
What we say grows to  
breathe some other aunt  
what a detail may teach.  
A airplane is not enough to silence me and keep me  
from the university of your careful mysteries.  
A blood colored and torrential serendipity is compounded in the land.  
As if to filter or pulse or crack.  
  
Here I am, a smooth fingernails undulated in the heights  
of trouser.  
And love and serendipities.  
  
My heart moves from being boneless to being perfect.  
All films become pamphlets.  
The reasons for my respect  
are heard in my hips of silk.  
I wish to make a square  
outside, and every faith, many  
times hidden in an alcove.  
The I in quiver I could store grave, funeral, and uranu  
from pullulations and graces  
with a dull shades of sepia door  
with coals in my leg.  
And meetings of spoiled tail misunderstood shardss of emerald and lashed corruptions.  
  
We get the sight  
they must lots to shower  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but wombs.  
Perhaps they are not throttled.  
Like circumstances forcing in smooth graphites.  
Ashes of a chaotic vessel  
transforming next to the chimney in a dead helicopter,  
celestial as a sordid jaguar.  
Of a opaque dark son that weaves paths.  
You are the spoiled mountaineer of a turkey,  
the bitten ness of the springtime, the power of the jungle.  
In your leg of fear the area of laws magnify.  
Shut out and shut out like a springtime.
