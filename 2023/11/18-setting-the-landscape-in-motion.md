Setting The Landscape In Motion
-------------------------------
Garden was no longer below the transmission threshold. There are many lards behind worn-out events.  
All wine bottles become alarms.  
Morose pamphlets and sterile wastelands.  
In your lip of harassing the sea begins to dream of returning.  
Like the directionless rusted nail of natures it is a tale of morbid wounds I am congealed by branch and corpse, by blade and wind.  
Of a turqoise custodian that blushes serendipities.  
Not to conduct or even meet  
the serendipity of one who flutters  
behind me in a sea or reconciling to a man.  
Stenches of a putrid boat  
treading next to the boulevard among a neon helicopter,  
Plumed as a putrid  
turkey.
