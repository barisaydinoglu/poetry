Since The Beginning Of Refreshing
---------------------------------
A key -like trapdoor  
went crystallized in maternity the starlight dawning from my eyelids.  
There are no wounds but rigid cycles of movie and green  
forms of verdure tear stained steel.  
Outside the puncturing nails.  
To the rosy color of the silk law.  
Halfway.  
My brandishing foot lights you always.  
My heart is filled with honor like a fused quartz hoove.
