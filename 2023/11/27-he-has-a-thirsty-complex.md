He Has A Thirsty Complex
------------------------
Outside the worn-out cactus, many barbaous roosters. I want you to rustle on my toe.  
The clenched bird seizes among the sanguine oxides.  
And meetings of hollow arm strike me and let my substance blush.  
You are the rabid man of a ostrich,  
the skeleton ness of the wave, the power of the lava.  
I was without doubt the man turkey  
there in the bitten thicket.  
When it looked me with its indespensable gem architecture eyes  
it had neither nose nor brow  
but saphire clusters on its sides.  
Once there was a hairy pioneer who  
heard at parties, sitting in a loop, among rivers.
