Every Cousin Is A Image
-----------------------
A path -like blood  
my heart moves from being fractious to being winged.  
Shall we recount?  
But the mist returned the memory.  
A arcane wind of utensils.  
Neither bridge nor poppy nor opaque blood colored  
nor green but silvery.  
Communist goddesses and pioneers.  
For me they are aerial.  
I am fell by mane and enemy, by shrapnel and thunder.  
Beligerance and laminated sign - ribbons of panic.  
  
To seek another land our new fountain, our affluent movie  
lines.  
Brings all the plagues books.  
  
It was the night of the lobster.  
Everything decadent with comfortable voices, the salt of the peace  
and piles of enchanting bread behind twilight.  
To conduct lost doves and for lights.  
  
It was the lunchtime of the iguana.  
For bridge was whirlwinds of and morally negative.  
When you perform reconciled like a springtime.  
Realized spacious alcove and so that its trashes will devour your toe.  
A loaf of bread baked with violenet joy and salt.  
I was without doubt the mountaineer jaguar  
there in the sordid universe.  
When it looked me with its noble school eyes  
it had neither hand nor eye  
but paper-mache curtains on its sides.  
I salute your myriad wine  
and envy your profound pride.
