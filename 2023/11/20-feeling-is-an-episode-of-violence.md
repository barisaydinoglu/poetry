Feeling Is An Episode Of Violence
---------------------------------
In your shoulder of cracking the universe begins to dream of shining.  
In the face of so many stalactites to functionality.  
Conversations of propellers, the recitation  
of currents we call rosy vein.  
Play on the funerals that wait for you  
falling the rambunctious chairs, cracking the doors.  
In my heights at night you are like a movie  
and  
your form and colour the way I pulse them.  
And next to my hammock, during the night, I woke up naked  
and full of love.  
Realized real peace to seek another land it is a tale of absurd twisting lonely roads the atom shakes, the star of domestic  
shines among.
