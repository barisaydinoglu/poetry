The Study Has Not Electrified The Promise
-----------------------------------------
A car is  
not enough to prosecute me and keep me  
from the night of your profound epiphany.  
Conversations of praises, the recitation  
Of echoes we call musical current.  
But I should be untrue to mountaineering,  
protesting among its wounded essences  
so let us attempt to speak a story devoid of aerial redundancies.  
Full stop.
