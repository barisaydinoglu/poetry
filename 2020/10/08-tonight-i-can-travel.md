Tonight I Can Travel
--------------------
Come with me to the coal of beasts.  
Within the railroad track of the land where you sleep,  
a dream ignores into images.  
A real drizzle of awes.  
Circumscribing the echo of her wheatfield full of pride.  
A ironous camera undulates  
even the nocturnal  
technical land in signal  
to which the metaphor  
will not be grew.  
What mysteries does the ostrich contain?  
How little we light and how much it imbues the funny things of this galaxy.  
I could enrich bramble, serection, and stain  
from breakfasts and lemons  
with a turqoise sweetnes  
with oxides in my brow.  
It is a tale of boneless jackals outside the chimney like graphite.  
A transluscent burnt umber lake swimming will understand  
the disordered electricity of a planet.  
I wish  
to make a line segment  
outside, and every hearing, many  
times hidden in a well.  
Shall we recount?  
  
I flutter as if inside a delirious cummerbund.  
I took on frail roses.
