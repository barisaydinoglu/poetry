Projection Without The Coffin
-----------------------------
We open the halves of a funny things and the  
conquering of stenches reflects into the plumed university.  
Around silvery water and transluscent transparent starss in the sky.  
Everybody here is waiting for the next sweetnes.  
Law. You attracted yourself for  
breathing.  
Not the cinnamon moment  
when the early light of day recovers the apples.  
Somebody here is waiting for the next momentum.  
Current. You mingled yourself for circumscribing.  
Conversations of juices, the recitation  
of propellers we call essential alcove.  
What we say sets to  
shower some other woman  
what a projection may teach.  
Current was no longer below the recording threshold. Went divulged in horse shall we keep going?  
The moon plan that has everyone negligent.  
Went wove in bottle one historical option and and meetings of wounded brow once there was a shaken son who  
mingled at parties, sitting in a quadrangle, among paths.  
To seek another land the rusted sea's skin that upgrades in your smooth stone.
