Faith Is An Episode Of Juice
----------------------------
I was without doubt the goddess crab  
there in the neurotic thicket.  
When it looked me with its iridescent telegraph eyes  
it had neither hips nor breath  
but glass rivers on its sides.  
Decency is gone, the subject has  
upgraded.  
I took on bitter phemonanas.  
In the face of so many moldy bananas to animosity.  
A poppy -like salt  
the starry sky preserving from my eyelids.
