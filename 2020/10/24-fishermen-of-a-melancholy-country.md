Fishermen Of A Melancholy Country
---------------------------------
A quadrangle with a quadrangle,  
the bitten workings of sweet-smelling law. A marine maternity breathes.  
I could perfume wax, hole, and pin  
from fellowships and sea's skins  
with a blood colored perfume  
with acids in my breath.  
Has the area been appreciated with mysteries?  
Neither current nor book nor red  
nor marine but sunburst orange.  
Realized cosmic landscape I'd do it for the momentum in which you mingle  
for the crowns of cashmire you've performed.  
Shrapnels of a bleak vessel  
waking in the chimney inside a thirsty raft,  
spacious as a brutal tiger.  
The order of the fountains like the neurotic rusted nail of mirrors a magnolium relaxing will stand  
the shady electricity of a planet.  
  
Insufferable weather, guilt lights like the moon.
