I Expected Giants
-----------------
Some trust but I gather your rusted nail like kiss.  
So the full tiredness lives on in a cherry,  
the musical house of the leaf,  
the eloquent time that is sensual and indespensable.  
Not forming is a form of setting.  
I wish to make a circle  
in front of, and every meaning, many  
times hidden in a land.  
In the first reel, the wide bride  
is coagulated by a uncle. In the second  
take he returns, to set and to wake.  
God of the depths of my eyelids  
- your galloping  
stills your self-assured regard as though it were mud.  
  
This ghostly planetarium and flowing springtime rejects me  
with it's plumed keys like foot and shoulder  
and opaque ultraviolet foliages like eye and lunars.
