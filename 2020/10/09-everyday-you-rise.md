Everyday You Rise
-----------------
I could love dung, phlegm, and cubicle  
from hooves and muscles  
with a black faucet  
with howls in my eyeballs.  
The rustling pencil is electric on your heart.  
Not to reconcile or even meet  
the flower of one who rescues  
in me in a sea or rising to a woman.  
Pure shrapnel gathers the juices if I could discover the vinegar and the night.  
If you were not the apple the absent minded moon  
cooks, sprinkling its orange across the room.  
From her eyelids and her brow divulge  
smooth stones of the earth.  
  
Perching the sweetnes of her splendor full of pride.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the soft pullulations?  
And the wind steady splattering its laws and executing them full of  
boulevard and toucan?  
One technical option and in the parched vein, many lethargic granules.  
I salute your lovely plum  
and envy your angellic pride.  
Sunburst orange lightning to my bitter momentum!  
Some gather but I awaken your broken glass like river bank.  
What curiosities does the pheasant contain?  
How little we hear and how much it relinquishes the epiphany of this universe.  
In front of the marine heart of the heat.
