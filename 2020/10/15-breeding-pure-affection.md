Breeding Pure Affection
-----------------------
I saw how momenta are lighted  
by the starry garden.  
A cinnamon quilt refreshes.  
Of a rust colored bride that breathes maps.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
Nothing but your steady shoulder.  
Not to inherit or even meet  
the hoove of one who imbues  
outside me in a boulevard or perching to an aunt.  
  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
magnify of bird feathers and shorelines  
and the cleansed kisses of his native land?  
In the first reel, the poetic stranger  
is hated by a man. In the second  
scene he returns, to chirp and to respond.  
Crimson and fluidic pioneer,  
what electric alcoves -  
the universe is filled with it,  
ripples for the droplet and the motionless cork.
