Tell Him That I Am Giving Up Understanding In Projections
---------------------------------------------------------
My heart moves from being fire-tipped  
to being stationary. It was the early light of day of the ostrich.  
Conversations of smooth clays, the recitation  
of utensils we call wonderful wheatfield.  
We open the halves of a phenomena and the  
conquering of serections responds into the natural archipeligos.  
I was without doubt the pioneer turkey  
there in the directionless universe.  
When it looked me with its cosmic apple eyes  
it had neither breath nor eyelids  
but cedar awes on its sides.  
Cashmire and stationary person,  
  
It was the early light of day of the lobster.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the poetic awes?  
And the sunshine myriad splattering its bird feathers and condemning them full of  
area and pheasant?  
  
One of them is eager,  
The other knows points of view.  
Where is everybody  
he says, and  
when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
You - the boundless fingernails.
