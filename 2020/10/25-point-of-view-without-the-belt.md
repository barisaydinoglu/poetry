Point Of View Without The Belt
------------------------------
To flow lost lights and for smooth graphites. And you crystallize like a flesh and developed and then lighted in the archipeligos.  
Boney twisting lonely roads and blood-stained explications.  
There ought to be a banner of a self-assured wreath dedicating in a city.  
A current of ancient pasture  
that does not know why it flows and understands.  
The water absorbant eternities are struck.  
  
Some rejoice but I excite your iron like quilt.  
The cheerless lemon that reflects in your nature.  
When you dawn like land understood by the earth.
