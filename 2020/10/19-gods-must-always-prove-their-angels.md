Gods Must Always Prove Their Angels
-----------------------------------
I'm the person to the river of immediate  
garden.  
The boundless lands chained neither guitar nor current nor turqoise  
nor transparent but green.  
A loaf of bread baked with brutal tiredness and salt.  
You are the lemon of my clotting shoulder.  
The warmths exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
within it in darkness.  
To the free nocturnal book  
which is a delicate springtime of directions  
twenty-seven or thousand, preserved  
on a hat or in the parsimonious sea water  
directions of the breath, a calculation in your noses.  
In your fingernails of attacking the divisions begins to dream of relinquishing.  
As if to drop or gallop or deform.  
My serendipidous hips pacifies you always.  
A musical wood paneling making a velvety thing of a impossible meeting with a daughter.  
I am penetrated by bridge and consequence, by saliva and thunder.  
  
Rotten shrapnels and guilt holes.  
I'm the pioneer to the awe of immediate coat.
