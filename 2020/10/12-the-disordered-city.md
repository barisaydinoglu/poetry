The Disordered City
-------------------
The phemonana dies, the quiver of ancient  
continues outside.  
Inside sepia water and marine hearts.  
In your breath of deceiving the divisions begins to dream of magnifying.  
For a day, maybe three hundred,  
I rested under a blade of grass  
at a post office, waiting for the father to be behind.  
Not the sepia moment  
when the holiday rejoices the muscles.  
What abolishes the props of tiredness?  
Agony  
and affection - energies of panic.  
Windy weather, misunderstood lights like the tryst.  
He is in the middle of us at this moment of first reflecting.  
I wish to make a quadrangle  
in front of, and every color, many  
times  
hidden in a bottle.  
In the guilt heights of communist autumn.  
  
A bicycle is not enough to silence me and keep me  
from the jungle of your hopeful curiosities.  
A raft is not enough to penetrate me and keep me  
from the region of your lovely secrets.
