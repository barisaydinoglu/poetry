Corpses About The Point Of View He Inherited
--------------------------------------------
One  
neutral option and one of them is naked,  
the other knows phenomena.  
Where is noone  
she cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen? Multitude of tigers!  
In and out of the marine the transparent and the transluscent marine spacious, gold cluster!  
Mist.  
In my region at morning you are like a perfume  
and your form and colour the way I travel them.  
Draw from it the hairy  
projection of its own synonym.  
It was the afternoon of the elephant.  
Crimson and iridescent  
mountaineer,  
It was the afternoon of the crab.  
I wish to make a triangle  
next to, and every abstraction, many  
times hidden in a smooth stone.  
Develop on the vigils that wait for you  
smothering the fuming chairs, rejecting the doors.
