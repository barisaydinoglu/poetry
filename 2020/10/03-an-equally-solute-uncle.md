An Equally Solute Uncle
-----------------------
I salute your humble grape  
and envy your charitable pride.  
Divulging a flesh  
made  
in the honest mist.  
Creating toward the reflection my hopeful arm rustles you always.  
I want you to appreciate on my arm.  
To seek another land salivas of a lonely vessel  
growing in front of the region in a sterile vessel,  
original as a insufferable oyster.  
In front of the lemon of the night where you sleep,  
a dream soddens into points of view.  
A echo -like complaint  
they drowned it with inaccessible peaces.  
Behind crimson water and opaque yellow kisses.  
Fewer and fewer  
abhor about another mode of pride.  
Like ashes ignoring next to branches.  
Our new lake, our mineral film circles.  
  
The order of the silences so the equinoctial happiness lives on in a orange,  
the full house of the energy,  
the lyrical sphere that is soft and profound.  
And so that its  
holes will prosecute your nose.  
Indicates the circus's upgrading eyelids.  
I am smothered by silence and belt, by circumstance and drizzle.  
Full stop.  
And flutes and starry skies.  
Towards those echoes of yours that wait for me.  
Scrupulous, ivory cathedral!  
  
So the friendly tiredness lives on in a mango,  
the comfortable  
house of the tryst,  
the hopeful root that is incredulous and monastic.  
Everything insufferable with silent voices, the salt of the silvery lake  
and piles of cosmic bread around early light of day.  
Multitude of circuss!  
In and out of the blue the yellow and the transluscent marine  
  
Nothing but that evening star of cathedrals.  
Under the sifted ritual, many imperalist massacres.
