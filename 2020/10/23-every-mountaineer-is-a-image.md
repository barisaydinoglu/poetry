Every Mountaineer Is A Image
----------------------------
The earth wonderful hearts are killed. Outside the transluscent deep brown foot of the lava.  
And so that its abberations will plague your brow.  
  
Weaving toward the book one of them is charitable,  
the other knows languages.  
Where is somebody  
she says, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Unguessed, fused quartz fellowship!
