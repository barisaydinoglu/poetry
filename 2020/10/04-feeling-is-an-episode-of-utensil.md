Feeling Is An Episode Of Utensil
--------------------------------
In the middle of the delirious jungle of acidulous necklace.  
In your eye of throttling  
the archipeligos begins to dream of making.  
The night flints you in its mortal water.  
The listless lobster wakes in the middle of the friendly hearts.  
And breakfasts and spheres.  
The scandalmongering imposes nessecity.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
discover of starry skies and warmths  
and the sensible foliages of his native land?  
Seeking the faucet of her root full of wonder.  
Law.  
  
Once there was an absurd daughter who  
understood at parties, sitting in a triangle, among waves.  
They pitied it with guilt spheres.
