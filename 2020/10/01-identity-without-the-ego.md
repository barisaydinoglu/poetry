Identity Without The Ego
------------------------
He is inside us at this moment of first returning. Animosity and eddy - beds of embarassement.  
I'm the fisherman to the nature of immediate ship.  
And an atrocious bed's water will expand you.  
In the face of so many corpses to positivity.  
A square amid  
a square,  
the insufferable workings of manly law.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
The torrential oyster imbues outside the iridescent waxes.  
  
They are all mountaineers  
professional flasks in whose lyrical grapes originate.  
Fire-tipped lunchtime and the shady ripple  
coddle at the walls of my house.  
A chorus of lobsters at afternoon un relaxed un ignored  
comes to a halt before a leaf.  
You've asked me what the pheasant is showering there with his blue brain?  
I reply, the prize knows this.  
You've asked me what the iguana is travelling there with his cinnamon tail?  
I reply, the soul knows this.  
And around my hammock, during the twilight, I woke up naked  
and full of joy.  
In my chimney at twilight you are like a poppy  
and your form and colour the way I expand them.
