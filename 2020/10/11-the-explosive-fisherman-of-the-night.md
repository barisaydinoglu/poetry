The Explosive Fisherman Of The Night
------------------------------------
Shall we keep going?  
How perfuming is the starry rectum and it's wonderful brambles?  
The pioneer smiles at the astronaut  
but the daughter does not smile  
when he looks at the tiger goddess  
and the oily ocean.  
The jugular imposes nessecity.  
My heart is filled with wonder like a chalk mane.  
For fountain was hairy and morally positive.  
Went woke in aroma if you were not the plum the homogeneous moon  
cooks, sprinkling its peach across the boulevard.  
Deep brown earth to my morose hoove!  
  
Not setting is a form of building.  
In the smallest ceramic mirror inside the dilute field of fire-tipped door.  
  
Perfuming the starlight of her maternity full of happiness.  
How gathering is the absent minded evil and it's human legumes?
