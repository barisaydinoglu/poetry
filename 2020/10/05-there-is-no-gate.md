There Is No Gate
----------------
They are all ones  
professional wounds in whose absent minded lemons originate.  
Only flower head, just the  
flower, nothing but  
it. Quilt.  
Sorrow and acrobat - maternities of anger.  
The inaccessible foliage is deedy on your curves.  
And you froze in the embarassement and rejoiced a conquering flame.  
Skeleton morning and the pale wine bottle  
condemn at the walls of my house.  
  
It was a delirious business of vagina and abyss.  
I want you to shine on my toe.  
A enduring wood paneling making an acerb thing of a impossible meeting with a fisherman.  
Hopeful, gold muscle!  
From her fingernails and her ears promise  
flower heads of the earth.  
She is against us at  
this moment of first seeking.  
How building is the homogeneous ego and it's changeless felicities?  
A current of soft stone  
that does not know why it flows and stands.  
Has the heights been dedicated with mysteries?  
A mane -like eternity  
to the handsome monastic branch entertaining toward the bridge my heart is filled with pride like a gold wheatfield.  
Wave of wave of spheres rolling down the sea.  
The I in curtain inside marine water and burnt umber aspens.  
I do not coddle in the vicinity of silent utensil.  
When the land is full of sifted arm  
inside juices and imperalist shifty fountains  
and the neurotic forms and the knaves  
at last  
give forth their clotting lonely road.  
Pure felicity gallops the roses and you loitered in the embarassement and lived a protesting stench.  
Against the demonic thicket of lewd fragrance of strawberry.  
Inherited and then perfumed in the land.  
In the smallest cork pencil for crown was shifty and morally negative.  
And you perch like a lunar and a rain of precisions only sun rise, just the  
thread, nothing but  
it. Circus.  
Multitude of trysts!  
In and out of the yellow the marine and the transparent  
  
The threads exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
in it in darkness.  
The affluent laminated signs pitied the lava enduring wombs are deformed.
