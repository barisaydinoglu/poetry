Rustling Sea Shell
------------------
Some gather but I connect your steel like aroma. The dews exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
around it in darkness.  
The coral plan that has everyone forceful.  
I'm the person to the umbrella of immediate affection.  
Draw from it the acidulous  
camera of its own production.  
Our new evening star, our pure awe quadrangles.  
Everything lashed with electrical voices, the salt of the lighthouse  
and piles of affluent bread next to early light of day.  
Multitude of smooth stones!  
In and out of the sunburst orange the cinnamon and the silvery  
burnt umber stalactites of conglomerate,  
sepia seams above a chaotic shoreline.  
Of natural nectarine, spirit  
of the farms,  
abhorred stranger blood, your kisses  
flow into exile  
and a droplet of marble, with remnants of the modern office.
