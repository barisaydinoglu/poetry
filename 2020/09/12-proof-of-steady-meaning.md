Proof Of Steady Meaning
-----------------------
Calculating weather, morose lights like the writing.  
For a day, maybe thousand,  
I rested under a unrelenting rain  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the mother to be in.  
When the sea is full of clenched eyelids  
inside granules and fractious ghostly shorelines  
and the dead snows and the telegraphs  
at last give forth their rustling pigeon hole.  
Outside the chimney like steel.
