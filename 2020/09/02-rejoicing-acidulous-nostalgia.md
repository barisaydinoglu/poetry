Rejoicing Acidulous Nostalgia
-----------------------------
What natural mosaics -  
the vicinity is filled with it,  
lands for the tiger and the fragmented paper-mache. I saw how starry skies are expanded  
by the fresh fountain.  
A green lunar connects.  
Of your dark sea shell when you hold out your tail.
