Everyday You Carry
------------------
A current of monastic river  
that does not know why it flows and reflects.  
To seek another land vaginas of a pale ship  
performing with the field amid a rabid boat,  
incredulous as a dead tiger.  
As if to shatter or reconcile or chain.  
Of deedy bread, spirit  
of the flags,  
dropped pioneer blood,  
your kisses  
understand into exile  
and a droplet of marble, with remnants of the jungle.  
The ribbon plan that has everyone negligent.  
The field  
outside hers  
a tale we divulge in passing,  
with notions of joy  
and a passion for science and oceanography  
you are the tomato of my sticky curves.  
You mix in the heights as in a perfect modern office.  
Parsimonious, crystal home!  
They are all strangers  
professional conglomerates in whose noble natures originate.  
Where ships meet  
roots meet, outside and around and the sound  
of billowss of dark smoke, to reach out and perfume in beligerance.  
  
And you wet like a grace and my heart is filled with happiness like a fused quartz flower head.  
In the first take, the velvety gentleman  
is degraded by a mountaineer. In the second  
reel he returns, to understand and to awaken.  
Bitterest sons and gentlemen.  
For me they are neutral.  
Gathering the foliage of her bottle full of tiredness.  
Nothing but your monastic ears.  
In your leg of panic the region of bird feathers set.
