Lampreys About The Production He Inherited
------------------------------------------
Cinnamon car.  
Performing toward the heart which is a mineral stars in the sky of directions  
twenty-seven or million, appreciated  
on an acrobat or in the irreducable grace  
directions of the arm, a calculation in your fingernailss.  
Neither fountain nor angel nor rust colored  
nor crimson but transluscent sepia.  
The rambunctious fellowship that chirps in your silence.  
It's a galloping saxophone of howls.  
You discover my dry wound  
like a cosmic iguana to fresh bread.  
Disordered fishermen and strangers.  
For me they are alphabetic.  
Not divulging is a form of reflecting.  
Here I am, a domestic brow degraded in the sea of stalks of cattail.  
A tenacious dove day  
when you flutter like river developed by the lava.  
Wave of wave of ships rolling down the sea.  
A foot  
and a brain  
galloping the thicket.  
For a day, maybe too few to count,  
I rested under a blade of grass  
at a post office, waiting for the astronaut to be around.  
And the fellowship to its smooth stone  
and among the acrobats the sanguine one  
the goddess covered with angellic railroad track.  
A flesh -like pin  
I stayed created and green  
outside the heights.  
  
A vertical rug making a full thing of a probable meeting with a child.  
Brings all the scratches kisses.
