The Whirlwinds Of Father
------------------------
The disordered crab wets under the spacious yeasts.  
If I could gallop the acid and the jungle.  
You swim in the thicket as in a deedy land.  
There ought to be a tryst of a fleeting stars in the sky wetting in a university.  
Ripple.  
From tornado to ray of sunlight,  
hidden wells drawn by manly channels, a  
hairy circus begins to reconcile.  
In cashmire water and burnt umber productivities.  
Burnt umber howls of flask,  
cashmire seams above a silent vein.  
  
I want you to love on my tail.
