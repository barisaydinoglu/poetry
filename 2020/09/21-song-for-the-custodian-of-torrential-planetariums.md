Song For The Custodian Of Torrential Planetariums
-------------------------------------------------
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the round laminated signs?  
And the sun sensual splattering its veins and congealing them full of  
modern office and toucan?  
He is under us at this moment of first building.
