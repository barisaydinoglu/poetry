I Have Gone Petrifying
----------------------
Come with me to the cummerbund of lards.  
In the first take, the steady bride  
is passed by a cousin. In the second  
reel he returns, to continue and to build.  
Pulsing a sun  
rise  
entertained in the eloquent fog.  
We open the halves of a secrets and  
the  
silencing of bloods magnifies into the friendly universe.  
In the face of so many rotten stumps to positivity.  
A eyelids and a brow  
swimming the jungle.  
An odor has refreshed behind the river,  
A mixture of shards of saphire and body, a setting  
soul that brings confusion.
