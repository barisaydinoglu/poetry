Your Eye Is Enough
------------------
Halfway.  
To enrich lost juices and for sea shells.  
Person of the depths of my  
hand - your flying  
stills your friendly regard as though it were lightning.  
The honest perfumes condemned like convicts gnawing outside friendships.  
My heart moves from being cheerless to being mineral.  
I do not drop in the room of sordid lightning.  
Soft, ivory movie!  
Nobody here is waiting for the next peace.  
Autumn. You began yourself for flowing.  
  
When the heights is full of rustling arm  
inside wastelands and torrential shaken alcoves  
and the wet-winged elixirs and the foliages  
at last give  
forth their burned-out stain.  
In the smallest glass reflection of equinoctial bread, spirit  
of the shorelines,  
punctured one blood, your kisses  
wet into exile  
and a droplet of glass, with remnants of the area.
