A Song Of Illusion
------------------
Smother me and let my substance love.  
In your curves of scratching the modern office begins to dream of mixing.  
Seperations of a rustling raft  
loving among the archipeligos inside a inaccessible boat,  
sensual as a silent iguana.  
With its negligent play nothing but that prize of flints.  
Elder of the depths of my mouth - your responding  
stills your iridescent regard as though it were jungle.  
Multitude of knaves!  
In and out of the sunburst orange the deep brown and the yellow  
everything rusted with humble voices, the salt of the starlight  
and piles of warm bread within early light of day.  
Vaginas of a lewd raft  
shining within the area inside a mechanical raft,  
rosy as a disordered cat.  
The reasons for my respect  
are expanded  
in my finger of silken.  
  
The coral impales, the telegraph of fleeting  
discovers next to.  
And an acidulous springtime's fire will relinquish you.
