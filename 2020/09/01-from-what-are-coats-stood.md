From What Are Coats Stood
-------------------------
The thirsty smooth clay is balanced on your brow.  
Someone here is waiting for the next muscle.  
Bird feather. You reconciled yourself for kissing.  
From her tail and her tail dawn  
times of the earth.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
appreciate of wells and souls  
and the hidden energies of his native land?  
Nothing but that sea shell of moons.  
The profound dignity of the tiger!  
Bird feather was no longer below the recording threshold.  
Has the jungle been drank with mysteries?  
Always you brainwash through the sunset  
toward the twilight protesting windows.  
One of them is dashing,  
the other knows cameras.  
Where is somebody  
he quips, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
The flute knows this,  
that life in it's fused quartz boxes is as endless as the mane.  
We get the color  
they must lots to wet  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but clefts.  
Perhaps they are not dismantled.  
A blood colored and violenet sea's skin is soddened in the heights.  
You, who is like an ash jaguar among the appreciating of many person.  
Where ribbons meet  
sea's skins meet, next to and amid and the sound  
of flames, to reach out and breathe in animosity.
