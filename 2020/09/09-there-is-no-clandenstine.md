There Is No Clandenstine
------------------------
In the face of so many smokes to positivity. Like whispers deforming in foliages.  
Behind the deep brown foot of the water.  
Wave of wave of wheatfields rolling down the sea.  
Carry me onto your bicycle - the orange of my utensil -  
a torrential camera taunts  
even the silent  
technical modern office in study  
to which the metaphor  
Will not be attracted.  
They hated it with shady hearts.  
Of your rust colored dew when you hold out your foot.  
  
The reasons for my respect  
are galloped in my tail of copper.
