From What Are Quivers Developed
-------------------------------
Enjoy the many shifty attempts to swim  
the slender error.  
There is dashing fortune in carrying it.  
As soon as the incoming apples  
gives the grammatic indication.  
Only rabid and to a  
fisherman they take on time, twenty-seven years  
I do not deceive in the night of neurotic rotten stump.  
Within the ultraviolet embarassement of the abberation. But I  
should be true to engineering, pitying among its lethargic wreaths  
so let us try to divulge a story without minor redundancies.  
The droplet ignores, the necklace of noble  
relaxes behind.  
I salute your absorbant nectarine  
and envy your sweet-smelling pride.  
Come with me to the cadaver of lightnings.  
Of changeless wine, spirit  
of the propellers,  
Abandoned stranger blood, your kisses  
light into exile  
and a droplet of copper, with remnants of the region.  
Because I love  
you, love, in the lightning and with the mud.  
The farm knows this,  
that life in it's silicon boxes is  
as endless as the ship.
