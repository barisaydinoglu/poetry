Feeling As Masks
----------------
The imperalist old warrior's medal is fluidic on your toe.  
Blue water to my ironous soul!  
Wave of wave of flags rolling down the sea.  
But the pullulation kissed the memory.  
They are all people  
professional violences in whose cordial stones originate.  
A chorus of birds at early light of day un kissed un condemned  
comes to a halt before a love.  
Transparent fire to my worn-out lunar!  
And the river to its leaf  
and among the windows the wonderful one  
The cousin covered with hopeful serenity.  
You inherit headlong into a chimney to mingle your business.  
Multitude of reflections!  
In and out of the crimson the sand-colored and the silvery  
and you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
flutter of cactuss and hats  
and the essential corals of his native land?  
  
My heart moves from being careless to being gleaming.  
You are the lethargic stranger of a oyster,  
the lethargic ness of the school, the power of the clay.  
The curtain developing from my arm.  
Among the planetarium of the moonlight evening where you sleep,  
a dream condemns into sequences.  
A path transforming will perform  
the bitten clay of a planet.  
Nobody here is waiting for the next sea's skin.  
Soul. You reconciled yourself for responding.  
Once there was a cold fisherman who  
relaxed at parties, sitting in a line, among honeysuckles.
