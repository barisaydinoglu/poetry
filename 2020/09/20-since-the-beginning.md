Since The Beginning
-------------------
For a day, maybe too few to count,  
I rested under a blade of grass  
at a bus stop, waiting for the bride to be among.  
Shut up and pulled out like a shades of crimson.  
Of your blood colored pasture when you hold out your curves.  
Like vigils throttling amid acrobats.  
I want you to shower on my hips.
