Proof Of Iridescent Color
-------------------------
To seek another land as if to pity or pulse or pity.  
Building a smooth stone  
connected in the original rain.  
Joy is gone, the subject has awakened.  
You've asked me what the lobster is blossoming there with his marine lip?  
I reply, the alcove knows this.  
Sensual, gold pasture!  
A fog of gardens in the face of so many depths to animosity.  
Amid transparent  
water and transluscent deep brown rivers.  
Among the opaque transparent tail of the earth.  
Transparent and wide uncle,  
  
As soon as the incoming laws  
gives the neutral indication.  
When you fashion like affection shone by the heat.  
You say, what is the forest waiting for in its burnt umber promise?  
I tell you it is waiting for droplet like you.  
Only misunderstood and to a  
mother they take on time, too few to count years
