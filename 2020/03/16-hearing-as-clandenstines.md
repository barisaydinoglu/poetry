Hearing As Clandenstines
------------------------
The shifty root that divulges in your key.  
Apple.  
And a rusted rose's heat will pulse you.  
Carry me onto your bicycle - the orange of my faucet -  
This hairy telegraph and dawning wheatfield entangles me  
with it's clear praises like arm and ears  
and turqoise droplets like ears and threads.  
Come with me to the serection of probes.  
The productivity plan that has everyone silent.  
To seek another land the crooked lobster magnifies in the fresh lonely roads.  
In your toe of embarassement the heights of manes recover.  
A listless evening star day  
depths of a tenacious boat  
weaving outside the heights among a bitten  
airplane,  
noble as a bitter ostrich.  
Brings all the drops  
books.  
Multitude of beds!  
In and out of the cashmire the silvery and the cashmire  
transluscent yellow and cleansed child,  
not swimming is a form of attracting.  
You, who is like a wax jaguar among the making of many father.  
  
Mingle on the stalactites that wait for you  
trembling the boneless chairs, executing the doors.  
One algorithmic option and and the star to its shades of transluscent marine  
and among  
the wine bottles the decisive one  
the gentleman covered with boundless moon.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
  
A garden -like belt  
and you attacked in the animosity and shone a taunting complaint.  
A difficult technique hates  
even the incredulous  
overtone boulevard in language  
to which the metaphor  
will not be lighted.  
  
But I should be true to photography, deluding among its cold sea shells  
so let us attempt to tell a story without grammatic redundancies.  
Billows of black smoke of a fire-tipped car  
waking behind the modern office next to a wayside helicopter,  
parsimonious as a inaccessible turkey.  
In your ears of deluding the moonlight evening begins to dream of performing.  
Return to the homeland of the necklaces.  
Nobody here is waiting for the next sweetnes.  
Landscape. You blushed yourself for treading.  
I saw how hearts are seized  
by the great flag.  
The order of the wheatfields and you deformed in the embarassement and drank a taunting martyr.
