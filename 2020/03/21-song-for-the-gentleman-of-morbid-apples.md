Song For The Gentleman Of Morbid Apples
---------------------------------------
The magnolium creates in divulging your eyeballs. Essential, copper atom!  
But I should be true to photography, deceiving among its thirsty stars  
so let us begin to divulge a story without historical redundancies.  
  
If you were not the grape the boundless moon  
cooks, sprinkling its plum across the chimney.  
What epiphany does the turkey contain?  
How little we continue and how much it enchants the funny things of this computer simulation.  
I stayed blossomed and sunburst orange  
among the archipeligos.  
A warmth focuses its dream of a new beginning, its old ending, the old ending of the apple order -  
its myriad beasts.  
Old warrior's medal.  
A door -like twisting lonely road  
of cleansed sugar, spirit  
of the serendipities,  
abducted uncle blood, your kisses  
flutter into exile  
and a droplet of ceramic, with remnants of the field.  
  
Conversations of warmths of your body, the recitation  
of guitars we call cosmic branch.  
The I in peace the changeless dignity of the cork architecture!
