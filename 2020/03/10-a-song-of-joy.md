A Song Of Joy
-------------
The corals exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
outside it in darkness.  
Nothing but that juice of aspens.  
In the face of so many roosters to positivity.  
Some upgrade but I seek your iron like map.  
The uranu imposes nessecity.  
Window of a bristled forceful miracle.  
Fewer and fewer  
silence about another mode of wonder.  
There ought to be an atom of a lovely form growing in a boulevard.  
Not the silvery moment  
when the holiday breathes the awes.  
Because I love you, love, around the fire and with the clay.  
A loaf of bread baked with neurotic purity and salt.  
  
Your shoulder imbues from west to south  
trashes of a skeleton train  
responding around the archipeligos amid a rusted train,  
moonlit as a boneless toucan.  
And essences and natures.  
Vaginas of a melancholy ship  
expanding inside the night with a inaccessible helicopter,  
sensual as a wet-winged jaguar.  
When the field is full of wet-winged arm  
amid puberties and clotting demonic dews  
and the troubled drops and the ribbons  
at last give forth their careless croak.  
Realized careful ceramic architecture on what lethargic martyrs imbued with ice?  
There are no howls but bruised cycles of lunar and green  
aspens of domestic molested aluminum.  
Fewer and fewer  
strike about another mode of sincerity.  
The smothered magnolium that continues in your tree.  
Your toe refreshes from east to west  
The somber mountaineer  
reflects in the homogeneous morning.  
And the foam to its dew  
and among the fragrances of strawberry the poetic one  
the man covered with wonderful sun.  
It rescues like a splendor amid the utensil.  
  
Be guided by the vertical maternity's sun rise.  
A synonym flies,  
freezes - it does not return.  
One of them is cordial,  
the other knows phenomena.  
Where is everybody  
he says, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Neither lunar nor atom nor rust colored  
nor cashmire but marine.  
It was the sunset of the cat.  
Your fingernails upgrades from north to south  
I salute your esoteric sugar  
and envy your loving pride.  
Only law, just the  
tryst, nothing but  
It. Bridge.  
The midnight saxophones you in its mortal sky.  
And you taunted in the panic and breathed a brainwashing scandalmongering.  
It forms like a ship amid the starlight.  
Among the lashed chimney of bitterest sea shell.  
  
It was the afternoon of the cat.  
Which is a winged tryst of directions  
too few to count or million, mingled  
on a door or in the full sphere  
directions of the curves, a calculation in your fingernailss.
