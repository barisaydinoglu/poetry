A Song Of Embarassement
-----------------------
Like wayside mosaic, moons  
a mist of warmths  
they are all daughters  
professional pins in whose real kiss originate.  
A bicycle is not enough to chain me and keep me  
from the universe of your decisive epiphany.  
You've asked me what the elephant is playing there with his sand-colored fingernails?  
I reply, the crown knows this.  
Like raucous fellowship, bells  
nothing but your esoteric lip.  
It stores like a circus outside the lemon.
