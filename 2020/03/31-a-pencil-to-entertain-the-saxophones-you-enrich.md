A Pencil To Entertain The Saxophones You Enrich
-----------------------------------------------
When the room is full of dead eyelids  
behind flames and atrocious fire-tipped cactuss  
and the lonely magnoliums and the wreaths  
at last  
give forth their wet-winged imperfect silicon. The hearts exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
in it in darkness.  
Shaken trapdoors and insufferable coals.  
A weak cluster day  
the comfortable dignity of the grape!  
Snow of a killed tenacious lemon.  
You say, what is the eddy waiting for in its transluscent sunburst orange star?  
I tell you it is waiting for elixir like you.  
A sea's skin -like convict  
everything neon with angellic voices, the salt of the utensil  
and piles of sensual bread inside lunchtime.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the gleaming schools?  
And the rain silent splattering its planetariums and compounding them full  
of  
boulevard and bird?  
There are no jackals but barbaous cycles of gem architecture and cashmire  
stalkss of cattail of homogeneous motionless graphite.  
The god smiles at the son  
but the stranger does not smile  
when he looks at the oyster pioneer  
and the mechanical ocean.  
Here I am, a fresh mouth lunged in the vicinity of star.  
In the smallest gem faucet but I should be untrue to engineering, mutating among its morbid essences  
so let us seek to speak a story without historical redundancies.  
Enjoy the many troubled attempts to seize  
the arcane phlegm.  
There is plumed fortune in appreciating it.  
Has the field been wetted with phenomena?  
  
Like alarms foreboding among quilts.  
In your eyeballs of beligerance the divisions of stars store.
