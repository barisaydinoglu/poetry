Since The Beginning
-------------------
We open the halves of a curiosities and the  
filtering of noises enriches into the angellic boulevard.  
Force me and let my substance re-cover.  
The apple knows this,  
that life in it's crystal boxes is as endless as the river bank.  
But I should be true to jouranlism, trembling among its shifty breakfasts  
so let us seek to tell a story without side redundancies.  
It is a tale of molested salivas like raucous sea water, saxophones  
I'd do it for the time in which you fashion  
for the faucets of marine you've expanded.  
Tear stained weather, listless lights like the flute.  
Which is a charitable key of directions  
thousand or million, dawned  
on a cork architecture or in the celestial momentum  
directions of the hand, a calculation in your hearts.  
And meetings of obscene toe we get the hearing  
they must lots to play  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but cities.  
Perhaps they are not buried.  
Fewer and fewer  
wet about another mode of purity.  
  
You are the lemon of my barbaous tail.
