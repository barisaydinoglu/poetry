The Point Of View Called The Arm
--------------------------------
The old warrior's medal flowing from my foot. And wine bottles and love.  
If you were not the wine the lion hearted moon  
cooks, sprinkling its bread across the divisions.  
Whirlwinds of weather, calcerous lights like the wave.  
You -  
the noble finger.  
You - the musical eye.  
To rustle lost shadess of crimson and for hats.  
Atrocious late afternoon and the communist foam  
die at the walls of my house.  
From her lip and her lip upgrade  
serenities of the earth.
