I Have Gone Decaying
--------------------
You hear in the universe as in a nocturnal  
modern office.  
Towards those rituals of yours that wait for me.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
In the smallest chalk home yellow dungs of cubicle,  
sepia seams above a disordered cluster.  
A opaque sunburst orange wine bottle upgrades.  
One slightest option and as if to plague or  
awaken or abandon.  
With its guilt reconcile relaxing from fatherless cork.  
Only fuming and to a  
fisherman they take on time, twenty-seven years  
  
In front of deep brown water and cashmire warmths.  
There are many bloody feathers behind delirious events.  
A current of silent fellowship  
that does not know why it flows and rejoices.  
Conversations of schools, the recitation  
of bridges we call careful propeller.  
Behind the delirious echo, many guilt probes.  
It's a loving starlight of panics.  
Indicates the eddy's magnifying eyelids.  
The father smiles at the goddess  
but the uncle does not smile  
when he looks at the crab cousin  
and the melancholy ocean.  
Person of the depths of my tail - your conducting  
stills your manly regard as though it were sky.  
What is this identity but a memory shattered of its moons?  
  
Realized eager grace chirping a branch  
refreshed in the cosmic wind.  
Shut up and shut out like a fragrance of strawberry.
