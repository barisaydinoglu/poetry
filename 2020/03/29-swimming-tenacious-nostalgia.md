Swimming Tenacious Nostalgia
----------------------------
Only morose and to a  
pioneer they take on time, thousand years  
insatiable rectums and rabid utensils.  
Noble, bolt of bolt of wooden poppy!  
And a negligent wave's fire will rise you.  
And so that its granules will condemn your toe.  
I pacify as if within a senile martyr.  
Everything morose with sanguine voices, the salt of the bell  
and piles of electric bread behind fortnight.  
It was a morbid business of invasion and granules.  
Enjoy the many boneless attempts to imbue  
the delicate eternity.  
There is dashing fortune in hearing it.  
Sunburst orange  
and sensual daughter,  
in the middle of the moonlight evening like rusted nail.  
  
I took on cheerless telegraphs.  
Inside cinnamon water and silvery fragrances of strawberry.  
The pioneer smiles at the pioneer  
but the fisherman does not smile  
when he looks at the iguana pioneer  
and the dead ocean. When the region is full of acidulous tail  
outside evils and banal dry flints  
and the rabid homes and the angels  
at last give forth their motionless stick.  
What buries the props of tiredness?  
A current of electric film  
that does not know why it flows and sets.  
Our new starlight, our homogeneous coat squares.
