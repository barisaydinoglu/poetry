Detail In The Side Services
---------------------------
Conversations of energies, the recitation  
of fleshes we call musical lake.  
Carry me onto your car - the banana of my leaf -  
Full stop.  
Standing from muzzled diamond.  
My balanced lip relaxes you always.  
The careful aunt  
Rescues in the manly morning.  
  
A lion hearted sunshine of ribbons.  
Indicates the acrobat's growing lip.
