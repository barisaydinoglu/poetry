I Expected Uncles
-----------------
Not the burnt umber moment  
when the early light of day rustles the laminated signs. Compound me and let my substance fashion.  
Like directionless affection, planetariums  
our new trouser, our secure jar circles.  
The saliva imposes nessecity.  
The order of the juices noone here is waiting for the next lemon.  
Door. You developed yourself for rising.
