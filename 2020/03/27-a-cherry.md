A Cherry
--------
A map focuses its dream of a new ending, its beginning, the ending of the book order -  
its moonlit brambles.  
A sequence for machine is the lack thereof.  
To wet lost serendipities and for propellers.  
You see fingernails as angellic as the fog.  
From palm tree leaf to uncomfortable turbulence,  
hidden sweetness drawn by serene channels, a  
hated lemon begins to divulge.  
I saw how homes are fluttered  
by the self-assured peace.
