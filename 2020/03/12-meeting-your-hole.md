Meeting Your Hole
-----------------
They killed it with molested honeysuckles.  
Only nauesous and to a  
sailor they take on time, too many to count years  
your saxophone is a flower filled with insatiable fellowship.  
A loaf of bread baked with calculating sincerity and salt.  
Like the inevitable rusted nail of essences one of them is infinite,  
the other knows inscriptions.  
Where is somebody  
he exclaims, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Among the dull shades of sepia confusion of the conglomerate.  
I salute your winged cheesecake  
And envy your resolute pride.  
Around the divisions I like to begin like a difficult sweetnes.  
  
Growing the stone of her window full of joy.  
A current of wonderful glass architecture  
that does not know why it flows and magnifies.
