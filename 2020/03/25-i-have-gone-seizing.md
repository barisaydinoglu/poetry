I Have Gone Seizing
-------------------
Shall we set forth?  
The chimney outside hers  
a tale we tell in passing,  
with notions of happiness  
and a passion for photography and jouranlism  
everything rigid with handsome voices, the salt of the magnolium  
and piles of aquatic bread within afternoon.  
In the smallest gold mist the tenacious tree is parsimonious on your toe.  
The demonic home is boundless on your hips.  
A browbeaten dove day  
thirsty elders and pioneers.  
For me they are historical.  
I salute your absent minded bread  
and envy your lovely pride.  
I wish to make a loop  
outside, and every sight, many  
times hidden in a fragrance of strawberry.  
You are the apple of my putrid foot.  
When you respond like wave performed by the water.  
As if to shake or develop or faint.  
Of your dull shades of cashmire form when you hold out your finger.  
The velvety thread gave it sincerity.  
I salute your somber nectarine  
and envy your serendipidous pride.  
I took on rotten graces.  
With its lethargic excite I stayed showered and silvery  
against the boulevard.
