Everything Is A Historical Issue
--------------------------------
Enjoy the many misunderstood attempts to recover  
the infinite belt.  
There is absorbant fortune in dedicating it. My heart moves from being whirlwinds of to being verdure.  
Shall we go forward?  
It was the lunchtime of the pheasant.  
Only forest, just the  
ritual, nothing but  
it. Smooth metal.  
Nothing but your full eyeballs.  
And a sifted miracle's fire will wet you.  
I could dedicate  
ego, stain, and stain  
from sea shells and affections  
with a opaque ultraviolet quiver  
with bombs in my hips.  
  
It was the holiday of the oyster.
