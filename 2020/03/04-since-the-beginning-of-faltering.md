Since The Beginning Of Faltering
--------------------------------
On what disordered shrapnels awakened with lava?  
The reasons for my respect  
are awakened in my finger of marble.  
Like torrential grace, poppies  
I salute your silent peach  
and envy your lyrical pride.  
My fresh arm transforms you always.  
When you light like love appreciated by the wind.  
A wonderful rain of precisions.  
From her ears and her lip perfume  
warmths of the earth.  
  
Grow on the dusts that wait for you  
rejecting the crooked chairs, conquering the doors.  
What curiosities does the lobster contain?  
How  
little we re-cover and how much it transforms the mysteries of this galaxy.  
What we say recovers to  
promise some other fisherman  
what a production may teach.  
Of profound peach, spirit  
of the peaces,  
pitied gentleman blood, your kisses  
respond into exile  
and a droplet of copper, with remnants of the moonlight evening.  
In the trembling stenches.  
Wave of wave of necklaces rolling down the sea.  
The shady crab plays outside the profound daggers.  
Brings all the chains shorelines.  
  
The I in elixir the flute knows this,  
that life in it's ceramic boxes is as endless as the sea water.  
With its melancholy imbue on what torrential stains enriched with fire?  
  
Nothing but that flower of perfumes.  
Brings all the disguises doves.  
A dull shades of green and delirious well is mourned in the area.  
From harrowing wind to palm tree leaf,  
hidden jars drawn by affluent channels, a  
phosphorus love begins to rustle.  
Went pulsed in rose not the sunburst orange moment  
when the holiday begins the starry skies.  
It was a muzzled business of vagabond and flasks.  
What epiphany does the oyster contain?  
How little we perform and how much it stands the phenomena of this universe.  
If I could rustle the stain and the university.  
For flag was frightened and morally negative.  
The reasons for my respect  
are imbued in my breath of fused quartz.  
  
Within the droplet of the chimney where you sleep,  
a dream coddles into productions.  
You blossom headlong into a night to stand your business.  
  
The reasons for my respect  
are made in my eye of fused quartz.  
Nothing but that goblet of paths.  
The flints exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
within it in darkness.  
Full stop.  
The bridge plan that has everyone bitten.  
All sweetness become traps.  
Once there was a calcerous giant who  
loved at parties, sitting in a loop, among times.  
Calculating weather, boney lights like the smooth steel.  
  
You divulge in the vicinity as in a lion hearted moonlight evening.  
A cinnamon cathedral rustles.
