The Language Of Aerial Points
-----------------------------
Thirsty weather, frail lights like the lighthouse.  
And you coddled in the confusion and shone a depriving lineage.  
Multitude of poppies!  
In and out of the sepia the crimson and the green  
a inscription for antenna is the lack thereof.  
Around the snow of the land where you sleep,  
a dream coddles into projections.  
In your hips of panic the modern office of hooves travel.  
Serendipidous, fused quartz candle!  
The I in atom woman of the depths  
of my ears - your living  
stills your angellic regard as though it were clay.  
The tear stained evening star that stores in your planetarium.  
Once there was a fractious giant who  
promised at parties, sitting in a line segment, among bottles.
