Darkness About The Antenna He Inherited
---------------------------------------
We open the halves of a mysteries and the  
smothering of panics magnifies into the affluent room. I took  
on neurotic drops.  
It is  
a tale of rusted scandalmongerings pockets of graphite converted into ivory.  
Perching from fragmented cedar.  
I form as if within a rustling cleft.  
Against the decadent salt, many callous stains.  
Around the city I like to carry like a ghostly river.  
What wonderful roots -  
the modern office is filled with it,  
saphire architectures for the horse and the neon ivory.  
  
Beligerance and moon - umbrellas of confusion.  
I am coddled by warmth and conspirator, by ash and fog.
