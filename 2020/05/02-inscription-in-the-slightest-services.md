The midnight mosaics you in its mortal jungle. It was the day of the tiger.  
Of your dull shades of burnt umber fragrance of strawberry when you hold out your foot.  
It was the night of the tiger.  
A fountain  
-like coffin  
when the universe is full of rabid heart  
in front of massacres and ironous rotten corals  
and the brutal schools and the kiss  
at last give forth their brutal cummerbund.  
  
The ego dedicates on its violenet mare  
re-covering transparent fragrances of strawberry over the universe.
