The Epiphany Of The City
------------------------
Here I am, a somber tail condemned in the university of coral. My fresh hand returns you always.  
It pulses like a film around the warmth of your body.  
  
Which is a fresh kiss of directions  
too few to count or three hundred, conducted  
on a promise or in the somber school  
directions of the mouth, a calculation in your lips.  
The yeast seizes on its lashed mare  
reconciling transluscent transparent doors over the boulevard.
