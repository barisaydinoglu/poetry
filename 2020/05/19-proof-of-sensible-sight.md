Proof Of Sensible Sight
-----------------------
The enchanting dignity of the planetarium!  
So the spacious felicity lives on  
in a orange,  
the electrical house of the eddy,  
the parenthetical map that is arcane and resolute.  
Here I am, a trusting toe fainted in the archipeligos of maternity.  
If I could trust the viola and the city.  
Sometimes a piece of the heat  
condemns like a kiss in my brow.  
Swimming the prize of her sea shell full of respect.  
  
What is this signal but a memory abducted of its books?  
So the pure pride lives on in a cherry,  
the resplendent house of the love,  
the myriad miracle that is scrupulous and decisive.
