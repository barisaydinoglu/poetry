A Orange
--------
A noble fog of rivers.  
I do not lunge in the jungle of sterile wasteland.  
A inscription for identity is the lack thereof.  
The reasons for my respect  
are excited in my eyeballs of wooden.  
Cashmire wind to my insatiable phemonana!  
There are many vaginas within fatherless events.  
But I should be untrue to jouranlism, dismantling among its furious smooth ashes  
so let us seek to divulge a story without slightest redundancies.  
Always you smear through the fortnight  
toward the afternoon pitying spheres.  
And bridges and fleshes.  
A ritual -like billows of red smoke  
imperalist night and the molested utensil  
silence at the walls of my house.
