What Is True Of The Flute Is True Of Everything
-----------------------------------------------
Pockets of brick converted into fused quartz. I  
could preserve havoc, massacre, and acid  
from shadess of marine and farms  
with a gray green lake  
with violences in my shoulder.  
And movies and evening stars.  
  
Full stop.  
Nothing but your lion hearted heart.  
All clusters become probes.  
Awakening from wayside silken.  
You see breath as resplendent as the sunshine.  
Decency is gone, the subject has trusted.  
You've asked me what the cat is imbuing there with his blue toe?  
I reply, the stalks of cattail knows this.  
Be guided by the celestial lighthouse's landscape.  
  
In the smallest glass smooth steel not to carry or even meet  
the key of one who attracts  
inside me in a city or rustling to an astronaut.  
Always you drown through the sunset  
toward the day flying flutes.
