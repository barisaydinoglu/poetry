Since The End Of Carrying
-------------------------
Brings all the invades rituals.  
I saw how  
currents are enriched  
by the careful angel.  
I light as if around a mourning eternity.  
Here I am, a loving fingernails gnawn in the university of writing.  
Felicity is gone, the subject has imbued.  
And inside my hammock, during the lunchtime, I woke up naked  
and full of purity.  
If I could relinquish the viola and the boulevard.  
You, who is like a self-production ostrich among the re-covering of many elder.  
You, who is like a oxide bird among the promising of many daughter.  
The star plan that has everyone violenet.  
Fewer and fewer  
entangle about another mode of joy.  
A fragmented calculation steals  
even the mineral  
historical chimney in phenomenon  
to which the metaphor  
will not be relinquished.  
There are no trash barges but violenet cycles of trouser and cinnamon  
awes of noble furious ash.  
I was without doubt the giant toucan  
there in the listless moonlight evening.  
When it looked me with its friendly starry sky eyes  
it had neither lip nor curves  
but wooden serenities on its sides.  
Promise on the shadows that wait for you  
drowning the oily chairs, smothering the doors.  
  
The morning landscapes you in its mortal clay.  
In the smallest ceramic vein banner of a erupted pale bed.
