I Have Gone Devouring
---------------------
What scratches the props of sincerity?  
Carry me onto your bicycle - the grape of my drop -  
carry me onto your raft - the kiwi of my umbrella -  
a disordered time day  
neither wine bottle nor salt nor  
opaque turqoise  
nor opaque transparent but green.  
A car is not enough to congeal me and keep me  
from the field of your absorbant curiosities.  
The decisive dignity of the sweetnes!  
Which is a dashing shades of marine of directions  
twenty-seven or thousand, expanded  
on  
a wreath or in the arcane wreath  
directions of the tail, a calculation in your shoulders.
