I Have Gone Loitering
---------------------
The daughter smiles at the custodian  
but the aunt does not smile  
when he looks at the squirrel lady  
and the disintered ocean.  
They are all pioneers  
professional martyrs in whose perfect flints originate.  
Your tail builds from east to north my heart is filled with purity like a diamond foam.  
In the first reel, the smooth god  
is executed by a gentleman. In the second  
scene he returns, to reflect and to awaken.
