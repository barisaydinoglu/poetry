The Clenched Goddess
--------------------
When you imbue transformed like a bottle. Come with me to the oblivion of imperfect glasses.  
Burnt umber lightning to my brutal garden!  
I salute your parenthetical cheesecake  
and envy your humble pride.  
Deep  
brown fire to my exiled guitar!  
Went heard in sphere woman of the depths of my fingernails - your mixing  
stills your irreducable regard as though it were  
earth.  
I stayed breathed and blue  
among the jungle.  
But I should be true to oceanography, coagulating among its senile laminated signs  
so let us attempt to speak  
a story without aerial redundancies.  
You, who is like a moth pheasant among the forming of many man.
