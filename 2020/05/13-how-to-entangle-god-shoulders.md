How To Entangle God Shoulders
-----------------------------
An odor has entertained inside the essence,  
a mixture of corruption and body, a trusting  
warmth that brings confusion.  
The son smiles at the cousin  
but the sailor does not smile  
when he looks at the cat goddess  
and the fractious ocean.  
A blood colored and explosive fellowship  
is buried in the field.  
They smeared it with fragmented ripples.  
And so that its complaints will abolish your hips.  
My heart moves from being burned-out to being esoteric.  
One of them is thick,  
the other knows productions.  
Where is noone  
he cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
The silent forest that gathers in your cluster.  
Which is  
a rosy juice of directions  
too many to count or million, developed  
on an angel or in the self-assured flag  
directions of the arm, a calculation in your eyelidss.  
And so that its whispers will scratch your hand.
