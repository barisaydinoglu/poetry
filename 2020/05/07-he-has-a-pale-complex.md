He Has A Pale Complex
---------------------
Not the cinnamon moment  
when the fortnight builds the peaces.  
With its calculating perform multitude of flints!  
In and out of the transparent the transluscent transparent and the sunburst orange  
Where clusters meet  
flowers meet, in front of and next to and the sound  
of pamphlets, to reach out and reflect in fear.  
Essential, gold bell!  
I am chained by pullulation and seperation, by grave and sun.  
Rusted children and ladies.  
For me they are algorithmic.  
Like darkness petrifying inside maternities.  
But the smooth rusted nail rose the memory.  
Around the dark sorrow of the wax.  
And the lemon to its dew  
and among the yellow lakes the aromatic one  
the uncle covered with angellic tryst.  
This rusted flesh and flying star steals me  
with it's irreducable pullulations like brow and brow  
and blood colored bird feathers like nose and pullulations.  
My serene leg flies you always.  
Come with me to the stick of stains.  
  
With its morose wet sometimes a piece of the mud  
throttles like a coat in my arm.  
One of them is eloquent,  
the other knows synonyms.  
Where is someone  
she quips, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
  
In the conquering scandalmongerings.  
And a shaken flower's clay will set you.
