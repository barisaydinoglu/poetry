Point Of View Without The Rooster
---------------------------------
I'm the custodian to the fellowship of immediate miracle.  
Pockets of metal converted into ivory.  
Halfway.  
You, who is like a wall bird among the carrying of many pioneer.  
  
And a rustling candle's ice will trust you.  
Inside the region like aluminum.  
You've asked me what the iguana is magnifying there with his opaque marine lip?  
I reply, the reflection knows this.  
The aunt smiles at the goddess  
but the aunt does not smile  
when he looks at the bird uncle  
and the calcerous ocean.  
A point of view for inscription is the lack thereof.  
It was the holiday of the elephant.  
It was a smothered business of billow of gray smoke and granules.  
Of a rust colored elder that flies souls.  
  
It was the night of the ostrich.  
Pockets of ash converted into ceramic.
