Your Hips Is Enough
-------------------
In my area at night you are like an aspen  
and your form and colour the way I carry them. Rustling a love  
lived in the deedy mist.  
And you pitied in the animosity and shone a dying salt.  
What secrets does the toucan  
contain?  
How little we blossom and how much it rustles the funny things of this computer simulation.  
But I should be true to science, invading among its frail maternities  
so let us seek to divulge a story devoid of aerial redundancies.
