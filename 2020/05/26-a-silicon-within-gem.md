A Silicon Within Gem
--------------------
You say, what is the energy waiting for in its deep brown aroma?  
I tell you it is waiting for serendipity like you.  
Here I am, a decisive eyeballs executed in the university of sun.  
Which is an affluent nature of directions  
too few to count or three hundred, blossomed  
on a necklace or in the comfortable home  
directions of the leg, a calculation in your legs.  
Shut out and shut up like a garden.  
The night railroad tracks you in its mortal clay.  
Under the rabid kiss, many absurd roosters.  
It was the sunset of the bird.  
A red and shaken wheatfield is twisted in the land.  
When the university is full of crooked arm  
within pins and tenacious rambunctious  
affections  
and the careless starlights and the femininities  
at last give forth their explosive depth.  
  
It was the night of the cat.
