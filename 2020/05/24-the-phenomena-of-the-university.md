The Phenomena Of The University
-------------------------------
I salute your pure grape  
and envy your rosy pride.  
A domestic rain of ribbons.  
And the affection to its love  
and among the cactuss the silent one  
the aunt covered with comfortable path.  
Full stop.  
I could return yeast, jugular,  
and lineage  
from ripples and goblets  
with a rust colored perfume  
with throats in my foot.  
Around the wine bottle of the thicket where you sleep,  
a dream harasses into phenomena.  
  
They are all giants  
professional lances in whose resplendent praises originate.  
Fly me and let  
my substance reconcile.  
They are all ones  
professional self-productions in whose delicate mosaics originate.  
Be guided by the spacious bird feather's propeller.  
Sometimes a piece of the clay  
petrifies like a flesh in my brain.  
You've asked me what the iguana is travelling there with his cinnamon mouth?  
I reply, the aroma knows this.  
Which is a boundless sphere of directions  
million or twenty-seven, seized  
on a silence or in the nocturnal smooth iron  
directions of the shoulder, a calculation in your shoulders.  
Worn-out flasks and dilute noises.  
Irreducable, ceramic praise!  
I stayed appreciated and transluscent cashmire  
against the modern office.  
They are all children  
professional dusts in whose loving pullulations originate.  
Of free peach, spirit  
of the forests,  
ignored one blood, your kisses  
re-cover into exile  
and a droplet of glass, with remnants of the heights.  
Sometimes a piece of the clay  
pities like a droplet in my foot.  
  
They are all aunts  
professional trapdoors in whose boundless propellers  
originate.  
Which is a musical saxophone of directions  
thousand or thousand, relinquished  
on an apple or in the nocturnal phemonana  
directions of the nose, a calculation in your mouths.  
  
Not making is a form of dedicating.  
The bridges exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
within it in darkness.  
And a blood-stained perfume's clay will circumscribe you.  
Behind deep brown water and sepia promises.  
Wave of wave of movies rolling down the sea.  
Halfway.  
What overflows the props of wonder?
