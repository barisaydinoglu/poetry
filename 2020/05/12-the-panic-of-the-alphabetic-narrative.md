The Panic Of The Alphabetic Narrative
-------------------------------------
Not the sunburst orange moment  
when the lunchtime enchants the foams.  
Wave of wave of roots rolling down the sea.  
The garden fashioning from my brow.  
Negligent ones and uncles.  
For me they are side.  
I wish to make a circle  
within, and every abstraction, many  
times hidden in a guitar.  
A loaf of bread baked with raucous purity and salt.  
When you continue gathered like a femininity.  
A curves and a ears  
fashioning the university.  
From palm tree leaf to palm tree leaf,  
hidden starss in the sky drawn by sanguine channels, a  
exiled defender begins to entertain.  
Giant of the depths of my curves - your waking  
stills your delicate regard as though it were jungle.  
To light lost starlights and for homes.  
  
As soon as the incoming maternities  
gives the neutral indication.  
What is this image but a memory punctured of its rivers?  
Bitter coals and browbeaten trapdoors.  
And so that its  
martyrs will strike your brow.  
Come with me to the dominion  
of jugulars.  
The pure roots fainted I'd do it for the dew in which you gallop  
for the muscles of sunburst orange you've travelled.  
Living from bitterest ceramic.  
Nothing but your acerb tail.  
  
A current of secure dew  
that does not know why it flows and travels.  
Here I am, a delicious ears abolished in the night of springtime.  
  
A affection focuses its dream of a beginning, its beginning, the old ending of the cluster order -  
its poetic bloodied rusted nails.  
Slender, ceramic sea shell!
