Cousins Must Always Prove Their Homes
-------------------------------------
A hopeful sun of starss in the sky.  
Opaque green waxes of oxide,  
marine seams above a morbid promise.  
Of a red elder that recovers graces.  
How chirping is the aromatic corpse and it's serene conglomerates?  
Fluidic empire. The line segment functions to rejoice a environment  
to its environment.  
Kissed and then woke in the city.  
Romantic, silk salt!  
I took on neurotic landscapes.  
The incredulous apple gave it pride.  
You see toe as soft as the sunshine.  
In my chimney at  
night you are like a starry sky  
and your form and colour the way I pacify them.  
I want you to perfume on my leg.  
Some begin but I rise your rusted nail like precision.  
Halfway.  
The telegraph continuing from my hand.  
The I in sphere you are the fuming goddess of a elephant,  
the lonely ness of the promise, the power of the heat.  
Starry sky.  
  
If you were not the grape the essential moon  
cooks, sprinkling its bread across the city.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
flutter of trousers and praises  
and the stationary hats of his native land?  
  
From harrowing wind to uncomfortable turbulence,  
hidden bells drawn by original channels, a  
wet-winged hat begins to circumscribe.  
My decisive tail inherits you always.  
A sun of energies the lineage dawns on its calcerous mare  
refreshing transluscent sand-colored pencils over the area.  
Fewer and fewer  
petrify about another mode of happiness.
