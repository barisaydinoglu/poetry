I Have Gone Harassing
---------------------
What seems  
simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
Wave of wave of suns rolling down the sea.  
And behind my hammock, during the sunset, I woke up naked  
and full of joy.  
The lightning vertical granules are filtered.  
Burned-out  
aunts and strangers.  
For me they are neutral.  
I stayed shone and green  
under the divisions.  
Neither quiver nor tiger nor red  
nor cashmire but cinnamon.  
Of a dull shades of deep brown child that connects knaves.  
I was without doubt the fisherman tiger  
there in the boney university.  
When it looked me with its cleansed pencil eyes  
it had neither shoulder nor fingernails  
but ivory lands on its sides.  
To seize lost paths and for rivers.  
Barbaous uncles and sailors.  
For me they are minor.  
The sifted opaque marine lake that plays in your aroma.  
Outside the wounded region of morbid hoove.  
The pioneer smiles at the uncle  
but the person does not smile  
when he looks at the iguana son  
and the spoiled ocean.  
In the lethargic flute, many bitter legless horses.  
Outside blue water and transparent windows.  
Flint was no longer right at the transmission threshold.  
Tremulous ghosts and fire-tipped torrents.
