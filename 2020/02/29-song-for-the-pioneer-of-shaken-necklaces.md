Song For The Pioneer Of Shaken Necklaces
----------------------------------------
Burnt umber and manly person,  
as soon as the incoming aromas  
gives the side indication.  
To fashion lost silences  
and for laws.  
I took on bleak drops.  
The sea shell connecting from my eyeballs.  
The jungle amid hers  
a tale we tell in passing,  
with notions of purity  
and a passion for photography and science  
  
The I in sun I want you to grow on my hand.  
Be guided by the myriad key's reflection.  
Be guided by the charitable law's trouser.  
And around my hammock, during the holiday, I woke up naked  
and full of wonder.  
Standing the sphere of her ivory architecture full of happiness.
