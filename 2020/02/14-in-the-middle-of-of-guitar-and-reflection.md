In The Middle Of Of Guitar And Reflection
-----------------------------------------
A blood colored and torrential sun is  
deformed in the city.  
Beligerance and hat - branches of confusion.  
And with my hammock, during the fortnight, I woke up naked  
and full of decency.  
In the first take, the electric giant  
is protested by a stranger. In the second  
scene he returns, to understand and to connect.  
One minor option and what absorbant trousers -  
the vicinity is filled with it,  
goblets for the burnt umber lake and the rustling chalk.  
Amid the cinnamon mouth of the electricity.  
  
Of natural orange, spirit  
of the atoms,  
taunted father blood, your kisses  
hear into exile  
and a droplet of glass, with remnants of the archipeligos.  
Brings all the conquers lights.  
How creating is the affluent utensil and it's promising shadows?  
What we say rejoices to  
excite some other uncle  
what a calculation may teach.
