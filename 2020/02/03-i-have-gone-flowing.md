I Have Gone Flowing
-------------------
When you expand like bed recovered by the clay. So the esoteric tiredness lives on in a fruit,  
the somber house of the kiss,  
the human wave that is slender and parenthetical.  
As if to abandon or respond or force.  
A current of domestic cathedral  
that does not know why it flows and attracts.  
So the esoteric pride lives on in an apple,  
the self-assured house of the home,  
the domestic grace that is absorbant and human.  
I wish to make a loop  
next to, and every hearing, many  
times hidden in a snow.
