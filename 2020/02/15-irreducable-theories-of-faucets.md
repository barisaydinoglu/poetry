Irreducable Theories Of Faucets
-------------------------------
Your path is a ribbon filled with fragmented tiger. It pulses like a maternity outside the fountain.  
Not seeking is a form of enriching.  
Where starlights meet  
trees meet, with and among and the sound  
of croaks, to reach out and imbue in agony.  
A current of fluidic sun  
that does not know why it flows and flows.  
Towards those miracles of yours that wait for me.  
Shut up and shut up like a springtime.
