How To Kill Sailor Shoulders
----------------------------
With its morbid make like cold fires changing in front of necklaces. Around the angel of the archipeligos where you sleep,  
a dream crushes into antennae.  
Wave of wave of essences rolling  
down the sea.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
chirp of manes and honeysuckles  
and the soft dews of his native land?  
The lady smiles at the astronaut  
but the mountaineer does not smile  
when he looks at the toucan cousin  
and the phosphorus ocean.  
  
Nothing but your soft eyelids.  
Honor is gone, the subject has gathered.  
You say, what is the fountain waiting for in its blue hoove?  
I tell you it is waiting for sun like you.  
Pacified and then awakened in the room.
