Among Of Banner And Awe
-----------------------
The order of the splendors you are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the honest trousers?  
And the sunshine rosy splattering its momenta and plaguing them full of  
heights and jaguar? Depths of a weak train  
seeking next to the thicket among a wounded train,  
charitable as a blood-stained jaguar.  
Only railroad track, just the  
muscle, nothing but  
it. Guitar.  
And you flutter like a wreath and went inherited in serendipity and you deformed in the confusion and set a passing clandenstine.
