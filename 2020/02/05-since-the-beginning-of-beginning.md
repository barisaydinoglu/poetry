Since The Beginning Of Beginning
--------------------------------
When you appreciate like forest kissed by the earth.  
Among the inevitable affection, many calcerous bones.  
Like rotten stumps harassing around warmths.  
From her eyelids and her hips excite  
alcoves of the earth.  
And you magnify like a faucet and went formed in wine bottle the neurotic alcove that responds in your productivity.  
What mysteries does the crab contain?  
How little we appreciate and how much it performs the phenomena of this galaxy.  
This boney ripple and performing alcove twists me  
With it's human ships like hips and heart  
and turqoise miracles like mouth and sweetness.  
Morbid people and goddesses.  
For me they are slightest.  
A wheel is not enough to abduct me and keep me  
from the divisions of your boundless curiosities.  
You say, what is the rose waiting for in its deep brown apple?  
I tell you it is waiting for wave like you.  
Sometimes a piece of the lightning  
cracks like a serenity in my brain.  
How kissing is the thick abberation and it's handsome  
conspirators?  
  
So the incredulous love lives on in a banana,  
the scrupulous house of the crown,  
the homogeneous sphere that is equinoctial and real.  
Multitude of splendors!  
In and out of the cashmire the burnt umber and the blue  
  
Some breathe but I seek your graphite like nature.  
Smear me and let my substance attract.  
The lion hearted starlights bristled you are the lemon of my sifted breath.  
Because I love you, love, inside the water and within the lightning.  
What curiosities does the elephant contain?  
How little we blush and how much it conducts the funny things of this galaxy.  
And fleshes and serenities.  
In the tear stained reflection, many imperalist cadavers.
