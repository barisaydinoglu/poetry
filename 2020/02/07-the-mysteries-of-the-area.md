The Mysteries Of The Area
-------------------------
A eye and a mouth  
enchanting the sea.  
Only wreath, just the  
branch, nothing but  
it. Kiss.  
What we say blossoms to  
dawn some other sailor  
what a detail may teach.  
I could divulge imbroglio, error, and vigil  
from doves and mosaics  
with a opaque black awe  
with daggers in my nose.
