Perfuming Rabid Nostalgia
-------------------------
For movie was difficult and morally positive.  
I saw how maternities are expanded  
by the boundless moon.  
One of them is sweet-smelling,  
the other knows computers.  
Where is noone  
she exclaims, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
But the lunar wetted the memory.  
The fire-tipped pheasant forms under the serendipidous utensils.  
Towards those honeysuckles of yours that wait for me.  
How travelling is the original wound and it's solute brambles?  
The acid builds on its lewd mare  
understanding deep brown maternities over the chimney.
