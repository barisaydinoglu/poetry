Faith Is An Episode Of Belt
---------------------------
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the electric essences?  
And the rain humble splattering its doves and drowning them full of  
area and turkey? For a day, maybe million,  
I rested under a unrelenting rain  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the one to be amid.  
I could inherit gate, lance, and imperfect copper  
from branches and hearts  
with a ultraviolet lunar  
with twisting lonely roads in my hand.  
You are the kiwi of my morose fingernails.  
Outside the night like steel.  
To the resplendent color of the fused quartz sphere.  
Not the cinnamon moment  
when the sunset dawns the trousers.  
Towards those clusters of yours that wait for me.  
  
I salute your warm nectarine  
and envy your brandishing pride.  
The starry sky knows this,  
that life in it's saphire boxes is as endless as the yellow lake.  
We open the halves of a mysteries and the  
mourning of graves develops into the soft field.  
We get the sight  
they must lots to grow  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but enemies.  
Perhaps they are not scratched.
