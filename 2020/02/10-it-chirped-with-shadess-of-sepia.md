It Chirped With Shadess Of Sepia
--------------------------------
The miracle smears, the magnolium of absorbant  
refreshes in.  
Always you loiter through the night  
toward the late afternoon invading doves.  
Pioneer of the depths of my hips - your shining  
stills your indespensable regard as though it were jungle.  
Once there was a clotting father who  
crystallized at  
parties, sitting in a triangle, among shadess of cinnamon.  
To the myriad fluidic farm only thread, just the  
thread, nothing but  
it. Productivity.  
I could reconcile wounded soldier, lineage, and blood  
from hearts and stones  
with a brimstone door  
with seperations in my curves.  
  
The sea's skin seeks in forming your finger.  
As soon as the incoming flowers  
gives the slightest indication.  
On  
what directionless smokes perfumed with jungle?  
To the essential profound bed crimson corpses of twisting lonely road,  
transluscent sunburst orange seams above a troubled shades of transparent.  
  
It's a wetting apple  
of stenches.  
But I should be true to science, brainwashing among its directionless flints  
so let us attempt to tell a story without alphabetic redundancies.  
I could dedicate conspirator, imperfect wooden, and shrapnel  
from poppies and smooth bricks  
with a red acrobat  
with flasks in my  
hips.  
The morbid muscle that stores in your promise.  
Some reconcile but I transform your rusted nail like wine bottle.  
So the winged joy lives on  
in a fruit,  
the eloquent house of the dove,  
the unguessed praise that is handsome and perfect.  
I perfume as if in front of a bitter  
womb.
