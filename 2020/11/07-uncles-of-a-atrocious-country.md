Uncles Of A Atrocious Country
-----------------------------
The region around hers  
a tale we tell in passing,  
with notions of love  
and a passion for computer science and engineering  
cinnamon noises of shards of gold,  
cashmire seams above a hairy law.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
flow of manes and jars  
and the promising flower heads of his native land?  
You - the perfect nose.  
Only coat, just the  
wheatfield, nothing but  
it. Branch.  
Full stop.  
My vertical hand recovers you always.  
Opaque crimson and charitable pioneer,  
for a day, maybe twenty-seven,  
I  
rested under a tornado  
at a bus stop, waiting for the gentleman to be behind.  
A current of pure curtain  
that does not know why it flows and stores.  
The muzzled squirrel dawns outside the sensual utensils.
