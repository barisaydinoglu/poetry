The Boneless Explication
------------------------
Not pulsing is a form of showering. The I in reflection in the face of so many yeasts to positivity.  
I'm the one to the elixir of immediate kiss.  
A loaf of bread baked with sterile tiredness and salt.  
A vessel is not enough to prosecute me and keep me  
from the area of your brandishing curiosities.  
In your hips of striking the city begins to dream of seizing.  
Full stop.  
You are the lemon of my imperalist leg.  
Closed off and shut out like a shoreline.
