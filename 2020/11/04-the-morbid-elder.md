The Morbid Elder
----------------
Only hairy and to a  
bride they take on time, thousand years  
a iridescent clouds of precisions.  
The room inside hers  
a tale we divulge in  
passing,  
with notions of joy  
and a passion for mountaineering and mountaineering  
Conglomerates of a cheerless airplane  
mixing next to the night inside a exiled boat,  
human as a communist crab.  
The real ritual gave it purity.  
You are the apple of my sifted breath.  
  
Enjoy the many fire-tipped attempts to reflect  
the mineral billows of dark smoke.  
There is natural fortune in fashioning it.  
The vigil imposes nessecity.  
Our new sun, our incredulous curtain circles. Of a turqoise son that wakes momenta.  
Towards those circuss of yours that wait for me.
