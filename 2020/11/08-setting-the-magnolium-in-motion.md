Setting The Magnolium In Motion
-------------------------------
I salute your deedy sugar  
and envy your enduring pride. Nothing but that tree of ribbons.  
To enrich lost stones and for drops.  
All fountains become rectums.  
What we say seeks to  
flow some other goddess  
what a calculation may teach.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.
