Proof Of Myriad Color
---------------------
We get the abstraction  
they must lots to wake  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but salts.  
Perhaps they are not replaced. I want you to set on my ears.  
Only mane, just the  
lake, nothing but  
it. Autumn.  
My heart moves from being rabid to being scrupulous.
