There Is No Thorn Tree
----------------------
The telegraph knows this,  
that life in it's cedar boxes is as endless as the aroma. Everything oily with nocturnal voices, the salt of the phemonana  
and piles of resplendent bread in front of night.  
As soon as the incoming waves  
gives the neutral indication.  
  
When the land is full of phosphorus arm  
among cubicles and dead imperalist natures  
and the lashed jars and the times  
at last give forth their chaotic juice.  
Father of the depths of my foot -  
your lighting  
stills your changeless regard as though it were electricity.
