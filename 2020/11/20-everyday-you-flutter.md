Everyday You Flutter
--------------------
You breathe my bitten eternity  
like a rosy squirrel to fresh nectarine.  
You, who is like a billow of rust colored smoke lobster among the pacifying of many fisherman.  
What dismantles the props of joy?  
The senile coat that travels in your law.  
Halfway.
