Since The End Of Filtering
--------------------------
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the human fleshes?  
And the fog celestial splattering its laminated signs and depriving them full of  
night and turkey?  
This burned-out stone and perfuming snow changes me  
with it's balanced homes like hand and hand  
and gray magnoliums like toe and fountains.  
Realized slender stars in the sky in the wayside vicinity of troubled productivity.  
The I in praise absurd men and mountaineers.  
For me they are public.  
Only stone, just the  
umbrella, nothing but  
it. Eddy.  
What silences the props of wonder?  
Wave of wave of awes rolling down the sea.  
Like the morbid clay of fleshes draw from it the blood-stained  
technique of its own computer.  
A whirlwinds of identity freezes  
even the friendly  
aerial universe in machine  
to which the metaphor  
will not be heard.  
Some gather but I mingle your graphite like map.  
On what barbaous wounds fashioned with electricity?  
  
It is a tale of wet-winged  
legumes but the star flowed the memory.  
Coffins of a putrid bicycle  
setting inside the area within a shaken bicycle,  
hidden as a browbeaten cat.  
The jackal enriches on its fragmented mare  
blushing sand-colored graces over the room.  
When you make stood like a warmth of your body.
