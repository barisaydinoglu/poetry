The Wax Fallen Into The Sea
---------------------------
And you dropped in the beligerance and chirped a dying rooster.  
The I in thread I saw how evening stars are mingled  
by the slender grape.  
Multitude of bells!  
In and out of the blue the sunburst orange and the crimson  
enriching  
a landscape  
dawned in the clear wind.  
  
Where aspens meet  
lighthouses meet, outside and inside and the sound  
of dungs, to reach out  
and understand in sorrow.  
Where sea's skins meet  
paths meet, with and in and the sound  
of uranus, to reach out and protect in animosity.
