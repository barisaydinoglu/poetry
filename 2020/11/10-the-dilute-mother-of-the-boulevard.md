The Dilute Mother Of The Boulevard
----------------------------------
My heart is filled with felicity like a glass juice. Indicates the saxophone's responding heart. I took on demonic ships.  
Wave of wave of bird feathers rolling down the sea.  
Not standing is a form  
of protecting.  
Skeleton wombs and dead martyrs.  
But the defender crystallized the memory.  
Like bombs passing around waves.  
  
The perfume passes, the heart of blazing  
connects in.  
For a day, maybe twenty-seven,  
I rested under a ray of sunlight  
at a post office, waiting for the sailor to be within.
