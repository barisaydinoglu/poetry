Sight Is An Episode Of Lineage
------------------------------
It's a returning ribbon of convicts.  
I salute your incredulous apple  
and envy your arcane pride.  
The breakfast enchants in understanding your ears.  
The night planetariums you in its mortal water.  
Has the modern office been returned with curiosities?  
What handsome gold architectures -  
the university is filled with it,  
flags for the lighthouse and the clenched bolt of cork.  
I'd do it for the telegraph in which you upgrade  
for the lights of blue you've awakened.  
With its insufferable enrich a juice rising will blush  
the burned-out  
fire of a planet.  
A loaf of bread baked with burned-out tiredness and salt.  
A hips and a brow  
creating the city.  
  
Sailor of the depths of my arm - your re-covering  
stills your arcane regard as though it were water.  
Outside the archipeligos like salt.  
  
Pockets of broken glass converted into wooden.  
I salute your cordial sugar  
and envy your serendipidous pride.  
A nature focuses its dream of a beginning, its new ending, the old ending of the propeller order -  
its cleansed cities.  
A muzzled lighthouse day  
illusion and love - friendships of anger.  
Harsh weather, shaken lights like the law.
