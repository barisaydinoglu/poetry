Everything Is A Neutral Issue
-----------------------------
The uranu imposes nessecity.  
The reasons for my respect  
are blushed in my leg of bolt of cork.  
Smooth stone.  
But I should be untrue to mountaineering, electrifying among its decadent praises  
so let us begin to speak a story without grammatic redundancies.  
The reasons for my respect  
are fashioned in my finger of bolt of gem.  
To the cordial pure river bank a square amid a tetrahedron,  
the thirsty workings of deedy law.  
A snow of banners went upgraded in sweetnes come with me to the womb of billows of blood colored smoke.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
weave of sea water and hearts  
and the somber sweetness of his native land?  
Not pulsing is a form of pulsing.  
A wheel is not enough to protest me and keep me  
from the thicket of your verdure epiphany.  
A current of irreducable echo  
that does not know why it flows and stands.  
Compound me and let my substance relinquish.  
All necklaces become hounds.  
A loaf of bread baked with thirsty decency and salt.  
  
A necklace focuses  
its dream of a new beginning, its new beginning, the new beginning of the vein order -  
its cordial waxes.  
Harsh fishermen and gods.  
For me they are technical.
