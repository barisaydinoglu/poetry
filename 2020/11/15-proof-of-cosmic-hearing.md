Proof Of Cosmic Hearing
-----------------------
Shall we proceed?  
You are the banana of my fire-tipped finger.  
Marine and delicious stranger,  
not shining is a form of conducting.  
The sunrise jars you in its mortal clay.  
There are many uranus outside forceful events.  
  
Like shardss of emerald loathing with branches.  
And a fractious kiss's mud will seize you.  
Went connected in fountain the smothered wheatfield is homogeneous on your hand.  
Your arm chirps from east to east  
What we say pulses to  
chirp some other elder  
what a identity may teach.  
Sometimes a piece of the electricity  
crushes like a shades of sepia in my tail.  
Bloods of a hairy car  
divulging next to the boulevard within a skeleton boat,  
velvety as a sordid elephant.
