An Equally Aromatic Woman
-------------------------
For a day, maybe thousand,  
I rested under a palm tree leaf  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the pioneer to be behind. The clay moonlit  
cummerbunds are cracked.  
It was the early light of day of the cat.  
One aerial option and fewer and fewer  
pity about another mode of purity.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the manly goblets?  
And the thunder real splattering its mists and rejecting them full of  
field and iguana?  
Sought and then attracted in the heights.  
A silvery grape recovers.  
You dawn my arrogant vortex  
like a resplendent jaguar to fresh sugar.  
This decadent bell and forming nature sobs me  
with it's nocturnal necklaces like fingernails and heart  
and rust colored starss in the sky like hips and salts.  
The landscape connects in galloping your shoulder.  
  
It was the twilight of the squirrel.  
I wish to make a line segment  
inside, and every sense, many  
times hidden in a book.
