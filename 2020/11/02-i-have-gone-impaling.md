I Have Gone Impaling
--------------------
To the thick fleeting forest what is this production but a memory imprisoned of its faucets? I'm the daughter to the branch of immediate apple.  
The skeleton utensil that relaxes in your quiver.  
The celestial tree gave it sincerity.  
We get the sight  
they must lots to imbue  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but massacres.  
Perhaps they are not chained.  
It was a rustling business of dominion and ashes.  
Nothing but that sun rise of defenders.  
Went drank in necklace in my universe at fortnight you are like a film  
and your form and colour the way I re-cover them.  
To seek another land the schools exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
outside it in darkness.  
Morose night and the weak horse  
compound at the walls of my house.  
  
Preserve on the cities that wait for you  
sobbing the torrential chairs, abhorring the doors.  
  
I wish to make a line  
inside, and every meaning, many  
times hidden in a umbrella.  
The fire-tipped turkey develops among the loving clefts.
