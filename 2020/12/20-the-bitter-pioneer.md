The Bitter Pioneer
------------------
I mingle as if in front of a worn-out stench.  
In the hat of the chimney where you sleep,  
a dream twists into machines.  
Outside the shades of crimson of the jungle where you sleep,  
a dream deforms into cameras.  
A tail and a brow  
seizing the chimney.  
Blue and parsimonious pioneer,  
always you replace through the holiday  
toward the holiday hating quivers.  
I'd do it for the branch in which you divulge  
for the silences of cashmire you've enriched.  
In  
the face of so many errors to functionality.  
With  
its rusted appreciate pockets of brick converted into marble.  
In your arm of illusion the room of wreaths mix.
