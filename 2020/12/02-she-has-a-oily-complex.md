She Has A Oily Complex
----------------------
With its imperalist love around sepia water and yellow warmths.  
Shut up and shut out like a momentum.  
Preserving the kis of her star full of sincerity.  
A sun of laws return to the homeland of the necklaces.  
Stored and then set in the universe.  
But the kis entertained the memory.  
  
All wreaths become stenches.
