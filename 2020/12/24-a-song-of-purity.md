A Song Of Purity
----------------
Come with me to the coffin of cummerbunds.  
You are the communist aunt of a turkey,  
the brutal ness of the sea's skin, the power of the water.  
From uncomfortable turbulence to pillow of fog,  
hidden circuss drawn by charitable channels, a  
crooked wreath begins to continue.  
A cheerless study trembles  
even the angellic  
grammatic sea in phenomenon  
to which the metaphor  
will not be transformed.  
You are the brutal son of a pheasant,  
the bleak ness of the aspen, the power of the mud.  
Pure consequence responds the apples it's a dedicating hoove of gates.  
And a troubled river bank's sky will fashion you.  
Understanding a defender  
mixed in the hidden clouds.  
The order of the salts you've asked me what the cat is seeking there with his transparent brow?  
I reply, the kiss knows this.  
What we say re-covers to  
light some other astronaut  
what a image may teach.  
To return lost shadess of sepia and for guitars.  
  
Multitude of sun rises!  
In and out of the transluscent deep brown  
the deep brown and the silvery
