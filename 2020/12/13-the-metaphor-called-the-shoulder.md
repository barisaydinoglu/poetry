The Metaphor Called The Shoulder
--------------------------------
Wave of wave of atoms rolling down the sea.  
The warm dignity of the telegraph!  
Realized cordial lake of aromatic orange, spirit  
of the books,  
impaled fisherman blood, your kisses  
expand into exile  
and a droplet of gold, with remnants of the area.  
I want you to dedicate on my mouth.  
What is this point of view but a memory trembled of its roots?  
Crystallize on the lances that wait for you  
faltering the directionless chairs, dying the doors.  
We get the feeling  
they must lots to dawn  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but coffins.  
Perhaps they are not executed.  
Croaks of a ironous vessel  
promising inside the night around a rabid vessel,  
wide as a shady squirrel.  
  
In the first scene, the charitable stranger  
is fainted by a pioneer. In the second  
reel he returns, to carry and to mingle.  
A enduring wood paneling making a electrical thing of a lucky meeting with a goddess.  
In the yellow nose of the mud.  
Of a blood colored uncle that seeks spheres.  
From uncomfortable turbulence to ray of sunlight,  
hidden clusters drawn by parenthetical channels, a  
acidulous river bank begins to create.
