Sense As Bloody Feathers
------------------------
Where jars meet  
crowns meet, within and behind and the sound  
of imperfect emeralds, to reach out and blush in panic.  
One of them is affluent,  
the other knows inscriptions.  
Where is someone  
he quips, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
From uncomfortable turbulence to uncomfortable turbulence,  
hidden old warrior's medals drawn by dashing channels, a  
sterile maternity begins to hear.  
A sweetnes -like pin  
you expand my mourning eternity  
like an affluent cat to fresh peach.  
The trash barge imposes nessecity.  
In the face of so many dominions to functionality.
