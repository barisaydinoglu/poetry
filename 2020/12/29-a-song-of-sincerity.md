A Song Of Sincerity
-------------------
We get the hearing  
they must lots to hear  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but cummerbunds.  
Perhaps they are not devoured.  
The clenched oyster wakes under the domestic panics.  
And you silenced in the sorrow and attracted a soddening cummerbund.  
You respond my bitten belt  
like a sensual cat to fresh apple.  
Neither wine bottle nor essence nor gray  
nor green but yellow.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
Respond  
of beds and movies  
and the eloquent tigers of his native land?
