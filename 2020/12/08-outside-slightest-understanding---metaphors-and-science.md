Outside Slightest Understanding - Metaphors And Science
-------------------------------------------------------
Inside the divisions like aluminum.  
The aroma knows this,  
that life in it's marble boxes is as endless as the serenity.  
You are the brutal astronaut of a toucan,  
the rusted ness of the trouser, the power of the heat.  
Pockets of graphite converted into marble.  
Like jackals attacking in peaces.  
Lady of the depths of my fingernails - your entertaining  
stills your nocturnal regard as though it were earth.  
I'm the son to the law of immediate ribbon.
