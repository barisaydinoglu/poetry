Enriching Crooked Nostalgia
---------------------------
A quadrangle behind a circle,  
the distorted workings of noble law.  
Transparent legless horses of cleft,  
marine seams above a putrid smooth metal.  
Fewer and fewer  
electrify about another mode of respect.  
Of a black man that treads alcoves.  
Our new sea's skin, our self-assured bridge tetrahedrons.  
Like inaccessible smooth rusted nail, pastures  
starry, saphire friendship!  
  
Yellow trapdoors of womb,  
cinnamon seams above a cold garden.  
In the night like broken glass.  
I could rejoice billows of dark smoke, abys, and enemy  
from apples and droplets  
with a black branch  
with gates in my brain.  
To seek another land the astronaut smiles at the giant  
but the aunt does not smile  
when he looks at the pheasant lady  
and the disordered ocean.  
Like lards burying around green cars.  
When you promise like form relaxed by the wind.  
Carrying a ripple  
showered in the plumed thunder.  
And so that its lightnings will forebode your eye.  
A production for camera is the lack thereof.  
When you continue enchanted like an apple.
