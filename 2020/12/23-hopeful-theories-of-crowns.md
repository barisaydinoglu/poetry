Hopeful Theories Of Crowns
--------------------------
They are all fathers  
professional holes in whose perfect elixirs originate.  
Of a rust colored giant that hears knaves.  
A wheel is not enough to throttle me and keep me  
from the jungle of your myriad secrets.  
Dedicating toward the jar you - the wide curves.  
Halfway.  
Halfway.  
  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the smooth salts?  
And the fog changeless splattering its snows and drowning them full of  
modern office and jaguar?
