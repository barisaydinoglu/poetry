From Water To Sky
-----------------
The blazing coats compounded my heart moves from being fatherless to being equinoctial.  
Of your ultraviolet sea's skin when you hold out your ears.  
You say, what is the star waiting for in its cinnamon root?  
I tell you it is waiting for propeller like you.  
A boat is not enough to freeze me and keep me  
from the region of your full funny things.
