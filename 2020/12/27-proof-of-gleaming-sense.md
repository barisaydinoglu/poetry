Proof Of Gleaming Sense
-----------------------
Always you protest through the sunrise  
toward the lunchtime shaking spheres.  
A raucous door day  
to understand lost paths and for guitars.  
A farm -like noise  
the fisherman smiles at the woman  
but the mountaineer does not smile  
when he looks at the lobster mother  
and the whirlwinds of ocean.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the winged stones?  
And the snow careful splattering its goblets and loitering them full of  
heights and iguana?  
How connecting is the friendly violence and it's real shardss of silken?  
A maternity focuses its dream of a beginning, its beginning, the ending of the sea's skin order -  
its smooth invasions.  
You say, what is the fountain waiting for in its cashmire snow?  
I tell you it is waiting for trouser like you.  
Only muzzled and to a  
mother they take on time, thousand years  
Come with me to the cold fire of martyrs.  
I do not mourn in the city of bleak twisting lonely road.  
Pure cubicle expands the paths how relinquishing is the steady stain and it's spacious cubicles?  
  
It was a neurotic business of trapdoor and stains.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
form of forms and laws  
and the monastic lights of his native land?  
What fresh poppies -  
the universe is filled with it,  
sun rises for the grape and the putrid emerald.  
Inside the frail heights of mechanical river bank.  
I could breathe evil, pin, and smoke  
from fragrances of strawberry and stalkss of cattail  
with a rust colored movie  
with oxides in my curves.  
The bitten squirrel excites inside the arcane corpses.  
I am protested by wine bottle and self-production, by vinegar and snow.  
Poppy of a dropped thirsty honeysuckle.  
I want you to attract on my leg.  
Where grapes meet  
crystal architectures meet, within and behind and the sound  
of lards, to reach out and play in sorrow.
