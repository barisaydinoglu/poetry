Language With The Probe
-----------------------
Shut up and shut up like an affection. You, who is like a throat toucan among the galloping of many custodian.  
The thorn tree imposes nessecity.  
From tornado to blade of grass,  
hidden sea's skins drawn by warm channels, a  
furious map begins to seize.  
Perfumed and then mixed in the city.  
Wave of wave of peaces rolling down the sea.  
Our new old warrior's medal, our profound praise circles.  
Whirlwinds of cummerbunds and crooked utensils.  
An odor has carried under the flesh,  
a mixture of convict and body, a reflecting  
guitar that brings sorrow.
