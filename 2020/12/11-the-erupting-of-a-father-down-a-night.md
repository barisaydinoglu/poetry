The Erupting Of A Father Down A Night
-------------------------------------
Stenches of a bitterest airplane  
waking in the vicinity with a bruised train,  
eloquent as a ghostly oyster.  
The wind round oxides are rejected.  
Always you smear through the midnight  
toward the afternoon harassing ships.  
What we say dawns to  
love some other uncle  
what a detail may  
teach.  
I was without doubt the elder turkey  
there in the smothered universe.  
When it looked me with its stationary leaf eyes  
it had neither fingernails nor mouth  
but cork breakfasts on its sides.  
And you fashion like a silence and realized moonlit quilt sometimes a piece of the lava  
coagulates like a flower in my hand.  
Neither telegraph nor guitar nor blood colored  
nor cashmire but sunburst orange.  
In the first take, the delicious cousin  
is wetted by a custodian. In the second  
scene he returns, to discover and to connect.  
One of them is original,  
the other knows identities.  
Where is someone  
he exclaims, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
A bicycle is not enough to reject me and keep me  
from the chimney of your slender curiosities.  
Went continued in vein  
a chorus of pheasants at sunrise un built un crushed  
comes to a halt before a rose.  
  
But the prize reflected the memory.  
You've asked me what the elephant is circumscribing there with his sand-colored eyeballs?  
I  
reply, the faucet knows this.
