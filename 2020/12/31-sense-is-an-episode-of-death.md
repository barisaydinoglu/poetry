Sense Is An Episode Of Death
----------------------------
To expand lost hooves and for sea water.  
Halfway.  
You are the tomato of my misunderstood shoulder.  
You - the infinite heart.  
A vein focuses its dream of a ending, its new beginning, the new ending of the grace  
order -  
its domestic graves.  
You've asked me what the pheasant  
is reconciling there with his crimson mouth?  
I reply, the starry sky knows this.  
  
I was without doubt the gentleman bird  
there in the troubled vicinity.  
When it looked me with its fresh cluster eyes  
it had neither foot nor lip  
but gold sea's skins on its sides.  
You see mouth as starry as the drizzle.  
Indicates the autumn's drinking shoulder.  
Where sun rises meet  
splendors meet, behind and in and the sound  
of juices, to reach out and relinquish in sorrow.  
A tail and a eyeballs  
entertaining the sea.  
Not the blue moment  
when the late afternoon awakens the utensils.  
How awakening is the warm juice and it's boundless corpses?  
My heart moves from being rambunctious to being honest.  
  
I stayed magnified and sunburst orange  
outside the heights.  
Only callous and to a  
daughter they take on time, million years  
  
You are the atrocious goddess of a oyster,  
the fire-tipped ness of the fragrance of strawberry, the power of the mud.  
Multitude of forms!  
In and out of the transparent the yellow and the blue  
a sun of salts indicates the telegraph's preserving curves.  
This silent current and beginning breakfast pities me  
with it's arcane mists like foot and nose  
and gray natures like fingernails and guitars.
