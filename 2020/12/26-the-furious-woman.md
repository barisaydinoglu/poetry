The Furious Woman
-----------------
Multitude of rivers!  
In and out of the green the marine and the yellow  
to the secure color of the silken film.  
It was the fortnight of the elephant.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
swim of ripples and planetariums  
and the warm forms of his native land?  
Transform on the legless horses that wait for you  
foreboding the chaotic chairs, wetting the doors.  
You weave my rotten beast  
like a fluidic crab to fresh grape.  
Because I love you, love, within the heat and in the heat.  
Conversations of sun rises, the recitation  
of moons we call comfortable cathedral.  
Like the dead metal of wheatfields your warmth is a sea water filled with ironous mosaic.  
Like throats executing within love.  
  
It was the twilight of the iguana.  
Among the vicinity like sand.  
And leaves and beds.  
Our new flag, our enchanting productivity line segments.  
For flute was negligent and morally negative.  
Pockets of brick converted into gold.  
The insufferable cactus is enchanting on your toe.  
Closed off and pulled out like a lake.
