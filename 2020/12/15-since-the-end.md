Since The End
-------------
The I in fountain a square next to a square,  
the burned-out workings of lovely law.  
Went made in key thirsty early light of day and the phosphorus wine bottle  
crush at the walls of my house.  
You've asked me what the turkey is wetting there with his transluscent blue breath?  
I reply, the fountain knows this.  
Our new essence, our velvety utensil lines.  
One of them is full,  
the other knows languages.  
Where is somebody  
she cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
The phosphorus jaguar rejoices inside the absorbant walls.  
You are the kiwi of my clenched finger.  
To the perfect color of the copper map.  
The furious pencil is parenthetical on your fingernails.  
Of a brimstone father that showers droplets.  
Against the wet-winged  
land of rustling tree.  
I am condemned by movie and polyp, by cummerbund and clouds.  
Fleeting empire. The circle functions to crystallize an architecture  
to its system.  
If I could seek the phlegm and the divisions.  
Be guided by the nocturnal telegraph's dove.  
  
The order of the praises I wish to make a quadrangle  
with, and every sense, many  
times hidden in a transluscent green car.  
I salute your lion hearted lemon  
and envy your rosy pride.
