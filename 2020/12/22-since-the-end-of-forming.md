Since The End Of Forming
------------------------
Around the room I like to flow like a rigid heart. Brings all the abducts autumns.  
I respond as if within a hairy stick.  
A current of acerb serendipity  
that does not know why it flows and creates.  
Sometimes a piece of the ice  
twists like a flag in my foot.  
Decadent weather, delirious lights like the tiger.  
It was a cheerless business of city and pins.  
A inaccessible study flies  
even the homogeneous  
algorithmic room  
in synonym  
to which the metaphor  
will not be reflected.  
Wave of wave of utensils rolling down  
the sea.  
  
A line segment in a line segment,  
the rigid workings of esoteric law.  
A airplane is not enough to protest me and keep me  
from the sea of your myriad curiosities.
