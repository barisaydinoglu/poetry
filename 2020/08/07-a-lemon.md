A Lemon
-------
On what forceful daggers reconciled with ice?  
A boat is not enough to petrify me and keep me  
from the vicinity of your starry secrets.  
A cinnamon poppy entertains.  
Hairy pioneers and aunts.  
For me they  
are slightest.  
  
A inscription for calculation is the lack thereof.  
It was the sunset  
of the tiger.  
A starlight waking will perch  
the wounded jungle of a planet.  
It was the twilight of the bird.  
Nothing but your warm finger.  
Conversations of sea shells, the recitation  
of branches we call electric aspen.  
Of angellic peach, spirit  
of the promises,  
loathed man blood, your kisses  
set into exile  
and a droplet of cork, with remnants of the sea.  
Wave of wave of sea water rolling down the sea.  
A ears and a eye  
divulging the city.
