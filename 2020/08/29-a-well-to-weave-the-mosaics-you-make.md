A Well To Weave The Mosaics You Make
------------------------------------
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another. Come with me to the trapdoor of imbroglios.  
Once there was a hairy child who  
sought at parties, sitting in a line, among lights.  
  
A cordial wood paneling making an angellic thing of a chance meeting with an aunt.  
In the smallest crystal door what thick warmths of your body -  
the modern office is filled with it,  
sea's skins for the warmth and the bleak paper-mache.
