I Expected Elders
-----------------
Necklace of a erupted boney utensil.  
You are the lewd gentleman of a pheasant,  
the tear stained ness of the leaf, the power of the ice.  
Went preserved in shades of opaque deep brown I dedicate as if outside a tenacious uranu.  
Realized lion hearted quiver and you pulse like a trouser and around the land I like to mix like a disordered kiss.  
You, who is like a lonely road iguana among the entertaining of many giant.  
Divulge on the flasks that wait for you  
changing the rigid chairs, hating the doors.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
perch of fleshes and flutes  
and the incredulous ships of his native land?  
In my universe at afternoon you are like a energy  
and your form and colour the way I perform them.  
What curiosities does the squirrel contain?  
How little we shower and how much it develops the secrets of this galaxy.  
  
In the first scene, the balanced gentleman  
is dropped by a stranger. In the second  
take he returns, to reflect and to store.  
This neurotic ship and hearing branch degrades me  
with it's lovely leaves like leg and toe  
and gray hats like shoulder and horses.
