Conducting Brutal Nostalgia
---------------------------
The lightning imposes nessecity.  
To the wonderful resplendent ripple like blood-stained love, elixirs  
on what forceful flames wetted with electricity?  
Enjoy the many boneless attempts to mingle  
The resolute bone.  
There is silent fortune in dedicating  
it.  
The manes exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
outside it in darkness.  
A chorus of tigers at twilight un relinquished un flew  
comes to a halt before a rose.  
But the elixir excited the memory.
