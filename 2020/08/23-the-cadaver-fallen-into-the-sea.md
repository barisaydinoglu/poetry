The Cadaver Fallen Into The Sea
-------------------------------
The boney jaguar stands under the ancient noises. You, who is like a evil ostrich among the dawning of many sailor.  
On what putrid shrapnels performed with earth?  
  
The sea shell passes, the ripple of aromatic  
grows among.  
Like the pale broken glass of bells the I in form played and then discovered in the heights.  
Halfway.  
If you were not the peach the fluidic moon  
cooks, sprinkling its peach across the heights.  
I was without doubt the elder bird  
there in the ghostly thicket.  
When it looked me with its balanced femininity eyes  
it had neither finger nor eyeballs  
but gem forests on  
its sides.  
A honeysuckle exciting will appreciate  
the difficult clay of a planet.  
I am crushed by warmth of your body and legless horse, by stick and fog.
