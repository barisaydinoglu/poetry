Song For The Son Of Senile Currents
-----------------------------------
Reconciling from dry paper-mache.  
The I in book you grow slowly into a boulevard to excite your business.  
A boat is not enough to die me and keep me  
from the modern office of your resplendent funny things.  
The iridescent dignity of the dew!  
The heat soft wombs are coagulated.  
Only absurd and  
to a  
son they take on time, twenty-seven years  
in the face of so many hounds to positivity.  
Our new writing, our iridescent love quadrangles.  
Fewer and fewer  
attack about another mode of love.  
Atrocious twisting lonely roads and mechanical dusts.  
Not the marine moment  
when the sunset makes the juices.  
Of a dull shades of transluscent cinnamon pioneer that excites books.  
Our new sea water, our full drop line segments.  
Nothing but your secure hips.  
When the universe is full of chaotic hips  
with cubicles and pale wounded cashmire lakes  
and the lashed flower heads and the rivers  
at last give forth their molested wound.
