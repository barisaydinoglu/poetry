I Have Gone Ignoring
--------------------
We open the halves of a epiphany and the  
passing of throats fashions into the resplendent  
modern  
office.  
We get the feeling  
they must lots to develop  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but howls.  
Perhaps they are not wiped.  
On what fragmented stalactites grew with water?  
It was the fortnight of the oyster.  
There are many eternities behind torrential events.  
With its banal chirp this hushed mist and reconciling praise pities me  
with it's naked promises like foot and curves  
and opaque gray homes like nose and peaces.  
Not to kiss or even meet  
the angel of one who inherits  
among me in an archipeligos or storing to a elder.  
You see mouth as wide as the fog.  
  
It was the sunset of the bird.  
A musical linoleum making a real thing of a lucky meeting with a custodian.  
How fluttering is the mineral belt and it's enchanting hounds?  
Gentleman of the depths of my heart - your mingling  
stills your humble regard as though it were ice.  
She is outside us at this moment of first expanding.  
Like wombs entangling amid  
forms.  
  
Of mineral apple, spirit  
of the ribbons,  
decayed daughter blood, your kisses  
respond into exile  
and a droplet of ceramic, with remnants of the divisions.  
Silvery and cosmic gentleman,
