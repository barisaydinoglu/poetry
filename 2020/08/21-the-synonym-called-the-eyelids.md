------------------------------
From blade of grass to harrowing wind,  
hidden mists drawn by enduring channels, a  
furious mosaic begins to begin.  
The maternities exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
amid it in darkness.  
You see nose as cleansed as the fog.  
Playing the heart of her foliage full of honor.  
But I should be untrue to jouranlism, attacking among its mechanical productivities  
so let us try to divulge a story devoid of individual redundancies.  
The cactus knows this,  
that life in it's silken boxes is as endless as the sphere.  
Only starlight, just the  
time, nothing but  
it. Umbrella.
