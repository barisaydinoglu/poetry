Breeding Natural Affection
--------------------------
With the opaque blue lip of the sky.  
Carry me onto your vessel - the grape of my drop -  
On what harsh havocs gathered with water?  
Miracle.  
  
Enjoy the many rustling attempts to fly  
the free seperation.  
There is promising fortune in developing it.  
The daughter smiles at the son  
but the uncle does not smile  
when he looks at the turkey woman  
and the senile ocean.  
It was the sunset of the elephant.  
I wish to make a loop  
amid, and every sense, many  
times hidden in a poppy.  
What filters the props of joy?  
From her nose and her brow perform  
stalkss of cattail of the earth.  
Outside the devouring cummerbunds.  
  
It was the fortnight of the turkey.  
There ought  
to be a foliage of a mineral  
warmth lighting in a land.  
Animosity and wreath - laminated signs of confusion.  
Warmth of your body of a disguised morbid laminated sign.  
The nail builds on its insufferable mare  
weaving marine veins over the area.  
You say, what is the foam waiting for in its green droplet?  
I tell you it is waiting for light like you.  
  
It was a tenacious business of invasion and vigils.  
Around the heights I like to shine like a lethargic flesh.
