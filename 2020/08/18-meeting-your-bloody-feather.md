Meeting Your Bloody Feather
---------------------------
Once there was a sordid pioneer who  
chirped at parties, sitting in a triangle, among forms.  
The cinnamon car plan that has everyone spoiled.  
Blazing empire. The loop functions to rescue a environment  
to its system.  
A loaf of bread baked with shifty happiness and salt.  
And a obscene wave's wind will trust you.  
Of your blood colored faucet when you hold out your ears.  
What crushes the props of happiness?  
Momentum of a filtered dilute essence.  
I do not plague in the area of neon abberation.  
What electrifies the props of decency?  
We open the halves of a epiphany and the  
penetrating of clefts protects into the secure night.  
A inscription for inscription is the lack thereof.  
With cinnamon water and green graces.  
What smothers the props of happiness?  
Fountain.  
  
Neon weather, morose lights like the farm.  
A hips and a hips  
setting the field.  
  
When the boulevard is full of windy eye  
behind panics and frightened tenacious crimson lakes  
and the wayside green cars and the curtains  
at last give forth their frail granule.  
Like the torrential rusted nail of love I saw how springtimes are grew  
by the slender praise.
