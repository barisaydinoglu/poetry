Tonight I Can Relax
-------------------
The convict transforms  
on its careless mare  
transforming silvery starry skies over the chimney. Nothing but your sensual tail.  
The land inside hers  
a story we tell in passing,  
with notions of sincerity  
and a passion for computer science and jouranlism  
  
When the thicket is full of bitten lip  
within shardss of fused quartz and parched wayside souls  
and the exiled sea's skins and the necklaces  
at last give forth their misunderstood eternity.  
There are many juices next to rustling events.  
And meetings of neurotic nose in my night at midnight you are like a tree  
and your form and colour the way  
I dedicate them.  
Halfway.  
Pulled out and shut up like a candle.  
I salute your pure nectarine  
and envy your great pride.  
Halfway.
