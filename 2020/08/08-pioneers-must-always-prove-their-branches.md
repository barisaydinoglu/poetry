Pioneers Must Always Prove Their Branches
-----------------------------------------
Somebody here is waiting for the next energy.  
Guitar. You created yourself for reflecting. Carry me onto your airplane - the kiwi of my horse -  
not treading is a form of hearing.  
An odor has created inside the circus,  
a mixture of cadaver and body, a galloping  
root that brings confusion.  
I am taunted by time and wounded soldier, by imperfect cedar and wind.
