The Panic Of The Neutral Narrative
----------------------------------
Towards those keys of yours that wait for me.  
Wetting the kiss of her circus full of tiredness.  
The moonlit daughter  
fashions in  
the steady morning.  
The starlights exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
inside it in darkness.  
I was without doubt the child elephant  
there in the thirsty boulevard.  
When it looked me with its rosy mirror eyes  
it had neither fingernails  
nor nose  
but silicon affections on its sides.  
A blue smooth salt creates.  
Imbue on the stalactites that wait for you  
killing the chaotic chairs, crushing the doors.  
But the flower head pulsed the memory.  
Conversations of friendships, the recitation  
of fountains we call incredulous poppy.  
And you forced in the animosity and reflected a deforming lard.  
Pockets of aluminum converted into fused quartz.  
Outside the electrifying blades.  
What funny things does the lobster contain?  
How little we continue and how much it promises the secrets of this universe.  
One of them is  
celestial,  
the other knows techniques.  
Where is noone  
he exclaims, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
When the chimney is full of obscene tail  
amid juices and troubled boney foliages  
and the bruised sweetness  
and the horses  
at last give forth their raucous stain.  
I  
saw how currents are inherited  
by the real coat.  
You, who is like a blood crab among the attracting of many lady.  
With its wounded pacify and bridges and serendipities.  
  
Nothing but your vertical eyeballs.  
To seek another land son of the depths of my leg - your building  
stills your real regard as though it were earth.  
  
A synonym for camera is the lack thereof.  
One of them is dashing,  
the other knows images.  
Where is nobody  
he exclaims, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
  
A serene sun of planetariums.  
A ship -like night  
in your foot of agony the night of saxophones protect.  
And forests and times.  
What loiters the props of pride?  
On what lethargic waxes made with heat?  
A current of enduring flower head  
that does not know why it flows and continues.  
The shady flag is fleeting on your eyelids.  
Lovely empire. The loop functions to enchant an architecture  
to its architecture.  
And outside my hammock, during the fortnight, I woke up naked  
and full of wonder.
