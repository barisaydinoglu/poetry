A Fruit
-------
And so that its gates will invade your eye.  
When the moonlight evening is full of bitter breath  
inside cold fires and clenched torrential branches  
and the inevitable magnoliums and the flags  
at last give forth their rusted receptacle.  
A lyrical rug making a parsimonious thing of a impossible meeting with a fisherman.  
Where serendipities meet  
tigers meet, amid and amid and the sound  
of ashes, to reach out and dawn in fear.  
Not the crimson moment  
when the twilight blushes the hearts.  
One of them is delicious,  
the other knows signals.  
Where is noone  
she cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
  
You dawn in the chimney as in a unguessed divisions.  
The order of the trousers you say, what is the door waiting for in its sepia peace?  
I tell you it is waiting for flesh like you.  
Nothing but that candle of windows.  
You've asked me what the elephant is promising there with his transparent hips?  
I reply, the mirror knows this.
