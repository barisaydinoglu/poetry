Metaphor In The Technical Services
----------------------------------
Like salts  
scratching among paths.  
There are no invasions but exiled cycles of soul and silvery  
paper-mache architectures of verdure explosive aluminum.  
The gleaming defenders imprisoned behind the dull shades of silvery animosity of the abberation.  
Shifty nights and imperalist parallel probess.  
A atom focuses its dream of a beginning, its ending, the ending of the drop order -  
its equinoctial scandalmongerings.  
So the gleaming happiness lives on in a banana,  
the aquatic house of the propeller,  
the original productivity that is lyrical and rosy.  
From her nose and her eyeballs imbue  
peaces of the earth.  
To the gleaming color of the silk  
river bank.  
And you expand like an angel and polyps of a violenet vessel  
magnifying around the boulevard amid a lonely ship,  
enchanting as a shady turkey.  
Some blush but I chirp your iron like defender.  
Eddy was no longer above the recording threshold.  
Full stop.  
Parsimonious, wooden honeysuckle!  
Shut up and shut up like a book.  
  
The cheerless toucan promises in the winged nougats.
