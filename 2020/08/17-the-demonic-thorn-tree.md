The Demonic Thorn Tree
----------------------
And so that its dusts will overflow your arm.  
You are the bitterest pioneer of a crab,  
the imperalist ness of the drop, the power of the electricity.  
The drop plays in growing your heart.  
Hear on the conspirators that wait for you  
devouring the shady chairs, dropping the doors.  
In the middle of the boulevard like clay.  
Nothing but that momentum of roots.  
Which  
is a romantic atom of directions  
too many to count or too few to count, excited  
on a tree or in the original shoreline  
directions of the foot, a calculation in your fingernailss.  
Salt was no longer below the recording threshold.  
  
One of them is eager,  
the other knows languages.  
Where is nobody  
he exclaims, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
The essential man  
expands in the delicious morning.  
From her arm and her eye play  
propellers of the earth.  
We open the halves of a funny things and the  
impaling of darkness rejoices into the serendipidous night.
