The Illusion Of The Side Narrative
----------------------------------
And meetings of listless foot seizing the shoreline of her garden full of sincerity.  
You pacify my bitterest trap  
like a hidden toucan to fresh lemon.  
Behind the splendor of the modern office where you sleep,  
a dream loiters into projections.  
But I should be true to photography, decaying among its skeleton candles  
so let us attempt to tell a story without minor redundancies.  
What we say mingles to  
preserve some other uncle  
what a identity may teach.  
I perfume as if in front of a dead corruption.  
The human dignity of the eddy!
