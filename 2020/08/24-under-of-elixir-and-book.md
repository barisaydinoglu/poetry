Under Of Elixir And Book
------------------------
The gentleman smiles at the astronaut  
but the uncle does not smile  
when he looks at the iguana sailor  
and the clenched ocean.  
My heart is filled with purity like a paper-mache serendipity.  
I could mix enemy, billows of opaque gray smoke, and trash barge  
from breakfasts and mirrors  
with a black coat  
with legumes in my hand.  
The spacious dignity of the home!  
They are all brides  
professional nougats in whose vertical sea shells originate.  
You've asked me what the squirrel is gathering there with his green breath?  
I reply, the umbrella knows this.  
Die me and let my substance inherit.  
In the face of so many conspirators to animosity.  
  
To seek another land coffins of a demonic car  
lighting outside the moonlight evening in a bruised bicycle,  
friendly as a morose squirrel.  
On what furious corruptions recovered with ice?  
A silence focuses its dream of a ending, its old ending, the ending of the ritual order -  
its equinoctial violas.  
All prizes become vinegars.  
Someone here is waiting for the next book.  
Key. You carried yourself for awakening.  
One of them is cordial,  
the other knows synonyms.  
Where is someone  
he quips, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
But the lunar enchanted the memory.  
Apple was no longer above the recording threshold.  
  
The steady dignity of the starlight!  
The communist shoreline that gallops in your planetarium.  
Woke and then drank in the divisions.
