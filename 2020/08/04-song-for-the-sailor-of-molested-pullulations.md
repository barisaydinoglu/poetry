Song For The Sailor Of Molested Pullulations
--------------------------------------------
One of them is wide,  
the other knows inscriptions.  
Where is someone  
he says, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
One of them is irreducable,  
the other knows studies.  
Where is everybody  
he quips, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Behind sunburst orange water and sepia hearts.  
The rectum imposes nessecity.  
Brings all the entangles shadess of burnt umber.  
Closed off and pulled out like a map.  
The tree knows this,  
that life in it's bolt of glass boxes is as endless as the flower.  
A rusted warmth of your body day  
which is an ancient river bank of directions  
too many to count or thousand, appreciated  
on a droplet or in the profound springtime  
directions of the hips, a calculation in your lips.  
Everybody here is waiting for the next elixir.  
Angel. You played yourself for continuing.  
Your mouth flies from east to south
