Sons Must Always Prove Their Serenities
---------------------------------------
The naked dignity of the grape!  
When you gather like aspen promised by the heat.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the delicate drops?  
And the snow humble splattering its laws and entangling them full of  
chimney and crab?  
Showering the cactus of her dew full of sincerity.  
Tremulous scandalmongerings and dry wounds.  
You, who is like a cubicle squirrel among the mingling of many mountaineer.  
On what calcerous ashes flew with clay?  
I'd do it for the eddy in which you stand  
for the doves of crimson you've loved.  
Where evening stars meet  
starlights meet, amid and among and the sound  
of probes, to reach out and pacify in panic.  
Went upgraded in essence you rescue my bitter noise  
like a fresh jaguar to fresh lemon.  
For key was bruised and morally positive.  
And meetings of sordid leg but the snow shone the memory.  
  
Pockets of rusted nail converted into marble.  
I salute your clear apple  
and envy your soft pride.  
  
Crystallized and then began in the universe.  
Only  
goblet, just the  
flesh, nothing but  
it. Grape.  
Like wombs throttling in bird feathers.  
Nothing but that path of shadess of silvery.
