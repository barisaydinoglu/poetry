The Projection Called The Finger
--------------------------------
Wave of wave of umbrellas rolling down the sea.  
Hearing the horse of her shoreline full of wonder.  
The day awes you in its mortal earth.  
I salute your monastic lemon  
and envy your angellic pride.  
A gray and crooked starlight is penetrated in the thicket.  
As soon as the incoming flowers  
gives the alphabetic indication.  
The pencil relinquishes in divulging your eye.  
Multitude of snows!  
In and out of the transparent the silvery and the transparent  
within the electrifying legless horses.  
Crimson and boundless elder,  
within the rejecting egoes.  
Not the cinnamon moment  
when the afternoon makes the doors.  
For a day, maybe million,  
I rested under a pillow of fog  
at a post office, waiting for the pioneer to be next to.  
Of your gray bottle when you hold out your brain.  
All sweetness become wounded soldiers.  
Pure dagger divulges the atoms because I love you, love, inside the heat and around the earth.
