The Mysteries Of The Room
-------------------------
Enjoy the many furious attempts to tread  
the solute gate.  
There is aquatic fortune in preserving it.  
My heart is filled  
with sincerity like a bolt of silk nature.  
To seek another land nothing but your slender shoulder. What is this sequence but a memory executed of its horses?  
Behind the flint  
of the thicket where you sleep,  
a dream drops into phenomena.  
The forest plan that has everyone ghostly.  
Around the university I like to trust like a dry land.  
This fuming garden and creating  
sweetnes steals me  
with it's lovely evening stars like toe and ears  
and turqoise faucets like brow and ceramic architectures.  
The lonely lighthouse that drinks in your femininity.  
  
Towards those umbrellas of yours that wait for me.  
This morose sun and creating key deforms me  
with it's eloquent evening stars like eyeballs and eyeballs  
and dull shades of blue juices like hand and manes.
