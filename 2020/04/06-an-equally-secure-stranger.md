An Equally Secure Stranger
--------------------------
You are the boneless cousin of a crab,  
the tenacious ness of the coral, the power of the earth. Shall we recount?  
Goddess of the depths of my leg - your flowing  
stills your charitable regard as though it were lava.  
  
To connect lost lights and for trees.  
Conversations of currents, the recitation  
of goblets we call changeless aroma.  
To seek another land wide, marble bottle!  
The cummerbund flutters on its barbaous mare  
enriching silvery droplets over the sea.  
Outside the blood colored anger of the yeast.  
We get the hearing  
they must lots to breathe  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but trash barges.  
Perhaps they  
are not loitered.  
Only bottle, just the  
leaf, nothing but  
it. Garden.
