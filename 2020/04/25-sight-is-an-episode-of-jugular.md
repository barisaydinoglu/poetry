Sight Is An Episode Of Jugular
------------------------------
Your curves treads from south to south  
I carry as if behind a browbeaten throat.  
Come with me to the cleft of receptacles.  
A trouser -like  
heart  
my electric eyelids relaxes you always.  
On what violenet invasions mixed with lightning?  
You - the humble shoulder.  
But the flower head mingled the memory.  
A current of loving root  
that does not know why it flows and mixes.  
Pockets of sand converted into paper-mache.  
And the smooth stone to its precision  
and among the stones the mineral one  
the gentleman covered with indespensable fountain.  
What mysteries does the squirrel contain?  
How little we perform and how much it travels the phenomena of this universe.  
A school focuses its dream of a old ending, its old ending, the new ending of the sea's skin order -  
its parenthetical egoes.  
Realized plumed essence transparent and perfect goddess,  
a cathedral inheriting will carry  
the wayside mud of a planet.  
Draw from it the atrocious  
study of its own language.  
Went blossomed in cactus a secure thunder of silences.  
Of a rust colored stranger that flies productivities.  
What is this technique but a memory fell of its bottles?  
Outside the vicinity like sand.  
A laminated sign growing will circumscribe  
the pale lava of a planet.  
Pockets of metal converted into fused quartz.
