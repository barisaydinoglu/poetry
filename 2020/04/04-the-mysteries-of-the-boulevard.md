The Mysteries Of The Boulevard
------------------------------
A airplane is not enough to decay me and keep me  
from the vicinity of your scrupulous phenomena.  
Always you coagulate through the night  
toward the lunchtime loitering quilts.  
In your curves of conquering the university begins to dream of growing.  
Among the striking explications.  
Where windows meet  
aromas meet, inside  
and around and the sound  
of receptacles, to reach out and magnify in sorrow.  
Enjoy the many bitten attempts to pulse  
the cordial viola.  
There is serendipidous fortune in crystallizing it.  
  
And clusters and lakes.  
Pockets of rusted nail converted into glass.  
The old warrior's medal plan that has everyone hated.  
It was a lewd business of serection and juices.
