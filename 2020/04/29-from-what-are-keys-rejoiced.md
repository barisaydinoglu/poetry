From What Are Keys Rejoiced
---------------------------
I salute your slender bread  
and envy your musical pride.  
They are all sailors  
professional shrapnels in whose equinoctial serendipities originate.  
Someone here is waiting for the next river bank.  
Flute. You swam yourself for making.  
My free eye hears you always.  
You've asked me what the tiger is responding there with his transluscent sand-colored eye?  
I reply, the autumn knows this.  
And meetings of pale brow in the first take, the domestic aunt  
is erupted by a bride. In the second  
Take he returns, to protect and to divulge.  
Play on the abberations that wait for you  
changing the rigid chairs, coagulating the doors.  
Nothing but your incredulous shoulder.  
My heart moves from being frail to being hidden.  
The splendors exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
outside it in darkness.  
  
This rustling banner and promising heart buries me  
with it's silent evening stars like eyelids and breath  
and gray coats like eye and candles.  
Here I am, a solute finger congealed in the area of springtime.  
  
Multitude of sea shells!  
In and out of the transparent the burnt umber and the cinnamon
