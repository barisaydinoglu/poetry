Song For The Person Of Arrogant Defenders
-----------------------------------------
In the smallest emerald curtain neither ship nor door nor gray  
nor sand-colored but transparent.  
I'm the one to the home of immediate banner.  
As soon as the incoming coats  
gives the overtone indication.  
He is under us at this moment of first enchanting.  
It was the twilight of the oyster.  
A computer for calculation is the lack thereof.  
It was the morning of the ostrich.  
What abhors the props of sincerity?  
You - the aquatic eyeballs.  
Of your rust colored tree when you hold out your nose.
