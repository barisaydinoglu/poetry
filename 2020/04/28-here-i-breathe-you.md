Here I Breathe You
------------------
To kiss lost evening stars and for lands.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
carry of grapes and corals  
and the vertical stones of his native land?  
To the parsimonious color of the copper fellowship.  
A forceful acrobat day  
imbuing a wheatfield  
breathed in the serendipidous rain.  
It was a bitten business of vinegar and conspirators.  
Abandon me and let my substance divulge.  
A pure sunshine of rituals.  
We get the sense  
they must lots to fashion  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but stains.  
Perhaps they are not brainwashed.  
Only disintered and to a  
mountaineer they take on time, thousand years  
sometimes a piece of the lava  
forces like a praise in my brain.  
  
To enrich lost gardens and for trees.  
You protect in the archipeligos as in a smooth chimney.  
And you disguised in the panic and sought a protesting trash barge.  
You say, what is the necklace waiting for in its opaque deep brown sphere?  
I tell you it is waiting for circus like you.
