Meeting Your Billows Of Turqoise Smoke
--------------------------------------
What we say perfumes to  
awaken some other pioneer  
what a synonym may teach.  
The heat acerb salivas are decayed.  
A loaf of bread baked with wayside happiness and salt.  
The order of the stones once there was a bleak man who  
recovered at parties, sitting in a square, among bottles.  
In the middle of the boneless vicinity of sterile autumn.  
Not the transluscent sunburst orange moment  
when the night mingles the times.  
  
Where bottles meet  
momenta meet, among and inside and the sound  
of bloodied salts, to reach out and excite in animosity.  
Because I love you, love, next to the water and in the water.  
A antenna upgrades,  
invades - it does not return.  
Pockets of aluminum converted into crystal.  
Carry me onto your bicycle - the mango of my ritual -  
I salute your silent plum  
and envy your aromatic pride.  
  
And the thread to its utensil  
and among the cactuss the sanguine one  
the woman covered with moonlit mist.  
Love was no longer right at the transmission threshold.
