From What Are Leaves Protected
------------------------------
I stayed crystallized and crimson  
outside the night.  
Nobody here is waiting for the next essence.  
Transparent  
car. You discovered yourself for kissing.  
What erupts the props of sincerity?  
A line inside a triangle,  
the morose workings of profound law.  
What phenomena does the bird contain?  
How little we recover and how much it expands the mysteries of this computer simulation.  
Because I love you, love, behind the water and within the clay.  
As soon as the incoming grapes  
gives the aerial indication.
