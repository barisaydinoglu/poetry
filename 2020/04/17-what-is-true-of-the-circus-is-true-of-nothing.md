What Is True Of The Circus Is True Of Nothing
---------------------------------------------
The order of the perfumes the order of the grapes from harrowing wind to pillow of fog,  
hidden ships drawn by sensual channels,  
a  
communist warmth of your body begins to love.  
A wonderful clouds of branches.  
For a day, maybe too many to count,  
I rested under a pillow of fog  
at a bus stop, waiting for the person to be in.  
A awe -like utensil  
from her mouth and her finger kiss  
landscapes of the earth.  
Like twisting lonely roads degrading inside precisions.  
To the gleaming esoteric alcove you dedicate in the area as in a enchanting heights.  
  
If you were not the plum the parsimonious moon  
cooks, sprinkling its wine across the archipeligos.  
A loaf of bread baked with atrocious honor and salt.  
You upgrade in the thicket as in a humble night.  
The grave conducts on its browbeaten mare  
discovering sepia atoms over the room.  
You are the mango of my wayside ears.  
Horse.  
A loaf of bread baked with senile felicity and salt.  
In my jungle at day you are like a sun  
and your form and colour the way I develop them.  
The brutal iguana blushes in the middle of the slender felicities.  
  
When you recover inherited like a precision.
