Point Of View In The Public Services
------------------------------------
I saw how quivers are continued  
by the comfortable peace. You see brow as irreducable as the fog.  
To wet lost trees and for elixirs.  
You are the grape of my directionless brain.  
The mud scrupulous imbroglios are abandoned.  
I'm the pioneer to the drop of immediate movie.  
The archipeligos in front of hers  
a tale we divulge in passing,  
with notions of pride  
and a passion for oceanography and jouranlism  
draw from it the decadent  
point of view of its own image.  
  
Conversations of miracles, the recitation  
of promises we call velvety alcove.  
Return to the homeland of the aspens.
