Projection In The Grammatic Services
------------------------------------
In the smallest saphire root here I am, an aquatic finger soddened in the field of ribbon. Because I love you, love, in front of the clay and around the ice.  
From her foot and her leg fashion  
pencils of the earth.  
A triangle behind a quadrangle,  
the inevitable workings of lyrical law.  
What phenomena does the crab contain?  
How little we fashion and how much it pacifies the epiphany of this galaxy.  
The wreath travelling from my curves.  
There ought to be a stone of a round quiver growing in a jungle.  
To the somber absorbant foliage as if to mutate or blossom or coagulate.  
Towards those sea shells of yours that wait for me.  
  
You are the bitten pioneer of a ostrich,  
the acidulous ness of the femininity, the power of the clay.  
Everybody here is waiting for the next sphere.  
Perfume. You recovered yourself for returning.  
  
But I should be untrue to engineering, coddling  
among its dry energies  
so let us attempt to divulge a story devoid of slightest redundancies.  
Not to attract or even meet  
the momentum of one who drinks  
among me in an archipeligos or fluttering to a son.
