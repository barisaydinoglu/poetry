Point Of View With The Trash
----------------------------
Indicates the momentum's pacifying tail.  
Conversations of reflections, the recitation  
of femininities we call arcane bridge.  
Halfway.  
My heart is filled with sincerity like a gold propeller.  
The energies exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
next to it in darkness.  
To seek another land to the humble color of the paper-mache horse.  
I do not shatter in the area of guilt  
uranu.  
Around the divisions I like to excite like a fuming cluster.  
Our new salt, our parenthetical fragrance of strawberry quadrangles.  
You see hips as iridescent as the mist.  
From her foot and her brain re-cover  
bottles of the earth.
