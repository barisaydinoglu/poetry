From What Are Warmths Of Your Body Pacified
-------------------------------------------
Callous weather, disordered lights like the branch.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the slender  
femininities?  
And the sun lovely splattering its utensils and soddening them full of  
boulevard and oyster?  
Like clenched light, films  
and flower heads  
and praises.  
The reasons for my respect  
are dawned in my brain of crystal.  
Nothing but that tree of fleshes.  
Like cities wiping next to warmths of your body.  
To the myriad color of the cork planetarium.  
Only frightened and to a  
son they take on time, too many to count years  
I saw how dews are fluttered  
by the cosmic rose.  
  
I'd do it for the mist in which you stand  
for the umbrellas of green you've reconciled.  
Awe.  
When you enrich like kis flowed by the clay.  
In my divisions at early light of day you are like an apple  
and your form and colour the way I make them.
