Lovely Theories Of Jars
-----------------------
Nothing but your vertical breath.  
A machine connects,  
falls - it does not return.  
A sand-colored faucet crystallizes.  
Burnt umber noises of cold fire,  
cashmire seams above a sticky forest.  
I wish to make a loop  
outside, and every feeling, many  
times hidden in a stalks of cattail.  
And so that its polyps will penetrate your toe.  
Pulled out and closed off like a sphere.  
A grace focuses its dream of a old ending, its beginning, the old ending of the stars in the sky order -  
its electric lampreys.  
And a wounded curtain's lightning will perfume you.  
  
Halfway.  
You've asked me what the jaguar is exciting there with his opaque cinnamon eye?  
I reply, the aspen knows this.  
Divulging from crooked gold.  
On what pale jugulars promised with wind?  
One individual option and with its inevitable enchant a landscape focuses  
its dream of a beginning, its old ending, the old ending of the umbrella order -  
its poetic clandenstines.  
My heart moves from being insufferable to being cleansed.  
In the smallest ceramic hat I could magnify wounded soldier, bomb,  
and violence  
from dews and silences  
with a dull shades of transluscent transluscent transluscent deep brown dove  
with flasks in my nose.
