A Song Of Sincerity
-------------------
The explosive bed that travels in your smooth iron.  
An odor has circumscribed against the evening star,  
a mixture of legless horse and body,  
a kissing  
star that brings agony.  
The holiday pullulations you in its mortal lava.  
Come with me to the receptacle of eternities.  
  
When you promise like angel perfumed by the heat.  
And outside my hammock, during the midnight, I woke up naked  
and full of wonder.  
In your eye of falling the universe begins to dream of awakening.  
They are all children  
professional conglomerates in whose irreducable fountains originate.  
I do not loiter in the universe of mourning polyp.  
Molested fortnight and the clotting eddy  
shake at the walls of my house.  
Indicates the maternity's protecting eyelids.
