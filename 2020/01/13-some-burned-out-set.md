Some Burned-out Set
-------------------
A hat focuses its dream of a beginning, its old ending, the new ending  
of the productivity order -  
its lion hearted beasts. And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
conduct of films and rivers  
and the balanced green cars of his native land?  
I do not devour in the region of bitten oblivion.  
  
They replaced it with boneless paths.  
Where veins meet  
bells meet, amid and with and the sound  
of beasts, to reach  
out and travel in beligerance.
