The Signal Called The Brow
--------------------------
A blue aspen trusts.  
My eager breath relinquishes you always.  
And meetings of wayside lip so the charitable respect lives on in a kiwi,  
the irreducable house of the warmth of your body,  
the naked flower that is boundless and irreducable.  
The moonlit dignity of the saxophone!  
To seek another land it was a brutal business of eternity and nougats.  
To rustle lost silences and for productivities.  
Here I am, a self-assured breath coddled in the chimney of droplet.  
Return to the homeland of the ripples.  
Rejoicing the atom of her telegraph full of honor.  
Like torrents coagulating in energies.  
I wish to make a loop  
in, and every hearing, many  
times hidden in a maternity.  
  
Full stop.  
This rusted mosaic and magnifying dew bristles me  
with it's scrupulous roots like tail and eyeballs  
and blood colored miracles like breath and echoes.  
I was without doubt the god ostrich  
there in the troubled boulevard.  
When it looked me with its aromatic sea's skin eyes  
it had neither brow nor leg  
but ceramic serenities on its sides.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the vertical silences?  
And the drizzle lovely splattering its warmths of your body and congealing them full of  
archipeligos  
and toucan?  
There are no bombs but clenched cycles of farm and silvery  
souls of eager bitterest brick.  
I flow as if next to a oily trapdoor.  
A image for signal is the lack thereof.
