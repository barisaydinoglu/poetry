She Has A Wounded Complex
-------------------------
Disintered weather, rusted lights like the wave.  
As soon as the incoming lands  
gives the alphabetic indication.  
Shut out and pulled out like a ritual.  
For a day, maybe twenty-seven,  
I rested under a ray of sunlight  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the giant to be with.  
A triangle behind a circle,  
the fatherless workings of original law.  
Father of the depths of my tail - your relinquishing  
stills your affluent regard as though it were earth.  
In your arm of fear the land of wells perch.  
I'm the elder to the shades of transparent of immediate film.  
Of your rust colored horse when you hold out your brain.  
The day ribbons you in its mortal heat.  
An odor has dawned in the river,  
a mixture of stench and body, a weaving  
shades of sepia that brings confusion.  
I set as if outside a sterile acid.  
Salt.  
Pockets of aluminum converted into marble.  
I wish to make a line  
next to, and every feeling, many  
times hidden in a ripple.  
Like coffins condemning outside crowns.  
But the smooth stone trod the memory.  
To the plumed friendly flute full stop.  
You say, what is the tree waiting for in its green map?  
I tell you it is waiting for echo like you.  
  
It's a fluttering sea shell of throats.  
Magnifying the autumn of her bird feather full of love.
