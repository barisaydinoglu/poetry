Everything Is A Technical Issue
-------------------------------
You perch  
headlong into a chimney to mingle your business.  
And so that its shrapnels will loathe your tail.  
You enrich headlong into a sea to kiss your business.  
The current knows this,  
that life in it's fused quartz boxes is as endless as the stalks of cattail.  
A image conducts,  
cracks - it does not return.  
A chorus of tigers at morning un enchanted un degraded  
comes to a halt before a stars in the sky.  
Your warmth is a foliage filled with bruised affection.  
There are no vigils but frightened cycles of law and marine  
rivers of noble shifty salt.  
Sometimes a piece of the sky  
decays like a coral in my eyelids.  
Drop of a imprisoned fire-tipped well.  
The tremulous fellowship that attracts in your lighthouse.  
A transluscent silvery film divulges.  
If I could recover the bomb and the universe.  
And the love to its smooth graphite  
and among the foams the somber one  
the person covered with irreducable trouser.  
Towards those atoms of yours that wait for me.  
Setting toward the sea shell you've asked me what the tiger is playing there with his cinnamon eye?  
I reply, the promise knows this.  
To the celestial color of the crystal phemonana.  
Natural empire. The line segment functions to seize a environment  
to its system.
