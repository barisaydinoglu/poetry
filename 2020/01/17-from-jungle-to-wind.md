From Jungle To Wind
-------------------
Towards those femininities of yours that wait for me. There are no bloods but chaotic cycles of drop and yellow  
kisses of scrupulous wounded ash.  
You say, what is the flower head waiting for in its opaque transluscent transparent coat?  
I tell you it is waiting for warmth of your body like you.  
Spoiled ones and women.  
For me they are neutral.  
Animosity and knave - circuss of sorrow.
