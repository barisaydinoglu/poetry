Angellic Theories Of Silences
-----------------------------
The farm blushes in blushing your brow. When you build like sphere played by the wind.  
My heart is filled with joy like a gem saxophone.  
Only ship, just the  
wave, nothing but  
it. Coat.  
And meetings of bitter brain I salute your unguessed apple  
and envy your careful pride.
