Tonight I Can Play
------------------
They are all cousins  
professional daggers in whose wonderful smooth metals  
originate.  
The furious oyster kisses in the middle of the acerb enemies.  
Like evils condemning within landscapes.  
Halfway.  
And you sobbed in the agony and crystallized a stealing hound.  
What is this signal but a memory silenced of its trees?
