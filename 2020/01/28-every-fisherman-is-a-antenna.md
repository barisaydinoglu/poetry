Every Fisherman Is A Antenna
----------------------------
My heart is filled with decency like a bolt of emerald apple. Inside the lashed farm, many blood-stained nougats.  
My heart moves from being motionless to being iridescent.  
We open the halves of a phenomena and the  
smothering of coffins conducts into the humble university.  
There are no abberations but wounded cycles of candle and burnt umber  
starlights of free browbeaten brick.  
Sometimes a piece of the mud  
falls like a smooth stone in my fingernails.  
River was no longer right at the recording threshold.  
  
It was a forceful business of oxide and torrents.  
And a clotting landscape's ice will enchant you.  
On what tear stained receptacles reconciled with water?  
Went began in productivity in the middle of the rambunctious room of whirlwinds of cathedral.  
A poppy developing will flutter  
the smothered lightning of a planet.  
Amid the door of the night where you sleep,  
a dream gnaws into calculations.  
When the thicket is full of muzzled eyelids  
outside granules and wounded harsh souls  
and the nauesous stalkss of cattail and the silicon architectures  
at last give forth their lashed blood.  
A current of serene warmth  
that does not know why it flows and develops.  
Realized steady breakfast one neutral option and a projection for calculation is the lack thereof.
