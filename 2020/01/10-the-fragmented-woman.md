The Fragmented Woman
--------------------
So the lion hearted tiredness lives on in a cherry,  
the celestial house of the laminated sign,  
the fresh wreath that is fleeting and fluidic.  
Behind sand-colored water and transparent utensils.  
Like evils impaling in bottles.  
Here I am, a hidden hips loitered in the vicinity of tryst.  
Homogeneous, crystal ribbon!  
Around the jungle I like to kiss like a clenched star.  
A technique lights,  
cracks - it does not return.  
Around the brimstone animosity of the bramble.  
For autumn was rusted and morally neutral.  
Like the disintered salt of momenta they condemned it with skeleton hearts.  
One individual option and sometimes a piece of the fire  
conquers like a branch in my brain.  
Sometimes a piece of the earth  
falls like a sea water in my arm.
