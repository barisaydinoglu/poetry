Among Of Quiver And Nature
--------------------------
Pacifying the coat of her fragrance of strawberry full of decency.  
This oily branch and growing wine bottle coddles me  
with it's decisive times like eyeballs and arm  
and rust colored shorelines like brain and droplets.  
Opaque crimson water to my crooked door!  
Realized rosy shades of deep brown and so that its polyps will twist your nose.  
  
Decency is gone, the subject has divulged.  
Neither starlight nor smooth iron nor red  
nor sepia but sand-colored.
