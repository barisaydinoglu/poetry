Since The End Of Rejecting
--------------------------
What epiphany does the lobster contain?  
How little we drink and how much it wakes the funny things of this universe.  
The neon jaguar magnifies behind the lion hearted moldy bananas.  
A splendor imbuing will grow  
the disordered mud of a planet.  
My heart is filled with love like a paper-mache shades of silvery.
