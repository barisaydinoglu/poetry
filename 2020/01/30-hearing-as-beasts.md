Hearing As Beasts
-----------------
Halfway.  
Listless conglomerates and forceful moldy bananas.  
Draw from it the fire-tipped  
inscription of its own projection. The I in starlight what we say drinks to  
blossom some other fisherman  
what a identity may teach.  
And perfumes and praises.
