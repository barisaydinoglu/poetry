Since The End Of Pitying
------------------------
If I could stand the moth and the boulevard. What secrets does the turkey contain?  
How little we love and how much it protects the phenomena of this computer simulation.  
A windy acrobat day  
elder of the depths of my finger - your dedicating  
stills your hopeful regard as though it were mud.  
Against the modern office like iron.  
Boundless empire. The quadrangle functions to enrich an architecture  
to its architecture.  
Your brain crystallizes from west to south  
agony and railroad track - magnoliums of illusion.
