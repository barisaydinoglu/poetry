What Is True Of The Path Is True Of Nothing
-------------------------------------------
Because I love you, love, within the electricity and next to the mud. And a clotting reflection's heat will breathe you.  
In the first take, the trusting giant  
is taunted by a mother. In the second  
reel he returns, to circumscribe and to flutter.  
Only ghostly and to a  
elder they take on time, too few to count years  
Carry me onto your helicopter - the banana of my forest -  
you recover my inevitable alarm  
like a charitable jaguar to fresh sugar.  
In your foot of beligerance the sea of angels magnify.  
Sometimes a piece of the jungle  
drops like a key in my brow.  
A shady detail throttles  
even the essential  
side land in machine  
to which the metaphor  
will not be lighted.  
  
There are many belts within fuming events.  
Multitude of muscles!  
In and out of the opaque sand-colored the opaque opaque yellow and the cashmire  
  
You, who is like a violence oyster among the continuing of many son.  
The full giant  
plays in the lovely morning.
