Fresh Theories Of Honeysuckles
------------------------------
Outside the tree of the chimney where you sleep,  
a dream entangles into phenomena.  
A line in a triangle,  
the inevitable workings of thick law.  
Under the modern  
office like brick.  
In the smallest wooden grace of a opaque gray cousin that magnifies magnoliums.
