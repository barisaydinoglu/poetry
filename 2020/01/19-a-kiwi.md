A Kiwi
------
Because I love you, love, amid the lava and outside the wind.  
The twisting lonely road carries on its directionless mare  
refreshing transluscent sepia mists over the divisions.  
The careless circus is trusting on your lip.  
When you love like laminated sign carried  
by the electricity.  
The current plan that has everyone bleak.  
You are the orange of my rambunctious fingernails.  
  
The order of the cactuss here I am, a velvety breath protested in the chimney of dove.  
My electric tail conducts you always.  
A chorus of toucans at holiday un grew un hated  
comes to a halt before a peace.  
Galloping toward the precision someone here is waiting for the next time.  
Faucet. You connected yourself for recovering.
