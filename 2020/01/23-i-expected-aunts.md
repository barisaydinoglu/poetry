I Expected Aunts
----------------
I saw how horses are preserved  
by the resplendent saxophone.  
Carry me onto your boat - the banana of my pullulation -  
I understand as if within a sifted hole.  
Brings all the condemns  
threads.  
I salute your aquatic grape  
and envy your arcane pride.  
A sea water relaxing will wake  
the demonic fire of a planet.  
You say, what is the curtain waiting for in its deep brown miracle?  
I tell you it is waiting for rose like you.
