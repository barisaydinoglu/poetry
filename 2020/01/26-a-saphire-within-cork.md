A Saphire Within Cork
---------------------
The quiver knows this,  
that life in it's diamond boxes is as endless as the jar.  
You say, what is the salt waiting for in its sand-colored sea water?  
I tell you it is waiting for  
ritual like you.  
Recovered and then dedicated in the thicket.  
And the aspen to its mirror  
and among the leaves the essential one  
the cousin covered with pure warmth of your body.  
Has the moonlight evening been built with epiphany?  
A metaphor for projection is the lack thereof.  
My blazing mouth flows you always.  
Your foot hears from north to north
