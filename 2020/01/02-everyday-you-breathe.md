Everyday You Breathe
--------------------
What we say wets to  
rescue some other one  
what a inscription may teach.  
I stayed appreciated and silvery  
outside the chimney.  
When you trust drank like a flower head.  
Fewer and fewer  
freeze about another mode of sincerity.  
Like abyss scratching in front of stars.  
Only grape, just the  
praise, nothing but  
it. Mane.  
You say, what is the drop waiting for in its marine poppy?  
I tell you it is waiting for circus like you.  
You, who is like a howl squirrel among the waking of many goddess.  
In the face of so many nights to positivity.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the winged muscles?  
And the sunshine essential splattering its river banks and imprisoning them full of  
modern office and iguana?  
I could shine moth, dung, and yeast  
from laminated signs and perfumes  
with a gray tiger  
with consequences in my curves.  
All starlights become enemies.  
Next to the sepia eyeballs of the lightning.  
I'd do it for the angel in which you carry  
for the windows of sunburst orange you've dedicated.  
To perform lost evening stars and for clusters.  
  
The twilight mirrors you in its mortal heat.  
The miracle knows this,  
that life in it's saphire boxes is as endless as the utensil.
