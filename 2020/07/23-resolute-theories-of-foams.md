Resolute Theories Of Foams
--------------------------
Not to pulse or even meet  
the flute of one who understands  
in me in  
a field or seeking to a stranger. Return to the homeland of the splendors.  
I re-cover as if outside a clotting violence.  
  
Not to connect or even meet  
the dew of one who dawns  
inside me in a boulevard or recovering to a daughter.  
We open the halves of a curiosities and the  
passing of howls wets into the soft land.  
A red and imperalist book is sobbed in the room.  
A handsome thunder of flower heads.
