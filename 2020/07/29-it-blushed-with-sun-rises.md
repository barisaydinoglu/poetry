It Blushed With Sun Rises
-------------------------
And inside my hammock, during the midnight, I woke up naked  
and full of decency.  
One slightest option and you trust headlong into a night to flutter your business.  
A camera begins,  
loathes - it does not return. A thunder of kiss return to the homeland of the echoes.  
Imperalist goddesses and sailors.  
For me they are historical.  
Wave of wave of shadess of sepia rolling down the sea.  
To the natural boundless lemon in your brain of agony the archipeligos of stalkss of cattail circumscribe.
