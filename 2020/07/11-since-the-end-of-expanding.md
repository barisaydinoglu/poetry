Since The End Of Expanding
--------------------------
But I should be true to jouranlism, hating among its weak maternities  
so let us attempt to divulge a story without technical redundancies.  
A cinnamon aroma breathes.  
Probes of a lewd ship  
enchanting in front of the region inside a fire-tipped boat,  
smooth as a inaccessible jaguar.  
But I should be untrue to computer science, silencing among its dead shadess of marine  
so let us seek to divulge a story without grammatic redundancies.  
Gentleman of the depths of my eyelids - your fluttering  
stills your romantic regard as though it were sky.  
Your home is a foliage filled with negligent well.  
Cinnamon ice to my listless writing!  
What is this calculation but a memory smeared of its starry skies?  
I could excite throat, panic, and beast  
from fleshes and landscapes  
with a turqoise miracle  
with whispers in my heart.  
You are the lemon of my senile foot.  
Sometimes a piece of the ice  
falls like a sea water in my eyelids.  
A musical drizzle of juices.  
Chain me and let my substance continue.  
There ought to be a soul of a noble foam gathering in a modern office.  
Blue self-productions of shadow,  
green seams above a dilute autumn.  
Rabid fortnight and the shady stalks of cattail  
gnaw at the walls of my house.
