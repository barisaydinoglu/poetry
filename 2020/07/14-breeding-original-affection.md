Breeding Original Affection
---------------------------
A language breathes,  
abducts - it does not return. In the cashmire foot of the clay.  
Embarassement and hat - candles of sorrow.  
  
Burnt umber enemies of abys,  
yellow seams above a troubled landscape.  
A sequence fashions,  
passes - it does not return.
