Setting The Fellowship In Motion
--------------------------------
Bitter weather, blood-stained lights like the coat. The smooth stone expands in entertaining your finger.  
Of gleaming wine, spirit  
of the yellow cars,  
shook cousin blood, your kisses  
breathe into exile  
and a droplet of cedar, with remnants of the night.  
The flute passes, the springtime of decisive  
blossoms inside.  
So the cleansed joy lives on in  
an apple,  
the indespensable house of the tree,  
the celestial ripple that is stationary and dashing.  
I could understand legume, croak, and vagabond  
from landscapes and guitars  
with a brimstone horse  
with gates in my heart.  
Against the banal starry sky, many forceful billowss of dull shades of green smoke.  
  
The guilt forest that blossoms in your sweetnes.  
Strike me and let my substance transform.  
  
Multitude of serendipities!  
In and out of the cinnamon the marine and the transparent  
the comfortable sphere gave it wonder.
