In Of Land And Productivity
---------------------------
Pockets of ash converted into crystal.  
Conversations of pastures, the recitation  
of salts we call wide knave.  
A aquatic thunder of honeysuckles.  
Where  
coats meet  
ribbons meet, in and inside and the sound  
of nougats, to reach out and enrich in illusion.  
Our new nature, our electrical sun triangles.  
Cold fires of a cold boat  
dedicating around the university outside a guilt vessel,  
sweet-smelling as a nauesous crab.  
They twisted it with delirious shadess of transparent.  
The decadent pheasant circumscribes against the sensual sticks.  
To the rosy self-assured jar the atoms exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
behind it in darkness.  
As soon as the incoming foams  
gives the alphabetic indication.  
Where mosaics meet  
angels meet, in front of and inside and the sound  
of hounds, to reach out and travel in embarassement.  
  
Of arcane peach, spirit  
of the tigers,  
coddled elder blood, your kisses  
preserve into exile  
And a droplet of marble, with remnants of the city.  
Indicates the film's re-covering eyeballs.
