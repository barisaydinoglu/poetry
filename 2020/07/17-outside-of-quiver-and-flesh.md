Outside Of Quiver And Flesh
---------------------------
Towards those affections of yours that wait for me.  
Lethargic weather, mechanical lights like the key.  
Cashmire puberties of night,  
cashmire seams above a decadent starlight.  
He is against us at this moment of first  
blushing.  
What is this machine but a memory died of its promises?  
An odor has perched in the middle of the umbrella,  
a mixture of night and body, a showering  
pasture that brings animosity.  
A loaf of bread baked with calculating felicity and salt.  
Outside the fatherless garden, many hairy bones. Outside the area like iron.  
What is this study but a memory silenced of its productivities?  
You, who is like a martyr crab among the setting of many one.  
Among the parched divisions of motionless wave.  
Towards those roots of yours that wait for me.  
I was without doubt the pioneer jaguar  
there in the furious vicinity.  
When it looked me with its blazing law eyes  
it had neither arm nor ears  
but fused quartz fleshes on its sides.  
A deedy carpet making a handsome thing of a probable meeting with a pioneer.
