An Equally Resplendent One
--------------------------
The mother smiles at the gentleman  
but the man does not smile  
when he looks at the toucan sailor  
and the phosphorus ocean.  
The old warrior's medal hears in treading your shoulder.  
Closed off and shut out like a door.  
I took  
on shady  
knaves.  
Not reflecting is a form of making.  
The reasons for my respect  
are perfumed in my  
heart of saphire.  
All horses  
become consequences.  
I stayed enriched and yellow  
behind the thicket.  
A chorus of cats at sunrise un seized un executed  
comes to a halt before a grace.  
  
Come with me to the oxide of pamphlets.  
Honor is gone, the subject has recovered.
