From What Are Fleshes Began
---------------------------
The hated quiver is boundless on your brain. To the verdure color of the silken lake.  
I do not deprive in the jungle of parched shrapnel.  
And the warmth of your body to its sun  
and among the spheres the humble one  
the stranger covered with boundless peace.  
The coat deprives, the heart of absent minded  
flows outside.  
Rigid twilight and the lewd grace  
loathe at  
the walls of my house.  
Realized essential lemon I am penetrated by well and panic, by coal and rain.  
With its clotting flutter circus of a trembled bitter  
quilt.  
From her eyelids and her breath shine  
aromas of the earth.
