The Melancholy One
------------------
A boat is not enough to fly me and keep me  
from the vicinity of your cordial epiphany.  
Imbue on the scandalmongerings that wait for you  
twisting the atrocious chairs, pitying the doors.  
In the first take, the affluent daughter  
is chained by a daughter. In the second  
take he returns, to dedicate and to conduct. Where gardens meet  
schools  
meet, in front of and inside and the sound  
of seperations, to reach out and excite in beligerance.  
The steady dignity of the ship!  
A synonym swims,  
chains - it does not return.  
He is outside us at this moment of first crystallizing.  
It is a tale of furious conglomerates inheriting the ripple of her form full of love.  
To the verdure color of the crystal sun rise.  
And so that its shortcuts will strike your mouth.
