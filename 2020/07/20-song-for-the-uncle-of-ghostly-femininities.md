Song For The Uncle Of Ghostly Femininities
------------------------------------------
A clotting maternity  
day  
where trysts meet  
branches meet, amid and next to and the sound  
of ashes, to reach out and circumscribe in beligerance.  
Towards those laminated signs of yours that wait for me.  
A quadrangle with a tetrahedron,  
the lonely workings of plumed law.  
It mingles like a stone inside the root.  
Conversations of planetariums, the recitation  
of sea shells we call real awe.  
The enchanting dignity of the bridge!  
In front of the turqoise beligerance of the coal.  
Insatiable weather, rigid lights like the breakfast.  
Nothing but that kiss of foams.  
A sterile antenna soddens  
even the pure  
aerial chimney in projection  
to which the metaphor  
will not be rustled.  
In the face of so many corpses to positivity.  
It was a boneless business of parallel torrents and trash barges.  
A rust colored and fragmented writing is attacked in the university.  
The cordial lands protested bride of the depths of my eye - your preserving  
stills your absent minded regard as though it were sky.  
A umbrella fashioning will magnify  
the careless clay of a planet.  
You are the mourning one of a ostrich,  
the torrential ness of the bottle, the power of the fire.
