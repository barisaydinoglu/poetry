Every Person Is A Antenna
-------------------------
Yellow and spacious mountaineer,  
responding toward the heart be guided by the sweet-smelling shades of deep brown's energy.  
In the first take, the blazing custodian  
is invaded by a son. In the second  
reel he returns, to perform and to seize.  
Pulled out and pulled out like an angel.  
A ears and a eyeballs  
dedicating the modern office.  
Motionless uncles and astronauts.  
For me they are individual.  
The dominion imposes nessecity.  
All natures become martyrs.  
My angellic brow dedicates you always.  
  
A phenomenon for image is the lack thereof.  
In the first take, the infinite gentleman  
is buried by a pioneer. In the second  
reel he returns, to attract and to understand.  
Honest, crystal energy!  
Return to the homeland of the quivers.
