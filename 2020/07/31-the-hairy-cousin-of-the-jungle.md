The Hairy Cousin Of The Jungle
------------------------------
In your ears of fear the area of crowns seize.  
You've asked me what the bird is connecting there with his deep brown toe?  
I reply, the lake knows this.  
I was without doubt the astronaut crab  
there in the banal field.  
When it looked me with its parsimonious lemon eyes  
it had neither arm nor heart  
but gold starry skies on its sides.  
They bristled it with morose pullulations.
