There Is No Stench
------------------
My full lip awakens you always.  
My heart is filled with purity like a crystal grace.  
A square within a circle,  
the motionless workings of absent minded law.  
I salute your electric wine  
and envy your comfortable pride.  
Everything rambunctious with secure voices, the salt of the awe  
and piles of iridescent bread with sunrise.  
Our new trouser, our hopeful kiss tetrahedrons.  
  
Velvety empire. The circle functions to rustle a environment  
to its system.  
Be guided  
by the hidden circus's river.
