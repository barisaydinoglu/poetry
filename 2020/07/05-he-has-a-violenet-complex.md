He Has A Violenet Complex
-------------------------
Tiredness is gone, the subject has formed.  
Indicates the juice's promising finger.  
Has the region been blushed with curiosities?  
Behind marine water and transluscent cinnamon wells.  
What wets the props of sincerity?  
Shut up and shut out like a sphere.  
And meetings of fractious tail indicates the salt's reconciling mouth.  
I am flew by mane and beast, by salt and mist.  
You are the worn-out mother of a ostrich,  
the senile ness of the pullulation, the power of the clay.  
How responding is the romantic city and it's real bones?  
Thick, glass faucet!  
There are many pigeon holes outside furious events.  
In my  
night at afternoon you are like a movie  
and your form and colour the way I return them.  
Outside the sand-colored hand of the lava.  
I could fly puberty, polyp, and cadaver  
from sweetness and shorelines  
with  
a turqoise necklace  
with receptacles in my shoulder.  
  
The sunset sea shells you in its mortal wind.  
And the cathedral to its energy  
and among the lights the thick one  
the mountaineer covered with celestial affection.
