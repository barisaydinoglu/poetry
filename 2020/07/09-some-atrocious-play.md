Some Atrocious Play
-------------------
We get the faith  
they must lots to rise  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but alarms.  
Perhaps they are not flew. You - the essential leg.  
Reconciling the sea shell of her awe full of wonder.  
Nothing but that reflection of stars.  
In the first take, the round person  
is wetted by a father. In the second  
scene he returns, to protect and to blush.  
There ought to be a banner of a warm apple preserving in a sea.  
You pacify in the sea as in a handsome archipeligos.  
The bitterest tiger that relaxes in your smooth stone.  
I am passed by knave and billow  
of blood colored smoke, by salt and drizzle.  
They trembled it with fragmented gardens.
