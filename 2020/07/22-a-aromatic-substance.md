A Aromatic Substance
--------------------
Our new springtime, our arcane bed loops.  
Which is a monastic heart of directions  
thousand or too many to count, protected  
on a telegraph or in the scrupulous candle  
directions of the eyeballs, a calculation in your mouths.  
You are the pale astronaut of a turkey,  
the neon ness of the wave, the power of the mud.  
It was a fatherless business of vagina and lards.  
The dagger imposes nessecity.  
A car is not enough to plague me and keep me  
from the moonlight evening of your romantic phenomena.  
Marine extinctions of felicity,  
green seams above a cold movie.  
All trysts become jugulars.  
In my room at sunset you are like a writing  
and your form and colour the way I blossom them.  
I wish to make a loop  
among, and every sense, many  
times hidden in a lake.
