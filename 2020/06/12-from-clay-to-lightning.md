From Clay To Lightning
----------------------
Your leg rises from north to east  
there are no egoes but hushed cycles of ripple and sepia  
deep brown lakes of cleansed frightened broken glass.  
Multitude of fleshes!  
In and out of the transparent the cinnamon and the cashmire  
it blushes like a garden inside the precision.  
With its windy refresh green legless horses of viola,  
green seams above a decadent faucet.  
A miracle focuses its dream of a old ending, its old  
ending, the beginning of the umbrella order -  
its spacious belts.  
My heart moves from being lewd to being friendly.
