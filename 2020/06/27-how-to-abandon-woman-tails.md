How To Abandon Woman Tails
--------------------------
A loaf of bread baked with negligent decency and salt.  
Halfway.  
Because I love you, love, outside the wind and in front of the water.  
You are the lemon of my ironous leg.  
I do not electrify in the moonlight  
evening of parched abberation.  
A current of equinoctial bird feather  
that does not know why it flows and develops.  
  
The I in lighthouse the archipeligos around hers  
a tale we divulge in passing,  
with notions of decency  
and a passion for computer science and mountaineering  
shut up and closed off like a breakfast.
