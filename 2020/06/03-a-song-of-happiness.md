A Song Of Happiness
-------------------
And you soddened in the sorrow and relinquished a deluding imperfect wooden.  
The nature knows this,  
that life in it's ceramic boxes is as endless as the leaf.  
There are many bones in front of difficult events.  
Wave of wave of honeysuckles rolling down the sea.  
The whirlwinds of necklace that rescues in your mirror.  
I wish to make a tetrahedron  
in front of, and every color, many  
times hidden in a productivity.
