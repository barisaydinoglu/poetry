A Song Of Fear
--------------
Your starlight is  
a fragrance of strawberry filled with  
frail lunar.  
Pulled out and closed off like a grace.  
Went heard in ship the consequence imposes nessecity.  
Has the city been trusted with funny things?  
You travel slowly into a vicinity to preserve your business.  
From tornado to unrelenting rain,  
hidden lunars drawn by promising channels, a  
troubled  
mirror begins to reconcile.  
From her hand and her shoulder set  
warmths of the earth.  
If I could seek the felicity and the university.  
Multitude of mosaics!  
In and out of the cinnamon the crimson and the sand-colored  
Around deep brown water and deep brown prizes.  
And you refresh like a utensil and an arcane carpet making a somber thing of a chance meeting with a daughter.
