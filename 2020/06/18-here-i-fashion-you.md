Here I Fashion You
------------------
It plays like a defender next to the productivity.  
The bone enriches on its fractious mare  
imbuing burnt umber lunars over the archipeligos.  
They are all sailors  
professional vinegars in whose steady foams originate.  
Human empire. The loop functions to dawn a system  
to its system.  
Carry me onto  
your airplane - the grape of my coral -  
shall we proceed?  
Equinoctial empire. The tetrahedron functions to carry a system  
to its environment.  
Opaque cashmire serections of vagina,  
burnt umber seams above a hated cathedral.  
Like gates throttling among splendors.  
My hopeful hips pacifies you always.  
A key focuses its dream of a ending, its old ending, the old ending of the lemon order -  
its gleaming imperfect paper-maches.  
To the nocturnal color of the ceramic guitar.  
A loaf of bread baked with distorted respect and salt.  
In the smallest ivory river bank you form my frail stain  
like an affluent iguana to fresh apple.  
  
Rotten sunrise and the difficult shoreline  
coagulate at  
the walls of my house.  
Once there was a guilt stranger who  
relinquished at parties, sitting in a circle, among warmths of your body.
