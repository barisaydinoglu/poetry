The Hairy Mountaineer Of The Moonlight Evening
----------------------------------------------
Phemonana was no longer right at the recording threshold.  
I wish to make a loop  
next to, and every faith, many  
times hidden in a foam.  
In your shoulder of gnawing the boulevard begins to dream of carrying.  
Wave of wave of times rolling down the sea.  
Multitude of elixirs!  
In and out of the burnt umber the crimson and the cinnamon  
To the aquatic color of the fused quartz old warrior's medal.  
The gentleman smiles at the woman  
but the woman does not smile  
when he looks at the elephant goddess  
and the bruised ocean.  
Come with me to the abberation of vinegars.  
Where manes meet  
propellers meet, in and in and the sound  
of hounds, to reach out and flow in embarassement.  
  
It's a mingling telegraph of smokes.
