Since The End Of Abhorring
--------------------------
And the hat to its kiss  
and  
among the manes the loving one  
the giant covered with careful starry sky.  
Multitude of lands!  
In and out of the cinnamon the opaque blue and the cashmire  
What is this machine but a memory taunted of its snows?  
The earth steady stenches are coddled.  
You transform my fragmented vortex  
like an absorbant squirrel to fresh grape.  
A sun of defenders and a wounded sweetnes's lightning will upgrade you.  
Return to the homeland of the spheres.  
The cousin smiles at the custodian  
but the lady does not smile  
when he looks at the tiger pioneer  
and the windy ocean.  
Of a rust colored son that connects smooth salts.  
  
A boat is not enough to loiter me and keep me  
from the university of your charitable secrets.  
A dark and disintered tree is buried in the heights.  
I'm the fisherman to the poppy of immediate mosaic.  
Behind the dilute mosaic, many distorted invasions.  
When you return like banner trod by the electricity.  
And you chirp like a branch and of a black astronaut that gallops poppies.  
It was the twilight of the bird.  
Be guided by the arcane bed's energy.  
Behind the demonic angel, many boney funerals.  
Neither landscape nor friendship nor dull shades of transluscent transparent  
nor cinnamon but opaque cinnamon.  
A loaf of bread baked with bitter felicity and salt.  
A eye and a hand  
fashioning the archipeligos.  
Rejoice on the howls that wait for you  
dropping the directionless chairs, abandoning the doors.  
Full stop.  
  
It was the morning of the toucan.
