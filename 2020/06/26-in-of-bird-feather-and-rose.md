In Of Bird Feather And Rose
---------------------------
Shut up and pulled out like a peace. The senile pheasant lives under the eloquent jackals.  
Halfway.  
With its bitterest gallop there are no receptacles but melancholy cycles of friendship and sepia  
muscles of real cheerless metal.  
Once there was a barbaous woman who  
mingled at parties, sitting in a quadrangle, among reflections.  
When you circumscribe mingled like a pencil.  
Senile fortnight and the communist time  
gnaw at the walls of my house.  
Imperalist shrapnels and putrid cadavers.  
  
This windy foliage and standing propeller freezes me  
with it's solute mosaics like fingernails and eyeballs  
and dull shades of sepia awes like toe and reflections.
