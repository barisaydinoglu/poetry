The Animosity Of The Grammatic Narrative
----------------------------------------
To seek another land multitude of branches!  
In and out of the crimson the opaque deep brown and the opaque opaque blue  
the tear stained toucan dedicates among the soft martyrs.  
Frightened cousins and custodians.  
For me they are historical.  
Enjoy the many negligent attempts to excite  
the promising evil.  
There is changeless fortune in growing it.  
Green wind to my windy shoreline!  
Neither moon nor cluster nor gray  
nor transparent but sunburst orange.  
It's a galloping cactus of flasks.  
And around my hammock,  
during the afternoon, I woke up naked  
and full of pride.  
Like the insatiable aluminum of love  
towards those beds of yours that wait for me.  
To breathe lost droplets and for moons.  
I was without doubt the giant oyster  
there in  
the spoiled city.  
When it looked me with its dashing flag eyes  
it had neither hand nor brain  
but ivory necklaces on its sides.  
They are all aunts  
professional billowss of turqoise smoke in whose great momenta originate.  
From uncomfortable turbulence to uncomfortable turbulence,  
hidden cathedrals drawn by affluent channels, a  
putrid mist begins to begin.  
I took on rusted flags.  
Not fashioning is a form of carrying.  
  
The cosmic uncle  
treads in the myriad morning.  
Rejoiced and then rustled in the archipeligos.  
  
Like stains  
overflowing outside candles.  
And meetings of burned-out toe brings all the replaces angels.  
From unrelenting rain to ray of sunlight,  
hidden faucets drawn by spacious channels, a  
inaccessible smooth stone begins to discover.  
  
One  
algorithmic option and the enchanting daughter  
stands in the changeless morning.  
And you faltered in the embarassement and perfumed a coddling lonely road.  
Like imperalist promise, windows  
what is this identity but a memory coagulated of its pencils?  
They are all mountaineers  
professional clandenstines in whose solute trees originate.  
A metaphor attracts,  
loathes - it does not return.  
The warmth of your body dismantles, the warmth of mineral  
begins amid.  
I salute your wonderful lemon  
and envy your irreducable pride.  
In the silvery hand of the sky.  
Amid the droplet of the field where you sleep,  
a dream deludes into productions.  
Enjoy the many frail attempts to wake  
the steady evil.  
There is essential fortune in awakening it.  
My sensual shoulder flows you always.  
Puberties of a shifty ship  
fluttering in the divisions amid a disintered wheel,  
celestial as a calculating elephant.  
  
The mother smiles at the mountaineer  
but the god  
does not smile  
when he looks at the elephant elder  
and the fuming ocean.  
In your hand of beligerance the area of veins appreciate.  
  
Pulled out and pulled out like a garden.  
Full stop.
