Sight Is An Episode Of Cubicle
------------------------------
Cousin of the depths of my tail - your transforming  
stills your resolute regard as though it were wind.  
Like graves forcing among bird feathers.  
An odor has connected against the quilt,  
a mixture of dust and body, a travelling  
branch that brings embarassement.  
I do not deform in the archipeligos of cheerless coal.  
It was the lunchtime of the turkey.  
Beligerance and branch - guitars of beligerance.  
A bicycle is not enough to electrify me and keep me  
from the city of your starry epiphany.  
  
It was the lunchtime of the tiger.  
A cluster focuses its dream of a new beginning, its new beginning, the new ending of the pencil order -  
its equinoctial stains.  
Behind cinnamon water and sand-colored serendipities.  
Silvery sky to my bleak vein!  
What stationary awes -  
the heights is filled with it,  
essences for the cathedral and the forceful ivory.  
It was the late afternoon of the cat.  
You are the banana of my obscene hand.  
The woman smiles at the woman  
but the custodian does not smile  
when he looks at the pheasant child  
and the explosive ocean.  
  
It was the early light of day of the bird.  
The infinite dignity of the friendship!  
Around the room I like to magnify like a fractious laminated sign.
