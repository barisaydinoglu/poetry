The Curiosities Of The Moonlight Evening
----------------------------------------
To the incredulous steady horse I want you to crystallize on my foot.  
A square outside a tetrahedron,  
the boney workings of celestial law.  
The indespensable pioneer  
Continues in the aquatic morning.  
I stayed performed and transluscent silvery  
in the region.  
Because I love you, love, with the heat and next to the heat.  
The giant smiles at the father  
but the giant does not smile  
when he looks at the elephant uncle  
and the violenet  
ocean.  
A signal understands,  
silences - it does not return.  
Halfway.  
You are the crooked son of a elephant,  
the shaken ness of the reflection, the power of the ice.  
  
Once there was a ironous custodian who  
responded at parties, sitting in a tetrahedron, among films.  
The sensible person  
protects in the spacious morning.  
And the mist to its telegraph  
and among the movies the parenthetical one  
the god covered with parenthetical book.  
I salute your arcane sugar  
and envy your honest pride.  
The manes exists even when there is  
little to say, and it  
ceases  
in front of it in darkness.  
An odor has seized against the current,  
a mixture of salt and body, a trusting  
dove that brings sorrow.  
I saw how coats are developed  
by the rosy foliage.
