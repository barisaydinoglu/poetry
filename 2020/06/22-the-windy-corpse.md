The Windy Corpse
----------------
A blood colored and mechanical wreath is forced in the thicket. It is a tale of dilute noises the hollow smooth stone is sweet-smelling on your heart.  
I saw how farms are stored  
by the humble guitar.  
Of your red river bank when you hold out your curves.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the trusting blue lakes?  
And the fog secure splattering its ships and coagulating them full of  
divisions and iguana?  
And  
so that its errors will deceive your mouth.  
Carry me onto your raft - the banana of my circus -  
The I in flower head hidden empire. The tetrahedron functions to set a system  
to its environment.  
Branch of an abolished putrid well.  
When you preserve like energy showered by the sky.
