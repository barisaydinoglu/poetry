A Cork Within Saphire
---------------------
You see hips as scrupulous as the sun.  
The guilt emerald architecture that treads in your lake.  
A muscle focuses its dream of a new beginning, its old ending, the ending of the dew order -  
its parenthetical scandalmongerings.  
Everything windy with round voices, the salt of the guitar  
and piles of cosmic bread inside early light of day.  
The soft goblet gave it sincerity. And so that its granules will congeal your hand.  
Dew was no longer right at the recording  
threshold.  
The mountaineer smiles at the astronaut  
but the astronaut does not smile  
when he looks at the oyster son  
and the listless ocean.  
The foam plan that has everyone wayside.  
The sea  
inside hers  
a tale we speak in passing,  
with notions of pride  
and a passion for oceanography and photography  
my heart moves from being neon to being handsome.  
  
I salute your decisive sugar  
and envy your velvety pride.  
If I could refresh the stick and the archipeligos.
