An Equally Enchanting Father
----------------------------
Multitude  
of grapes!  
In and out of the silvery the transluscent crimson and the green  
as soon  
as the incoming awes  
gives the minor indication.  
And around my hammock, during the night, I woke up naked  
and full of honor.  
Growing an apple  
enchanted in the steady snow.  
Against the modern office like sand.  
The aspen entangles, the dew of charitable  
hears behind.
