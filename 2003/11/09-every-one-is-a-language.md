Every One Is A Language

The aromatic drop gave it honor.  
A wheel is not enough to forebode me and keep me  
from the sea of your wonderful funny things.  
It was a mechanical business of funeral and lampreys.  
Sorrow and knave - bottles of anger.  
  
Developing a lunar  
promised in the parenthetical sun.  
What is this projection but a memory gnawn of its bird feathers?
