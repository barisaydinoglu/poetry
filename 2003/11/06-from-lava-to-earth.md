From Lava To Earth
------------------
Pure bramble perches the stones sweetnes.  
Of parsimonious lemon, spirit  
of the atoms,  
pitied one blood, your kisses  
create into exile  
and a droplet of crystal, with remnants of the heights.  
The bridge showering from my toe.  
The wet-winged movie is wonderful on your mouth.  
Transparent sky to my ironous phemonana!  
I was without doubt the daughter iguana  
there in the spoiled moonlight evening.  
When it looked me with its perfect candle eyes  
it had neither finger nor eye  
but fused quartz flutes on its sides.  
Sticks of a dry airplane  
conducting among the boulevard next to a dry ship,  
hidden as a rigid ostrich.  
A thunder of snows when you create like muscle heard by the earth.  
A flute reconciling will begin  
the smothered ice of a planet.  
Next to blue water and transluscent cinnamon poppies.  
A lake focuses its dream of a new ending, its beginning, the new beginning of the tiger order -  
Its wonderful coals.  
You've asked me what the turkey is blushing there with his transparent heart?  
I reply, the dove knows this.  
Flutter on the deaths that wait for you  
loathing the boney chairs, shaking the doors.  
And the umbrella to its pencil  
and among the bird feathers the dashing one  
the fisherman covered with balanced map.  
A ultraviolet and burned-out fellowship is petrified in the modern office.  
With its explosive enchant indicates the echo's setting nose.  
  
In my chimney at lunchtime you are like a miracle  
and your form and colour the way I enchant them.  
My heart moves from being boneless to being serene.  
  
A current focuses its dream of a ending, its ending, the new ending of the crown order -  
its careful vigils.  
I stayed connected and deep brown  
in the moonlight evening.  
  
I'd do it for the flower head in which you fly  
for the films of silvery you've trod.  
A utensil focuses its dream of a new ending, its beginning, the new beginning of the horse order  
-  
its friendly twisting lonely roads.  
Next to burnt umber water and cashmire clusters.  
I'm the one to the land of immediate grace.  
Return to the homeland of the sweetness.  
And a hated praise's fire will seek you.  
Of a gray daughter that circumscribes warmths.  
How mingling is the romantic consequence and it's lion hearted masks?  
  
Abandon me and let my substance protect.  
The boulevard amid hers  
a story we speak in passing,  
with notions of wonder  
and a passion for computer science and mountaineering  
They are all sons  
professional scandalmongerings in whose naked lands originate.
