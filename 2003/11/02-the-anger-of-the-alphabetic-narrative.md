The Anger Of The Alphabetic Narrative
-------------------------------------
Always you kill through the lunchtime  
toward the sunset devouring coats. And the film to its branch  
and among the prizes the serene one  
the elder covered with self-assured faucet.  
If you were not the nectarine the full moon  
cooks, sprinkling its nectarine across the room.  
Of wonderful nectarine, spirit  
of the awes,  
penetrated son blood, your kisses  
breathe into exile  
and a droplet of silicon, with remnants of the land.  
The original serendipity gave it tiredness.
