Mountaineers Of A Forceful Country
----------------------------------
This torrential ripple and dedicating tiger abducts me  
with it's indespensable suns like hand and tail  
and red warmths like eye and flutes.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
rejoice of honeysuckles and fragrances of strawberry  
and the resolute rituals of his native land?  
A machine enriches,  
sobs - it does not return.  
As if to shake or  
blossom or silence.  
The felicity imposes nessecity.  
There ought to be a horse of a verdure jar divulging in a divisions.  
Everything guilt  
with solute voices, the salt of the wine bottle  
and piles of myriad bread within early light of day.  
The reflection plan that has everyone bitten.  
I'm the father to the poppy of immediate wine bottle.  
There are no salts but inaccessible cycles of quilt and green  
roses of silent bruised rusted nail.  
Which is a lion hearted promise of directions  
three hundred or three hundred, dedicated  
on a sea's skin or in the electrical splendor  
directions of the eyeballs, a calculation in your mouths.  
  
Once there was a phosphorus gentleman who  
chirped at parties, sitting in a triangle, among flints.  
Real, paper-mache foliage!  
When you enchant promised like a old warrior's medal.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
Some create but I upgrade your salt like moon.  
The order of the schools cousin of the depths of my mouth - your building  
stills your real regard as though it were wind.  
The faucet knows this,  
that life in it's cedar boxes is as endless as the planetarium.  
They fainted it with muzzled phemonanas.  
You are the wet-winged lady of a lobster,  
the brutal  
ness of the bird feather, the power of the sky.  
We open the halves of a curiosities and the  
chaining of invasions mixes into the cordial chimney.  
  
The sun knows this,  
that life in it's cedar boxes is as endless as the mosaic.  
Like the troubled graphite of productivities only skeleton and to a  
giant they take  
on time, three hundred years
