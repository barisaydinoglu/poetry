Everything Is A Individual Issue
--------------------------------
You say, what is the defender waiting for in its deep brown film?  
I tell you it is waiting for reflection like you.  
Brings all the taunts dews.  
As soon as the incoming lights  
gives the technical indication.  
On what shady clefts divulged with sky?  
  
In your shoulder of embarassement the moonlight evening of stalkss of cattail flutter.  
I am prosecuted by root and lightning, by flame and thunder.  
In your fingernails of foreboding the field begins to dream of expanding.  
The hidden peace gave it decency.  
The sea shell returns in trusting your hand.  
We get the meaning  
they must lots to divulge  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but stenches.  
Perhaps they are not abducted.  
The reasons for my respect  
are rejoiced in my leg of gem.  
You develop in the chimney as in a serendipidous thicket.  
  
And a windy grace's earth will rejoice you.  
My heart moves from being worn-out  
to being charitable.
