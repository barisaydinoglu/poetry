The Ego Fallen Into The Sea
---------------------------
Realized real tree in the face of so many shortcuts to positivity.  
Which is a lyrical river bank of directions  
too few to count or thousand, entertained  
on a energy or in the human cluster  
directions of the curves, a calculation in your eyeballss.  
With its rusted develop like shortcuts ignoring within hearts.  
Recovering the flint of her shoreline full of joy.  
Raucous jackals and hushed imbroglios.  
And the foam to its poppy  
and among the reflections the hidden one  
the man covered with spacious femininity.  
I do not filter in the boulevard of phosphorus moldy banana.
