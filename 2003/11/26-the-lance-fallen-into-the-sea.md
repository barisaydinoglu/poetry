The Lance Fallen Into The Sea
-----------------------------
Everything worn-out with infinite voices, the salt of the vein  
and piles of angellic bread among day.  
Of your turqoise goblet when you hold out your heart.  
The friendship plan that has everyone troubled.  
What is this metaphor but a memory deformed of its stars?  
You, who is like a shortcut ostrich among the circumscribing of many pioneer.  
Behind marine water and sand-colored laws.  
Pockets of sand  
converted into fused quartz.  
As soon as the incoming rivers  
gives the public indication.  
A warmth of your body focuses its dream of a new beginning, its old ending,  
the new beginning of the flesh order -  
its aquatic salivas.  
Which is a wonderful shoreline of directions  
too many to count or three hundred, imbued  
on a momentum or in the fleeting cathedral  
directions of the hips, a calculation in your earss.  
And meetings of rusted eye a loaf of bread baked with communist tiredness and salt.  
Only guilt and to a  
father they take on time, three hundred years  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the angellic stars?  
And the fog dashing splattering its natures  
and shattering  
them full of  
room and ostrich?  
And you throttled in the panic and wove a undulating belt.  
Full stop.  
  
Wave of wave of flints rolling down the sea.  
Shall we keep going?  
  
Outside the bitten grace, many  
hairy pins.  
And clusters and knaves.
