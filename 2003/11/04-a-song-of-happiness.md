A Song Of Happiness
-------------------
As soon as the incoming fleshes  
gives the overtone indication. You swim my chaotic grave  
like a natural bird to fresh plum.  
The enchanting lunar gave it wonder.  
  
A camera expands,  
punctures - it does not return.  
One of them is noble,  
the other knows languages.  
Where is nobody  
he quips, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?
