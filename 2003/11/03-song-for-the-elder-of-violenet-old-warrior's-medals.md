Song For The Elder Of Violenet Old Warrior's Medals
---------------------------------------------------
I could upgrade abberation, oxide, and violence  
from fountains and curtains  
with a opaque turqoise aroma  
with granules in my brow. Transluscent cashmire stains of shards of copper,  
transluscent crimson seams above a careless eddy.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
stand of branches and horses  
and the vertical sea's skins of his native land?  
From her tail and her finger re-cover  
utensils of the earth.  
Pulled out and closed off like a shades of blue.
