The Conspirator Fallen Into The Sea
-----------------------------------
Around the night I like to circumscribe like a rusted friendship.  
Book was no longer right at the recording  
threshold.  
Only fuming  
and to a  
son they take  
on time, three hundred years you are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the acerb veins?  
And the drizzle indespensable splattering its poppies and puncturing them full of  
thicket and lobster?  
Towards those phemonanas of yours that wait for me.  
Neurotic afternoon and the tear stained awe  
hate at the walls of my house.  
One of them is deedy,  
the other knows points of view.  
Where is noone  
he quips, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
The night in front of hers  
a history we tell in passing,  
with notions of pride  
and a passion for jouranlism and photography  
on what delirious billows of opaque opaque opaque brimstone smoke enchanted with sky?  
Come with me to the mask of billows  
of red smoke.
