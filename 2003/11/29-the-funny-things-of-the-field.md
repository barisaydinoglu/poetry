The Funny Things Of The Field
-----------------------------
Not  
to understand or even meet  
the hat of one who grows  
outside me in a sea or flowing to a giant.  
Deceive me and let my substance awaken.  
I stayed  
trusted and crimson  
inside the divisions.  
The order of the mirrors playing the awe  
of her promise full of honor.  
I am gnawn by pullulation and oblivion, by oxide and sunshine.  
Pure abys drinks the goblets  
return to the homeland of the maternities.  
But the stalks of cattail recovered the memory.  
For a day, maybe too many to count,  
I  
rested under a tornado  
at a bus stop, waiting for the one to be inside.  
Towards those hats of yours that wait for me.  
  
In your foot of smearing the moonlight evening begins to dream of blushing.  
I awaken as if outside a rustling city.
