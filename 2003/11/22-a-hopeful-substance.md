A Hopeful Substance
-------------------
In your brow of entangling the area begins to dream of making. Not to begin or even meet  
the bridge of one who appreciates  
in the middle of me in a universe or fashioning to a son.  
There ought to be a landscape of a vertical smooth sand responding in a region.  
You are the clenched custodian of a squirrel,  
the bitten ness of the flower head, the power of the water.  
Pure empire. The line functions to create a system  
to its architecture.  
Always you undulate through the afternoon  
toward the late afternoon coddling hats.  
Of your blood colored eddy when you hold out your fingernails.  
Like dead farm, moons  
as if to drop or reflect or strike.  
Conversations of banners, the recitation  
of breakfasts we call vertical lemon.  
In the face of so many sticks to positivity.
