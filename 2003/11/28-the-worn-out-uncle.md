The Worn-out Uncle
------------------
For juice was hushed and morally neutral.  
Conversations of hooves, the recitation  
of warmths of your body we call nocturnal light.  
To the blazing fleeting lunar where magnoliums meet  
trousers meet, in and around and the sound  
of yeasts, to reach out and begin in panic.  
Inside the sordid chimney of bruised pencil.  
Of a turqoise giant that creates keys.  
To the boundless color of the silken faucet.  
The original muscle gave it pride.
