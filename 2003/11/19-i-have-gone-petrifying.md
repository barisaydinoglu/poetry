I Have Gone Petrifying
----------------------
You are the misunderstood gentleman of a bird,  
the ironous ness of the saxophone, the power of the lava. The doves exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
inside it in darkness. Leaf was no longer above the recording threshold.  
I flutter as if outside a burned-out ash.
