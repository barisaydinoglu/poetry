Communist Film
--------------
In my university at day you are like a banner  
and your form and colour the way I perfume  
them.  
An odor has responded against the serendipity,  
a mixture of clandenstine and body, a fluttering  
warmth of your body that  
brings panic.  
And you bristled in the embarassement and flew a mutating flask.  
An odor has seized inside the flower head,  
a mixture of clandenstine and body, a relaxing  
planetarium that brings animosity.  
A sweetnes focuses its dream of a beginning, its beginning, the new ending of the current order -  
its vertical violas.  
You are the explosive uncle of a lobster,  
the motionless ness of the candle, the power of the lava.  
  
With its troubled reflect your river is a horse filled with demonic evening star.  
A black and morbid current is smothered in the vicinity.
