Color As Salts
--------------
Wave of wave of foams rolling down the sea.  
Only insatiable and to a  
woman they take on time, three hundred years  
I'd do it for the honeysuckle in which you respond  
for the planetariums of transluscent green you've circumscribed. With its frail circumscribe in my  
night at sunset you are like a fountain  
and your form and colour the way I protect them.
