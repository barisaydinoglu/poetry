Everything Is A Minor Issue
---------------------------
You - the unguessed curves.  
For warmth was imperalist and morally neutral.  
A line inside a square,  
the sordid workings of lovely law.  
In your shoulder of impaling the land begins to dream of enchanting.  
The order of the ribbons my fluidic hips inherits you always.  
For essence was disordered and morally neutral.  
This cold reflection and enriching sea's skin penetrates me  
with it's silent beds like lip and mouth  
And turqoise silences like mouth and paths.  
  
Pacify on the pins that wait for you  
protesting the cold chairs, cracking the doors.  
I took on fatherless defenders.  
There ought to be a smooth stone of a essential wave seizing in a moonlight evening.
