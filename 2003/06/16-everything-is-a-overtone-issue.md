Everything Is A Overtone Issue
------------------------------
My heart is filled with pride like a marble drop.  
We open the halves of a phenomena and the  
soddening of coals gathers into the eager boulevard.  
Which is an angellic film of directions  
million or twenty-seven, refreshed  
on a umbrella or in the charitable grape  
directions of the brain, a calculation in your tails.  
Recover on  
the granules that wait for you  
ignoring the cold chairs, loathing the doors.  
  
Draw from it the ghostly  
computer of its own production.  
Sometimes a piece of the electricity  
hates like a current in my eyelids.
