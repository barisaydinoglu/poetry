Since The End
-------------
This windy lake and showering time drowns me  
with it's natural energies like leg and lip  
and dull shades of cinnamon lighthouses like brow and splendors.  
A serene wood paneling making a full thing of a lucky meeting with a woman.  
Multitude of droplets!  
In and out of the sepia the sunburst orange and the deep brown  
The wind electrical bloody feathers are deformed.  
And meetings of calcerous hips it's a mixing stalks of cattail of waxes.  
Not carrying is a form of creating.  
It was the day of the tiger.  
Come with me to the error of walls.  
My heart moves from being dry to being gleaming.  
It is a tale of wayside bones I saw how productivities are relaxed  
by the clear apple.  
One of them is hopeful,  
the other knows machines.  
Where is someone  
he says, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Where prizes meet  
shorelines meet, next to and next to and the sound  
of explications, to reach out and dedicate in embarassement.  
With its hairy conduct outside marine water and green coats.  
  
The light gallops in circumscribing your fingernails.  
You, who is like a juice elephant among the playing of many astronaut.  
  
It was the holiday of the iguana.  
The daughter smiles at the father  
but the fisherman does not smile  
when he looks at the jaguar god  
and the hated ocean.  
Transparent massacres of death,  
crimson seams above a skeleton stalks of cattail.  
The enduring honeysuckles wiped you begin headlong into a chimney to fashion your business.  
They fainted it with calcerous silences.  
  
Within the brimstone sorrow of the darknes.  
Halfway.  
Amid the rust colored fear of the puberty.  
In your heart of killing the jungle begins to dream of fluttering.  
Nothing but that hoove of sea water.
