Since The End
-------------
The insufferable eddy that attracts in your fellowship. Like the muzzled brick of miracles halfway.  
Of your blood colored  
bottle when you hold out your heart.  
  
And amid my hammock, during the midnight, I woke up naked  
and full of felicity.  
A wheatfield focuses its dream of a new beginning, its new ending, the old ending of the mirror order -  
its hopeful bones.
