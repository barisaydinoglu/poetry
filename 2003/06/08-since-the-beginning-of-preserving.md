Since The Beginning Of Preserving
---------------------------------
It's a wetting candle of lonely roads.  
Cinnamon salivas of night,  
sand-colored seams above a bruised angel.  
Pockets of sand converted into glass.  
The smooth stone plan that has everyone sticky.  
Once there was a wounded son who  
upgraded at parties, sitting in a loop, among splendors.  
With its raucous excite in the face of so many pigeon holes to animosity.  
  
Sometimes a piece of the mud  
loathes like a umbrella in my eyeballs.  
The dust showers on its wayside mare  
relaxing blue alcoves over the boulevard.
