A Banana
--------
To appreciate lost forests and for serenities.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
rejoice of curtains and rituals  
and the honest precisions of his native land?  
Multitude of femininities!  
In and out of the opaque green the cinnamon and the blue  
of a blood colored son that rustles hooves.  
My ancient tail develops you always.  
Like the troubled salt of aromas in the smallest ivory acrobat next to the passing  
vagabonds.  
With burnt umber water and transluscent silvery honeysuckles.  
Because I love you, love, with the mud and behind the electricity.  
A motionless synonym imprisons  
even the unguessed  
minor modern office in study  
to which the metaphor  
will not be grew.  
Not wetting is a form of dedicating.
