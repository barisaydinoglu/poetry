An Equally Moonlit Gentleman
----------------------------
The star penetrates, the curtain of musical  
transforms around.  
Not to rejoice or even meet  
the law of one who flies  
in the middle of me in a universe or pacifying to a god.  
Raucous sons  
and custodians.  
For me they are neutral.  
Calculating weather, melancholy lights like the trouser.  
  
You reconcile slowly into a sea to pacify your business.  
A current of promising ship  
that does not know why it flows and wakes.
