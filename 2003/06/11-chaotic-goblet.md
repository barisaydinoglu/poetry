Chaotic Goblet
--------------
I saw how aromas are preserved  
by the domestic bottle.  
A arm and a leg  
divulging the sea.  
And next to my hammock, during the afternoon, I woke up naked  
and full of tiredness.  
If you were not the nectarine the enduring moon  
cooks, sprinkling its orange across the jungle.  
I was without doubt the pioneer toucan  
there in the skeleton region.  
When it looked me with its resolute utensil eyes  
it had neither finger nor arm  
but gem necklaces on its sides.  
A black and calcerous sphere is rejected in the room.  
Shall we set forth?  
My heart is filled with joy like a cedar bottle. Only clotting and to a  
fisherman they take on time, too few to count years  
and you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
wet of laws  
and hearts  
and the warm circuss of his native land?  
Multitude of essences!  
In and out of the crimson the silvery and the cashmire  
From blade of grass to harrowing wind,  
hidden saxophones drawn by affluent channels, a  
exiled river begins to perform.
