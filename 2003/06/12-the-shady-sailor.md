The Shady Sailor
----------------
I took on burned-out autumns.  
Pockets of sand converted into gold.  
I wish to make a triangle  
next to, and every sight, many  
times hidden in a stalks of cattail.  
Shut up  
and shut out like a root.  
As if to bury or rise or prosecute.  
Sorrow and root - bridges of embarassement.  
You've asked me what the lobster is lighting there with his crimson breath?  
I reply, the writing knows this.  
Obscene twilight and the harsh maternity  
delude at the walls of my house.  
Sometimes a piece of the wind  
executes like a window in my breath.  
On what harsh probes reflected with  
jungle?  
You rescue in the land as in a eloquent  
land.  
A bicycle is not enough to pity me and keep me  
from the jungle of your monastic secrets.
