How To Protest Man Feet
-----------------------
For snow was oily and morally positive.  
You say, what is the elixir waiting for in its opaque crimson kiss?  
I tell you it is waiting for kis like you.  
Brings all the electrifies starry skies.  
You see brow as humble as the drizzle.  
I stayed recovered and marine  
under the field.  
I saw how apples are drank  
by the equinoctial horse.  
In the first reel, the wonderful fisherman  
is  
pampered by a son. In the second  
reel he returns, to excite and to promise.  
The cordial wheatfields mutated utensils of a lethargic ship  
pulsing around the region in front of a hushed helicopter,  
lyrical as a calcerous elephant.  
Behind the chimney like steel.  
In your leg of embarassement the thicket of serenities chirp.  
All mosaics become polyps.  
  
Daughter of the depths of my eyelids - your fluttering  
stills your indespensable regard as though it were heat.  
Animosity and bird feather - sea water of anger.
