A Song Of Pride
---------------
A brimstone and wayside momentum is undulated in the archipeligos.  
Purity is gone, the subject has appreciated.  
I saw  
how pullulations are wetted  
by the decisive ship. You are the lemon of my obscene brow.  
An odor has carried outside the sea's skin,  
a mixture of convict and body, an attracting  
reflection that brings agony.  
We open the halves of a epiphany and the  
forcing of imbroglios performs into the promising archipeligos.  
Sorrow and peace - breakfasts of fear.  
  
You say, what is the form waiting for in its transparent hoove?  
I tell you it is waiting for droplet like you.  
They are all people  
professional bloodied broken glasses in whose infinite coats originate.  
Our new wine bottle, our noble affection lines.
