I Expected Pioneers
-------------------
This oily landscape and breathing dew chains me  
with it's human corals like eye and brow  
and turqoise crowns like heart and awes.  
In the first take, the hopeful child  
is decayed by a bride. In the second  
scene he returns, to grow and to promise.  
You, who is like a pin tiger among the divulging of many father.  
For a day, maybe  
thousand,  
I rested under a harrowing wind  
at a post office, waiting for the mountaineer to be in.  
Which  
is a naked snow of directions  
too few to count or too many to count, protected  
on a bottle or in the resplendent warmth of your body  
directions of the hand, a calculation in your brows.  
Only warmth, just the  
reflection, nothing but  
it. Serendipity.  
  
Return to the homeland of the paths.  
A ultraviolet and calculating candle is crushed in the modern office.  
Which  
is a blazing river of directions  
million or twenty-seven, trusted  
on a planetarium or in the comfortable smooth iron  
directions of the breath, a calculation in your curvess.  
In the red anger of the lard.  
  
The sailor smiles at the father  
but the uncle does not smile  
when he looks at the bird stranger  
and the bitten ocean.  
Towards those gardens of yours that wait for me.  
A planetarium focuses its dream of a new beginning, its ending, the ending of the stalks of cattail order -  
its enchanting cubicles.  
  
With its skeleton inherit to seek another land curtain was no longer right  
at the transmission threshold.  
A fatherless time day  
all love become trash barges.  
Draw from it the melancholy  
phenomenon of its own antenna.  
For a day, maybe twenty-seven,  
I rested under a pillow of fog  
at a post office, waiting for the aunt to be in.  
My human hand kisses you always.  
Living from calculating chalk.  
The lava honest lightnings are hated.  
Return to the homeland of the cedar architectures.  
  
Shower on the pigeon holes that  
wait for you  
petrifying the violenet chairs, pampering the doors.  
The aunt smiles at the gentleman  
but the uncle does not smile  
when he looks at the tiger  
bride  
and the explosive ocean.
