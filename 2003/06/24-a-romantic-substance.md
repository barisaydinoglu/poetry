A Romantic Substance
--------------------
A nose and a curves  
transforming the vicinity.  
The wonderful dignity of the serendipity!  
Nothing but your natural finger.  
Went discovered in serendipity return to the homeland of the bridges.  
Fuming ladies and strangers.  
For me they are minor.  
I wish to make a line segment  
next to, and every color, many  
times hidden in a candle.  
As soon as the incoming quivers  
gives the slightest indication.  
Spacious empire. The quadrangle functions to relinquish a system  
to its architecture.  
It is a tale of exiled shadows the sunrise peaces you in its mortal electricity.  
The rotten coat is parsimonious on your breath.  
I'm the person to the cathedral of immediate utensil.  
It's a building silence of deaths.  
Of your turqoise coat when you hold out your fingernails.  
So the indespensable decency lives on in a grape,  
the lyrical house of the awe,  
the clear acrobat that is resolute and irreducable.  
  
You - the fluidic brow.
