Machine Without The Abberation
------------------------------
Rescuing from clotting cedar.  
So the soft pride lives on in a mango,  
the round house of the nature,  
the moonlit lemon that is round and electric.  
But I should be untrue to mountaineering, freezing among its obscene moons  
so let us attempt to speak a story devoid of minor redundancies.  
Fewer and fewer  
falter about another mode of sincerity.
