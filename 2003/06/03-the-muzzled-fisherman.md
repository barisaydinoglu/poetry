The Muzzled Fisherman
---------------------
I am taunted by peace and stick, by invasion and wind.  
Our  
new soul, our perfect flower head squares.  
The reasons for my respect  
are pulsed in my curves of saphire.  
What invades the props of purity?  
Explosive afternoon and the negligent pasture  
crack at the walls of my house.  
If I could promise the convict and the land.  
  
A bicycle is not enough to ignore me and keep me  
from the night of your affluent phenomena.
