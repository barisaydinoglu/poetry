Since The End Of Loathing
-------------------------
Playing a pasture  
responded  
in the moonlit drizzle.  
A loaf of bread baked with fuming tiredness and salt.  
And a careless railroad track's ice will pacify you.  
But the banner built the memory.  
Brings all the entangles schools.  
It's a pacifying coral of dominions.  
Hat  
of a wetted inevitable aroma.  
Neither stone nor miracle nor rust colored  
nor sand-colored but marine.  
  
In the first reel, the unguessed lady  
is scratched by a lady. In the second  
take he returns, to return and to light.  
Not discovering is a form of discovering.  
A calculation chirps,  
taunts - it does not return.  
What mysteries does the jaguar contain?  
How little we travel and how much it crystallizes the curiosities of this universe.
