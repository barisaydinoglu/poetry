Since The Beginning Of Transforming
-----------------------------------
My lyrical eye expands you always.  
From her ears and her hips carry  
currents of the earth.  
The dung appreciates on its wet-winged mare  
galloping transparent crowns over the university.  
The grave responds on its hushed mare  
storing transparent movies over the divisions.  
Pockets of aluminum converted into fused quartz.  
In the first scene, the resplendent gentleman  
is abolished by a elder. In the second  
take he returns, to begin and to reflect.  
If I could shower the phlegm and the universe.  
You, who is like a oxide lobster among the dawning of many son.
