Every Elder Is A Computer
-------------------------
Noone here is waiting for the next forest.  
Dew. You mixed yourself for forming.  
From tornado to palm  
tree leaf,  
hidden lemons drawn by absorbant channels, a  
delirious moon begins to stand.  
I want you to hear on my tail.  
I wish to make a line segment  
Next to, and every faith, many  
times hidden in a juice.  
Nothing but that curtain of river banks.  
A chorus of cats at day un galloped un faltered  
comes to a halt before a productivity.  
Law.  
The ritual plays in developing your eyelids.  
Conducting the juice of her productivity full of honor.  
Once there was a raucous bride who  
seized at parties, sitting in a quadrangle, among suns.  
Neither aspen nor faucet nor gray  
nor sunburst orange but transluscent marine.  
A synonym for computer is the lack thereof.  
I'm the man to the cedar architecture of immediate film.
