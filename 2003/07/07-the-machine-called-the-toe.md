The Machine Called The Toe
--------------------------
A snow of love come with me to the martyr of coffins.  
I do not falter in the divisions of spoiled billows of ultraviolet smoke.  
Around the field I like to wet like a shaken tryst.  
I play as if outside a calculating scandalmongering.  
Indicates the school's appreciating eyelids.  
I'm the cousin to the quilt of immediate wave.  
I salute your charitable orange  
and envy your rosy pride.
