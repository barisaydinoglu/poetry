Outside Of Quiver And Nature
----------------------------
I was without doubt the daughter squirrel  
there in the obscene night.  
When it looked me with its absorbant momentum eyes  
it had neither arm nor eye  
but ivory pullulations on its sides. A circle with a line,  
the bitter workings of profound law.  
Halfway.  
Be guided by the pure pencil's lake.  
Around  
the field I like to grow like a brutal coral.  
The autumn sets in discovering your fingernails.  
In my jungle at sunset you are like a pasture  
and your form and colour the way I seize them.  
What is this sequence but a memory deceived of its coats?  
  
Not imbuing is a form of blossoming.  
Not preserving is a form of gathering.  
Where autumns meet  
kiss meet, among and next to and the sound  
of wounded soldiers, to reach out and relax in confusion.  
Shut up and shut out like a lemon.  
Come with me to the clock of wastelands.  
There are no nougats but browbeaten cycles of fountain and crimson  
forms of nocturnal  
cheerless ash.  
Here I am, a gleaming lip invaded in the modern office of awe.
