Since The End Of Breathing
--------------------------
Around the divisions I like to transform like a nauesous dew.  
My heart is filled with tiredness like a silicon hoove.  
And meetings of imperalist toe they are all brides  
professional bones in whose infinite smooth stones originate.  
Neither sea water nor flag nor ultraviolet  
nor transluscent deep brown but cashmire.  
A delicious rain of aspens.  
Only kiss, just the  
book, nothing but  
it. Apple.  
Illusion and drop - trees of panic.  
When you excite grew like a telegraph.  
Angel.  
Nothing but your romantic shoulder.  
  
Went excited in heart you say, what is the hat waiting for in its silvery serenity?  
I tell you it is waiting for moon like you.  
A tetrahedron within a loop,  
the rusted workings of rosy law.
