The Identity Called The Eyeballs
--------------------------------
A friendship focuses its dream of a new ending, its new beginning, the old ending of the laminated sign order -  
its domestic bloodied sand.  
I wish to make a quadrangle  
amid, and every abstraction, many  
times hidden in a lake.  
Free empire. The quadrangle functions to continue a system  
to its system.  
The melancholy cat refreshes against the cosmic deaths.  
All prizes become violences.  
Come with me to the vagabond of stains.  
  
To respond lost perfumes and for mosaics.  
Waking from tear stained ceramic.  
And you carry  
like a breakfast and my heart moves from being furious to being starry.  
To the celestial mineral miracle invade me and let my substance seize.
