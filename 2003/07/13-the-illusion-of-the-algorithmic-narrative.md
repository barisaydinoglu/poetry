The Illusion Of The Algorithmic Narrative
-----------------------------------------
And umbrellas and yellow lakes.  
Full stop.  
Shall we keep going?  
Some excite but I magnify your graphite like fellowship.  
Beligerance and mist - quivers of panic.  
A bridge -like cummerbund  
communist afternoon and the whirlwinds of dew  
strike at the walls of my house.  
Not to crystallize or even meet  
the lemon of one who mingles  
behind me in a chimney or pacifying to a cousin.  
In your nose of executing the modern office begins to dream of continuing.  
When you love like guitar understood by the ice.  
The wounded lemon that blossoms in  
your serenity.  
Receptacles of a lethargic wheel  
making behind the vicinity outside a violenet train,  
romantic as a mourning tiger.  
Like shadows plaguing in stars.  
Nobody here is waiting for the next echo.  
Springtime. You flew yourself for protecting.
