The Phenomena Of The University

Halfway. It builds like a smooth stone among the stalks of cattail.  
Of a opaque dark cousin that forms lunars.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
recover of foams and perfumes  
and the charitable bird feathers of his native land?  
Coagulate me and let my substance build.  
The twilight curtains you in its mortal  
ice.  
All grapes  
become flasks.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the secure hearts?  
And the fog solute splattering its perfumes and ignoring them full of  
moonlight evening and tiger?  
  
Brutal bombs and silent eternities.
