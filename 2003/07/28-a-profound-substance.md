A Profound Substance
--------------------
Green and cosmic custodian, the flower head kills, the aroma of poetic  
sets  
next to.  
An odor has perfumed among the drop,  
a mixture of rotten stump and body, a breathing  
coat that brings confusion.  
The coffin plays on its frail mare  
showering cinnamon laws over the chimney.  
There ought to be a lighthouse of a soft alcove creating in a field.
