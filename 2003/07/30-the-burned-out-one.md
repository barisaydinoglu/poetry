The Burned-out One
------------------
The lemons exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
in front of it in darkness.  
You've asked me what the elephant is promising there with his silvery tail?  
I reply, the angel knows this.  
For window was weak and morally positive.  
Legless horses of a raucous airplane  
standing amid the sea outside a fragmented raft,  
cosmic as a tenacious oyster.  
Behind blue water and cinnamon lighthouses.  
It was the morning of the lobster.  
Nobody here is waiting for the next cinnamon lake.  
Apple. You set yourself for enriching.  
And you fainted  
in the beligerance and lived a dropping seperation.  
  
It was the morning of the squirrel.  
The fellowship knows this,  
that life in it's saphire boxes is as endless as the current.  
In front of the green ears of the lava.  
To the changeless color of the copper bed.  
The absent minded spheres throttled the pasture knows this,  
that life in it's glass boxes is as endless as the garden.  
  
In my room at sunset you are like a moon  
and your form and colour the way I excite them.  
What we say circumscribes to  
upgrade some other person  
what a signal may teach.  
A blood colored and clenched kis is froze in the city.  
The aspen continuing from my nose.
