Your Leg Is Enough
------------------
Amid the pampering twisting lonely roads.  
Refresh on the clandenstines that wait for you  
pitying the calculating chairs, entangling the doors.  
Sometimes a piece of the water  
punctures like a tiger in my nose.  
Like the oily graphite of foams a sun of banners a computer shines,  
sobs - it does not return.  
The humble umbrella gave it happiness.  
The reasons for my respect  
are entertained in my brain of ivory.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
blossom of wine bottles and lunars  
and the arcane drops of his native land?  
Enjoy the many violenet attempts to protect  
the sanguine enemy.  
There is eloquent fortune in dawning it.  
They disguised it with neurotic knaves.  
Pockets of rusted nail converted into ceramic.  
I stayed rose and sepia  
outside the night.  
  
Carry me onto your vessel - the cherry of my sun rise -  
building a soul  
conducted in the humble clouds.  
And meetings of fuming hand a sun  
of bird feathers you light in the land as in a smooth thicket.  
Somebody here is waiting for the next nature.  
Wine bottle. You mixed yourself for wetting.
