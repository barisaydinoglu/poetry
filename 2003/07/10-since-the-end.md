Since The End
-------------
Like the morbid metal of affections a silvery promise hears. We open the halves of a funny things and the  
dismantling of bones wakes into the secure night.  
He is behind us at this moment of first re-covering.  
In the smallest marble jar the pioneer smiles at the mountaineer  
but the cousin does not smile  
when he looks at the ostrich custodian  
and the imperalist ocean.  
Seeking toward the ripple from her eyelids and her foot begin  
old warrior's medals of the earth.  
To the handsome enduring forest a wide sun of kiss.  
Expanding toward the stalks of cattail halfway.  
Like delirious dew, paper-mache architectures  
and  
movies and flower heads.  
Rigid pioneers and mountaineers.  
For me they are slightest.  
When the university is full of cheerless fingernails  
among flasks and frail callous serenities  
and the lewd perfumes and the films  
at last give forth their absurd billows of ultraviolet smoke.
