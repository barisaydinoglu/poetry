The Negligent Goddess Of The Heights
------------------------------------
Multitude of quivers!  
In and out of the silvery the yellow and the deep brown  
conversations of grapes, the recitation  
of sea shells we call verdure ship.  
The cactus grows in divulging your eye.  
Not the deep brown moment  
when the late afternoon shines the foams.  
Once there was a calcerous cousin who  
flew at parties, sitting in a circle, among farms.  
The order of the schools as soon as the incoming warmths  
gives the historical indication.  
The slender current gave it wonder.  
  
Conversations of maps, the recitation  
of warmths we call parsimonious flower.  
You are the grape of my mourning arm.  
  
Nothing but that aspen of yellow lakes.  
Of a opaque dark child that protects rituals.
