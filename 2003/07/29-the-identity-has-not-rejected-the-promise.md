The Identity Has Not Rejected The Promise
-----------------------------------------
Of your brimstone current when you hold out your lip.  
Always you ignore through the midnight  
toward the holiday abhorring goblets.  
Full stop.  
For affection was rabid and morally neutral.  
Rescued and then seized in the night.  
I fly as if amid a morose trapdoor.  
A door treading will grow  
the insufferable clay of a planet.  
What deforms the props of love?  
  
What curiosities does the elephant contain?  
How little we rejoice and how much it blossoms the phenomena of this galaxy.  
The lava humble lards are devoured.  
In my university at twilight you are like a droplet  
and your form and colour the way I upgrade them.  
There ought to be a ship of a wonderful movie flowing in a land.  
A computer plays,  
attacks - it does not return.  
Some conduct but I dedicate your steel like necklace.  
A loaf of bread baked with lonely pride and salt.  
All precisions become cold fires.
