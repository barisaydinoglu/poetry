Everyday You Fashion
--------------------
Brings all the soddens moons.  
Like yeasts degrading inside hats.  
Inside the bitter utensil, many lonely lonely roads.  
Come with me to the city of imperfect paper-maches.  
Conversations  
of momenta, the recitation  
of beds we call aromatic ship.  
And meetings of bruised eyelids imbuing toward the star to appreciate lost lighthouses and for praises.  
You, who is like a bloodied iron jaguar among the mingling of many pioneer.  
And  
you perform like a prize and you - the sanguine leg.  
Halfway.  
Nothing but that book of crowns.  
Of your dark bed when you hold out your arm.  
And you bristled in the beligerance and perched a depriving wax.  
An odor has mixed against the moon,  
a mixture of flask and body, a rescuing  
fountain that brings embarassement.  
A train is not enough to harass me and keep me  
from the jungle of your wonderful phenomena.  
In the sun rise of the vicinity where you sleep,  
a dream pities into images.  
My arcane hand breathes you always.  
Rustling a saxophone  
lived in the fluidic sunshine.  
Loving toward the lake appreciating an aspen  
played in the manly rain.  
  
Blossom on the shadows that wait for you  
shaking the nauesous chairs, faltering the doors.  
Wetted and  
then transformed in the land.  
Candle.
