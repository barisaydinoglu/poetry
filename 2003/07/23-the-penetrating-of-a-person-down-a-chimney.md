The Penetrating Of A Person Down A Chimney
------------------------------------------
The human river banks wiped so the plumed happiness lives on in a lemon,  
the monastic house of the telegraph,  
the fleeting candle that is comfortable and honest.  
Has the vicinity been perfumed with curiosities?  
A sepia fragrance of strawberry attracts.  
Only calcerous and to a  
astronaut they take on time, too many to count years  
you transform in the chimney as in a wonderful  
boulevard.
