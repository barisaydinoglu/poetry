There Is No Twisting Lonely Road

And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
connect of lemons and currents  
and the lovely spheres of his native land?  
Of a dull shades of cashmire father that flows aromas.  
The disintered crab shines outside the domestic seperations.  
Conversations of clusters, the recitation  
of foams we call irreducable breakfast.  
The rambunctious tiger plays against the infinite juices.  
Of your brimstone sphere when you hold out your eye.  
Of a rust colored custodian  
that begins souls.  
Of your opaque red perfume when you hold out your eyelids.  
Realized changeless star the bottle flutters in circumscribing your brow.  
And you deluded  
in the agony and relaxed a chaining depth.  
Green and absent minded lady,  
It rustles like a muscle in the grace.
