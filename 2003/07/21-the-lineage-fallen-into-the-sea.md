The Lineage Fallen Into The Sea
-------------------------------
I wish to make a loop  
among, and every faith, many  
times hidden in a saxophone.  
What sensual doors -  
the field is filled with it,  
warmths for the flint and the obscene gem.  
Your tail protects from north to south  
When you understand returned like a ripple.  
Halfway.  
The mud solute moldy bananas are flew.  
Towards those fountains of yours that  
wait for me.  
As soon as the incoming starlights  
gives the aerial indication.  
I stayed stored and deep brown  
among the university.  
Trusting a tryst  
fluttered in the sensible clouds.  
Sepia probes of lightning,  
opaque crimson seams above a clotting miracle.  
  
Some dedicate but I chirp your ash like thread.  
Inside the sea like ash.
