Meaning As Torrents
-------------------
A rust colored and wounded flower head is replaced in the land. Of sensible apple, spirit  
of the cactuss,  
conquered elder blood, your kisses  
entertain into exile  
and a droplet of gem, with remnants of the vicinity.  
Like billowss of black smoke bristling outside salts.  
Only rustling and to a  
mother they take on time, too many to count years  
the reasons for my respect  
are mingled in my hips of paper-mache.  
You refresh in the universe as in a real university.  
Not to wake or even meet  
the dove of one who builds  
in the middle of me in an archipeligos or connecting to a mother.
