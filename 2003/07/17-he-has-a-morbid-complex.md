He Has A Morbid Complex
-----------------------
I wish to make a triangle  
within, and every feeling, many  
Times hidden in a thread.  
On what banal phlegms refreshed with water?  
  
And doves and ribbons.  
Blue water to my listless map!  
  
A loaf of bread baked  
with insufferable love and salt.  
Among the brimstone embarassement of the rooster.
