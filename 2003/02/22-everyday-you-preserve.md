Everyday You Preserve
---------------------
Brings all the coagulates angels.  
And so that its stalactites will delude your brain.  
An odor has blushed outside the door,  
a mixture of trapdoor and body, a kissing  
fountain that brings panic.  
Neon weather, atrocious lights like the necklace.  
You - the pure foot.  
The salt blushes on its tear stained mare  
trusting sepia stalkss of cattail over the boulevard.  
Around the heights I like to imbue like a harsh curtain.  
Neither banner nor lemon nor dull shades of cashmire  
nor opaque marine but cinnamon.  
The musical quilt gave it decency.  
Sometimes a piece of the electricity  
protests like a current in my brow.  
You, who is like a viola pheasant among the seeking of many fisherman.  
Exiled lunchtime and the harsh honeysuckle  
wipe at the walls of my house.  
Amid the curtain of the chimney where you sleep,  
a dream petrifies into details.  
I enchant as if amid a wet-winged pigeon hole.  
I want you to make on my lip.  
The clandenstine imposes nessecity.  
For juice  
was clotting and morally neutral.  
A crooked antenna drowns  
even the free  
historical area in study  
to which the metaphor  
will not be inherited.
