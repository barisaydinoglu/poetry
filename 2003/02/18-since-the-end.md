Since The End
-------------
For a day, maybe million,  
I rested under a ray of sunlight  
at a post office, waiting for the mountaineer to be among.  
When the universe is full of calcerous lip  
next to circumstances and crooked windy bird feathers  
and the negligent pullulations and the foliages  
at last give forth their fatherless consequence.  
A wounded synonym coagulates  
even the humble  
minor divisions in inscription  
to which the metaphor  
will not be performed.  
Sand-colored torrents of conglomerate,  
sepia seams above a fatherless momentum.  
  
Closed off and pulled out like a movie.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
The magnolium knows this,  
that life in it's chalk boxes is as endless as the serenity.  
Here I am, a electrical brow changed in the city of juice.
