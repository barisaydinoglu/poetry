The Identity Of Grammatic Points
--------------------------------
I am erupted by silvery lake and serection, by conspirator and mist.  
I'd do it for the faucet in which you create  
for the planetariums of cashmire you've swam.  
The stick transforms on its calcerous mare  
awakening yellow pencils over the sea.  
The starry smooth ash gave it wonder.  
When the sea is full of tenacious arm  
within sticks and fractious neon sweetness  
and the brutal rituals and the silences  
at last give forth their obscene ego.  
In the smallest paper-mache warmth of your body what seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
Phosphorus afternoon and the boney rose  
change at the walls of my house.  
I am forced by prize and pigeon hole, by rotten stump and sun.  
Only school, just the  
drop, nothing but  
it. Law.  
Alcove of a bristled violenet apple.  
We get the sense  
they must lots to wake  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but enemies.  
Perhaps they are not coagulated.  
You've asked me what the squirrel is trusting there with his green eye?  
I reply, the warmth knows this.  
The order of the muscles it was a mechanical business of vagabond and dusts.  
If you were not the peach the solute moon  
cooks, sprinkling its bread across the night.  
  
But the branch reflected the memory.  
And a bruised lunar's fire will live you.  
  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
Indicates the starlight's growing finger.
