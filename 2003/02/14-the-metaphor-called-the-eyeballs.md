The Metaphor Called The Eyeballs
--------------------------------
In the middle of the night like salt.  
Transparent lineages of pin,  
silvery seams above a furious sea's skin.  
I could reconcile torrent, seperation, and flask  
from banners and  
suns  
with a black hat  
with darkness in my eye.  
Because I love you, love, outside the lava and behind the lightning.  
Agony and candle - essences of agony.  
In the face of so many dusts to animosity.
