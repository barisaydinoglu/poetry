Proof Of Full Feeling
---------------------
A laminated sign focuses its dream of a old ending, its beginning, the ending of the fragrance of strawberry order -  
its winged clefts.  
Come with me to the lance of trapdoors.  
A chorus of turkeys at fortnight un breathed un wiped  
comes to a halt before an affection.  
Shall we keep going?  
I wish to make a quadrangle  
amid, and every color, many  
times hidden in a breakfast.  
To the wonderful warm quilt the order of the laminated signs of your turqoise phemonana when you hold out your arm.  
If I could shine the pin and the vicinity.  
You trust headlong into a divisions to magnify your business.  
It was a cheerless business of billows of turqoise smoke and bombs.  
The reasons for my respect  
are mixed in my heart of diamond.  
Return to the homeland of the mirrors.  
I wish to make a tetrahedron  
around, and every feeling, many  
times hidden in a coat.  
And you soddened in the agony and heard a smearing wasteland.  
  
Shut up and shut out like a ship.  
Building from disordered copper.  
  
Only silent and to a  
god they take on time, too few to count years
