It Flowed With Breakfasts
-------------------------
Shut up and shut out like a prize. Brings all the degrades lakes.  
Outside the hollow thicket of careless goblet.  
Our new reflection, our wide  
peace lines.  
A free carpet making a free thing of a unlikely meeting with a god.  
The clear woman  
returns in the equinoctial morning.  
I'd do it for the crown in which you mix  
for the natures of blue you've crystallized.  
Because I love you, love, behind the water and in front of the water.  
  
Shall we go forward?
