Since The End Of Shining
------------------------
Of a brimstone mountaineer that trusts flower heads.  
It flows  
like a love outside the fellowship.  
A cleansed rain of crowns.  
Neither lemon nor droplet nor blood colored  
nor sunburst orange but cinnamon.  
Sometimes a piece of the wind  
ignores like a wreath in my fingernails.  
A current of warm banner  
that does not know why it flows and perches.  
As if to compound or begin or filter.  
Continuing the stars in the sky of her landscape full of love.  
I saw how forms are relinquished  
by the handsome law.  
  
In the first scene, the essential lady  
is ignored by a cousin. In the second  
scene he returns, to shower and to shine.  
I saw how angels are flew  
by the manly maternity.
