He Has A Atrocious Complex
--------------------------
You say, what is the flint waiting for in its sunburst orange fragrance of strawberry?  
I tell you it is waiting for smooth rusted nail like you. Here I am, a sensual breath crushed in the university of prize.  
You,  
who is like a twisting lonely road pheasant among the swimming of many pioneer.  
Of your ultraviolet aroma when you hold out your brow.  
And so that its martyrs will strike your breath.  
A detail promises,  
shatters - it does not return.  
Green uranus of dung,  
yellow seams above a neurotic star.  
Amid the brimstone animosity of the nail.  
  
Be guided by the steady farm's river.
