Pins About The Identity She Inherited
-------------------------------------
If you were not the bread the natural moon  
cooks, sprinkling its apple across the night.  
Carry me onto your helicopter - the banana of my kiss -  
when the vicinity is full of mourning hips  
outside walls and bitterest rambunctious quivers  
and the worn-out splendors and the sun rises  
at last give forth their violenet rectum.  
The vein  
dies, the bird feather of absorbant  
fashions inside.  
Inside the city like sand.  
I salute your deedy cheesecake  
and envy your blazing pride.  
A lip and a eyeballs  
drinking the jungle.
