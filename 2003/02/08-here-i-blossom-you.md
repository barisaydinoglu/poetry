Here I Blossom You
------------------
In my land at midnight you are like a drop  
and your form and colour the way I drink  
them. Always you shatter through the twilight  
toward the twilight striking laminated signs.  
A inscription develops,  
pities - it does not return.  
When the jungle is full of imperalist arm  
inside nougats and boney decadent sea water  
and the sifted quivers and the salts  
at last give forth their insatiable lamprey.  
The land in hers  
a story we  
tell in passing,  
with notions of tiredness  
and a passion for mountaineering and jouranlism  
  
In the smallest crystal light and the pullulation to its sun  
and among the bottles the lion hearted one  
the god covered with profound breakfast.  
I'd do it for the lake in  
which you seize  
for the bridges of marine you've relaxed.
