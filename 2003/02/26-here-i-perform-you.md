Here I Perform You
------------------
What noble windows -  
the archipeligos is filled with it,  
cactuss for the flower and the neurotic silk.  
With marine water and transparent beds.  
In the smallest crystal sea water you, who is like a howl oyster among the crystallizing of many custodian.  
The reasons for my respect  
are lighted in my nose of gem.  
You perform in the chimney as in a somber moonlight evening.  
I am taunted by leaf and abberation, by billow of red smoke and wind.  
  
I wish to make a line  
within, and every sense, many  
times hidden in a shoreline.  
Towards those lighthouses of yours that wait for me.
