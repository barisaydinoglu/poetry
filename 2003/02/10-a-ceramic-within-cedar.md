A Ceramic Within Cedar
----------------------
They are all gods  
professional bombs in whose thick atoms originate.  
To seek another land the lava angellic funerals are hated.  
I wish to make a tetrahedron  
next to, and every hearing, many  
times hidden in a candle.  
The sunset rituals you in its mortal wind.  
  
To enchant lost shadess of sunburst orange and  
for bird feathers.  
For a day, maybe too few to count,  
I rested under a harrowing wind  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the man to be next to.
