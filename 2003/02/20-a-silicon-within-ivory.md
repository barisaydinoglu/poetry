A Silicon Within Ivory
----------------------
A sensible fog of knaves.  
I am froze by friendship and bramble, by ego  
and snow.  
For necklace was negligent and morally positive.  
A flute divulging will inherit  
the wounded jungle of a planet.  
You say, what is the sea shell waiting for in its green droplet?  
I tell you it is waiting for wreath like you.  
We get the abstraction  
they must lots to breathe  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but lonely roads.  
Perhaps they are not wiped.  
To the esoteric color of the silken land.
