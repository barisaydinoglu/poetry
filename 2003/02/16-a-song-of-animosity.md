A Song Of Animosity
-------------------
Behind the dull shades of sand-colored panic of the havoc.  
And you recover like a stars in the sky and for a day, maybe twenty-seven,  
I rested under a unrelenting rain  
at a bus stop, waiting for the lady to be within.  
A serene carpet making a round thing of a lucky meeting with a stranger.  
Against the mechanical vicinity of browbeaten warmth.  
To promise lost lunars and for aromas.  
Carry me onto your helicopter - the orange of my echo -  
Like disintered prize, films  
you awaken headlong into a thicket to chirp your business.  
The silent dignity of the awe!  
She is under us at this moment of first making.  
Towards those droplets of yours that wait for me.  
Frail twilight and the tremulous necklace  
delude at the walls of my house.  
Some pacify but I chirp your salt like autumn.  
Among the bird feather of the moonlight evening where you sleep,  
a dream kills into inscriptions.
