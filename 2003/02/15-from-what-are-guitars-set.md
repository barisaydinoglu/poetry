From What Are Guitars Set
-------------------------
Scandalmongerings of a spoiled ship  
relinquishing next to the boulevard outside a bleak car,  
absent minded as a misunderstood elephant.  
In my room at day you are like a film  
And your form and colour the way I understand them.  
The grace plan that has everyone bitter.  
As if to kill or recover or congeal.  
I saw how love are stood  
by the plumed guitar.  
A parched identity soddens  
even the somber  
algorithmic thicket in inscription  
to which the metaphor  
will not be reconciled.
