I Have Gone Weaving
-------------------
What funny things does the lobster contain?  
How little we protect and how much it promises the mysteries of this universe.  
I was without doubt the mother squirrel  
there in the parched jungle.  
When it looked me with its angellic wine bottle eyes  
it had neither nose nor hips  
but gold keys on its sides.  
And in my hammock, during the afternoon, I woke up naked  
and full of sincerity.  
And eddies and moons.
