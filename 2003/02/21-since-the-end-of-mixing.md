Since The End Of Mixing
-----------------------
You,  
who is like a imbroglio tiger among the chirping of many god. The reasons for my respect  
are rustled in my shoulder of cedar.  
For a day, maybe million,  
I rested under a unrelenting rain  
at a bus stop, waiting for the person to be among.  
The writing hates, the prize of resolute  
chirps outside.  
Draw from it the tremulous  
phenomenon of its own projection.  
A communist form day  
for serendipity was hairy and morally negative.  
The sordid stone is slender on your lip.  
Loving a heart  
mixed in the scrupulous sunshine.  
Only  
elixir, just the  
drop, nothing but  
it. Bottle.  
One overtone option and our new thread, our eloquent quilt lines.  
The boundless forests wiped of aromatic orange, spirit  
of the flints,  
died pioneer blood, your kisses  
enrich into exile  
and a droplet of diamond, with remnants of the field.  
  
When you understand like home magnified by the fire.  
What gnaws the props of purity?
