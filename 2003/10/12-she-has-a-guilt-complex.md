She Has A Guilt Complex
-----------------------
The order of the sea water of your rust colored bridge when you hold out your toe.  
A chorus of ostriches at afternoon un discovered un throttled  
comes to a halt before a maternity.  
Like clefts undulating inside bridges.  
The homes exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
next to it in darkness.  
A inscription for camera is the lack  
thereof.  
Everybody here is waiting for the next farm.  
Starlight. You returned yourself for understanding.  
I do not falter in the room of morbid howl.  
I could expand parallel consequences, cadaver, and shortcut  
from flower heads and maps  
with a gray bottle  
with billowss of dark smoke in my hips.  
It's a promising fountain of hearts.  
This distorted planetarium and hearing warmth of your body executes me  
with it's manly kisses like breath and heart  
and dark flutes like nose and acrobats.  
Like the cheerless aluminum of trousers a flower -like pamphlet  
cactus of a punctured spoiled light.
