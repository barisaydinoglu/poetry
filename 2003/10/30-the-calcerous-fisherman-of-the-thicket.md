The Calcerous Fisherman Of The Thicket
--------------------------------------
Shaken weather, whirlwinds of lights like the film.  
In front of blue water and yellow lighthouses.  
In the first take, the irreducable woman  
is impaled by a sailor. In the second  
reel he returns, to mix and to kiss.  
My heart is filled with love like a glass  
cathedral.  
The stationary acrobat gave it wonder.  
My heart is filled with felicity like a gold gem architecture.  
What we say makes to  
rescue some other god  
what a point of view may teach.  
On what shady shortcuts entertained with wind?  
  
But I should be true to oceanography, coddling among its frail cactuss  
so let us attempt to tell a story without slightest redundancies.  
For pencil was wet-winged and morally neutral.  
You, who is like a vinegar jaguar among the showering of many sailor.
