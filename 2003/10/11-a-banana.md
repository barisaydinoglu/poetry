A Banana
--------
One of them is fresh,  
the other knows phenomena.  
Where is somebody  
she quips, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
A femininity focuses its dream of a old ending, its ending, the old ending of the echo order -  
its stationary dungs.  
Your brow makes from east to south  
and meetings of fatherless hips she is outside us at this moment of first appreciating.  
Of a opaque rust colored one that recovers miracles.  
And the candle to its kis  
and among the prizes the irreducable one  
the aunt covered with myriad ship.  
The full dignity of the promise!  
You, who is like a lance iguana among the trusting of many man.
