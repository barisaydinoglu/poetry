A Aroma To Flow The Flints You Divulge
--------------------------------------
It was the sunrise of the pheasant.  
Fear and foam - moons of anger.  
Burnt umber wind to my nauesous coral!  
  
It was the midnight of the oyster.  
Of a rust  
colored aunt that enchants lemons.  
The velvety aunt  
kisses in the sweet-smelling morning.  
A current of fleeting pullulation  
that does not know why it flows and magnifies.  
Perfuming toward the circus the city around hers  
a story we speak in passing,  
with notions of pride  
and a passion for science and computer science
