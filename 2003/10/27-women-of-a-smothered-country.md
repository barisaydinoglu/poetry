Women Of A Smothered Country
----------------------------
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
perch of bottles and awes  
and the honest crowns of his native land?  
Where acrobats meet  
grapes meet, in and outside and the sound  
of jackals, to reach out and travel in illusion.  
This burned-out railroad track and dawning time coddles me  
with it's delicate maternities like arm and toe  
and dark jars like arm and doves.  
A sunburst orange landscape dawns.  
Wave of wave of old warrior's medals rolling down the sea.  
Circumscribed and then mingled in the moonlight evening.  
Nothing but that telegraph of droplets.  
I stayed dawned and sand-colored  
behind the region.  
  
Pride is gone, the subject has blossomed.  
Here I am, a warm finger pitied in the field of lunar.  
All  
juices become self-productions.  
You - the handsome ears.  
Amid the ultraviolet panic of the grave.  
Has the divisions been preserved with mysteries?  
Of full grape,  
spirit  
of the atoms,  
drowned father blood, your kisses  
wake into exile  
and a droplet of crystal, with remnants of the chimney.
