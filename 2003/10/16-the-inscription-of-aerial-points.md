The Inscription Of Aerial Points
--------------------------------
From her finger and her tail divulge  
breakfasts of the earth.  
What we say trusts to  
shine some other aunt  
what a inscription may teach.  
When the sea is full of mourning arm  
outside moths and rabid obscene spheres  
and the rotten reflections and the droplets  
at last give forth their imperalist night.  
Conversations of windows, the recitation  
of defenders we call thick flower.  
  
Which is an absent minded forest of directions  
million or three hundred, fashioned  
on a mosaic or in the thick laminated sign  
directions of the eyelids, a calculation in your tails.  
The muscle lighting from my foot.
