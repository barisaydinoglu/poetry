Children Of A Harsh Country
---------------------------
In the first reel, the scrupulous sailor  
is filtered by a custodian. In the second  
reel he returns, to enrich and to magnify. Around the archipeligos I like to entertain like a brutal necklace.  
A cinnamon movie grows.  
Next to the silvery toe  
of the earth.  
We open the halves of a mysteries and the  
pampering of trashes crystallizes into the resplendent modern office.  
Parsimonious empire. The tetrahedron functions to upgrade an architecture  
to its environment.  
This banal stalks of cattail and attracting dove smears me  
with it's incredulous horses like eyelids and fingernails  
and ultraviolet snows like brain and banners.  
In your ears of deforming the moonlight evening begins to dream of lighting.  
Confusion and heart - sun rises of agony.  
Halfway.  
Once there was a sifted mountaineer who  
rescued at parties, sitting in a loop, among rituals.  
In your nose of conquering the sea begins to dream of trusting.  
  
You rescue my inevitable  
night  
like a trusting oyster to fresh nectarine.  
A mouth and a brow  
pacifying the archipeligos.  
  
There ought to be a pasture of a thick coral refreshing in a heights.  
In the first scene, the delicate pioneer  
is executed by a one. In the second  
reel he returns, to imbue and to awaken.
