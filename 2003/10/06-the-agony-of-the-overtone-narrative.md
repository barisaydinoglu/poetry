The Agony Of The Overtone Narrative
-----------------------------------
Like the morose iron of gardens I am shattered by river bank and conglomerate, by saliva and clouds.  
Of musical apple, spirit  
of the banners,  
buried aunt blood, your kisses  
shower into exile  
and a droplet of cedar, with remnants of the heights.  
Indicates the kis's shining breath.  
Relinquishing a tryst  
appreciated in the poetic thunder.  
You appreciate my inaccessible flask  
like a lion hearted ostrich to fresh grape.  
Multitude of atoms!  
In and out of the sunburst orange the green and the yellow  
to the fleeting color of the cedar shoreline.  
The perfume rising from my eyeballs.  
Pure panic perches  
the paths a crimson river bank expands.  
Communist day and the rambunctious tryst  
strike at the walls of my house.
