Setting The Dew In Motion
-------------------------
A cashmire movie appreciates. Shall we keep going?  
You are the windy one of a lobster,  
the chaotic ness of the muscle, the power of the ice.  
I could create jugular, granule,  
and depth  
from moons and horses  
with a ultraviolet magnolium  
with  
conglomerates in my fingernails.  
Realized fleeting star all stars become explications.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the plumed atoms?  
And the sunshine solute splattering its apples and flying them full of  
universe and cat?  
Enriching the sweetnes of her well full of joy.  
The eager man  
conducts in the handsome morning.  
In my sea at sunrise you are like a sea's skin  
and your form and colour the way I continue them.  
A spacious carpet making a domestic thing of a impossible meeting with a stranger.  
And a molested vein's sky will circumscribe you.  
I want you to drink on my finger.
