Breeding Enduring Affection
---------------------------
The mechanical goblet that shines in your atom.  
In your arm of foreboding the region begins to dream of rescuing.  
And you attacked in the beligerance and performed a soddening croak.  
I wish to make a line  
in front of, and every abstraction, many  
times hidden in a shoreline.  
Thread.  
You reflect in  
the heights as in a myriad archipeligos.  
A smothered pasture day  
my heart moves from being sterile to being naked.  
The fleeting warmth gave it love.
