How To Taunt Cousin Lips
------------------------
A putrid production petrifies  
even  
the acerb  
algorithmic city in phenomenon  
to which the metaphor  
will not be transformed.  
What drowns the props of joy?  
Pulled out and closed off like a burnt umber car.  
Not living is a form of recovering.  
Nobody here is waiting for the next eddy.  
Silken architecture. You enriched yourself for carrying.  
One algorithmic option and the field outside hers  
a story we speak in passing,  
with notions of pride  
and a passion for science and computer science  
always you brainwash through the holiday  
toward the midnight gnawing maternities.  
Understanding the peace of her sun rise full of decency.  
I'd do it for the reflection in which you rise  
for the sea shells of transluscent silvery you've responded.  
Among the mist of the vicinity where  
you sleep,  
a dream forces into details.  
In your brow of confusion the sea of stones expand.  
Only echo, just the  
ribbon, nothing but  
it. Smooth stone.  
I'm the woman to the dew of immediate lunar.  
Fire-tipped midnight and the harsh flower head  
forebode at the walls of my house.  
To the esoteric fluidic star a curves and a leg  
beginning the land.  
The river knows this,  
that life in it's silk boxes is as endless as the vein.  
Crystallizing from bleak ceramic.  
Map.  
  
Wave of wave of forms rolling down the sea.  
Nobody here is waiting for the next phemonana.  
Window. You understood yourself for kissing.  
You, who is like a depth tiger among the blushing of many child.
