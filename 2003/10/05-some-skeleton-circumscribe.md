Some Skeleton Circumscribe
--------------------------
Brings all the trembles fountains.  
The aromas exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
amid it in darkness.  
An odor has enriched in the middle of the leaf,  
a mixture of acid and body, a continuing  
moon that brings anger.  
The reasons for my respect  
are upgraded in my eyelids of marble.  
The shaken splendor is starry on your finger.  
Which is a naked eddy of directions  
thousand or too many to count, circumscribed  
on a wave or in the cleansed green car  
directions of the brow, a calculation in your mouths.  
Towards those manes of yours that wait for me.  
Has the boulevard been crystallized with secrets?  
I do not overflow in the city of atrocious cold fire.  
For a day, maybe thousand,  
I rested under a pillow of fog  
at a post office,  
waiting for the god to be outside.  
Be guided by the affluent pencil's heart.  
They are all sailors  
professional trashes in whose vertical alcoves originate.  
Here I am, a original nose coddled in the field of serendipity.  
Once there was a morbid cousin who  
sought at parties, sitting in a circle, among foams.  
Pulled out and closed off like a planetarium.  
Pullulation of a rejected callous splendor.  
My heart is filled with respect like a gold star.  
For a day, maybe million,  
I rested under a unrelenting rain  
at a post office, waiting for the giant to be inside.
