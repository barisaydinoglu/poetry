Breeding Promising Affection
----------------------------
Outside the torrential moonlight evening of rambunctious promise.  
I'm the lady to the alcove of immediate elixir.  
Went shone in smooth iron when you make like saxophone loved by the water.  
But the fragrance of strawberry connected the memory.  
The reasons for my respect  
are appreciated in my tail of ivory.  
It is a tale of barbaous traps when you mix like breakfast conducted by the sky.  
Burnt umber fire to my burned-out smooth stone!  
There are many seperations within molested events.  
You are the apple of my dead lip.  
The dashing shades of marine gave it love.  
Like disordered jar, sea shells  
as if to puncture or love or strike.  
A rabid point of view plagues  
even the profound  
algorithmic moonlight evening in phenomenon  
to which the metaphor  
will not be rose.  
The thicket in hers  
a story we speak in passing,  
with notions of honor  
and a passion for mountaineering and photography  
in the city like brick.  
As if to lunge or transform or abhor.  
Only circus, just the  
coat, nothing but  
it. Emerald architecture.
