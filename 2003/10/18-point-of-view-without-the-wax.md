Point Of View Without The Wax
-----------------------------
There ought to be a maternity of a manly femininity connecting in a jungle.  
Towards those manes of yours that wait for me.  
My heart moves from being lashed to being ancient.  
Everything neon with fleeting voices, the salt of the flower head  
and piles of fresh bread next to morning.  
From uncomfortable turbulence to blade of grass,  
hidden hearts drawn by pure channels, a  
weak wave begins to enchant.  
An odor has developed among the flint,  
a mixture of beast and body, a seizing  
fellowship that brings animosity.
