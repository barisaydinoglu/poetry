Everything Is A Historical Issue
--------------------------------
A clouds of old warrior's medals the maternity plan that has everyone bitten.  
Come with me to the pamphlet of conspirators.  
In the face of so many traps to positivity.  
I wish to make a line segment  
amid, and every color, many  
times hidden in a saxophone.  
And the lunar to its splendor  
and among the flower heads the winged one  
the giant covered with serendipidous lake.  
When you light like aroma formed by the ice.  
Enjoy the many dilute attempts to inherit  
the smooth conspirator.  
There is original fortune in storing it.  
A sand-colored juice dawns.  
They are all aunts  
professional corpses in whose perfect corals originate.  
Brings all the degrades smooth aluminums.  
I stayed stood and transluscent yellow  
under the field.  
Pure dagger fashions the bridges indicates the old warrior's medal's trusting eyelids.  
Realized free miracle when you shine like mosaic perfumed by the fire.  
You return in the modern office as in an absent minded jungle.  
In your foot of electrifying the sea begins to dream of seizing.  
Entangle me and let my substance breathe.
