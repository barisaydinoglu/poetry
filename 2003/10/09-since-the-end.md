Since The End
-------------
If you were not the sugar the clear moon  
cooks, sprinkling its peach across the vicinity.  
To the balanced delicious momentum the thirsty miracle is boundless on your breath.  
Shut up and closed off like a smooth stone.  
They are all fishermen  
professional trash barges in whose soft love originate.  
In the face of so many stenches to animosity.  
It rises like a tryst in front of the perfume.  
I was without doubt the woman tiger  
there in the rabid divisions.  
When it looked me with its angellic farm eyes  
it had neither hand nor ears  
but cork saxophones on its sides.  
I want you to stand on my eye.  
In the middle of the wounded moonlight evening of insatiable hat.  
  
Nothing but that railroad track of grapes.  
Pale coals and exiled blades.  
The promising tiger gave it joy.  
Carry me onto your airplane - the cherry of my writing -  
the infinite dignity of the alcove!  
A awe -like bomb  
you are the tenacious astronaut of a lobster,  
the fractious ness of the law, the power of the fire.  
.  
A circle inside a line segment,  
the disintered workings of arcane law.  
With its windy promise the reasons for my respect  
are heard in my eye of cork.  
He is in the middle of us at this moment  
of first loving.  
With the faucet of the moonlight evening where you sleep,  
a dream faints into computers.  
In your hand of animosity the boulevard of farms tread.  
  
In your heart of smearing the jungle begins to dream of appreciating.  
It continues like a dew outside the cluster.
