What Is True Of The Hoove Is True Of Nothing
--------------------------------------------
Wave of wave of leaves rolling down the sea.  
I'd do it for the mist in which you blossom  
for the kiss of yellow you've enriched.  
Your branch is a quilt filled with troubled  
elixir.  
Here I am, a human  
leg entangled in the archipeligos of starry sky.  
Neither tryst nor energy nor turqoise  
nor transluscent sepia but transluscent transluscent cinnamon.
