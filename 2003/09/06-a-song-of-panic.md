A Song Of Panic
---------------
Your foot gathers from east to west  
a miracle focuses its dream of a new ending, its beginning, the old ending of the starry sky order -  
its changeless stalactites.  
I took on clotting productivities.  
Around the universe I like to wake like a violenet ritual.  
And so that its pins will coagulate your hand.  
Divulged and then drank in the sea.  
I excite as if inside a hairy havoc.  
Praise of a disguised dead pencil.  
It was the sunrise of the elephant.  
A burnt umber stone re-covers.  
A line among a line,  
the shifty workings of nocturnal law.  
  
It was the sunset of the elephant.  
Seizing the smooth stone of her sphere full of joy.  
I do not dismantle in the area of demonic billow of dark smoke.
