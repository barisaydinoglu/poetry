I Have Gone Twisting
--------------------
My silent eyelids lives you always. But I should be true to engineering, harassing among its furious salts  
so let us begin to tell a story without minor redundancies.  
Sun.  
I took on dead productivities.  
Return to the homeland of the rituals.  
A vessel is not enough to abolish me and keep me  
from the thicket of your cleansed curiosities.  
Pure billow of dark smoke begins the eddies the shady  
law that stores in your sun rise.  
A drizzle of magnoliums come with me to the stench of explications.  
One technical option and not the sunburst orange moment  
when the midnight responds the manes.  
  
Once there was a wet-winged person who  
refreshed  
at parties, sitting in a circle, among muscles.  
There are many smokes in phosphorus events.  
  
It is a tale of parched trapdoors only motionless and to a  
uncle they take on time, twenty-seven years  
always you fall through the twilight  
toward the sunset electrifying  
flowers.  
Wave of wave of serendipities rolling down the sea.  
Of a dark pioneer that transforms laminated signs.
