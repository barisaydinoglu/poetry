Meeting Your Corpse
-------------------
If I could attract the scandalmongering and the region.  
Pockets of clay converted into marble.  
Because I love you, love, amid the water and outside the ice.  
And a violenet quilt's clay will weave you.  
The sea amid hers  
a history we tell in passing,  
with notions of happiness  
and a passion for photography and computer science  
the bone shines on its sterile mare  
building crimson cinnamon cars over the universe.  
If you were not the lemon the scrupulous moon  
cooks, sprinkling its grape across the chimney.  
To seek another land I saw how echoes are continued  
by the boundless book.  
Realized romantic flag behind the ultraviolet illusion of the heart.  
Fewer and fewer  
disguise about another mode of pride.  
A point of view for computer is the lack thereof.  
My lovely shoulder entertains you always.  
As if to freeze or magnify or overflow.
