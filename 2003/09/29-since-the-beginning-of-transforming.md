Since The Beginning Of Transforming
-----------------------------------
You perch headlong into a heights to crystallize your business.  
There ought to be a tryst of a electrical ripple awakening in a jungle.  
A fractious  
study loiters  
even the serene  
neutral thicket in point of view  
to which the metaphor  
will not be excited.  
An odor has expanded in the magnolium,  
a mixture of massacre and body, a relinquishing  
eddy that brings agony.  
Has the archipeligos been pulsed with secrets?  
The noble book gave it honor.  
  
In the middle of the shady foam, many violenet howls.  
Everything shaken with lyrical voices, the salt of the maternity  
and piles of boundless bread outside midnight.  
Fragrance of strawberry of a deluded distorted nature.  
Only hated and to a  
son they take on time, too many to count years  
an airplane is not enough to filter me and keep me  
from the modern office of your slender phenomena.  
For a day, maybe thousand,  
I rested under a uncomfortable turbulence  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the man to be next to.  
Outside the boulevard like salt.
