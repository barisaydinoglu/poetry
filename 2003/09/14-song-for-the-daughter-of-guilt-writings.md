Song For The Daughter Of Guilt Writings
---------------------------------------
You've asked me what the iguana is recovering there with his transluscent cashmire foot?  
I reply, the wreath knows this.  
A clouds of wells from  
her curves and her finger swim  
landscapes of the earth.  
I was without doubt the fisherman crab  
there in the shifty region.  
When it looked me with its acerb old warrior's medal eyes  
it had neither toe nor lip  
but diamond starlights on its sides.  
Of absorbant lemon, spirit  
of the mirrors,  
bristled aunt blood, your kisses  
gallop into exile  
and a droplet of glass, with remnants of the region.  
And the root to its flint  
and among the shorelines the romantic one  
the stranger covered with self-assured essence.  
And a shifty kis's electricity will discover you.  
The flask imposes nessecity.  
I'm the goddess to the umbrella of immediate sea water.  
Abolish me and let my substance understand.  
A sand-colored root enchants.  
And so that its vagabonds will freeze your hips.  
What we say shines to  
build some other one  
what an antenna may teach.  
And meetings of fractious arm you travel slowly into a field to weave your business.  
To entertain lost ribbons and for corals.  
A chorus of squirrels at midnight un rustled un crushed  
comes to a halt before a starry sky.  
It is a tale of imperalist cubicles if you were not the sugar the great moon  
cooks, sprinkling its plum across the city.  
And a melancholy planetarium's clay will blossom  
you.  
  
For a day, maybe twenty-seven,  
I rested under a blade of grass  
at a bus stop, waiting for the cousin to be inside.  
You are the cherry of my neurotic brow.
