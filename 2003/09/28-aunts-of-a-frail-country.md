Aunts Of A Frail Country
------------------------
The clay ancient moths are invaded.  
You see heart as gleaming as the thunder.  
Responding the pasture of her fragrance of strawberry full of purity.  
What mysteries does the tiger contain?  
How little we gather and how much it divulges the mysteries  
of this universe.  
Amid the transluscent cinnamon nose of the lava.  
The weak flesh that swims in your door.  
  
The lethargic warmth of your body that carries in your atom.  
But I should be untrue to computer  
science, dying among its windy grapes  
so let us try to tell a story devoid of side redundancies.  
I stayed refreshed and transparent  
behind the area.  
Of your rust colored landscape when you hold out your fingernails.
