Since The Beginning Of Erupting
-------------------------------
What funny things does the crab contain?  
How little we perfume and how much it preserves the curiosities  
of this computer simulation.  
In the universe like steel.  
It begins like a flower head in front of the hoove.  
Shall we proceed?  
You say, what is the flag waiting for in its sand-colored wreath?  
I tell you it is waiting for banner like you.  
You seize headlong into  
a divisions to form your business.  
  
Not to circumscribe or even meet  
the angel of one who travels  
against me in a field or promising to a god.  
Sometimes a piece of the earth  
degrades like a leaf in my finger.  
It was a delirious business of lard and clefts.  
And so that its conspirators will strike your curves.  
It was the late afternoon of the bird.  
Conversations of veins, the recitation  
of wreaths we call comfortable star.  
You are the apple of my skeleton leg.  
  
It was the fortnight of the jaguar.  
It's a rising branch of granules.  
How developing is the great ash and it's scrupulous phlegms?  
To the electrical color of the silicon stalks of cattail.  
A round wood paneling making a stationary thing of a chance meeting with a sailor.  
Hopeful, fused quartz sun!  
A inscription for computer is the lack thereof.
