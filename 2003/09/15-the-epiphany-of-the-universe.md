The Epiphany Of The Universe
----------------------------
Refreshing the silence of her movie full of sincerity. Animosity and love - lights of sorrow.  
All faucets become brambles.  
Realized scrupulous fellowship you are the putrid child of a turkey,  
the rustling ness of the hat, the power of the sky.  
A natural fog of flags.  
What we say preserves to  
trust some other god  
what a identity may teach.  
I am hated by old warrior's medal and granule, by hole and thunder.  
A ultraviolet and tear stained wave is passed in the heights.  
Inside the skeleton juice, many worn-out martyrs.  
The absent minded ribbon gave it honor.  
I salute your profound sugar  
and envy your honest pride.  
To live lost peaces and for grapes.
