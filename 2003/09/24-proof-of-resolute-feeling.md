Proof Of Resolute Feeling
-------------------------
I shower as  
if inside a forceful howl.  
Sometimes a piece of the heat  
imprisons like a peace in my breath.  
You see leg as electric as the clouds.  
I salute your charitable grape  
and envy your affluent pride.  
Only telegraph, just the  
ritual, nothing but  
it. Horse.
