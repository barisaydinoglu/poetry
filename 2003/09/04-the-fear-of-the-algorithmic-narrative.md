The Fear Of The Algorithmic Narrative
-------------------------------------
What we say dedicates to  
pacify some other gentleman  
what a machine may teach.  
Worn-out rotten stumps and rusted clocks.  
There are no graves but mechanical cycles of breakfast and green  
sun rises of smooth silent steel. Halfway.  
Only maternity, just the  
bird feather, nothing but  
it. Key.  
I wish to make a loop  
in front of, and every abstraction, many  
times hidden in a wine bottle.  
Transform on the eternities that wait for you  
rejecting the oily chairs, lunging the doors.  
To the cosmic color of the wooden aspen.  
Towards those pullulations of yours that wait for me.  
Of a opaque ultraviolet gentleman that circumscribes ribbons.
