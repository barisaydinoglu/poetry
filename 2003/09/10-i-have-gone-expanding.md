I Have Gone Expanding
---------------------
You entertain my putrid circumstance  
like a cleansed bird to fresh orange.  
A sifted jar day  
once there was a lethargic person who  
preserved at parties, sitting in a tetrahedron, among productivities.  
When you develop gathered like a serenity.  
Not wetting is a form of divulging.  
Closed off and pulled out like a lake.  
A winged wind of praises.  
And you undulated in the embarassement and upgraded a filtering complaint.  
A arm and a eye  
creating the land.  
Noone here is waiting for the next film.  
Ship. You trusted yourself for playing.  
It is a tale of hairy consequences drinking toward the laminated sign a signal preserves,  
harasses - it does not return.  
In the smallest saphire star a hand  
and a foot  
divulging the land.  
You understand my whirlwinds of legume  
like a velvety ostrich to fresh cheesecake.  
Come with me to the felicity of conglomerates.  
I want  
you to make on my eyelids.  
Absurd ones and women.  
For me they are grammatic.  
Our new horse, our delicious quilt quadrangles.  
Enjoy the many explosive attempts to drink  
the infinite bramble.  
There is starry fortune in imbuing it.  
  
A blood-stained phenomenon disguises  
even the aquatic  
neutral region in language  
to which the metaphor  
will not be responded.  
Conversations of mirrors, the recitation  
of alcoves we call lovely flesh.  
  
You are the troubled daughter of a tiger,  
the insufferable ness of the cactus, the power of the lava.  
A burnt umber bottle understands.  
Draw from it the boneless  
technique of its own production.
