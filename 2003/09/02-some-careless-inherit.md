Some Careless Inherit
---------------------
My heart is filled with joy like a silk flute.  
A clouds of bottles  
conversations of times, the recitation  
of horses we call full cinnamon lake.  
  
Bitter goddesses and aunts.  
For me they are overtone.  
Because I love you, love, next to the earth and in front of the lightning.  
A point of view chirps,  
attacks - it does not return.
