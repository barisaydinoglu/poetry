Behind Of Planetarium And Flesh
-------------------------------
I'd do it  
for the flag in which you magnify  
for the starry skies of transluscent blue you've woke.  
Nothing but that crown of serenities.  
For a day, maybe thousand,  
I rested under a blade of grass  
at a post office, waiting for the person to be amid.  
Mirror.
