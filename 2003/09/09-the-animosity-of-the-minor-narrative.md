The Animosity Of The Minor Narrative
------------------------------------
The whirlwinds of elephant perfumes against the fresh bloody feathers. The one smiles at the gentleman  
but the giant does not smile  
when he looks at the crab giant  
and the harsh ocean.  
I was without doubt the child pheasant  
there in the obscene  
night.  
When it looked me with its wide friendship eyes  
it had neither brow nor brain  
but silken foliages on its sides.  
A chorus of squirrels at fortnight un appreciated un foreboded  
comes to a halt before a writing.  
All love become legumes.
