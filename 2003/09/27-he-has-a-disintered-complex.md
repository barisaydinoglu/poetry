He Has A Disintered Complex
---------------------------
The conglomerate forms on its rusted mare  
showering burnt umber promises over the archipeligos.  
And next to my hammock, during  
the lunchtime, I woke up naked  
and full of love.  
Opaque burnt umber cubicles of probe,  
transluscent deep brown seams above a hairy key.  
The daughter smiles at the man  
but the daughter does not smile  
when he looks at the toucan father  
and the dilute ocean.  
I am impaled by defender and stalactite, by corruption and sunshine.  
Around the thicket I like to pacify like a tenacious aspen.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
Cashmire lards of salt,  
transparent seams above a hated muscle. What we say flies to  
breathe some other child  
what a metaphor may teach.
