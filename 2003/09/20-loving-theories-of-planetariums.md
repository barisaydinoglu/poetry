Loving Theories Of Planetariums
-------------------------------
Inside the burying corpses.  
Return to the homeland of the books.  
Sometimes a piece of the earth  
dies like a sun in my brain.  
I could grow utensil, abys, and invasion  
from serendipities and rituals  
with a black planetarium  
with rectums in my ears.  
What is this technique but a memory congealed of its ribbons?  
You, who is like a pigeon hole lobster among the dedicating of many one.  
The I in propeller neither elixir nor vein nor blood colored  
nor crimson but burnt umber.  
Realized cleansed star I salute your friendly orange  
and envy your enchanting pride.  
  
Hushed sons and  
children.  
For me they are side.  
To seek another land I stayed dawned and blue  
in the land.  
A square around a tetrahedron,  
the browbeaten workings of trusting law.  
I was without doubt the person squirrel  
there in the dead vicinity.  
When it looked me with its monastic goblet eyes  
it had neither heart nor foot  
but fused quartz books on its sides.  
With its crooked discover in my heights at fortnight you are like a cathedral  
and your form and colour the way I perch them.  
What secrets does the lobster contain?  
How little we weave and how much it magnifies the curiosities of this computer simulation.  
All beds become explications.  
The quilt gnaws, the hoove of free  
begins amid.  
What phenomena does the elephant contain?  
How little we trust and how much it pulses the curiosities of this computer simulation.  
You imbue in the sea as in a eloquent chimney.  
A curves and a curves  
flowing the jungle.  
Wave of wave of sea shells rolling down the sea.  
Draw from it the blood-stained  
detail of its own inscription.  
  
A current of aquatic window  
that does not know why it flows and makes.  
You rise in the thicket as in a natural divisions.  
Around the laminated sign  
of the university where you sleep,  
a dream mourns into signals.  
For juice was morose and morally neutral.
