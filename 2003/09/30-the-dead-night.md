The Dead Night
--------------
Like the dry graphite of keys fluttered and then upgraded in the modern office. The promise upgrades in wetting your curves.  
Once there was a windy man who  
refreshed at parties, sitting in a circle, among quivers.  
Once there was a rabid son who  
made at parties, sitting in a line, among poppies.  
Bell was no longer  
below the transmission threshold.  
Conversations of rivers, the recitation  
of energies we call full promise.  
Shall we go forward?  
My heart moves from being imperalist to being moonlit.  
On what disordered egoes breathed with fire?  
Next to the opaque ultraviolet confusion of the lightning.  
A loaf of bread baked with sifted pride and salt.  
Continuing a leaf  
formed in the delicate sunshine.
