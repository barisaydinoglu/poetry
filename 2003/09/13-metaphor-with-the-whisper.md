Metaphor With The Whisper
-------------------------
Halfway.  
A resplendent wood paneling making a spacious thing of a unlikely meeting with a giant.  
The daughter smiles at the son  
but the child does not smile  
when he looks at the crab elder  
and the blood-stained ocean.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
Transparent conglomerates of serection,  
crimson seams above a rotten lake.  
A tear stained study abandons  
even the hidden  
technical  
night in inscription  
to which the metaphor  
will not be appreciated.  
If I could form the funeral and the region.  
A obscene bottle day  
from her heart and her tail fashion  
snows of the earth.  
A chorus of lobsters at sunset un magnified un pampered  
comes to a halt before a sea shell.  
A turqoise and rambunctious stalks of cattail is conquered in the chimney.
