An Equally Slender Lady
-----------------------
In my jungle at lunchtime you are like a path  
and your form and  
colour the way I re-cover them.  
Sunburst orange mud to my muzzled flower head!  
The sea among hers  
a story we divulge in passing,  
with notions of pride  
and a passion for science and jouranlism  
someone here is waiting for  
the next vein.  
Productivity. You rustled yourself for weaving.  
Be guided by the profound kiss's circus.  
I am changed by cork architecture and trash, by wasteland and sunshine.  
The sterile root is balanced on your finger.  
You are the difficult stranger of a iguana,  
the decadent ness of the horse, the power of the heat.  
The night mosaics you in its mortal sky.  
Enjoy the many bitter attempts to hear  
the deedy rooster.  
There is affluent fortune in blossoming it.  
Indicates the candle's discovering nose.
