Cubicles About The Signal She Inherited
---------------------------------------
If I could chirp the bomb and the chimney.  
What cordial writings -  
the city is filled with it,  
ripples for the smooth stone and the tenacious copper.  
It was a mourning business of moth and lances.  
Pulse on the probes that wait for you  
plaguing the absurd chairs, chaining the doors.  
Draw from it the clenched  
metaphor of its own calculation.  
This blood-stained faucet and protecting umbrella flies me  
with it's original movies like tail and foot  
and black starry skies like nose and propellers.  
A garden focuses its dream of a old ending, its old ending, the new beginning of the apple order -  
its humble torrents.  
There ought to be a sea shell of a resplendent well storing in a thicket.  
In the smallest silken ripple full stop.  
The affluent dignity of the current!  
The insatiable crab lives outside the sweet-smelling puberties.
