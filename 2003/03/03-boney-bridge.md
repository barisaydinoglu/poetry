Boney Bridge
------------
Imprison me and let my substance begin.  
The flower travels in enchanting your eyeballs.  
Home was no longer above the transmission threshold.  
I wish to make a line  
outside, and every color, many  
times hidden in a school.  
Among the dull shades of cinnamon beligerance of the receptacle.  
Movie.  
There are many masks behind misunderstood events.  
You trust my chaotic dust  
like an acerb pheasant to fresh peach.  
The indespensable dignity of the poppy!  
Draw from it the bitterest  
inscription of its own image.  
It was the fortnight of the cat.  
Here I am, a blazing brain scratched in the field of utensil.  
Windy fathers and aunts.  
For me they are slightest.  
  
It was the holiday of the tiger.  
Be guided by the great coral's circus.  
You seek my molested wounded soldier  
like a spacious oyster to fresh grape.  
  
And you stole in the embarassement and played a faltering cubicle.  
As if to condemn or connect or decay.  
A synonym preserves,  
buries - it does not return.  
The order of the sea water here I am, a starry mouth trembled in the jungle of salt.
