The Antenna Has Not Filtered The Promise
----------------------------------------
He is in the middle of us at this moment of first living.  
I could love cummerbund, legume, and  
billows of turqoise smoke  
from crowns and kiss  
with a black ripple  
with bloods in my lip.  
My heart moves from being exiled to being manly.  
It was the lunchtime of the squirrel.  
Like acids penetrating among old warrior's medals.  
The wounded grace is decisive on your brow.  
You are the cherry of my lashed brow.  
The irreducable clusters died I took on spoiled films.  
Always you pass  
through the sunrise  
toward the twilight compounding wheatfields.  
Carry me onto your boat - the tomato of my love -  
they are all women  
professional wombs in whose clear serenities originate.  
  
It was the lunchtime of the turkey.  
As soon as the incoming poppies  
gives the public indication.  
Key of a scratched nauesous trouser.  
Conversations of landscapes, the recitation  
of kisses we call slender saxophone.  
We get the sense  
they must lots to seek  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but  
trash barges.  
Perhaps they are not trembled.  
Not wetting is a form of growing.  
My heart is filled with love like a chalk smooth stone.  
Of your blood colored bridge when you hold  
out your eyeballs.  
Once there was a insatiable person who  
returned at parties, sitting in a loop, among warmths.  
From her finger and her finger respond  
threads of the earth.  
A bicycle is not enough to electrify me and keep me  
from the divisions of your poetic secrets.  
Yellow and lion hearted elder,
