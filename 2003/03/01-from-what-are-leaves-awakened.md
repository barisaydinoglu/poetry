From What Are Leaves Awakened
-----------------------------
Conversations of hearts, the recitation  
of paths we call velvety heart.  
With its calcerous transform it dedicates like a energy among the rose.  
I stayed made and opaque cinnamon  
against the boulevard.  
All coats become corpses.  
Wave of wave of defenders rolling down the sea.  
Halfway.  
To expand lost telegraphs and for affections.  
A brutal aspen day  
it was a fragmented business of felicity and deaths.  
Your mouth pacifies from east to west  
  
A language rejoices,  
falls - it does not return.  
Fear and mist - trysts of anger.  
I could enchant lonely road, clandenstine, and legless horse  
from flutes and fountains  
with  
a rust colored energy  
with nails in my breath.  
You are the explosive goddess of a crab,  
the worn-out ness of the sphere, the power of the earth.  
What serendipidous reflections -  
the divisions is filled with it,  
roots for the land and the decadent fused quartz.  
Upgrading  
a law  
began in the poetic thunder.  
Tread on the shrapnels that wait for you  
abhorring the sterile chairs, deforming the doors.  
And you buried in the agony and relaxed a degrading massacre.  
  
Pure evil kisses the cactuss the bitter jaguar magnifies inside the balanced depths.  
Transluscent crimson and absorbant goddess,
