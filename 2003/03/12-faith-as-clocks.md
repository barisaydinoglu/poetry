Faith As Clocks
---------------
Of a gray fisherman that reconciles alcoves. Like silent key, evening stars  
I could swim stick, stalactite, and legless horse  
from maps and silences  
with a black flag  
with enemies in my eyeballs.  
All ships become dominions.  
To seek another land the frail heart is loving on your finger.  
What funny things does the pheasant contain?  
How little we protect and how much it sets the secrets of this computer simulation.  
I was without doubt the sailor bird  
there in the shady region.  
When it looked me with its warm root eyes  
it had neither ears nor fingernails  
but marble doves on its sides.  
It was a rusted business of eternity and conspirators.  
  
In your ears of sorrow the field of lands gather.  
You see tail as loving as the sunshine.  
  
And a forceful echo's electricity will imbue you.  
Full stop.
