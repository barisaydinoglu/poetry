Here I Wet You

And a brutal form's electricity will relax you. And amid my hammock, during the day, I woke up naked  
and full of decency.

from sea shells and roots  
with a gray starry sky  
with conglomerates in my eyelids.  
One algorithmic option and the miracle begins in promising your hips.
