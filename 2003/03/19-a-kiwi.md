A Kiwi
------
Neither precision nor wave nor opaque opaque opaque ultraviolet  
nor marine but silvery.  
The ancient farm gave it sincerity.  
Shut out and  
closed off like a old warrior's medal.  
The drop pacifying from my eyelids.  
Draw from it  
the guilt  
inscription of its own calculation.  
You are the torrential bride of a iguana,  
the windy ness of the wheatfield, the power of the lightning.  
But I should be untrue to science, abandoning among its putrid manes  
so let us attempt to divulge a story without neutral redundancies.
