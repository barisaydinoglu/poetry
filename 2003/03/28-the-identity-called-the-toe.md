The Identity Called The Toe
---------------------------
You are the wayside cousin of a pheasant,  
the blood-stained ness of the thread, the power of the mud.  
Everything blood-stained with affluent voices, the salt of the awe  
and piles of domestic bread around fortnight.  
The snow mourns, the bird feather of serendipidous  
pulses in.  
A synonym for machine is the lack thereof.  
  
A eloquent rain of elixirs.  
Brings all the faints souls.
