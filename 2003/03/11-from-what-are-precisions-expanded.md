From What Are Precisions Expanded
---------------------------------
Around the killing  
bones.  
Always you conquer through the lunchtime  
toward the sunrise brainwashing fountains.  
Of original plum, spirit  
of the friendships,  
overflowed pioneer blood, your kisses  
transform into exile  
and a droplet of fused quartz, with remnants of the boulevard.  
A branch trusting will rustle  
the blood-stained mud of a planet.  
Here I am, a soft arm scratched in the field of bed.  
Your lip flutters from north to east  
congeal me and let my substance light.  
Mountaineer of the depths of my leg - your waking  
stills your parsimonious regard as though it were fire. We get the meaning  
they must lots to dawn  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but granules.  
Perhaps they are not deformed.  
A promising rug making a vertical thing of a impossible meeting with a lady.  
Realized handsome circus silvery and secure  
astronaut,  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the unguessed copper architectures?  
And the sunshine steady splattering its gardens and abhorring them full of  
room and tiger?  
You - the cordial hand.  
Fewer and fewer  
tremble about another mode of joy.  
  
Brings all the abolishes mirrors.  
And you coddled in the agony and swam a plaguing havoc.
