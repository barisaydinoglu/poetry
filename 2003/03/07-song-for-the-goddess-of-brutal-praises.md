Song For The Goddess Of Brutal Praises
--------------------------------------
The cleft imposes nessecity. In the face of so many hounds to functionality.  
A ghostly green lake day  
I'd do it for the umbrella in which you rejoice  
for the springtimes of green you've lived.  
Only guitar, just the  
wheatfield, nothing but  
it. Old warrior's medal.  
The sky blazing cummerbunds are cracked.
