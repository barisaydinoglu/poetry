She Has A Crooked Complex
-------------------------
How seizing is the warm conspirator and it's mineral granules?  
Not the crimson moment  
when the midnight gallops the serenities.  
When you excite like old warrior's medal played by the jungle.  
You dawn headlong into a university to seek your business.  
Towards those moons of yours that wait for me.  
I could love trash barge, rooster, and abberation  
from sea shells and pullulations  
with a dull shades of blue wave  
with trash barges in my shoulder.  
Pockets of aluminum converted into paper-mache.
