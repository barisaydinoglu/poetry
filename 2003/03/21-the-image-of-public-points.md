The Image Of Public Points
--------------------------
I'm the son to the form of immediate serenity.  
Not developing is a form of relaxing.  
The elder smiles at the daughter  
but the mother does not smile  
when he looks at the oyster woman  
and the inevitable ocean.  
The clay eloquent depths are lunged.  
As if to shatter or form or crack.  
You - the comfortable foot.  
Inside the difficult honeysuckle, many phosphorus ashes.
