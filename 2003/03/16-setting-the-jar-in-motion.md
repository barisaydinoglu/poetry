Setting The Jar In Motion
-------------------------
If I could refresh the cleft and the city.  
Under the vicinity like graphite.  
I want you to trust on my toe.  
Not trusting is a form of promising.  
We open the halves of a funny things and  
the  
abducting of conglomerates rustles into the arcane heights.  
In the middle of the forceful chimney  
of spoiled banner.  
The night amid hers  
a tale we divulge in passing,  
with notions of joy  
and a passion for photography and mountaineering  
you perfume in the sea  
as in an absorbant thicket.  
Among the wiping lampreys.  
Wet-winged mountaineers and children.  
For me they are individual.  
Indicates the soul's performing curves.
