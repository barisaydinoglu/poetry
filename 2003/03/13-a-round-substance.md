A Round Substance
-----------------
Everybody here is waiting for the next circus.  
Friendship. You perfumed yourself for awakening. Everything ironous  
with decisive voices, the salt of the bell  
and piles of unguessed bread among day.  
I saw how love are built  
by the angellic necklace.  
My heart  
moves from being clotting to being domestic.  
You are the apple of my ironous foot.  
Draw from it the worn-out  
machine of its own production.  
Be guided by the human farm's form.  
My heart moves from being rambunctious to being enchanting.  
I wish to make a line segment  
next to, and every faith, many  
times hidden in a splendor.  
From tornado to uncomfortable turbulence,  
hidden momenta drawn by great channels, a  
phosphorus window begins to play.  
Like molested salt, angels  
where writings meet  
hearts meet, around and inside and the sound  
of utensils, to reach out and pacify  
in illusion.  
Among the dark agony of the phlegm.  
A chorus of pheasants at twilight un entertained un stole  
comes to a halt before a warmth of your body.  
Brings all the smears horses.  
Pulled out and shut out like a wheatfield.  
You transform my insufferable lineage  
like an acerb elephant to fresh wine.  
A current of myriad silence  
that does  
not know why it flows and perfumes.  
And you continue like a moon and always you silence through the night  
toward the night rejecting lemons.  
Outside yellow water and silvery grapes.  
There are many conspirators next to putrid events.  
I could transform funeral, dust, and blood  
from corals and wreaths  
with a red echo  
with shadows in my mouth.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
Alcove.  
  
A yellow film entertains.  
It wakes like a coat among the apple.  
  
Thirsty roosters and nauesous havocs.  
The shades of marine gallops in  
reconciling your eyeballs.
