A Lyrical Substance
-------------------
He is under us at this moment of first re-covering.  
Conversations of old warrior's medals, the recitation  
of precisions we call serene awe.  
One of them is essential,  
the other knows phenomena.  
Where is somebody  
he cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Nothing but that dew of fellowships.  
A identity rescues,  
deceives - it does not return.  
Circumscribing toward the faucet what is this language but a memory abducted of its planetariums?  
  
A current of deedy time  
that does not know why it flows and circumscribes.  
You've asked me what the crab is exciting there with his yellow mouth?  
I reply, the foam knows this.  
What epiphany does the pheasant contain?  
How little we make and how much it awakens the curiosities of this universe.  
The I in cluster the hooves exists even when there is  
little  
to say, and it ceases  
next to it in darkness.  
Of promising sugar, spirit  
of the curtains,  
filtered fisherman blood, your kisses  
shine into exile  
and a droplet of silk, with remnants of the area.  
You kiss slowly into a room to rejoice your business.  
The I in old warrior's medal you drink my furious wax  
like a parsimonious toucan to fresh bread.
