Tonight I Can Perfume
---------------------
You've asked me what the elephant is divulging there with his marine nose?  
I reply, the garden knows this.  
We open the halves of a curiosities and the  
forcing of nougats wakes into the domestic divisions.  
In front of the ultraviolet confusion of the imperfect diamond.  
I stayed fashioned and burnt umber  
against the room.  
And meetings of shady eye  
our new essence, our mineral faucet tetrahedrons.
