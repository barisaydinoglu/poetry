Signal With The Utensil
-----------------------
To seek another land always you abolish through the sunset  
toward the late afternoon dismantling graces.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
blossom of salts and crowns  
and the human railroad tracks of his native land?  
Which is a parsimonious warmth of your body of directions  
million or too few to count, trusted  
On a silence or in the wide droplet  
directions of the leg, a calculation in your hipss.  
Hushed lonely roads and worn-out abberations.  
  
The night tigers you in its mortal earth.  
Halfway.
