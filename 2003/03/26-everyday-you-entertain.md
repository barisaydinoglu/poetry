Everyday You Entertain
----------------------
A sea shell -like ghost  
And autumns and beds.  
The order of the pastures and so that its juices will petrify your lip.  
And the lighthouse to its serenity  
and among the trousers the aromatic one  
the goddess covered with original candle.  
Elixir of a fainted dilute ribbon.  
You've asked me what the lobster is standing there with his crimson shoulder?  
I reply, the flag knows this.  
On what atrocious ghosts created with lava?  
A banner focuses its dream of a ending, its ending, the beginning of the defender order -  
its steady wombs.  
Equinoctial empire. The square functions to rustle an architecture  
to its system.  
  
The reasons for my respect  
are entertained in my curves of ivory.  
In the smallest gem window I am dismantled by lemon and granule, by convict and fog.  
  
Of your turqoise candle when you hold out your hand.  
A chorus of lobsters at night un promised un wiped  
comes to a halt before a starry sky.
