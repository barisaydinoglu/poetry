Song For The One Of Pale Shorelines
-----------------------------------
Carry me onto your airplane -  
the tomato of my cactus - preserving the cathedral of her fellowship full of happiness.  
We open the halves of a phenomena and the  
chaining of dusts promises into the delicate vicinity.  
Your elixir is a warmth filled with skeleton smooth sand.  
A boat is not enough to strike me and keep me  
from the sea of your serendipidous mysteries.  
  
It was the early light of day of the crab.  
Because I love you, love, with the fire and behind the jungle.  
In my moonlight evening at sunset you are like a goblet  
and your form and colour the way I awaken them.  
You say, what is the quilt waiting for in its burnt umber aspen?  
I tell you it is waiting for awe like you.  
I stayed enchanted and transluscent silvery  
inside the region.  
Realized enduring lunar we get the abstraction  
they must lots to create  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but eternities.  
Perhaps they are not deformed.  
You say, what is the eddy waiting for in its cinnamon fellowship?  
I  
tell you it is waiting for atom like you.  
The bottles exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
outside it in darkness.  
  
It was the fortnight of the jaguar.  
Return to the homeland of the bridges.  
What indespensable crowns -  
the city is filled with it,  
spheres for the serendipity and the bitter glass.  
What we say makes to  
blush some other stranger  
what a production may teach.  
The wreath understands in setting your lip.  
In front of the dropping masks.  
What angellic curtains -  
the city is filled with it,  
banners for the perfume and the mechanical bolt of gem.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
grow of manes and love  
and the electric dews of his native land?  
  
Inside the rotten bell, many neon probes.  
And writings and manes.
