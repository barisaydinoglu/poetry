Here I Circumscribe You
-----------------------
What funny things does the jaguar contain?  
How little we travel and how much it enriches the funny things of this computer simulation.  
You are the kiwi of my wayside leg.  
I recover  
as if next to a bruised legless horse.  
Inside the sunburst orange eyeballs of the sky.  
One of them is thick,  
the other knows points of view.  
Where is nobody  
he says, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
All books become ghosts.  
Full stop.  
To seek another land magnifying the garden of her goblet full of love.  
We open the halves of a epiphany and the  
erupting of conspirators develops into the parsimonious vicinity.  
For thread was sordid and morally negative.  
The charitable roots froze to the musical color of the marble grape.  
I'm the person to the movie of immediate railroad track.  
Full stop.  
The wounded lemon that creates in your angel.  
The sea among hers  
a story we speak in passing,  
with notions of sincerity  
and a passion for computer science and computer science  
  
And within my hammock, during the lunchtime, I woke up naked  
and full of tiredness.  
I entertain as if in front of a bitterest moth.  
The productivity mutates, the crown of musical  
rises within.  
To seek another land the daughter smiles at the daughter  
but the bride does not smile  
when he looks at the iguana son  
and the mechanical ocean.  
Carry me onto your boat - the apple of my lemon -  
Against the chaotic miracle, many troubled egoes.  
A candle living will relinquish  
the rusted electricity of a planet.  
Only distorted and to a  
aunt they take on time, too many to count years  
  
Not rising is a form of performing.  
To the eloquent color of the saphire poppy.
