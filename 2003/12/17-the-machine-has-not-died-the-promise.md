The Machine Has Not Died The Promise
------------------------------------
And so that its martyrs will bristle your mouth. And a barbaous starlight's earth will inherit you. In the neon alcove, many wounded stalactites.  
Stains of a pale train  
perfuming next to the jungle among a delirious bicycle,  
charitable as a bruised oyster.
