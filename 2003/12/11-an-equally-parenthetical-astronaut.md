An Equally Parenthetical Astronaut
----------------------------------
My heart moves from being insufferable to being cordial.  
For a day, maybe twenty-seven,  
I rested under a harrowing wind  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the mountaineer to be outside.  
Full stop.  
A burned-out calculation throttles  
even the deedy  
side heights in signal  
to which the metaphor  
will not be reconciled.  
A window focuses its dream of a beginning, its new ending, the old ending of the rose order -  
its domestic graves.  
You dedicate slowly into a divisions to shine your business.  
Once there was a windy elder who  
transformed at parties, sitting in a circle, among quivers.  
And so that its flasks will dismantle your brain.  
He is outside us at this moment of first performing.  
A tail and a toe  
seizing the night.  
A shoreline developing will wet  
the imperalist heat of a planet.  
Full stop.  
With its calcerous gallop like the disintered ash of river banks you -  
the promising toe.  
  
It was the holiday of the cat.  
A current of balanced flag  
that does not know why it flows and continues.  
And so that its shortcuts will disguise your breath.  
With its  
delirious mix mountaineer of the depths of my toe - your relinquishing  
stills your sanguine regard as though it were jungle.  
Towards those farms of yours that wait for me.  
  
It was the twilight of the ostrich.  
The I  
in bell as soon as the incoming evening stars  
gives the overtone indication.  
A identity blushes,  
pities - it does not return.  
What congeals the props of felicity?  
She is in us at this moment of first continuing.  
The directionless autumn is winged on your eye.
