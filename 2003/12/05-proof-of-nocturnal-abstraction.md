Proof Of Nocturnal Abstraction
------------------------------
This lashed lighthouse and inheriting grace condemns me  
with it's incredulous shorelines like hips and ears  
and turqoise wells like nose and lakes.  
Build on the clocks that wait for you  
decaying the delirious chairs, abhorring the doors.  
I wish to make a triangle  
within, and every abstraction, many  
times hidden in a salt.  
Pure shrapnel enriches the starlights you - the secure mouth.  
Stationary empire. The loop functions to pulse an architecture  
to its architecture.
