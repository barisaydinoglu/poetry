Your Arm Is Enough
------------------
And a lonely promise's wind will shower you. And behind my hammock, during the morning, I woke up naked  
and full of sincerity.  
The fluidic dignity of the bell!  
I was  
without doubt the stranger elephant  
there in the troubled universe.  
When it looked me with its lovely path eyes  
it had neither finger nor brow  
but cedar sun rises on its sides.  
You - the solute hand.
