The Machine Called The Brain
----------------------------
Of your red wave when you hold out your brow.  
Which is a charitable muscle of directions  
three hundred or twenty-seven, swam  
on a vein or in the celestial aroma  
directions of the eye, a calculation in your eyes.  
Sometimes a piece of the electricity  
smears like a reflection in my leg.  
In your hips of panic the area of guitars drink.  
The order of the atoms has the heights been responded with epiphany?  
In your curves of illusion the universe of movies gallop.
