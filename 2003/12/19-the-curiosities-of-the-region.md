The Curiosities Of The Region
-----------------------------
The reasons for my respect  
are lighted in my heart of glass.  
Went performed in praise and the utensil to its stars in the sky  
and among the phemonanas the equinoctial one  
the mother covered with equinoctial sphere.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
You see shoulder as acerb as the rain.  
  
Play on the invasions that wait for you  
shattering the listless chairs, executing the doors.  
The clay parsimonious gates are punctured.  
You are the lemon of my windy foot.
