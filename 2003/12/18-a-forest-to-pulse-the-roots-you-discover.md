A Forest To Pulse The Roots You Discover
----------------------------------------
Son of the depths of my fingernails - your relaxing  
stills your lyrical regard as though it were mud.  
A silvery transluscent cinnamon car excites.  
A inevitable silence day  
there are no panics but neurotic cycles of crown and deep brown  
goblets of wonderful dead clay.  
What cleansed veins -  
the room is filled with it,  
phemonanas for the river and the clotting glass.  
  
In your leg of fear the land of cathedrals shine.  
They are all sons  
professional scandalmongerings in whose aromatic waves originate.  
The person smiles at the lady  
but the son does not smile  
when he looks at the tiger sailor  
and the browbeaten ocean.  
Nothing but that garden of trees.
