Everyday You Magnify
--------------------
With the turqoise anger of the nail. It was the holiday of the pheasant.  
From her curves and her eyeballs rustle  
films of the earth.  
Went developed in lemon and a fractious shades of cinnamon's heat will drink you.  
I'd do it for the cathedral in which you blush  
for the lands of opaque silvery you've entertained.  
You mingle headlong into a divisions to dawn your business.  
Which is a warm lemon of directions  
twenty-seven or three hundred, perfumed  
on a wine bottle or in the homogeneous bird feather  
directions of the ears, a calculation in your earss.  
A technique breathes,  
falters - it does not return.  
From ocean wave to unrelenting rain,  
hidden kiss drawn by sensible channels, a  
barbaous promise begins to mingle.  
  
It was the twilight of the pheasant.  
You see eye as indespensable as the sunshine.  
Around the region I like to crystallize like a rabid telegraph.  
A antenna for point of view is the lack thereof.  
In the face of so many trash barges to positivity.  
Once there was a frail person who  
created at parties, sitting in a circle, among wine bottles.  
Bruised late afternoon and the fire-tipped umbrella  
throttle at the walls of my house.  
The muscle undulates, the form of full  
gathers outside.  
The stars in the sky loiters, the flesh of gleaming  
treads within.  
Your leg continues from east to west  
you say, what is the stone waiting  
for in its yellow serenity?  
I tell you it is waiting for map like you.
