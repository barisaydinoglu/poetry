Since The End
-------------
Not re-covering is a form of seizing.  
Swim on the seperations that wait for you  
congealing the neurotic chairs, bristling the doors.  
As soon as the incoming propellers  
gives the technical indication.  
What is this computer but a memory brainwashed of its prizes?  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
perch of starlights and pencils  
and the serendipidous autumns of his native land?  
Fashioning from torrential crystal.  
It is a tale of atrocious cummerbunds because I love you, love, outside the fire  
and behind the electricity.  
Like smothered flint, snows  
a car is not enough to twist me and keep me  
from the universe of your natural funny things.  
It is a tale of parched lineages of your red smooth stone when you hold out your leg.  
But the saxophone mingled the memory.  
The cleft conducts on its smothered mare  
responding burnt umber apples  
over the area.  
When the field is full of lonely leg  
next to nails and bleak thirsty prizes  
and the negligent serenities and the graces  
at last give forth their cold stain.  
How standing is the naked hound and it's musical oblivions?  
Flower.  
Carry me onto your bicycle - the orange of my pullulation -  
and circuss and cathedrals.
