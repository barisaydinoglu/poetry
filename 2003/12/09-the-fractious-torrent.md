The Fractious Torrent
---------------------
Wave of wave of sweetness rolling down the sea.  
Nobody here is waiting for the next land.  
Forest. You performed yourself for drinking.  
Fewer and fewer  
deform about another mode of honor.  
My heart moves from being raucous to being absent minded.  
It was a weak business of seperation and coffins.  
We open the halves of a secrets and the  
puncturing of depths seeks into the stationary night.  
Halfway.  
There ought to be a flag of a sensible utensil lighting in a city.  
The careless turkey lights outside the romantic havocs.  
A changeless carpet making a fluidic thing of a chance meeting with a cousin.  
Deedy empire. The tetrahedron functions to trust an architecture  
to its system.  
Brings all the conquers homes.  
Blue walls of bloodied metal,  
green seams above a molested aspen.
