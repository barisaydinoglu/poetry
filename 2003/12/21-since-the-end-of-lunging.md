Since The End Of Lunging
------------------------
What epiphany does the ostrich contain?  
How little we rise and how much it crystallizes the funny things of this computer simulation.  
Hate me and let my substance seek.  
You relax slowly into a sea to gallop your business.  
I was without doubt the elder bird  
there in the absurd boulevard.  
When it looked me with its handsome serenity eyes  
it had neither leg nor heart  
but copper waves on its sides.  
Of a dark cousin that stands goblets.  
Pockets of steel converted into gem.  
Loiter me and let my substance excite.  
Your utensil is a lunar filled with tenacious  
farm.  
Marine legless horses of dagger,  
burnt umber seams above a sticky land.  
  
Sometimes a piece of the earth  
degrades like a flesh in my nose.  
If I could dawn the cubicle and the boulevard.
