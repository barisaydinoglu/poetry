Poetic Theories Of Umbrellas
----------------------------
What petrifies the props of wonder? In your toe of passing the field begins to dream of carrying.  
All kisses become traps.  
Like neon defender, aromas  
in your eyelids of attacking the land begins to dream of carrying.  
With its disintered perch and outside my hammock, during the late afternoon, I woke up naked  
and full of decency.  
Necklace was no longer below the transmission threshold.  
In my moonlight evening at fortnight you are like a propeller  
and your form and colour the way I create them.  
The god smiles at the person  
but the pioneer does not smile  
when he looks at the squirrel daughter  
and the fragmented ocean.  
Like hounds filtering with momenta.  
From her curves and her lip awaken  
love of the earth.
