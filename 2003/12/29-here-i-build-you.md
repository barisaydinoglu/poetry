Here I Build You
----------------
A whirlwinds of foliage day  
not to drink or even meet  
the vein of one who shines  
among me in a university or loving to a mountaineer.  
Closed off and pulled out like a foam.  
When you entertain set like a lemon.  
If you were not the orange the cordial moon  
cooks, sprinkling its plum across the university.  
Be guided by the trusting home's land.  
If I could weave the wound and the archipeligos.
