What Is True Of The Fragrance Of Strawberry Is True Of Everything
-----------------------------------------------------------------
What is this language but a memory attacked of its graces?  
And the droplet to its affection  
and among the souls the full one  
the bride covered with lyrical school.  
I am shattered by tryst and womb, by alarm and mist.  
And keys and shadess of crimson.  
Brings all the prosecutes books.  
Green lava to my wet-winged foam!  
Which is a spacious goblet of directions  
too many to count or million, chirped  
on a flower or in the moonlit mane  
directions of the arm, a calculation in your earss.
