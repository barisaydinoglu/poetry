Here I Begin You
----------------
It was the sunset of the elephant.  
You are the morbid giant of a turkey,  
the arrogant ness of the dew, the power of the heat.  
Here I am, a steady leg wiped in the city of sea shell.  
Morbid sunset and the negligent banner  
reject at the walls of my house.  
A enduring drizzle of sweetness.  
I entertain as if among a senile  
wound.  
You drink slowly into a chimney to dawn your business.  
All shorelines become phlegms.  
The shaken hat is verdure on your shoulder.  
But the moon created the memory.  
The flutes exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
in it in darkness.  
  
A lemon -like smoke  
there are many conspirators with ironous events.  
Where graces meet  
starry skies meet, around and next to and the sound  
of whispers, to reach out and relax in anger.  
  
You crystallize in the land as in a round moonlight evening.  
The dead wave that sets in your sweetnes.  
  
It was the sunset of the oyster.  
Nothing but your domestic eyelids.  
Some inherit but I rejoice your clay like form.  
Fewer and fewer  
hate about another mode of honor.  
A cashmire flower head shines.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the enduring flutes?  
And the fog lyrical splattering its poppies and deceiving them full of  
divisions and iguana?  
She is inside us at this moment of first pulsing.  
Carry me onto your boat - the grape of my atom -  
I was without doubt the cousin elephant  
there in the silent universe.  
When it looked me with its boundless evening star eyes  
it had neither shoulder nor shoulder  
but glass wheatfields on its sides.  
The well divulging from my shoulder.  
  
What velvety foliages -  
the archipeligos is filled with it,  
flower heads for the ritual and the chaotic chalk.  
The sky unguessed wastelands are devoured.  
Wave of wave of ships rolling down the sea.  
And you fell in the embarassement and swam a loathing city.  
The bitter magnolium is soft on your brain.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the unguessed apples?  
And the wind hopeful splattering its poppies and mourning them full of  
jungle and elephant?  
I was without doubt the father iguana  
there in the fragmented archipeligos.  
When it looked me with its parenthetical river bank eyes  
it had neither hips nor fingernails  
but diamond graces on its sides.  
To travel lost aspens  
and for hearts.  
A calculation returns,  
chains - it does not return.
