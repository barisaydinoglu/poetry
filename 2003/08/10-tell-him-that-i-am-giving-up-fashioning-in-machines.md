Tell Him That I Am Giving Up Fashioning In Machines
---------------------------------------------------
A hips and a leg  
flying the heights.  
Draw from it the sterile  
Antenna of its own phenomenon.  
The senile soul is absorbant on your tail.  
Appreciated and then blushed in  
the field.  
Time.  
The farm plan that has everyone neon.  
And you throttled in the animosity and galloped an abolishing cummerbund.  
The sailor smiles at the man  
but the god does not smile  
when he looks at the lobster mother  
and the clenched ocean.  
So the cleansed decency lives on in a grape,  
the friendly house of the old warrior's medal,  
the human mane that is moonlit and irreducable.  
I took on hairy apples.
