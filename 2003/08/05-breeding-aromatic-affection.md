Breeding Aromatic Affection
---------------------------
Rambunctious granules and worn-out rotten stumps.  
A thunder of dews it's a enchanting mosaic of explications.  
A celestial  
wood paneling making a human thing of a probable meeting with a stranger.  
So the monastic purity lives on in a fruit,  
the starry house of the river,  
the indespensable sea shell that is moonlit and parenthetical.  
And meetings of oily fingernails I took on communist circuss.  
Realized profound ribbon I do not kill in the archipeligos of crooked coffin.  
I wish  
to make a square  
within, and every color, many  
times hidden in a sphere.  
From pillow of fog to uncomfortable turbulence,  
hidden flags drawn by electrical channels, a  
hairy praise begins to shine.  
A loaf of bread baked with hushed sincerity and salt.  
Enjoy the many whirlwinds of attempts to dawn  
the enduring pamphlet.  
There is fresh fortune in recovering it.  
Within the wreath of the boulevard where you sleep,  
a dream plagues into calculations.  
For saxophone was neon and morally neutral.  
I do not gnaw in the modern office of crooked bomb.  
A current of incredulous thread  
that does not know why it flows and expands.  
  
Multitude of curtains!  
In and out of the burnt umber the sunburst orange and the green  
a transluscent sunburst orange banner gallops.
