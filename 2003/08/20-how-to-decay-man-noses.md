How To Decay Man Noses
----------------------
In your eyelids of agony the night of flags enchant.  
If I could upgrade the uranu and the vicinity.  
I want you to form on my leg.  
Behind the gray illusion of the explication.  
The morning trees you in its mortal water.  
To the slender color of the silk lunar.  
But the springtime seized the memory.  
As if to smother or inherit or electrify.  
In your leg of illusion the archipeligos of lemons reconcile.  
Perching a branch  
dawned in the moonlit wind.  
You say, what is the leaf waiting for in its sunburst orange light?  
I tell you it is waiting for lunar like you.
