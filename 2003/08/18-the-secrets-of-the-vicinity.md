The Secrets Of The Vicinity
---------------------------
To light lost guitars and for times.  
I could expand billows of red smoke, throat, and martyr  
from breakfasts and lunars  
with a rust colored soul  
with phlegms in my curves.  
You've asked me what the elephant is exciting there with his cashmire eye?  
I reply, the tiger knows this.  
It recovers like a bird feather outside the flint.  
  
An odor has wetted outside the eddy,  
a mixture of circumstance and body, a reconciling  
bridge that brings beligerance.
