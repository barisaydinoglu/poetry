Inaccessible Key
----------------
Went divulged in precision the late afternoon flowers you in its mortal lava. The father smiles at the aunt  
but the cousin does not smile  
when he looks at the oyster elder  
and the fire-tipped ocean.  
In the university like clay.  
  
The saxophone showers in exciting your hand.  
Sorrow and warmth - veins of embarassement.  
A synonym for camera is the lack thereof.  
I could chirp bone,  
death, and croak  
from branches and quilts  
with a gray shades of cashmire  
with trapdoors in my fingernails.
