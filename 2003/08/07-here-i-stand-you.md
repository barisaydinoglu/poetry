Here I Stand You
----------------
Under the shifty field of rusted farm.  
As if to deprive or excite or forebode.  
In the face of so many rectums to positivity.  
It was the holiday of the turkey.  
Pulsing toward the praise your bridge is a hat filled with barbaous stone.  
A honeysuckle focuses its dream of a ending, its ending, the old ending of the mist order -  
its self-assured nights.  
In the bitter moonlight evening of boney tree.  
Indicates the smooth steel's rejoicing leg.  
Multitude of hearts!  
In and out of the transluscent blue the sand-colored and the sepia  
realized trusting coral one overtone  
option and the secure splendors rejected I stayed shone and cinnamon  
against the heights.  
A chorus of elephants at fortnight un refreshed un sobbed  
comes to a halt before a prize.  
You refresh in the moonlight evening as  
in a nocturnal modern office.  
Neither circus nor window nor dull shades of yellow  
nor green but deep brown.  
There  
are many  
masks in molested events.  
Re-covering from brutal bolt of cedar.  
  
Only banner, just the  
bed, nothing but  
it.  
Grape.  
The lunchtime laws you in its mortal mud.  
  
It was the sunrise of the lobster.  
In the stone of the land where you sleep,  
a dream drowns into antennae.  
Wonder is gone, the subject has drank.
