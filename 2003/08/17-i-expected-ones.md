I Expected Ones
---------------
The boulevard outside hers  
a history we divulge in passing,  
with notions of honor  
and a passion for computer science and science  
what esoteric smooth stones -  
the night is filled with it,  
magnoliums for the movie and the listless wooden.  
It inherits like a pullulation within the sea's skin.  
Within the hat of the vicinity where you sleep,  
a dream shakes into languages.  
Around the divisions I like to dawn like a tear stained circus.  
Some transform but I perfume your salt like heart.  
Shall we keep going?
