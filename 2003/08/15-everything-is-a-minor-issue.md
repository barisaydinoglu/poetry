Everything Is A Minor Issue
---------------------------
There are no complaints but sifted cycles of home and cinnamon  
planetariums of original sticky metal. In the face of so many stenches to functionality.  
The I in sea's skin but the sphere breathed the memory.  
  
Everything bitterest with  
indespensable voices, the salt of the mist  
and piles of enchanting bread around morning.
