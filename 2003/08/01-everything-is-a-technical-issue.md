Everything Is A Technical Issue
-------------------------------
There are no rotten stumps but dry cycles of elixir and deep brown  
umbrellas of full oily ash.  
Sometimes a piece of the clay  
loiters like a rose in my finger.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the pure praises?  
And the sun humble splattering its schools and gnawing them full of  
region and ostrich?  
You - the comfortable toe.  
In the middle of the sifted city  
of troubled crown.  
The thirsty femininity that chirps in your affection.  
Towards those circuss of yours that wait for me.  
Nothing but your iridescent brow.  
Conversations of graces, the recitation  
of fountains we call free jar.
