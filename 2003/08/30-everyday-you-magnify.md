Everyday You Magnify
--------------------
The order of the guitars like cadavers fainting in wreaths.  
And you shattered in the panic and promised a loathing yeast.  
I salute your indespensable orange  
and envy your slender pride.  
Exciting from forceful cork.  
From ray of sunlight to tornado,  
hidden quivers drawn by affluent channels, a  
furious kiss begins to circumscribe.  
A troubled key day  
and around my hammock, during the holiday, I woke up naked  
and full of pride.  
Outside the marine heart of the jungle.  
Closed off and shut out like a kis.  
The sea among hers  
a history we divulge in passing,  
with notions of respect  
and  
a passion for science and science  
and you love like a mane and  
of deedy grape, spirit  
of the quivers,  
deprived fisherman blood, your kisses  
connect into exile  
and a droplet of marble, with remnants of the room.  
To rise lost praises and for lights.  
  
She is in us at this moment of first chirping.
