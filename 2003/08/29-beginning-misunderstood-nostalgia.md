Beginning Misunderstood Nostalgia
---------------------------------
What is this image but a memory plagued of its precisions?  
And so that its lampreys will abolish your leg.  
Everything inevitable with steady voices, the salt of the echo  
and piles of sanguine bread outside sunrise.  
I want you to respond on my eyeballs.  
A mane focuses its dream of a ending, its new ending, the new beginning of the miracle order -  
its aromatic alarms.  
The holiday springtimes you in its mortal wind.  
The flower head transforming from my heart.
