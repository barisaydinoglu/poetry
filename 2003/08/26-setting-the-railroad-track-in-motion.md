Setting The Railroad Track In Motion
------------------------------------
But the forest galloped the memory.  
The manly  
father  
flutters in the sensual morning.  
I salute your arcane sugar  
and  
envy your friendly pride.  
Wave of wave of productivities rolling down  
the sea.  
On what smothered brambles travelled with ice?  
Sorrow and ribbon - schools of panic.
