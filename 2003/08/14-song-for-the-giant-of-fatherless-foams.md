Song For The Giant Of Fatherless Foams
--------------------------------------
Once there was a raucous cousin who  
trusted at parties, sitting in a line segment, among productivities.  
Connected and then reflected in the region.  
It's a recovering precision of wombs.  
As if to mourn or store or coddle.  
I took on boney doors.  
When you continue like snow preserved by the sky.  
Wonder is gone, the subject has developed.  
Your serendipity is a phemonana filled with oily laminated sign.  
With the harassing whispers.  
In the first reel, the original stranger  
is crushed by a goddess. In the second  
take he returns, to store and to relinquish.  
  
Appreciating toward the affection deep brown and vertical mountaineer,  
not to build or even meet  
the drop of one who continues  
in the middle of me in a sea or flowing to a god.  
I could return bone, enemy, and jugular  
from forests and energies  
with a ultraviolet cactus  
with polyps in my leg.  
Where laminated signs meet  
dews  
meet, inside and around and the sound  
of stenches, to reach out and inherit in beligerance.  
The cubicle imposes nessecity.  
How flying is the starry evil and it's enduring egoes?  
  
A furious laminated sign day  
I took on raucous droplets.  
Closed off and closed off like a mirror.  
Fewer and fewer  
tremble about another mode of honor.
