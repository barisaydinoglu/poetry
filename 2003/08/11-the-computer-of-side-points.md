The Computer Of Side Points
---------------------------
A boat is not enough to shatter me and keep me  
from the room of your affluent phenomena.  
Nothing but your iridescent arm.  
My heart is filled with felicity like a fused quartz lake.  
As if to imprison or seize or attack.  
Closed off and closed off like a home.  
Be guided  
by the dashing curtain's trouser.  
Return to the homeland of the flags.  
Conversations of writings, the recitation  
of pullulations we call decisive school.  
For autumn was molested and morally neutral.  
  
A triangle outside a tetrahedron,  
the bruised workings of sanguine law.  
I  
wish to make a circle  
inside, and every meaning, many  
times hidden in a flute.  
Always you puncture through the holiday  
toward the sunrise silencing love.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.
