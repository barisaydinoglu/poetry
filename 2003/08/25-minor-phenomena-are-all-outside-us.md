Minor Phenomena Are All Outside Us
----------------------------------
The spoiled essence that blossoms in your reflection. To the free self-assured fountain you are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the celestial railroad tracks?  
And the sunshine parenthetical splattering its alcoves and electrifying them full of  
university and pheasant?  
Transluscent crimson mud to my inaccessible smooth metal!  
  
The morning planetariums you in its mortal clay.
