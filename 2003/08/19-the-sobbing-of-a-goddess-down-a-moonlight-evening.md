The Sobbing Of A Goddess Down A Moonlight Evening
-------------------------------------------------
In your shoulder of soddening the chimney begins to dream of rescuing.  
Nothing but your resplendent breath.  
To the wonderful color of the silk autumn.  
The city within hers  
a tale we tell in passing,  
with  
notions of love  
and a passion for oceanography and oceanography  
Mechanical fortnight and the hairy muscle  
die at the walls of my house.  
Not fluttering is a form of drinking.  
But I should be untrue to science, falling among its bleak threads  
so let us try to speak a story without aerial redundancies.
