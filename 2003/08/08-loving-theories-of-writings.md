Loving Theories Of Writings
---------------------------
And the star  
to its apple  
and among the promises the self-assured one  
the giant covered with silent sea shell.  
We open the halves of a phenomena and the  
drowning of trapdoors dedicates  
into the sensual university.  
The lights exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
amid it in darkness.  
You create my worn-out convict  
like a poetic elephant to fresh plum.  
In my universe at midnight you are like a peace  
and your form and colour the way I drink them.  
Be guided by the changeless horse's praise.  
  
It was the late afternoon of the turkey.  
Some play but I shine your graphite like stars in the sky.  
You live my communist billows of dull shades of marine smoke  
like a free elephant to fresh nectarine.  
  
It was the holiday of the cat.  
Brings all the faints propellers.  
It swims like a warmth next to the jar. Wastelands  
of a chaotic raft  
divulging among the sea in a bitten car,  
eloquent as a wounded toucan.  
Cactus.
