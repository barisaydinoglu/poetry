The Epiphany Of The University
------------------------------
Among the opaque blue foot of the ice.  
On what pale lonely roads began with fire?  
A dull shades of green and negligent  
sea water is deprived in the land.  
Come with me to the massacre of stalactites.  
Wave of wave of circuss rolling down the sea.  
A green grace carries.  
I saw how forests are understood  
by the free tree.  
Here I am, a delicate nose electrified in the archipeligos of eddy.  
Enjoy the many directionless attempts to form  
the charitable dagger.  
There is brandishing fortune in connecting it.  
  
All lands become massacres.
