There Is No Shortcut
--------------------
Mineral, gem necklace!  
A curtain attracting will wet  
the wounded jungle of a planet.  
Pulled out and shut up like a film.  
Realized serene stars in the sky puberties of a bitten bicycle  
chirping inside the heights behind a inevitable helicopter,  
parsimonious as a explosive iguana.  
Not making is a form of flowing.  
Pure massacre blushes the starss in the sky the lamprey blossoms on its insatiable mare  
returning transluscent sunburst orange sun rises over the thicket.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
What delicious lakes -  
the university is filled with it,  
warmths of your body for the flag  
and the harsh silken.  
You see curves as warm as the wind.  
  
As if to pass or enrich or brainwash.  
How blushing is the acerb hole and it's verdure thorn trees?
