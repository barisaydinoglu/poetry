It Awakened With Schools
------------------------
With its muzzled dedicate  
set on the lampreys that wait for you  
dropping the blood-stained chairs, pampering the doors. You kiss my ironous cold fire  
like a gleaming elephant to fresh peach.  
It is a tale of insufferable invasions I was without doubt the person jaguar  
there in the dead heights.  
When it looked me with its self-assured shades of sunburst orange eyes  
it had neither hand nor nose  
but copper paths on its sides.  
In the face of so many funerals to positivity.
