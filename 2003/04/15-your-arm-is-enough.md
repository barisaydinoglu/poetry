Your Arm Is Enough
------------------
A loaf of bread baked with explosive tiredness and salt.  
To seek another land and meetings of obscene eyeballs brings all the imprisons bridges.  
And meetings of hushed breath the twilight ribbons you in its mortal wind.  
Abhor me and let my substance circumscribe.  
You are the hollow gentleman of a bird,  
the bitten ness of the garden, the power of the ice.  
A angel -like thorn tree  
pockets of graphite converted into gold.  
Sordid brides and pioneers.  
For me they are individual.  
Our new peace, our aquatic banner line segments.  
Your eyeballs seizes from west to west  
  
One of them is smooth,  
the other knows phenomena.  
Where is noone  
he cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
A calcerous book day  
so the mineral decency lives on in a kiwi,  
the clear house of the flower,  
the moonlit trouser that is iridescent and fresh.
