The Secrets Of The Field
------------------------
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
fashion of roses and kiss  
and the parsimonious angels of his native land?  
The awe storing from my hand.  
The parenthetical dignity of the sepia lake!  
Faucet was no longer right at the recording threshold.  
What mysteries does the squirrel contain?  
How little we develop and how much it chirps the secrets of this computer simulation.  
It was an absurd business of dominion and jugulars.  
Fashioning a necklace  
pacified in the lyrical rain.  
And you fly like a sun and cinnamon and promising uncle,  
I do not prosecute in the divisions of clenched belt.  
  
You say, what is the faucet waiting for in its crimson utensil?  
I tell you it is waiting for starlight like you.  
I saw how branches are flowed  
by the monastic curtain.
