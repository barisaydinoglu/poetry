The Thorn Tree Fallen Into The Sea
----------------------------------
Because I love you, love, inside the lightning and outside the electricity.  
The night starlights you in its mortal earth.  
From her eye and her fingernails create  
flowers of the earth.  
I do not taunt in the archipeligos of fatherless whisper.  
Spacious, gold hat!  
And meetings of windy shoulder it's a pacifying faucet of jackals.
