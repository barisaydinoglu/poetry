Breeding Fleeting Affection
---------------------------
I do not silence in the thicket of whirlwinds of funeral.  
In the middle of the fire-tipped femininity, many pale yeasts.  
Halfway.  
And around my hammock, during the sunrise, I woke up naked  
and full of love.  
Equinoctial, gold pencil!  
To rise lost foliages and for horses.  
A current of deedy fragrance of strawberry  
that does not know why it flows and kisses.  
And you re-cover like a forest and a esoteric sun of stars.  
Return to the homeland of the beds.  
How continuing is the self-assured legume and  
it's enduring walls?  
Because I love you, love, inside the mud and with the heat.  
A perfect linoleum making a thick thing of a probable meeting with a stranger.  
In my region at late afternoon you are like a shoreline  
and your form and colour the way I travel them.  
For a day, maybe too few to count,  
I rested under a uncomfortable turbulence  
at a bus stop, waiting for the sailor to be within.  
  
I saw how foams are developed  
by the lion hearted coral.
