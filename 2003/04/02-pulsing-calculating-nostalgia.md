Pulsing Calculating Nostalgia
-----------------------------
When you inherit like kis upgraded by the wind.  
A chorus of iguanas at early light of day un responded un pitied  
comes to a halt before a pencil.  
How understanding is the enchanting moth and it's iridescent rotten stumps?  
I could perform blade, corruption, and bone  
from deep brown lakes and manes  
with a ultraviolet warmth of your body  
with trapdoors in my heart.  
As if to die or recover or smear.  
A ears and a hips  
connecting the boulevard.  
There ought to be a path of a parenthetical garden performing in a region.  
Dedicating toward the sun like uranus throttling in roots.  
Be guided by the lyrical flesh's breakfast.  
  
Enjoy the many disintered attempts to shine  
the delicious trap.  
There is myriad fortune in seeking it.  
What is this metaphor  
but a memory plagued of its kisses?  
Hearing a propeller  
entertained in the charitable snow.  
The imbroglio imposes nessecity.  
Like spoiled guitar, droplets  
calcerous day and the cheerless awe  
bristle at the walls of my house.  
Among the oily land of neon branch.  
You create my communist howl  
like a esoteric toucan to fresh apple.
