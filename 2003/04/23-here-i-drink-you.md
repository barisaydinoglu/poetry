Here I Drink You
----------------
A cashmire writing imbues.  
What is this projection but a memory soddened of its forests?  
Here I am, a esoteric curves penetrated in the area of reflection.  
Inside the opaque turqoise beligerance of the nougat.  
Return to the homeland of the breakfasts. I want you to trust on my nose.  
Banal sunrise and the dead ribbon  
entangle at the walls of my house.  
A quadrangle behind a loop,  
the wet-winged workings of handsome law.  
Next to the deluding imperfect silks.  
In your breath of confusion the sea of branches flutter.  
Wave of wave of telegraphs rolling down the sea.  
For a day, maybe too many to count,  
I rested under a blade of grass  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the one to be in front of.
