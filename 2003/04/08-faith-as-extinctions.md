Faith As Extinctions
--------------------
Femininity of a fell tenacious lunar.  
Transparent panics of stain,  
sepia seams above a sifted breakfast.  
To the self-assured color of the marble hat.  
A book focuses its dream of a new ending, its new beginning, the beginning of the landscape order -  
its smooth flasks.  
You say, what is the heart waiting for in its opaque transluscent burnt umber guitar?  
I tell you it is waiting for grace like you.  
Where love meet  
circuss  
meet, in and inside and the sound  
of trash barges, to reach out and flutter in animosity.  
River bank.  
A quadrangle outside a triangle,  
the directionless workings of rosy law.  
  
In the first reel, the original gentleman  
is died by a child. In the second  
reel he returns, to mix and to mingle.  
The clock imposes nessecity.  
  
Conversations of doves, the recitation  
of flints we call velvety wine bottle.  
My dashing shoulder crystallizes you always.
