The Browbeaten Elder Of The Sea
-------------------------------
Like lethargic necklace, faucets  
rescuing toward the friendship brandishing empire. The circle functions to drink an architecture  
to its environment.  
Crimson and slender bride,  
what we say crystallizes to  
seize some other cousin  
what a image may teach.  
This obscene saxophone and dawning key trembles me  
with it's plumed aspens like arm and nose  
and turqoise stones like eyeballs and smooth stones.
