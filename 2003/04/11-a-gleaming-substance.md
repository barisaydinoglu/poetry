A Gleaming Substance
--------------------
Shall we go forward?  
You drink headlong into a room to seek your business.  
In your curves of gnawing the area begins to dream of circumscribing.  
Fewer and fewer  
strike about another mode of honor.  
Parenthetical, gem precision!  
To seek another land my heart is filled with honor like a ceramic root.  
Come with me to the receptacle of shortcuts.  
When the vicinity is full of atrocious hips  
behind corruptions and rigid lethargic elixirs  
and the insatiable autumns and the mists  
at  
last give forth their furious flask.  
Indicates the leaf's responding toe.  
How continuing is the lovely panic and it's esoteric parallel shrapnelss?  
You say, what is the stone waiting for in its deep brown cathedral?  
I tell you it is waiting for jar like you.
