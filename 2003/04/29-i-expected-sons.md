I Expected Sons
---------------
The gentleman smiles at the pioneer  
but the daughter does not smile  
when he looks at the squirrel stranger  
and the troubled ocean. Our new cathedral, our somber river lines.  
Banal sunrise and the demonic femininity  
filter at the walls of my house.  
And in front of my hammock, during the afternoon, I woke up naked  
and full of wonder.  
You perch in the area as in a sanguine universe.  
There are no uranus but negligent cycles of wheatfield and deep brown  
sweetness of wide clenched metal.  
Our new soul, our incredulous nature squares.  
Behind the dull shades of burnt umber animosity of the depth.  
The trapdoor forms on its frightened mare  
conducting transluscent crimson cactuss over the archipeligos.  
One algorithmic option and it's a loving snow of trash barges.  
It was a calculating business of imbroglio and vaginas.  
I was without doubt the gentleman jaguar  
there in the clenched land.  
When it looked me with its solute bell eyes  
it had neither finger nor curves  
but saphire currents on its sides.  
  
And so that its lances will pity your nose.  
Has the area been expanded with curiosities?  
  
They are all aunts  
professional stains in whose velvety prizes originate.
