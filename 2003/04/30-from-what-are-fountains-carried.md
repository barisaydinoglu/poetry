From What Are Fountains Carried
-------------------------------
The noble wheatfield gave it felicity.  
In the smallest gem atom an odor has awakened in the sea shell,  
a mixture of wax  
and body, a perfuming  
elixir that brings confusion.  
Around the night  
I like to discover like a frightened tree.  
From uncomfortable turbulence to uncomfortable turbulence,  
hidden smooth irons drawn by cleansed channels, a  
ironous cluster begins to relax.
