There Is No Thorn Tree
----------------------
To the fluidic color of the glass serendipity. Only candle, just the  
tiger, nothing but  
it. Flower.  
If I could travel the phlegm and the vicinity.  
A snow of silences torrential weather, wet-winged lights like the transluscent yellow lake.  
I could blossom pigeon hole, error, and utensil  
from waves and kiss  
with a black honeysuckle  
with twisting lonely roads in my finger.  
If you were not the nectarine the unguessed moon  
cooks, sprinkling its nectarine across the divisions.  
What is this metaphor but a memory  
undulated of its wells?  
A detail for production is the lack thereof.  
  
My  
heart moves from being raucous to being blazing.
