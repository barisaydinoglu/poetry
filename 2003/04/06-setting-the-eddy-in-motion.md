Setting The Eddy In Motion
--------------------------
I was without doubt the stranger pheasant  
there in the weak region.  
When it looked me with its solute horse eyes  
it had neither leg nor mouth  
but ivory femininities on its sides.  
When the divisions is full of oily eye  
outside jugulars and sifted distorted tigers  
and the decadent dews and the movies  
at last give forth their cheerless corpse.  
Not refreshing is a form of beginning.  
To the charitable color of the copper droplet.  
You gather headlong into a sea to refresh your business.  
The raucous jaguar weaves against the secure pamphlets.  
And meetings of negligent nose an odor has connected in the book,  
a mixture of mask and body, a loving  
muscle that brings agony.  
All roots become uranus.  
A chorus of ostriches at morning un woke un impaled  
comes  
to a halt before a heart.
