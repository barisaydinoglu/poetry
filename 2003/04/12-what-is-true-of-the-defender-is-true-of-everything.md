What Is True Of The Defender Is True Of Everything
--------------------------------------------------
A detail divulges,  
trembles - it does not return.  
One of them is promising,  
the other knows studies.  
Where is nobody  
she says, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
My heart moves from being banal to being lion hearted.  
The spoiled saxophone is brandishing on your fingernails.  
Wipe me and let my substance carry.  
Has the boulevard been returned with curiosities?  
Multitude of manes!  
In and out of the transparent the green and the burnt umber  
and meetings of wayside fingernails  
one of them is iridescent,  
the other knows sequences.  
Where is everybody  
she says, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?
