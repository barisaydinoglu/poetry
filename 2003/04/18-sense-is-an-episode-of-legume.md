Sense Is An Episode Of Legume
-----------------------------
In the face of so many cold fires to positivity.  
Dedicating the tryst of her crown full of felicity.  
A dull shades of sunburst orange and inevitable flag is forced in the boulevard.  
I could stand vagabond, death, and noise  
from grapes and currents  
with a black light  
with wombs in my brain.  
Mingling toward the prize I took on bitten books.  
You are the clenched son of a tiger,  
the worn-out ness of the hat, the power of the mud.  
Has the jungle been chirped with mysteries?
