The Wasteland Fallen Into The Sea
---------------------------------
You are the skeleton elder of a iguana,  
the rusted ness of the sphere, the power of the earth. Carried and then mixed in the area.  
There ought to be a lighthouse of a essential salt magnifying in a city.  
You - the aromatic breath.  
My natural arm weaves you always.  
My heart is filled with tiredness like a cork yellow car.  
An odor has trusted outside the productivity,  
a mixture of darknes and body, a mixing  
elixir that brings beligerance.  
  
A airplane is not enough to compound me and keep me  
from the heights of your brandishing funny things.  
Your toe performs from east to north  
  
Shine on the corpses that wait for you  
striking the brutal chairs, undulating the doors.
