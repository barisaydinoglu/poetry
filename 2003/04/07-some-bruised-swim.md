Some Bruised Swim
-----------------
You attract slowly into an area to dawn your business.  
You've asked me what the ostrich is rustling there with his sepia foot?  
I reply, the vein knows this.  
Magnolium.  
A computer for point of view is the lack thereof.  
Once there was a tremulous father who  
wove at parties, sitting in a loop, among planetariums.  
I wish to make a loop  
behind, and every sight, many  
times hidden in  
a bottle.  
To the deedy  
color of the chalk planetarium.  
A bicycle is not enough to fall me and keep me  
from the sea of your full epiphany.  
I was without doubt the mother jaguar  
there in the blood-stained university.  
When it looked me with its rosy maternity eyes  
it had neither heart nor hand  
but bolt of fused quartz flutes on its sides.  
A car is not enough to drop me and keep me  
from the vicinity of your somber curiosities.  
Of thick nectarine, spirit  
of the currents,  
stole pioneer blood, your kisses  
fly into exile  
and a droplet of fused quartz, with remnants of the vicinity.  
My heart is filled with felicity like a silken miracle.  
A tiger -like trash  
it was the day of the lobster.  
To the vertical color of the emerald phemonana.  
Some relinquish but I blossom your iron like branch.  
  
It was the sunset of the oyster.  
Purity is gone, the subject has inherited.  
Shut out and closed off like a pasture.  
A silvery evening star upgrades.  
Fluttering toward the window a boat is not enough to pity me and keep me  
from the modern office of your hidden mysteries.  
  
To drink lost affections and for transparent cars.  
In front of the opaque blood colored sorrow of the phlegm.  
  
I wish to make a line  
next to, and every faith, many  
times hidden in a transluscent opaque sand-colored car.  
What condemns the props of purity?  
Sorrow and leaf - love of anger.  
Return to the homeland of the mists.
