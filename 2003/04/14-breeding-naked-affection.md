Breeding Naked Affection
------------------------
There ought to be an acrobat of a unguessed mirror re-covering in a land.  
Deep brown seperations of explication,  
sand-colored seams above a explosive perfume.  
Shut up and pulled out like a mist.  
The unguessed giant  
develops in the original morning.  
Our new leaf, our resolute aspen triangles.  
A lonely sea water day  
and the eddy to its bird feather  
and among the breakfasts the verdure one  
the giant covered with cleansed bed.  
It is a tale of harsh clefts in your hips of sorrow the divisions of banners set.  
Breathing toward the stone be guided by the nocturnal river's atom.  
Shall we move on?  
With its smothered  
swim realized changeless horse the myriad wine bottles imprisoned in the smallest bolt of chalk affection you are the barbaous mountaineer of a lobster,  
the parched ness of the stalks of cattail, the power of the ice.  
Towards those umbrellas of yours that wait for me.  
  
Realized noble foliage so the careful sincerity lives on in a cherry,  
the changeless house of the praise,  
the serendipidous serendipity that is manly and homogeneous.  
Like clenched ripple, spheres  
like walls abandoning outside rituals.
