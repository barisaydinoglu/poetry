An Equally Resplendent Mountaineer
----------------------------------
A raft is not enough to impale me and keep me  
from the sea of your fleeting epiphany.  
Insufferable morning and the imperalist  
telegraph  
overflow at the walls of my house.  
I wish to make a circle  
within, and  
every color, many  
times hidden in a bottle.  
Sea shell was  
no longer right at the recording threshold.
