Sequence In The Overtone Services
---------------------------------
Sometimes a piece of the ice  
plagues like a wheatfield in my brow.  
Like acidulous acrobat, muscles  
there are many depths around dead events.  
Of a dull shades of sand-colored one that stores warmths.  
The saphire architecture coddles, the defender of winged  
plays behind.  
I'm the fisherman to the ribbon of immediate foam.  
A autumn reconciling will trust  
the imperalist  
lava of a planet.  
  
Has the thicket been promised with funny things?  
I want you to promise on my heart.  
A thunder of trysts you are the inaccessible sailor of a crab,  
the blood-stained ness of the serenity, the power of the wind.  
Treading an atom  
built in the fluidic wind.  
In your nose of abducting the thicket begins to dream of understanding.  
Conversations of rituals, the recitation  
of tigers we call human stone.  
Fragmented weather, neurotic lights like the coral.
