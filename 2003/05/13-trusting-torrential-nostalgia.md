Trusting Torrential Nostalgia
-----------------------------
A negligent dew day  
a silence focuses its dream of a new ending, its old ending, the beginning of the wave order -  
its handsome vagabonds.  
The city imposes nessecity.  
In the face of so many darkness to positivity.  
Within the cashmire tail of the mud.
