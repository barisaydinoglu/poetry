Velvety Theories Of Apples
--------------------------
You say,  
what is the root waiting for in its burnt umber promise?  
I tell you it is waiting for flesh like you.  
A negligent study devours  
even the musical  
public universe in synonym  
to which the metaphor  
will not be gathered.  
Nobody here is waiting for the next tiger.  
Maternity. You fashioned yourself for upgrading.  
In the smallest silicon  
flute mixing the foliage of her river bank full of tiredness.  
What we say builds to  
reconcile some other son  
what a inscription may teach.  
Inside the area like aluminum.  
  
I stayed trod and blue  
in the city.
