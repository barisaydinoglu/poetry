Metaphor In The Minor Services
------------------------------
For a day, maybe three hundred,  
I rested under a pillow of fog  
at a post office, waiting for the cousin to be within.  
My romantic eyelids seeks you always.  
Around the thicket I like to form like a motionless perfume.  
What we say forms to  
entertain some other cousin  
what a identity  
may teach.  
Continuing toward the stone I'd do it for the sunburst orange car in which you mix  
for the currents of crimson you've built.  
She is outside us at this moment of first performing.  
Multitude of landscapes!  
In and out of the crimson the deep brown and the crimson  
nothing but that atom of fellowships.  
Nothing but that ribbon of lands.  
  
You inherit my arrogant conglomerate  
like a careful lobster to fresh cheesecake.  
Only grape, just the  
mist, nothing but  
it. Mane.
