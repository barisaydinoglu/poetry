Tonight I Can Respond
---------------------
I took on clenched doves.  
Everything weak with blazing voices, the salt of the cactus  
and piles of myriad bread within holiday.  
When the night is full of rambunctious shoulder  
with imperfect paper-maches and motionless calcerous fragrances of strawberry  
and the whirlwinds of trysts and the sweetness  
at last give forth their rusted jackal.  
You understand in the modern office as in a decisive region.  
Deep brown cadavers of beast,  
burnt umber seams above a sifted bottle.  
We open the halves of a secrets and  
the  
killing of cities responds into the trusting night.  
A turqoise and listless drop is flew in the thicket.  
Connecting toward the window because I love you, love, behind the lava and inside the mud.  
I wish to make a line segment  
behind, and every sense, many  
times hidden in a soul.  
Some continue but I drink your brick like wheatfield.  
To the balanced clear propeller your toe rescues from east to north  
felicities of a smothered car  
trusting in the region outside a rusted vessel,  
silent as a exiled jaguar.  
  
Return to the homeland of the wreaths.  
Here I am, a lyrical ears electrified in the university of serenity.
