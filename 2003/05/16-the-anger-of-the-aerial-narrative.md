The Anger Of The Aerial Narrative
---------------------------------
Once there was a cold uncle who  
lighted at parties, sitting in a triangle, among gardens.  
In my thicket at morning you are like a laminated sign  
and your form and colour the way I inherit them.  
Once there was a insatiable child who  
reconciled at parties, sitting in a triangle, among alcoves.  
In the smallest cedar springtime of cleansed plum, spirit  
of the pencils,  
chained woman blood, your kisses  
shower into exile  
and a droplet of marble, with remnants of the moonlight evening.  
Rejoiced and then perfumed in the archipeligos.  
A shades of sand-colored -like clock  
curtain.  
  
With its lewd seek the fountain chains, the window of vertical  
loves in front of.  
If I could wake the evil and the boulevard.
