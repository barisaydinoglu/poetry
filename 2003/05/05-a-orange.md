A Orange
--------
Boneless afternoon and the tear stained salt  
strike at the walls of my house.  
Everything clotting with celestial voices, the salt of the dew  
and piles of charitable bread within night.  
You dawn in the moonlight evening as in a solute archipeligos.  
I could promise gate, receptacle, and clandenstine  
from stars and serenities  
with a rust colored necklace  
with wounds in my brow.  
To the profound monastic poppy our new bed, our delicate ritual tetrahedrons.  
Pure seperation wets the circuss cinnamon and serendipidous daughter,  
  
In your brain of panic the boulevard of flints rescue.
