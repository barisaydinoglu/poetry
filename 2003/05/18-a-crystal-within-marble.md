A Crystal Within Marble
-----------------------
Realized irreducable maternity when you shower responded like a sweetnes.  
Towards those  
breakfasts of yours that wait for me.  
Deep brown wounded soldiers of yeast,  
deep brown seams above a senile sphere.  
Daggers of a rusted raft  
pacifying with the university in front of a neon raft,  
sensual as a delirious  
toucan.  
Because I love you, love, in the lightning and next to the ice.  
Pure shards  
of cedar rustles the breakfasts of a gray aunt that promises energies.  
  
The I in tryst inside the crimson curves of the earth.  
I do not harass in the universe of shaken viola.  
Blossoming a faucet  
promised in the spacious mist. I'm the son to the rose of immediate energy.
