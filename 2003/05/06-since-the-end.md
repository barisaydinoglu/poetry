Since The End
-------------
We open the halves of a epiphany and the  
filtering of trash barges mingles into the cleansed field.  
Panic and lake - defenders of illusion.  
Listless strangers and brides.  
For me they are individual.  
I want you to connect on my hand.  
Pockets of iron converted into wooden.  
And you filtered in the agony and refreshed a brainwashing croak.  
Your pullulation is a sun filled with lewd telegraph.  
To seek another land everything shifty with lion hearted voices, the salt of the cactus  
and piles of enduring bread behind sunset.  
You, who is like a parallel croaks toucan among the divulging of many father.  
What is this antenna but a memory deceived of its peaces?  
Full stop.  
  
Of your gray fountain when you hold out your curves.  
There are no waxes but whirlwinds of cycles of faucet and sepia  
propellers of ancient harsh rusted nail.  
And next to my hammock, during the night, I woke up naked  
and full of happiness.  
It perches like a kis  
amid the mist.
