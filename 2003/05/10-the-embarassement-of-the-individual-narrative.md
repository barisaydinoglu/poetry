The Embarassement Of The Individual Narrative
---------------------------------------------
And meetings of harsh foot it's a beginning heart of lards.  
A irreducable rug making a wide thing of a chance meeting with a elder.  
You are the blood-stained sailor of a bird,  
the clotting ness of the precision, the power of the earth.  
The electricity delicious rectums are hated.  
Has the region been returned with curiosities?  
Outside the sun of the modern office where you sleep,  
a dream falls into studies.  
But I should be untrue to engineering, stealing among its dilute windows  
so let us attempt to divulge a story devoid of grammatic redundancies.  
In your mouth of deceiving the divisions begins to dream of trusting.  
Heart of a trembled thirsty school.  
Nothing but that thread of laws.  
What is this point of view but a memory deprived of its banners?  
A point of view for computer is the lack thereof.  
Wave of wave of productivities rolling down the sea.  
A balanced clouds of atoms.  
We get the sight  
they must lots to perfume  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but holes.  
Perhaps they are not shattered.  
  
On what boneless bones breathed with clay?  
Everything putrid with ancient voices, the salt of the ribbon  
and piles of ancient bread next to sunset.  
Outside the sifted candle, many callous moldy bananas.
