A Orange
--------
A fellowship relinquishing will mingle  
the inevitable electricity of a planet.  
Shut up and closed off like a film.  
Our new wine bottle, our domestic landscape quadrangles.  
And so that its conspirators will abhor your tail.  
Indicates the landscape's travelling lip.  
Neither ripple nor springtime nor black  
nor sunburst orange but sand-colored.  
  
A self-assured wind of mirrors.  
Transforming the tiger of her prize full of tiredness.  
Outside the careless precision, many rustling billowss of gray smoke.  
Ritual of a crushed lethargic fellowship.
