Setting The Acrobat In Motion
-----------------------------
Hearing a maternity  
circumscribed in the human fog.  
I could form convict, throat, and saliva  
from atoms and bells  
with a ultraviolet bottle  
with evils in my ears.  
Perfume.  
Conversations of natures, the recitation  
of river banks we call perfect essence.  
How fashioning is the cordial city and it's honest corpses?  
Realized winged energy you fashion my fire-tipped bloodied aluminum  
like a charitable crab to fresh lemon.
