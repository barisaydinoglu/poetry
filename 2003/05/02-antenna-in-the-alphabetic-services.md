But the stalks of cattail gathered the memory.  
What we say upgrades to  
rise some other lady  
what a computer may teach.  
You say, what is the sweetnes waiting for in its marine laminated sign?  
I tell you it is waiting for grace like you.  
Next to the cashmire brow of the fire.  
The inaccessible saxophone that imbues in your root.  
The blood-stained home is parenthetical on your tail.  
  
One minor option and once there was a rambunctious elder who  
trod at parties, sitting in a circle, among wells.  
Planetarium of a penetrated shaken cluster.  
There ought to be a candle of a wonderful pencil relinquishing in a thicket.  
The sunrise love you in its mortal fire.
