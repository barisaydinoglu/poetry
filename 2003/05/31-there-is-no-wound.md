There Is No Wound
-----------------
If you were not the grape the friendly moon  
cooks, sprinkling its apple across the archipeligos.  
A mist of transparent cars behind the arrogant heights of ironous laminated sign.  
How treading is the serene uranu and it's scrupulous lineages? The stench imposes nessecity.  
Towards those pencils of yours that wait for me.
