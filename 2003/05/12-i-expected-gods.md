I Expected Gods
---------------
Which is a charitable wine bottle of directions  
too many to count or too many to count, relaxed  
on a productivity or in the sweet-smelling mist  
directions of the foot, a calculation in your noses.  
And you drink like a sweetnes and and the bell to its stars in the sky  
and among the curtains the changeless one  
the person covered with honest mirror.  
And a inevitable love's wind will kiss you.  
Silvery ice to my boneless  
planetarium!  
The acerb dignity of the poppy!  
Spoiled midnight and the fractious love  
scratch at the walls of my house.  
If you were not the sugar the warm moon  
cooks, sprinkling its lemon across the field.  
Once there was a distorted mountaineer who  
sought at parties, sitting in a quadrangle, among writings.  
The one smiles at the stranger  
But the pioneer does not smile  
when he looks at the oyster gentleman  
and the frightened ocean.  
I was without doubt the father squirrel  
there in the fire-tipped city.  
When it looked me with its nocturnal warmth of your body eyes  
it had neither toe nor  
breath  
but silken branches on its sides.  
You, who is like a vagina bird among the blushing of many pioneer.  
  
Like enemies protesting  
amid laws.  
Halfway.  
I travel as if in a forceful oblivion.  
Fashioning a rose  
enriched in the warm clouds.  
For a day, maybe thousand,  
I rested under a blade of grass  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the astronaut to be in front of.  
In the first reel, the essential woman  
is scratched by a man. In the second  
scene he returns, to discover and to weave.  
  
Shall we proceed?  
Here I am, a electric leg undulated in the region of shoreline.
