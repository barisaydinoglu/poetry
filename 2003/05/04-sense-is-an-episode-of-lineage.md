Sense Is An Episode Of Lineage
------------------------------
You - the perfect hand.  
Realized serendipidous coat the wind careful imperfect saphires are electrified.  
What trusting knaves -  
the land is filled with it,  
awes for the grace and the mechanical saphire.  
Developing from spoiled cork.  
The shadess of opaque transluscent blue  
exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
outside it in darkness. Conversations of times, the recitation  
of wells we call enchanting branch.  
Light.
