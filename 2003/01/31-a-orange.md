A Orange
--------
This rusted form and reflecting pencil plagues me  
with it's boundless juices like arm  
and brain  
and opaque gray jars like eyeballs and doors. Illusion and key - pullulations of illusion.  
Rigid yeasts and neurotic cadavers.  
In front of the breakfast of the divisions where you sleep,  
a dream mourns into cameras.  
The sea's skins exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
in it in darkness.
