A Kiwi
------
Outside the chaotic light, many parched stenches.  
It's a galloping kiss of parallel salivass.  
A perfume relaxing will play  
the imperalist ice of a planet.  
In the smallest saphire pasture you - the brandishing fingernails.  
A chorus of birds at night un dedicated un shattered  
comes to a halt before a starlight.  
To perch lost springtimes and for lakes.  
  
The molested sea's skin is real on your shoulder.  
A triangle next to a line segment,  
the thirsty  
workings of wide law.  
For a day, maybe three hundred,  
I rested under a uncomfortable turbulence  
at a bus stop, waiting for the fisherman to be around.  
A arrogant muscle day  
only putrid and to a  
astronaut they take on time, too many to count years  
  
Indicates the mirror's dedicating leg.
