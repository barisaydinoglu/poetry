The Calculation Of Alphabetic Points
------------------------------------
The delicious flower head gave it felicity.  
A decisive drizzle of flower heads.  
The fragrance of strawberry pulsing from my brain.  
What seems simultaneous  
to one will not seem so to another.  
Everybody here is waiting for the next marine lake.  
Juice. You kissed yourself for connecting.  
If I could inherit the convict and the moonlight evening.  
You, who is like a blade squirrel among the seizing of many mountaineer.  
The saliva imposes nessecity.  
Acerb, wooden defender!  
I want you to perch on my toe.  
In front of the mourning wastelands.  
Some connect but I divulge your brick like utensil.  
What self-assured lands -  
the university is filled with it,  
railroad tracks for the pullulation and the negligent cork.
