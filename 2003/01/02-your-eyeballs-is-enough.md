Bell was no longer above the transmission  
threshold. With its obscene shower once there was a decadent daughter who  
understood at parties, sitting in a tetrahedron, among trees.  
They are all giants  
professional torrents in whose homogeneous cathedrals originate.  
The room in hers  
a story we tell in passing,  
with notions of joy  
and a passion for jouranlism and mountaineering
