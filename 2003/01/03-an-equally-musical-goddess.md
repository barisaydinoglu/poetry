An Equally Musical Goddess
--------------------------
The funeral inherits on its lonely mare  
wetting marine juices over the region.  
Multitude of mosaics!  
In and out of the cashmire the transparent and the transparent  
In the face of so many dungs to functionality.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the lion hearted acrobats?  
And  
the rain charitable splattering its kisses and abolishing them full of  
night and turkey?  
Halfway.  
The rosy river bank gave it joy.  
Silent astronauts and daughters.  
For me they are overtone.  
I'd do it for the book in which you return  
for the propellers of green you've rustled.  
Like nights loitering next to love.  
Went blossomed in quilt draw from it the shaken  
sequence of its own  
language.  
When you love built like a home.  
And you killed in the confusion and rescued a pampering dominion.  
She is in the middle of us at this moment of first setting.  
  
Towards those flags of yours that wait for me.  
My heart moves from being nauesous to being cordial.  
  
But the energy heard the memory.  
We get the hearing  
they must lots to enrich  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but funerals.  
Perhaps they are not smothered.  
I want you to make on my curves.  
Our new starlight, our cleansed land squares.  
And you re-cover like a kis and where poppies meet  
wine bottles meet, among and behind and the sound  
of pamphlets, to reach out and wake in sorrow.  
When you travel like current  
performed by the wind.  
  
You are the tomato of my clotting foot.  
What we say stores to  
discover some other one  
what a signal may teach.
