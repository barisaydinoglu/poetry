A Grape
-------
From her toe and her lip rescue  
old warrior's medals of the earth.  
Went seized in candle from unrelenting rain to unrelenting rain,  
hidden veins drawn by careful channels, a  
tear stained bed begins to appreciate.  
Brings all the punctures sea  
water.  
Shut up and shut up like a praise.  
You are the chaotic god of a bird,  
the boney ness of the shoreline, the power of the water.  
Halfway.  
  
The early light of day veins you in its mortal lava.  
Wave of wave of river banks rolling down the sea.  
Some live but I entertain your broken glass like flute.  
Like the lethargic ash of schools promising from muzzled chalk.  
And the leaf to its hat  
and among the fleshes the iridescent one  
the pioneer covered with boundless acrobat.  
Not the transluscent transparent moment  
when the late afternoon excites the quivers.  
To perch lost maps and for sun rises.  
Sometimes a piece of the electricity  
twists like a stars in the sky in my brain.  
It breathes like a leaf inside the grape.  
A loop inside a loop,  
the melancholy workings of winged law.  
Went drank in farm not the sepia moment  
when the holiday imbues the shorelines.  
A current of trusting bell  
that does not know why it flows and lights.  
My heart is filled with honor like a saphire tryst.  
  
I  
wish to make a loop  
next to, and every hearing, many  
times hidden in a bell.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
flutter of flags and rivers  
and the cosmic silences of his native land?  
I salute your rosy sugar  
and envy your trusting pride.  
With the marine nose of the lightning.
