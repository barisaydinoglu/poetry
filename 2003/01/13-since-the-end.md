Since The End
-------------
A triangle around a circle,  
the inevitable workings of humble law.  
Outside transluscent yellow water and marine drops.  
Sailor of the depths of my lip - your playing  
stills your esoteric regard as though it were sky.  
The billow of dull shades of green smoke perches on its burned-out mare  
perching cinnamon lemons over the region.  
Not the transparent moment  
when the night connects the dews.  
Always you coagulate through the twilight  
toward the night condemning roots.  
Nothing but your somber fingernails.  
A cinnamon perfume enchants.  
  
You see lip as acerb as the clouds.  
And the necklace to its mosaic  
and among the roses the irreducable one  
the giant covered with domestic bed.
