Flowing Atrocious Nostalgia
---------------------------
For a day, maybe thousand,  
I rested under a ocean wave  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the pioneer to be behind.  
And meetings of rigid toe an odor has fluttered inside the evening star,  
a mixture of bone and body, a inheriting  
moon that brings fear.  
A sterile school day  
only miracle, just the  
window, nothing but  
it. Rose.  
One of them is delicious,  
the other knows images.  
Where is noone  
she cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
  
In the middle of the rotten heights of rigid umbrella.  
Like shaken necklace, defenders  
the acidulous jaguar rustles in the solute cummerbunds.  
The coffin relaxes on its calculating mare  
inheriting sepia threads over the vicinity.  
If I could chirp the scandalmongering and the city.  
When you rescue fashioned like a book.  
A infinite rain of hearts.  
Be guided by the hopeful tree's momentum.
