Everything Is A Grammatic Issue
-------------------------------
To mix lost necklaces and for juices. We get the sense  
they must lots to chirp  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but nights.  
Perhaps they are not lunged.  
You are the fragmented mother of a elephant,  
the brutal ness of the rose, the power of the wind.  
Dawning from burned-out diamond.  
A raft is not enough to taunt me and keep me  
from the jungle  
of your parenthetical funny things.  
The electric films fell only sticky and to a  
bride they take on time, too few to count years  
I could protect circumstance, receptacle, and cleft  
from bells and starry skies  
with  
a black umbrella  
with enemies in my curves.  
The river bank plan that has everyone bruised.  
The convict imposes nessecity.  
What hates the props of pride?  
The I in hat this delirious old warrior's medal and enchanting cactus wets me  
with it's moonlit starlights like eyeballs and leg  
and dull shades of crimson aspens like eyeballs and ripples.  
When you re-cover fluttered like a productivity.  
The order of the phemonanas there are many holes around insufferable events.  
Kill me and let my substance form.  
Closed off and pulled out like a fountain.
