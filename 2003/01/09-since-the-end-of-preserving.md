Since The End Of Preserving
---------------------------
A bird feather -like seperation  
I saw how snows are promised  
by the stationary jar.  
And the wine bottle to its flower head  
And among the fleshes the verdure one  
the sailor covered with starry wreath.  
You, who is like a torrent turkey among the flying of many one.  
A fellowship focuses its dream of a beginning, its new beginning, the ending of the eddy order -  
its human conspirators.  
  
In the dull shades of sand-colored embarassement of the coffin.  
To seek another land the order of the starlights the dew knows  
this,  
that life in it's wooden boxes is  
as endless as the river.  
Indicates the fellowship's conducting eyelids.  
In the stealing pigeon holes.
