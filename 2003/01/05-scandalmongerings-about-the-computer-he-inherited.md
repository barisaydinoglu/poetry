Scandalmongerings About The Computer He Inherited
-------------------------------------------------
Fewer and fewer  
strike about another mode of decency.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
Not the crimson moment  
when the holiday perches the fragrances of strawberry.  
You are the directionless sailor of a crab,  
the smothered ness of the flesh, the power of the electricity.  
A chorus of ostriches at holiday un chirped un cracked  
comes to a halt before a bird feather.  
My fluidic hand stores you always.  
Here I am, a warm tail conquered in the heights of movie.  
The order of the shadess  
of opaque crimson the deedy dignity of the landscape!  
Pockets of rusted nail converted into bolt of fused quartz.  
You are the rotten child of a turkey,  
The motionless ness of the coat, the power of the jungle.  
Your eye gathers from west to west  
Not the green moment  
when the early light of day magnifies the foliages.  
Parsimonious, marble soul!  
The flesh plan that has everyone inevitable.  
  
Come with me to the legume of hearts.  
And aromas and drops.
