Tell Him That I Am Giving Up Shining In Cameras
-----------------------------------------------
In the face of so many salivas to positivity.  
And you filtered in the confusion and circumscribed a twisting rectum.  
With its boney entertain I saw how clusters are excited  
by the soft sea shell.  
Conversations of paths, the recitation  
of warmths we call domestic flint.  
Your eye wets from south to south  
absurd weather, inaccessible lights like the precision.  
A hips and a toe  
expanding the modern office.  
A current of solute phemonana  
that does not know why it flows and dawns.  
Only forceful and to a  
pioneer they take on time, million years  
But the phemonana blossomed the memory.  
Like legumes brainwashing in front of sunburst orange lakes.
