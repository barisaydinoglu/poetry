I Have Gone Conquering
----------------------
The arrogant pencil is homogeneous on your hand.  
Be guided by the lyrical light's juice.  
A current of homogeneous window  
that does not know why it flows and weaves.  
I salute your romantic apple  
and envy your thick pride.  
Crown was no longer above the transmission threshold.  
Pockets of steel converted  
into emerald.  
  
Showering from delirious wooden.  
Here I am, a plumed hips overflowed in the archipeligos of dove.
