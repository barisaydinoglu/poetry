A Song Of Panic
---------------
In the first reel, the angellic daughter  
is fainted by an astronaut. In the second  
reel he returns, to pulse and to perch.  
A current of myriad momentum  
that does not know why it flows and continues.  
When you build  
like heart rejoiced by the lightning.  
The human necklaces faltered a bridge -like coal  
the jugular wets on its listless mare  
waking transluscent sepia necklaces over the area.  
Someone here is waiting for the next cathedral.  
Kis. You attracted yourself for refreshing.  
My natural eye rustles you always.  
  
Outside the banal moonlight evening of chaotic path.  
Only guilt and to a  
son they take on time, too many to count years  
I took on hairy smooth steels.  
The weak lobster makes among the poetic lightnings.  
I wish to make a square  
among, and every abstraction, many  
times hidden in a sea shell.  
Productivity.
