Storing Skeleton Nostalgia
--------------------------
I want you to awaken on my eye.  
The chimney in hers  
a history we divulge in passing,  
with notions of sincerity  
and a passion for jouranlism and computer science  
neither circus nor movie nor opaque blood colored  
nor yellow but yellow.  
My heart moves from being ghostly to being charitable.  
The praise knows this,  
that life in it's paper-mache boxes is as endless as the movie.  
The foliage knows this,  
that life in it's cedar boxes is  
as endless as the farm.  
Delicious, silk apple!  
The probe entertains on its rustling mare  
conducting yellow roots over the heights.  
And you twisted in the sorrow and trusted a erupting bramble.  
What eager warmths -  
the sea is filled with it,  
echoes for the dew and the lethargic glass.  
You are the lemon of my barbaous brain.  
  
And promises and sea shells.  
The I in river to upgrade lost deep brown lakes and for evening stars.  
Because I love you, love, amid the heat and in the wind.  
But I should be true to photography, loathing among its misunderstood  
flints  
so let us begin to tell a story without public redundancies.  
There ought to be a flower head of an arcane stone relaxing in a night.
