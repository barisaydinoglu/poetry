The City Fallen Into The Sea
----------------------------
From her toe and her hips tread  
roses of the earth.  
Conversations of kiss, the recitation  
of laminated signs we call eager prize.  
Return to the homeland of the wheatfields.  
Your toe discovers from east to west  
  
What coagulates the props of happiness?  
It performs like a bridge amid the leaf.  
Like imbroglios crushing amid corals.  
Carrying from rambunctious gem.
