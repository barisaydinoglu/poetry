Since The Beginning
-------------------
The drops exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
next to it in darkness. And you soddened in the animosity and circumscribed an abhorring vortex.  
The stench protects on its careless mare  
appreciating sunburst orange leaves over the boulevard.  
I am hated by lake and viola, by granule and mist.  
You live in the vicinity as in a slender field.  
  
Nothing but your monastic mouth.  
Of a red child that rustles manes.
