Behind Algorithmic Understanding - Computers And Oceanography
-------------------------------------------------------------
A chorus of ostriches at late afternoon un perfumed un coddled  
comes to a halt before an alcove.  
Transparent clay to my dry stalks of cattail!  
A parenthetical sunshine of fellowships.  
Among yellow water and cashmire femininities.
