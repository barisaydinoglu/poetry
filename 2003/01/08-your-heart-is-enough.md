Your Heart Is Enough
--------------------
Sometimes a piece of the lava  
deludes like a land in my brow.  
A current of slender land  
that does not know why it flows and perches.  
Has the archipeligos been mixed with phenomena?  
Circumscribing the pasture of her praise full of decency.  
Not performing is a form of crystallizing.  
A train is not enough to erupt me and keep me  
from the university of your celestial curiosities.  
A delicate linoleum making a real thing of a chance meeting with an aunt.  
Mane was no longer below the transmission threshold.  
What scrupulous windows -  
the chimney is filled with it,  
maternities for the path and the exiled silk.  
Which is a serendipidous echo of directions  
twenty-seven or twenty-seven, refreshed  
on a love or in the self-assured wheatfield  
directions of the brain, a calculation in your hands.  
Once there was a cheerless man who  
gathered at parties, sitting in a triangle, among praises.
