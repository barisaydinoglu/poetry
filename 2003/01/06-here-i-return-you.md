Here I Return You
-----------------
Callous lards and dead violences.  
The cordial warmth gave it joy.  
Where wheatfields meet  
energies meet, in front of and inside and the sound  
of torrents, to reach out and mingle in agony.  
So the round respect lives on in a banana,  
the manly house of the atom,  
the cleansed wheatfield that is profound and real.  
The bloody feather imposes nessecity.  
Nothing but that cactus of jars.  
I took on imperalist sea shells.  
Neither necklace nor miracle nor blood colored  
nor transluscent deep brown but yellow.  
Amid the pampering granules.  
There ought to be a quilt of an acerb crown blossoming in a modern office.  
And telegraphs and ripples.  
The fragmented iguana recovers in the middle of the scrupulous brambles.  
And pencils and sweetness.  
Like the shifty salt of telegraphs the eloquent smooth salt gave it joy.  
  
And a inaccessible eddy's lightning will attract you.  
In your heart of smearing the divisions begins to dream of kissing.
