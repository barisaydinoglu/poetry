The Antenna Has Not Filtered The Promise
----------------------------------------
Pulled out and closed off like a river. Under the forceful moonlight evening of calculating leaf.  
And you breathe like a silence and in your eyelids of fear the sea of aspens circumscribe.  
  
Careless weather, fragmented lights like the lake.  
Here I am, a pure ears silenced in the field of sphere.  
And so that its cadavers will mutate your hand.  
I am overflowed by fellowship and flask, by gate and wind.
