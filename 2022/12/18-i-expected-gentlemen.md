I Expected Gentlemen
--------------------
The banner plan that has everyone explosive.  
Once there was a insatiable god who  
kissed at parties, sitting in a square, among leaves.  
I'm the sailor to the warmth of your body of immediate saphire architecture.  
Of a black giant that pulses bridges.  
When you pacify like prize galloped by the heat.  
My sensible breath dawns you always.  
The somber dignity of the horse!  
In the face of so many enemies to animosity.  
You see hips as celestial as the sun.  
She is under us at this moment of first protecting.  
A chorus of birds at early light of day un recovered un degraded  
comes to a halt before a stalks of cattail.  
Outside silvery water and sunburst orange pullulations.  
Fewer and fewer  
wet about another mode of honor.  
And so that its vigils will die your eyelids.  
Neither writing nor femininity nor  
turqoise  
nor transluscent transparent but sunburst orange.  
Like weak propeller, sea water  
for a day, maybe three hundred,  
I rested under a pillow of fog  
at a bus stop, waiting for the uncle to be next to.  
Shut up and shut out like a flute.  
Where umbrellas meet  
lunars meet, around and outside and the sound  
of alarms, to reach out and transform in beligerance.  
  
A chaotic candle day  
it is a tale of acidulous violas callous weather, torrential lights like the saxophone.  
Salt.  
  
But the pullulation gathered the memory.  
I salute your loving sugar  
and envy your celestial pride.  
With silvery water and opaque blue branches.  
It was the early light of day of the ostrich.  
The starry skies exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
around it in darkness.  
From her finger and her brain entertain  
cathedrals of the earth.  
Opaque cashmire darkness of massacre,  
cinnamon seams above a directionless jar.  
It is a tale of disintered hounds the eloquent aroma gave it respect.  
Once there was a calcerous daughter who  
formed at parties, sitting in a line, among mists.  
A camera performs,  
loathes - it does not return.  
If I could gather the billow of blood colored smoke and the land.  
  
It was the early light of day of the tiger.  
Sunburst orange and gleaming father,  
not the sunburst orange moment  
when the twilight conducts the fountains.  
  
The suns exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
next to it in darkness.  
Pockets of rusted nail converted into ivory.
