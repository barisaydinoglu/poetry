An Equally Slender Sailor
-------------------------
A misunderstood technique penetrates  
even the domestic  
minor universe in technique  
to which the metaphor  
will not be breathed. If you were not the peach the serene moon  
cooks, sprinkling its apple across the land.  
Coagulate me and let  
my substance weave.  
  
Draw from it the disintered  
camera of its own camera.  
My heart is filled with decency like a saphire ribbon.
