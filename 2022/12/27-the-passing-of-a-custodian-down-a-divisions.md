The Passing Of A Custodian Down A Divisions
-------------------------------------------
From her arm and her heart mingle  
ribbons of the earth.  
A dark and sordid nature is fainted in the divisions.  
The equinoctial drop gave it purity.  
Within the yellow fingernails of the mud.  
  
The wreath blushing from my curves.  
I took on putrid aspens.
