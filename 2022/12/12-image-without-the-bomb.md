Image Without The Bomb
----------------------
One public option and with the filtering evils. My delicious hand loves you always.  
Amid the blue nose of the wind.  
A opaque gray and hushed dove is bristled in  
the thicket.  
Your hips stores from west  
to north  
To continue lost love and for hooves.  
Boundless empire. The tetrahedron functions to love an architecture  
to its system.  
Lighthouse.  
A current of serendipidous nature  
that does not know why it flows and sets.  
There ought to be  
a gem architecture of a cosmic fellowship reflecting in a university.
