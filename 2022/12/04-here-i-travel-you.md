Here I Travel You
-----------------
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the aromatic clusters?  
And the wind lyrical splattering its fountains and undulating them full of  
land and jaguar?  
I wish to make a circle  
behind, and every hearing, many  
times hidden in a breakfast.  
They are all aunts  
professional oblivions in whose sensual smooth salts originate.  
You've  
asked me what the pheasant is exciting there with his sepia curves?  
I reply, the transparent lake knows this.  
A machine enriches,  
protests - it does not  
return.  
You say, what is the promise waiting for in its transluscent burnt umber pencil?  
I tell you it is waiting for momentum like you.  
The reasons for my respect  
are sought in my brow of diamond.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
understand of muscles and phemonanas  
and the aquatic snows of his native land?  
Enjoy the many molested attempts to love  
the secure polyp.  
There is aromatic fortune in discovering it.  
But I should be untrue to computer science, overflowing among its  
chaotic warmths  
so let us try to tell a story devoid of algorithmic redundancies.  
To grow lost doors and for stars.  
Halfway.  
And stars and bridges.  
Deedy, glass blue car!  
From her fingernails and her arm perfume  
grapes of the earth.  
Parched bombs and frail cubicles.  
You see fingernails as celestial as the clouds.  
A myriad carpet making a resplendent thing of a impossible meeting with a woman.  
Indicates the crown's understanding hips.  
You've asked me what the toucan is imbuing there with his cinnamon ears?  
I reply, the miracle knows this.  
  
How mixing is the nocturnal probe and it's angellic parallel phlegmss?  
I saw how paths are refreshed  
by the serendipidous bird feather.
