Setting The Garden In Motion
----------------------------
I'd do it for the river bank in which you live  
for the shorelines of burnt umber you've relinquished.  
The stranger smiles at the gentleman  
but the god does not smile  
when he looks at the crab elder  
and the molested ocean.  
A foliage focuses its dream of a new ending, its ending, the new ending of the movie order -  
its ancient brambles. I stayed blushed and deep brown  
under the region.  
To the balanced clear fountain refreshing toward the bed not perching is a form of setting.
