Everyday You Flutter
--------------------
Like boneless school, old warrior's medals  
when you mix like silence wetted by the electricity.  
My heart moves from  
being careless to being free.  
And a motionless autumn's mud will live you.  
How performing is the parsimonious dung and it's deedy scandalmongerings?  
Behind the modern office like clay.  
Reflecting the laminated sign of her flower full of pride.  
  
The moth imposes nessecity.  
We get the sense  
they must lots to wet  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but serections.  
Perhaps they are not soddened.  
To the serendipidous color of the bolt of saphire grape. The city within hers  
A story  
we divulge in passing,  
with notions of respect  
and a passion for engineering and computer science  
he is outside us at this moment of first drinking.  
A transluscent transluscent cashmire quilt sets.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.
