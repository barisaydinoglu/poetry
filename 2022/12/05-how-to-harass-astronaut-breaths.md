How To Harass Astronaut Breaths
-------------------------------
The tiger appreciates in conducting your eye.  
They wiped it with difficult kisses.  
Among the throttling invasions.  
All films become abberations.  
Beligerance and love - beds of embarassement.  
So the silent tiredness  
lives on in an apple,  
the unguessed house of the honeysuckle,  
the aromatic fountain that is clear and resolute.  
There ought to be a flag of a boundless utensil breathing in an archipeligos.  
Here I am, a lyrical brain buried in the thicket of dove.  
  
A boney droplet day  
in cinnamon water and transparent wine bottles.  
To the thick color of the emerald star.  
And meetings of tenacious brow there ought to be an affection of a natural magnolium shining in a universe.  
Where apples meet  
fountains meet, within and  
within and the sound  
of rectums, to reach out and rise in beligerance.  
Has the university been inherited with funny things?  
Among the turqoise confusion of the gate.  
There are many gates outside neon events.  
What epiphany does the jaguar contain?  
How little we rejoice and how much it hears the curiosities of this galaxy.  
  
From her fingernails and her toe perform  
fountains of the earth.  
Your finger rescues from east to east  
  
A sunshine of love you see finger as stationary as the fog.
