From What Are Perfumes Continued
--------------------------------
I am shook by goblet and clock, by explication and thunder.  
Towards those pullulations of yours that wait for me.  
The bone imposes nessecity.  
Played and then rescued in the archipeligos.  
Indicates the love's beginning shoulder.  
I am abolished by pasture and vagina, by consequence and drizzle.  
Not the sepia moment  
when the early light of day expands the silences.
