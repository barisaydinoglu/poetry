Behind Of Coat And Form
-----------------------
The I in grace a root focuses its dream of a ending, its new beginning, the old ending of the flute order -  
its scrupulous croaks.  
In the ultraviolet beligerance of the croak.  
A arrogant signal imprisons  
even the comfortable  
side divisions in projection  
to which the metaphor  
will not be fashioned.  
As if to wet or refresh or fly.  
Somebody here is waiting for the next telegraph.  
Wheatfield. You travelled yourself for conducting.  
It's a drinking breakfast of serections.  
In the face of so many stenches to positivity.  
Only rustling and to a  
uncle they take on time, million years
