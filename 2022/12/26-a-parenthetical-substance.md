A Parenthetical Substance
-------------------------
The field in front of hers  
a tale we divulge in passing,  
with notions of honor  
and a passion for oceanography and oceanography  
but the cactus fashioned the memory.  
Your finger perfumes from north to north  
and you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
wake of foams and ships  
and the parsimonious magnoliums of his native land?  
Shut out and shut out like a cathedral.  
In the first scene, the plumed fisherman  
is shattered by a father. In the second  
scene he returns, to rise and to seize.  
The fluidic propellers flew halfway.  
Love is gone, the subject has promised.  
If you were not the plum the infinite moon  
cooks, sprinkling its lemon across the universe.  
Respect is gone, the subject has discovered.
