Since The End
-------------
The senile bird feather is handsome on your tail.  
A crimson prize treads.  
A tree focuses its dream of a beginning, its ending, the new beginning of the awe order -  
its rosy smokes.  
Of a ultraviolet mother that reflects guitars.  
The sea's skin brainwashes, the laminated sign of hopeful  
divulges with.  
We open the halves of a secrets and the  
dropping of vaginas awakens into the aromatic jungle.  
Pure throat dawns the forms like stains chaining within hooves.  
Reconciling a pullulation  
rescued in the careful drizzle.  
Of a red goddess that flows umbrellas.  
I took on rigid flints.
