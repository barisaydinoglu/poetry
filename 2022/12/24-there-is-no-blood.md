There Is No Blood
-----------------
When the vicinity is full of violenet brain  
outside polyps and burned-out cold beds  
and the clotting paths and the sweetness  
at last give forth their barbaous funeral.  
The I in grape I mix as if around a parched wall.  
One of them is iridescent,  
the other knows details.  
Where is somebody  
he says, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
The tiger plan that has everyone rambunctious.
