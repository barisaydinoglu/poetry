A Song Of Joy
-------------
Come with me to the rotten stump of felicities.  
Thirsty bloods and sifted belts.  
A arm and a toe  
perfuming the land.  
Mourn me and let my substance awaken.  
The imperalist pheasant forms in the electrical vinegars.  
As if to degrade or create or degrade.  
Where silences meet  
laws meet, within and among and the sound  
of acids, to reach out and flutter in animosity.  
The reasons for my respect  
are rescued in my eyeballs of fused quartz.  
Your juice is a smooth brick filled with  
whirlwinds of fragrance of strawberry.  
An odor has  
discovered outside the aroma,  
a mixture of lineage and body, a swimming  
wave that brings anger.  
One  
of them is resolute,  
the other knows techniques.  
Where is nobody  
she quips, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Pure viola performs the honeysuckles which is a electrical sphere of directions  
thousand or thousand, played  
on a starlight or in the cosmic rose  
directions of the tail, a calculation in your noses.  
Here I am, a nocturnal hand devoured in the field of splendor.
