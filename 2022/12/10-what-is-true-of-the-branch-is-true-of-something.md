What Is True Of The Branch Is True Of Something
-----------------------------------------------
There are no twisting lonely roads but bitterest cycles of fountain and blue  
eddies of aquatic muzzled rusted nail. What petrifies the props of happiness?  
The blood-stained flint is original on your ears.  
The sea water transforming from my eyeballs.  
I was without doubt the mother crab  
there in the oily archipeligos.  
When it looked me with its silent tiger eyes  
it had neither foot nor tail  
but bolt of silicon acrobats on its sides.  
Only callous and to a  
aunt they take on time, too many to count years  
Horse.  
You, who is like a cleft elephant among the appreciating of many bride.  
Not the cashmire moment  
when the night kisses the suns.  
A chorus of birds at morning un understood un disguised  
comes to a halt before a school.  
In the middle of the region like ash.  
  
The flame seizes on its bitter mare  
awakening marine trees over the jungle.  
To travel lost laws and for autumns.
