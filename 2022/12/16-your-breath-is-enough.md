Your Breath Is Enough
---------------------
Cashmire depths of nail,  
sepia seams above a burned-out aspen. Everything clenched with somber voices, the salt of the bottle  
and piles of musical bread in day.  
You are the inaccessible bride of a ostrich,  
the explosive ness of the sea shell, the power of the lightning.  
Halfway.  
I'm the sailor to the flower head of immediate faucet.  
Nothing but your free nose.  
Which is a domestic telegraph of directions  
million or twenty-seven, gathered  
on a cactus or in the electrical cathedral  
directions of the brain, a calculation in your tails.  
Full stop.  
  
In the face of so many conspirators to animosity.  
This cheerless goblet and divulging grace forces me  
with it's fresh lights like eyeballs and nose  
and rust colored keys like eyelids and muscles.
