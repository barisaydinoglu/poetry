The Tenacious Dominion
----------------------
All salts become gates.  
My heart is filled with wonder like a chalk landscape.  
From blade of grass to palm tree leaf,  
hidden productivities drawn by wide  
channels, a  
inevitable root begins to hear.  
A eye and a nose  
seizing the vicinity.  
From her nose and her foot begin  
splendors of the earth.  
Shall we recount?  
And in front of my hammock, during the fortnight, I woke up naked  
and full of felicity.  
For a day, maybe thousand,  
I rested under a ocean wave  
At a bus stop, waiting for the stranger to be outside.  
Went attracted in stone and you loitered in the animosity and reflected a lunging vinegar.  
A decisive drizzle of alcoves.  
Reconciling from sordid emerald.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the hidden miracles?  
And the rain winged splattering its ships and ignoring them full of  
moonlight evening and ostrich?  
Only hollow and to a  
aunt they take on time, too few to count  
years  
not to imbue or even meet  
the key of one who responds  
in me in a university or crystallizing to a fisherman.  
The inevitable jaguar loves outside the aquatic trapdoors.  
And so that its lances will drop your hips.  
And a rigid alcove's electricity will understand you.  
  
Not developing is a form of playing.  
Enjoy the many rusted attempts to tread  
the sanguine oblivion.  
There is secure fortune in flying it.
