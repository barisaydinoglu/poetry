What Is True Of The Heart Is True Of Nothing
--------------------------------------------
To seek another land there are many dusts with insufferable events.  
A quadrangle in a loop,  
the harsh workings of romantic law.  
  
In the first take, the dashing mountaineer  
is condemned by a mother. In the second  
scene he returns, to form and to conduct.  
Lived and then seized in the city.  
The reasons for my respect  
are stored in my lip of saphire.
