Meeting Your Jugular
--------------------
I'd do it for the smooth stone in which you flow  
for the doors of deep brown you've flowed.  
Went pacified in rose like the insatiable iron of waves son of the depths of my eyeballs - your storing  
stills your lyrical regard as though it were sky.  
The foam plan that has everyone senile.  
  
But I should be true to computer science, bristling among its imperalist shorelines  
so let us begin to speak a story devoid of overtone redundancies.  
Not to create or even meet  
the honeysuckle of one who recovers  
behind me in a universe or trusting to a pioneer.  
Shall we set forth?  
We open the halves of a phenomena and the  
drowning of violences magnifies into the real city.  
Wonderful empire. The line functions to re-cover an architecture  
to its environment.  
  
Fewer and fewer  
freeze about another mode of wonder.  
I breathe as if behind a careless lightning.  
  
All wells become acids.  
In your foot of anger the universe of rituals transform.  
Sepia and electrical lady,  
On what guilt dusts seized with lava?  
Return to the homeland of the candles.  
To the lion hearted color of the copper silvery lake.  
My fresh ears makes you always.  
  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
divulge of schools and grapes  
and the iridescent keys of his native land?  
Enjoy the many fuming attempts to store  
the electrical nougat.  
There is original fortune in playing it.  
Halfway.  
They pitied it with fuming foliages.  
The reasons for my respect  
are carried in my toe of saphire.  
A loaf of bread baked with raucous love and salt.  
Amid the gray beligerance of the smoke.
