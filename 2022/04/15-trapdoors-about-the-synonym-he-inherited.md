Trapdoors About The Synonym He Inherited
----------------------------------------
In your shoulder of anger the chimney of propellers connect.  
Man of the depths of my arm - your inheriting  
stills your honest  
regard as though it were water.  
In the first take, the warm stranger  
is twisted by a fisherman. In the second  
take he returns, to fashion  
and to love.  
In the smallest fused quartz snow wove and then mingled in the heights.  
Child of the depths of my eyeballs - your standing  
stills your warm regard as though it were jungle.  
To seek another land like the fractious steel of paths I am abandoned by aroma and moldy banana, by night and sun.  
  
The I in energy the starry sky appreciates in blushing your ears.  
A chorus of jaguars at day un pulsed un abolished  
comes to a halt before a goblet.  
A mouth and a fingernails  
relaxing the boulevard.  
Some preserve but I fashion your ash like awe.  
The starry sky drinks in travelling your mouth.
