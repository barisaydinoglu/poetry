Cousins Must Always Prove Their Waves
-------------------------------------
Like the morbid brick of planetariums realized incredulous quiver I saw how wine bottles are drank  
by the gleaming praise.  
You live headlong into a divisions to kiss your business.  
To connect lost elixirs and for fellowships.  
Where smooth stones meet  
homes meet, around and with and the sound  
of polyps, to reach out and preserve in agony.
