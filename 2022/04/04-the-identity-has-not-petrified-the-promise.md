The Identity Has Not Petrified The Promise
------------------------------------------
Giant of the depths of my hips - your dedicating  
stills your delicate regard as though it were lava.  
The heights in front of hers  
a history we speak in passing,  
with notions of pride  
and a passion for jouranlism and jouranlism  
it expands like a flower next to the lighthouse.  
What is this camera but a memory plagued of its natures?  
The insatiable wave that rustles in your coral.  
But I should be true to science, harassing among its tear stained  
bridges  
so let us try to divulge a story devoid of alphabetic redundancies.  
Draw from it the harsh  
production of its own inscription.  
Return to the homeland of the salts.
