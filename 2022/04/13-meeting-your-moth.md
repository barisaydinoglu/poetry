Meeting Your Moth
-----------------
And a molested ripple's jungle will perfume you.  
For a day, maybe million,  
I rested under a pillow of fog  
at a bus stop, waiting for the elder to be within.  
Only ship, just the  
elixir, nothing but  
it. Key.  
This inaccessible pencil and recovering form overflows me  
with it's great shadess of crimson like finger and mouth  
and rust colored fellowships like toe and lunars.  
From ray of sunlight to ray of sunlight,  
hidden silences drawn by poetic channels, a  
burned-out moon begins to seize.  
The child smiles at the mountaineer  
but the daughter does not smile  
when he looks at the elephant woman  
and the insatiable ocean.  
The parenthetical kiss gave it love.  
Arrogant weather, wounded lights like the law.  
A point of view for point of view is the lack thereof.  
And meetings of boney nose your ears fashions from west to south  
  
A chorus of elephants at twilight un pacified un coagulated  
comes to a halt before a stars in the sky.  
For ribbon was frightened and morally neutral.  
The lion hearted dignity of the root!  
What steals the props of joy?  
I want you to develop on my brain.  
Conversations of miracles, the recitation  
of faucets we call enduring landscape.  
There are no shadows but rambunctious cycles of fountain and blue  
keys of silent morose salt.  
The dagger reconciles on its banal mare  
flowing green guitars over the area.  
Went flew in star some fashion but I wake your brick like tryst.
