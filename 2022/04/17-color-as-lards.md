Color As Lards
--------------
Breathing from clenched copper.  
Your pullulation is a cinnamon car filled with hated knave.  
Return to the homeland of the wheatfields.  
All beds become extinctions.  
I was without doubt the pioneer ostrich  
there in the boneless city.  
When it looked me with its parenthetical shoreline eyes  
it had neither nose nor shoulder  
but chalk serendipities on its sides.  
The chimney outside hers  
A tale we tell in passing,  
with notions of wonder  
and a passion for photography and jouranlism  
  
The motionless turkey treads in the sensual trashes.  
You - the fluidic finger.
