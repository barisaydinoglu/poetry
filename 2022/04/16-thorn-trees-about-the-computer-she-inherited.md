Thorn Trees About The Computer She Inherited
--------------------------------------------
The dilute turkey gallops among the unguessed alarms.  
A poetic mist of forests.  
But the foam trod the memory.  
Where pencils meet  
branches meet, around and amid and the sound  
of stenches, to reach out and swim in illusion.  
Under the dead silvery car,  
many crooked rectums.  
Tear stained fishermen and aunts.  
For me they are slightest.  
The winged praises struck what we say awakens to  
live some other giant  
what a inscription may teach.
