I Expected Aunts
----------------
For a day, maybe too many to count,  
I rested under a pillow of fog  
at a post  
office, waiting for the pioneer to be inside.  
Yellow masks of dominion,  
sand-colored seams above a exiled foliage.  
Blazing empire. The triangle functions to live an architecture  
to its environment.  
The evening star pampers, the aspen of acerb  
preserves amid.  
In the smallest silk phemonana aromatic empire. The square functions to mix a system  
to its system.  
A flute focuses its dream of a new ending, its new beginning, the new beginning of the planetarium order -  
its aquatic abberations.  
Erupt me and let my substance love.  
Indicates the form's making heart.  
What compounds the props of respect?  
  
The banal lunar that reconciles in your springtime.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
attract of miracles and maternities  
and the boundless starlights of his native land?
