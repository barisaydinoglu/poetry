Since The Beginning Of Brainwashing
-----------------------------------
I took on atrocious suns.  
You see heart as sensual as the thunder.  
When you promise like tiger gathered by the clay.  
Always you wet through the day  
toward the lunchtime penetrating shadess of green.  
Not to protect or even meet  
the hat of one who flows  
behind me in a modern office or blushing to a father.
