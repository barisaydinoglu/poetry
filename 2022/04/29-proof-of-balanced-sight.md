Proof Of Balanced Sight
-----------------------
And you perform like a wave and the cold fire blushes on its weak mare  
enriching sand-colored homes over the heights.  
And the perfume to its snow  
and among the energies the nocturnal one  
the stranger covered with mineral leaf.  
Return to the homeland of the bird feathers.  
Sometimes a piece of the lava  
devours like a book in my toe.
