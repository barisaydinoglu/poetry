The Study Called The Leg
------------------------
But the necklace lighted the memory.  
Lewd giants and ones.  
For me they are overtone.  
And so that its wounds will reject your brow.  
Putrid weather, ironous lights like the quiver.  
But the old warrior's medal circumscribed the memory.  
There are no vagabonds but blood-stained cycles of warmth and yellow  
forests of spacious neon salt.  
A solute  
rug making a incredulous thing of a unlikely meeting with a custodian.  
It is a tale of hushed vagabonds on what rigid brambles stored with jungle?  
I could understand flask, receptacle, and rectum  
from muscles and pullulations  
with a red gold architecture  
with jackals in my eyeballs.  
Halfway.  
For moon  
was acidulous and morally negative.  
The sensible dignity of the sweetnes!  
To the nocturnal serene sweetnes because I love you, love,  
among the lightning and within the lightning.  
My eloquent eye stores you always.  
  
And around my hammock, during the morning, I woke up naked  
and full of sincerity.  
One of them is resplendent,  
the other knows phenomena.  
Where is nobody  
he cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
  
To upgrade lost poppies and for quivers.  
A current of vertical trouser  
that does not know why it flows and forms.  
  
Burnt umber shadows of shortcut,  
marine seams above a hated circus.
