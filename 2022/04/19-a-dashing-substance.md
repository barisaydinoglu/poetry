A Dashing Substance
-------------------
In the smallest gold starry sky I could begin depth, gate, and noise  
from doves and starlights  
With a gray affection  
with roosters in my hips.  
As soon as the incoming wheatfields  
gives the public indication.  
In your breath of animosity the moonlight evening of ships chirp.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the delicate keys?  
And the rain resplendent splattering its starss in  
the sky and pitying them full of  
university and toucan?  
Friendly, cork grape!
