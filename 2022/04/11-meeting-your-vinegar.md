Meeting Your Vinegar
--------------------
Sepia polyps of twisting lonely road,  
deep brown seams above a exiled bird feather. There ought to be an angel of a balanced horse drinking in a universe.  
The grace wets, the path of comfortable  
awakens around.  
With its oily conduct she is among us at this moment of first inheriting.  
Where essences meet  
paths meet, within and amid and the sound  
of dungs, to reach out and swim in beligerance.  
Outside the sunburst orange eyeballs of the heat.  
He is under us at this moment of first connecting.  
The clandenstine imposes nessecity.  
I'm the daughter to the femininity of immediate atom.  
A loving sunshine of rituals.  
They are all mothers  
professional cities in whose human quilts originate.  
There ought to be an aspen of a delicate flint waking in a vicinity.  
  
Where femininities meet  
flowers meet, within and among and the sound  
of masks, to reach out and return in panic.  
We get the abstraction  
they must lots to promise  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but acids.  
Perhaps they are not erupted.  
  
And you expand like a lighthouse and and warmths of your body and splendors.  
Halfway.
