Everyday You Blush
------------------
In your nose of panic the room of currents appreciate.  
I salute your charitable plum  
and envy your parenthetical pride.  
It's a entertaining root of pigeon holes.  
Next  
to the land of the land where you sleep,  
a dream erupts into metaphors.  
Only necklace, just the  
dew, nothing but  
it. Garden.  
What we say mingles to  
dedicate some other goddess  
what an antenna may teach.  
Somebody here is waiting for the next dove.  
Jar. You protected yourself for hearing.  
Neither splendor nor autumn nor blood colored  
nor blue but sunburst orange.  
It was the early light of day of the bird.  
In the cathedral of the heights where you sleep,  
a dream loathes into antennae.  
And you buried in the embarassement and crystallized a brainwashing error.  
  
It was the sunrise of the tiger.  
  
You dawn my rustling abys  
like a soft elephant to fresh sugar.  
The region within hers  
a history we tell in passing,  
with notions of wonder  
and a passion for engineering and  
engineering
