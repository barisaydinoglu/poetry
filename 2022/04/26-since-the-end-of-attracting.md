Since The End Of Attracting
---------------------------
The lamprey blushes on its fire-tipped mare  
blushing marine  
poppies over the city.  
This smothered fountain and circumscribing cluster mourns me  
with it's  
celestial rituals like eyeballs and brow  
and opaque rust colored mirrors like shoulder and evening stars.  
My soft hand connects you always.  
You, who is like an abys tiger among the dawning of many lady.  
From her mouth and her toe relax  
roots of the earth.  
What parenthetical echoes -  
the boulevard is filled with it,  
honeysuckles for the eddy and the neon ceramic.  
But I should  
be untrue to mountaineering, chaining among its torrential ripples  
so let us begin to tell a story devoid of alphabetic redundancies.  
Among the wiping nails.  
  
Inside the city like broken glass.  
Like melancholy flower head, threads  
you - the friendly  
brain.  
.  
The pioneer smiles at the daughter  
but the mountaineer does not smile  
when he looks at the turkey elder  
and the insatiable ocean.  
Pulsed and then reflected in the chimney.  
Neither magnolium nor mist nor ultraviolet  
nor sand-colored but marine.  
Loathe me and let my substance relax.  
It transforms like a elixir inside the utensil.  
My nocturnal hips gathers you always.
