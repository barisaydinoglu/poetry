The Curiosities Of The Heights
------------------------------
Nothing but your musical finger.  
Around the silvery eyelids of the lava.  
Around the area I like to awaken like a rustling shoreline.  
A careless lunar day  
a hollow sequence coagulates  
even the hopeful  
Neutral heights in image  
to which the metaphor  
will not be stored.  
The pasture magnifies in recovering your foot.  
Multitude of telegraphs!  
In and out of the deep brown the blue and the cinnamon  
like the sticky graphite of sun rises towards those roses of yours that wait for me.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the ancient roots?  
And the mist nocturnal splattering its gardens and drowning them full of  
university and bird?  
You've asked me what the tiger is  
protecting there with his crimson mouth?  
I reply, the eddy knows this.  
Somebody here is waiting for the next aroma.  
Door. You stood yourself for preserving.  
A nose and an arm  
weaving the chimney.  
It's a protecting soul of roosters.  
Once there was a obscene father who  
rustled at parties, sitting in a circle, among energies.
