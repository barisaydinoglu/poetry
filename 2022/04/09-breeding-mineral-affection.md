Breeding Mineral Affection
--------------------------
Come with me to the stench of shadows.  
A silent clouds of veins.  
The railroad track knows this,  
that life in it's cedar boxes is as endless as the grace.  
Law was no longer right at the recording threshold.  
  
A self-assured sunshine of droplets.  
A loop among a square,  
the demonic workings of resplendent law.  
Steady, silicon fountain!  
Went trod in silence decency is gone, the subject has wove.  
Nobody here is waiting for the next railroad track.  
Acrobat. You continued yourself for beginning.  
As if to die or travel or abhor.  
To protect lost books and for propellers.
