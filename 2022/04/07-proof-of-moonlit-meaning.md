Proof Of Moonlit Meaning
------------------------
  
Rustle on the brambles that wait for you  
falling the rotten  
chairs, invading the doors.  
I salute your comfortable  
peach  
and envy your delicate pride.  
The rosy key gave it happiness.  
Like ghostly book, trysts  
I am wiped by warmth and parallel salivas, by night and wind.  
All saxophones become probes.  
Conversations of kiss, the recitation  
of kiss we call unguessed bed.  
Not to relinquish or even meet  
the saxophone of one who performs  
in the middle of me in a boulevard or pacifying to a sailor.
