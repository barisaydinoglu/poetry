A Song Of Happiness
-------------------
Domestic, fused quartz kiss!  
Only flower head, just the  
perfume, nothing but  
it. Tree.  
A quadrangle behind a circle,  
the cheerless workings of velvety law.  
The child smiles at the pioneer  
but the lady does not smile  
when he looks at the squirrel pioneer  
and the whirlwinds of ocean.  
Wayside legumes and forceful dusts.  
Towards those mists of yours that wait for me.  
One individual option and and you love like a maternity and it dedicates  
like an alcove inside the splendor.  
I am  
deprived by jar and coffin, by noise and fog.  
As if to attack or wet or replace.
