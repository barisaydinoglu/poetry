I Have Gone Impaling
--------------------
Not divulging is a form of playing.  
Noone here is waiting for the next snow.  
Angel. You fluttered yourself for pulsing.  
A negligent aspen day  
everybody here is waiting for the next smooth salt.  
Affection. You entertained yourself for circumscribing.  
Not to develop or even meet  
the necklace of one who upgrades  
against me in a boulevard or seeking to a daughter.  
There are many dusts with misunderstood events.  
You are the tomato of my decadent mouth.  
And behind my hammock,  
during the night, I woke up naked  
and full  
of sincerity.  
From uncomfortable turbulence to palm tree leaf,  
hidden autumns drawn by soft channels, a  
fatherless maternity begins to understand.  
  
A chorus of toucans at afternoon un connected un ignored  
comes to a halt before a shoreline.  
I want you to stand on my finger.  
Enjoy the many listless attempts to breathe  
the dashing ego.  
There is essential fortune in exciting it.  
Compound me and let my substance continue.  
In the face of so  
many ashes to animosity.  
For acrobat was morose and morally negative.  
When the chimney is full of dead nose  
outside imbroglios and fragmented tenacious railroad tracks  
and the nauesous old warrior's medals and the stones  
at last give forth their sterile womb.  
I flow as if amid a whirlwinds of billows of dark smoke.  
  
You gather in the modern office as in a fresh modern office.  
Some crystallize but I reflect your ash like window.
