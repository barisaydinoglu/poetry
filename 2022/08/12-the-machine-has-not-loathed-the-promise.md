The Machine Has Not Loathed The Promise
---------------------------------------
Imperalist day and the negligent kiss  
execute at the walls of my house.  
Behind the lonely writing, many blood-stained dungs.  
To the solute color of the gem evening star.  
In the cheerless hat, many calcerous depths.  
  
Fewer and fewer  
twist about another mode of happiness.  
So the arcane love lives on in a grape,  
the friendly house of the film,  
the angellic cactus that is sanguine and comfortable.
