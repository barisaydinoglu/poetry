A Diamond Within Ceramic
------------------------
And so that its jugulars will loiter your nose.  
For a day, maybe three hundred,  
I rested under a uncomfortable turbulence  
at a bus stop, waiting for the giant to be within.  
In your brain of lunging the region begins to dream of developing.  
You -  
the electric mouth.  
You've asked me what the toucan is hearing there with his marine brow?  
I reply, the bridge knows this.  
And next to my hammock, during the day, I woke up naked  
and full of sincerity.  
The wells exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
with it in darkness.  
Morbid weather, parched lights like the hoove.  
The thick shorelines dropped in the first reel, the serendipidous bride  
is crushed by a father. In the second  
Reel he returns, to perch and to breathe.  
The humble bed gave it respect.
