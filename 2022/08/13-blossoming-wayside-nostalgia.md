Blossoming Wayside Nostalgia
----------------------------
In the opaque turqoise  
animosity of the blood.  
Once there was a parched aunt who  
created at parties, sitting in  
a circle, among stars.  
The morose land that  
connects in your kis.  
What phenomena does the squirrel contain?  
How little we drink and how much it continues the mysteries of this computer simulation.  
All defenders become bloody feathers.  
It was a mechanical business of havoc and polyps.  
From her leg and her shoulder mix  
hearts of the earth.
