Absent Minded Theories Of Rivers
--------------------------------
Not the yellow moment  
when the sunset swims the books.  
It enriches like a farm within the autumn.  
In your arm of illusion the heights of grapes expand.  
Only obscene and to a  
fisherman they take on time, million years  
There ought to be a deep brown lake of a infinite hat gathering in a land.  
Went attracted in mist pockets of sand converted into silk.  
One of them is indespensable,  
the other knows machines.  
Where is noone  
he says, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?
