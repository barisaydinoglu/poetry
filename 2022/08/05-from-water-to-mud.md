From Water To Mud
-----------------
Not the green moment  
when the morning makes the juices. Only poppy, just the  
door, nothing but  
it. Movie.  
The pioneer smiles at the pioneer  
but the giant does not smile  
when he looks at the crab goddess  
and the frightened ocean.  
Next to the turqoise sorrow of the polyp.  
The absurd map that swims in your time.  
Everybody here is waiting for  
the next juice.  
Prize. You built yourself for swimming.  
Only sordid and to a  
child they take on time, three hundred years  
ghosts of a rambunctious wheel  
fluttering behind the divisions within a shifty boat,  
promising as a forceful toucan.  
Which is a vertical laminated sign of directions  
Million or million, chirped  
on a maternity or  
in the serene moon  
directions of the lip, a calculation in your noses.
