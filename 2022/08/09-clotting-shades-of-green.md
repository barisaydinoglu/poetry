Clotting Shades Of Green
------------------------
Your tiger is a phemonana filled with  
dead mane. What coagulates the props of wonder?  
Parsimonious, gold precision!  
A wheel is not enough to abduct me and keep me  
from the chimney of your fresh mysteries.  
Window of a mourned windy sweetnes.  
Your leg conducts from south to north  
outside the turqoise panic of the bloody feather.  
Calculating night and the molested sun  
Filter at the walls of my house.  
My heart moves from being hushed to being real.
