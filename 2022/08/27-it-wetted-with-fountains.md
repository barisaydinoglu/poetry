It Wetted With Fountains
------------------------
Because I love you, love, within the heat and inside the electricity.  
Behind marine water and silvery leaves.  
Which is a honest apple of directions  
thousand or twenty-seven, upgraded  
on a bridge or in the enchanting shades of transparent  
directions of the curves, a calculation in your hearts.  
The area within hers  
a tale we tell in passing,  
with notions of decency  
and a passion for science and science  
So the loving joy lives on in a mango,  
the brandishing house of the wave,  
the decisive flower that is essential and handsome.  
When you create like maternity perched by the fire.  
Lion hearted, crystal trouser!  
Like the parched salt of coats the brandishing dignity of the breakfast!  
The earth scrupulous trash barges are faltered.  
Neither propeller nor aspen nor turqoise  
nor yellow but sand-colored.  
Our new form, our manly phemonana  
tetrahedrons.  
The incredulous bride  
awakens in the winged morning.  
In the thirsty film, many morose violences.
