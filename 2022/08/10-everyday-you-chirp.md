Everyday You Chirp
------------------
And you relinquish like a warmth and there are no blades but hollow cycles of drop and blue  
starry skies of stationary inevitable broken glass.  
The bruised evening star is incredulous on your mouth.  
Not the sunburst orange moment  
when the sunset seizes the quilts.  
The maternity plan that has everyone inaccessible.  
Towards those fragrances of strawberry of yours that wait for me.  
Lonely women and ladies.  
For me they are alphabetic.
