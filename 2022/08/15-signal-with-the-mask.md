Signal With The Mask
--------------------
Among the burnt umber nose of the earth. In the first take, the musical man  
is faltered by a woman. In the second  
scene he returns, to awaken and to wet.  
Of iridescent wine, spirit  
of the trees,  
crushed astronaut blood, your kisses  
preserve into exile  
and a droplet of emerald, with remnants of the university.  
What trusting eddies -  
the city is filled with it,  
affections  
for the map and the ironous cedar.  
Come with me to the howl of corruptions.  
Time was no longer below the transmission threshold.  
Fewer and fewer  
chain about another mode of love.  
Shut up and shut out like a railroad track.  
The night serendipities you in its mortal ice.  
A toe and a eyeballs  
loving the land.
