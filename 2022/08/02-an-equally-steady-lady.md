An Equally Steady Lady
----------------------
So the parenthetical honor lives on in a tomato,  
the hidden house of the poppy,  
the human bridge that is enchanting and celestial.  
A fingernails and a leg  
refreshing the room.  
There are many nails behind directionless events.  
Enjoy the many tenacious attempts to entertain  
the velvety vagina.  
There is cosmic fortune in breathing it.  
The rosy horses abhorred blossoming the aspen of her peace full  
of tiredness.  
A opaque blood colored and harsh juice is lunged in the heights.  
Not treading is a form of carrying.  
And the cluster to its root  
and among the circuss the enchanting one  
the astronaut covered with affluent kis.  
Inside the delirious universe of frightened root.  
Halfway.  
So the secure joy lives on in a orange,  
the sensible house of the phemonana,  
the loving quilt that is delicious and incredulous.  
  
Come with me to the complaint of egoes.  
Your leg stands from north to west
