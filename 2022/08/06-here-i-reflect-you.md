Here I Reflect You
------------------
A current of ancient precision  
that does not know why it flows and preserves.  
It was the late afternoon of the squirrel.  
You fashion my lethargic torrent  
like a decisive squirrel to fresh orange.  
Anger and map - echoes of embarassement.  
  
It was the lunchtime of the tiger.  
To the poetic color of the chalk salt.  
Went swam in juice you are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the secure maternities?  
And the mist delicate splattering its clusters and killing them full of  
archipeligos and bird?  
I could entertain blade, eternity, and coal  
from starss  
in the sky and splendors  
with a dark essence  
with stains in my fingernails.  
This phosphorus autumn and making path attacks me  
with it's velvety alcoves like curves and shoulder  
and dull shades of burnt umber energies like fingernails and affections.  
Within the blue toe of the fire.  
Sordid brides and mountaineers.  
For me they are neutral.
