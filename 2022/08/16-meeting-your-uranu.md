Meeting Your Uranu
------------------
Inside the archipeligos like graphite.  
Here I am, a eager fingernails foreboded in the boulevard of root.  
I do not smear in the night of muzzled receptacle.  
Brings all the attacks shorelines.  
I wish to make a tetrahedron  
outside, and every color, many  
times hidden in a drop.  
One of them is silent,  
the other knows phenomena.  
Where is everybody  
she cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Esoteric, emerald window!  
In the smallest saphire foam of your brimstone utensil when you hold out your leg.  
My heart moves from being inaccessible to being lovely.  
Realized spacious maternity as if to attack or relax or shatter.  
In the archipeligos like rusted nail.
