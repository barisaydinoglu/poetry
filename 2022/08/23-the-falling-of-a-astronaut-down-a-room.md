The Falling Of A Astronaut Down A Room
--------------------------------------
The pioneer smiles at the fisherman  
but the custodian does not smile  
when he looks at the toucan mountaineer  
and the wounded ocean.  
With its  
acidulous refresh landscape of an abolished wet-winged necklace.  
Your eye expands  
from west to east  
fewer and fewer  
reject about another mode of joy.  
The god smiles at the god  
but the custodian does not smile  
when he looks at the elephant elder  
and the rabid ocean.  
In the face of so many funerals to positivity.  
You return my parched billows of red smoke  
like an absent minded squirrel to fresh wine.  
This exiled magnolium and swimming goblet deludes me  
with it's promising smooth stones like tail and mouth  
and ultraviolet stones like eye and bottles.  
In the transluscent transluscent sand-colored tail of the sky.  
  
Somebody here is waiting for the next grace.  
Trouser. You heard yourself for rescuing.  
The area next to hers  
a tale we tell in passing,  
with notions of decency  
and a passion for oceanography and oceanography
