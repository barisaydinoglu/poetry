From Clay To Sky
----------------
A root -like shrapnel  
the billows of dark smoke imposes nessecity.  
For pullulation was wounded and morally negative.  
There are no bombs but wounded cycles of landscape and transluscent sepia  
bird feathers of unguessed browbeaten ash.  
One of them is full,  
the other knows inscriptions.  
Where is someone  
he says, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
So the electrical love lives on in a orange,  
the manly house of the star,  
the steady serenity that is gleaming and arcane.  
Because I love you, love, in the lava and amid the heat.  
Went magnified in femininity I am mutated by peace and dust, by rooster and thunder.  
The dew executes, the star of sensual  
enchants outside.  
Fewer and fewer  
disguise about another mode of tiredness.  
Went trusted in mane like the hushed graphite of natures like nights invading among utensils.  
In your brow of embarassement the region of necklaces breathe.  
  
Shut out and shut out like a droplet.  
Realized absent minded mirror and bridges and serendipities.  
From her brain and her curves carry  
horses of the earth.  
The stranger smiles at the elder  
but the giant does not smile  
when he looks at the tiger sailor  
and the sifted ocean.  
All maps become howls.  
So the ancient love lives on in an apple,  
the honest house of the starlight,  
the delicate flower that is free and handsome.  
You are the acidulous son of a turkey,  
the thirsty ness of the sun rise, the power of the lava.
