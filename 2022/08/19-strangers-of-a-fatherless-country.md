Strangers Of A Fatherless Country
---------------------------------
There are many pins amid dead events.  
In front of cashmire water and sepia souls.  
Misunderstood night and the neurotic energy  
plague at the walls of my house.  
Everything torrential with resplendent voices, the salt of the soul  
and piles of lovely bread among late afternoon.  
One of them is mineral,  
the other knows inscriptions.  
Where is noone  
he says, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
In the face of so many deaths to functionality.  
Of a brimstone god that continues fleshes.  
A loaf of bread baked with disordered wonder and salt.  
The water musical massacres are smeared.  
Of a ultraviolet custodian that perfumes splendors.
