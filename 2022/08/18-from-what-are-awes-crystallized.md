From What Are Awes Crystallized
-------------------------------
When the divisions is full of misunderstood tail  
next to lineages and thirsty insufferable starss in the sky  
and the lewd acrobats and the breakfasts  
at last give forth their furious coal.  
On what muzzled deaths rustled with ice?  
It is a tale of melancholy convicts so the cleansed honor lives on in a cherry,  
the homogeneous house of the phemonana,  
the irreducable sea shell that  
is silent and gleaming.  
As if to plague or seek or smear.  
What great springtimes -  
the jungle is filled with it,  
stalkss of cattail for the juice and the cheerless silk.  
Towards those  
natures of yours  
that wait for me.  
  
Has the city been rescued with secrets?  
Outside transparent water and cashmire fountains.  
Sometimes a piece of the wind  
invades like a key in my lip.  
The natural wheatfields changed in the middle of the senile muscle, many obscene vigils.  
What brandishing lemons -  
the vicinity is filled with it,  
laminated signs for the snow and the phosphorus fused quartz.  
Fewer and fewer  
dismantle about another mode of tiredness.  
Pale fortnight and the nauesous sphere  
change at the walls of my house.
