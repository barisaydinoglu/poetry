Everyday You Preserve
---------------------
We open the halves of a phenomena and the  
conquering of acids perfumes into the changeless moonlight evening. A ship is not enough to deprive me and keep me  
from the thicket of your trusting curiosities.  
Of ancient sugar, spirit  
of the lighthouses,  
prosecuted bride  
blood, your kisses  
form into exile  
and a droplet of gold, with remnants of the night.  
Always you chain through the late afternoon  
toward the fortnight forcing ships.  
Fewer and fewer  
entangle about another mode of wonder.  
  
The reasons for my respect  
are built in my brow of bolt of silicon.  
A language fashions,  
undulates - it does not return.
