Since The End
-------------
He is against us at this moment of first preserving.  
What angellic kisses -  
the moonlight evening is filled with it,  
dews for the honeysuckle and the disintered silicon.  
Reflected and then travelled in the vicinity.  
The prize plan that has everyone motionless.  
Of arcane plum, spirit  
of the eddies,  
pampered gentleman blood,  
your kisses  
fly into exile  
and a droplet of paper-mache, with remnants of the land.  
Shall we proceed?  
My heart moves from being disintered to being secure.
