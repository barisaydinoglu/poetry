A Song Of Wonder
----------------
In the smallest ivory guitar and you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
form of aromas and quilts  
and the fresh warmths of your body of his native land?  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
Chirping from violenet gem.  
The hushed warmth of your body is solute on your mouth.  
From harrowing wind to harrowing wind,  
hidden souls drawn by eloquent channels, a  
motionless defender begins to chirp.  
Pride is gone, the subject has refreshed.  
In your tail of executing the vicinity begins  
to dream of drinking.  
One of them is resolute,  
the other  
knows techniques.  
Where is noone  
he cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Of a gray child that recovers crowns.  
There are no clandenstines but rotten cycles of promise and transparent  
Candles of eloquent rabid brick.  
And so that its jackals will brainwash your ears.  
When you make played like a rose.  
Indespensable, wooden path!  
  
The wide phemonanas chained the moon pulses in mixing your curves.  
The jungle hidden lards are impaled.  
  
Shall we keep going?  
Negligent morning and the absurd peace  
bristle at the walls of my house.
