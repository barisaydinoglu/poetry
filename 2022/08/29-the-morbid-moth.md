The Morbid Moth
---------------
Nothing but that flag of flowers.  
The absorbant dignity of the mosaic!  
Where pullulations meet  
affections meet, inside and within and the sound  
of coffins, to reach out and imbue in agony.  
You say, what is the flesh waiting for in its sand-colored ripple?  
I tell you it is waiting for  
fountain like you.  
The time hates, the sea water of boundless  
weaves outside.
