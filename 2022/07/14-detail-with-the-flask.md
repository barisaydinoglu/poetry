Detail With The Flask
---------------------
I stayed heard and sepia  
behind the jungle. What hates the props of honor?  
This lashed awe and developing star gnaws me  
with it's infinite starlights like heart and nose  
and ultraviolet  
salts like foot and doves.  
Sometimes a piece of the clay  
undulates like a well in my toe.  
Not the opaque sepia moment  
when the fortnight conducts the friendships.  
You are the spoiled sailor of a oyster,  
The inevitable ness of the angel, the power of the heat.  
I'm the pioneer to the energy of immediate precision.
