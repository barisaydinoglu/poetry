Every Sailor Is A Point Of View
-------------------------------
The wind aromatic corpses are decayed.  
Always you reject through the sunrise  
toward the day freezing rivers.  
Neither light nor lunar nor ultraviolet  
nor cashmire but burnt umber.  
One minor option and of your turqoise window when you hold out your eyeballs.  
Halfway.  
Because I love you, love, behind the earth and with the clay.  
I took on boneless warmths of your body.  
A brimstone and obscene current is devoured in the universe. I'm the sailor to the trouser of immediate current.  
Return to the homeland of the manes.  
Mother of the depths of my finger - your pulsing  
stills your wonderful regard as though it were wind.  
To the absorbant color of the ivory bird feather.  
Like legumes impaling next to propellers.  
Fewer and fewer  
drop about another mode of happiness.  
All crowns become roosters.
