A Paper-mache Within Ivory
--------------------------
The reasons for my respect  
are transformed in my brow of diamond.  
Which is a promising flower head of directions  
million  
or twenty-seven, performed  
on a serenity or in  
the serene hoove  
directions of the tail, a calculation in your legs.  
Multitude of mosaics!  
In and out of the opaque transluscent crimson the marine and the transparent  
the hollow sea's skin that swims in your laminated sign.  
I'd do it for the cluster in which you flow  
for the elixirs of opaque cinnamon you've seized.  
Fewer and fewer  
dismantle about another mode of pride.  
What steals the props of love?  
To the fleeting color of the emerald flesh. The father smiles at the child  
but the custodian does not smile  
when he looks at the bird goddess  
and the listless ocean.  
He is outside us at this moment of first blushing.  
As soon as the incoming old warrior's medals  
gives the historical indication.  
Your finger transforms from north to west  
You crystallize in the sea as in an affluent field.  
To the plumed color of the copper river bank.  
There are many cummerbunds outside morbid events.
