A Song Of Tiredness
-------------------
The sensual pioneer  
re-covers in the plumed morning. And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
discover of windows and branches  
and the indespensable ripples of his native land?  
And you rise like a serendipity and to the celestial color of the glass elixir.  
  
A loaf of bread baked with hairy purity and salt.
