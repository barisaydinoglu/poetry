I Have Gone Rustling
--------------------
The order of the quivers it  
was the night of the toucan.  
Among the modern office like salt.  
And autumns and circuss.  
As if to execute or blush  
or smear.  
Because I love you, love, among the sky and in front of the sky.  
The whirlwinds of fellowship is secure on your arm.  
Around the rust colored agony of the explication.  
  
Nothing but your domestic toe.  
I'm the son to the grace of immediate miracle.  
  
It was the day of the pheasant.  
The comfortable splendors twisted the divisions around hers  
a history we speak in passing,  
with notions of love  
and a passion for photography and jouranlism
