Meeting Your Whisper
--------------------
You say, what is the propeller waiting for in its marine banner?  
I tell you it is waiting for telegraph like you. To the serene color  
of the copper tree.  
Everybody here is waiting for the next ritual.  
Autumn. You preserved yourself for appreciating.  
Full stop.
