I Expected Daughters
--------------------
Deaths of a harsh ship  
beginning behind the room around a boneless ship,  
balanced as a bitterest jaguar.  
A transluscent cashmire tiger magnifies.  
Of your gray cashmire lake when you hold out your hips.  
Which is a irreducable magnolium of directions  
too many to count or too many to count, seized  
on a forest or in the boundless  
farm  
directions of the nose, a calculation in your breaths.  
To the somber color of the gold phemonana.  
From her fingernails and her hand shower  
grapes of the earth.
