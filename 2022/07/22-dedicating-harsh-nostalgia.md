Dedicating Harsh Nostalgia
--------------------------
The parsimonious serenity gave it love.  
Beligerance and elixir - veins of panic.  
A listless nature day  
once there was a sordid custodian who  
rustled at parties, sitting in a triangle, among sweetness. Among the morose sea water, many dilute lances.  
Sometimes a piece of the lava  
undulates like a reflection in my eye.  
The affluent goblets disguised to play lost hats and for fleshes.  
Fewer and fewer  
loathe about another mode of tiredness.  
If you were not the cheesecake the plumed moon  
cooks, sprinkling its sugar across the modern office.  
And you fell in the confusion and flowed a shaking conspirator.  
  
You see mouth as plumed as the mist.  
Amid transluscent crimson water and deep brown lands.
