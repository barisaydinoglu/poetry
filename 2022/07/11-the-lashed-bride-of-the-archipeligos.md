The Lashed Bride Of The Archipeligos
------------------------------------
In front of the killing cadavers.  
Awakening toward the vein of your dull shades of green autumn when you hold  
out your arm.  
With its phosphorus set the jungle outside hers  
a story we divulge in passing,  
with notions of decency  
and a passion for oceanography and science  
there are no moths but neon cycles of promise and deep brown  
river banks of secure spoiled ash.  
Human  
empire. The tetrahedron functions to develop a system  
to its system.  
A metaphor returns,  
cracks - it does not return.  
  
Come with me to the eternity of flames.  
You see mouth as steady as the thunder.  
With its boneless weave like rotten form, kiss  
burnt umber and spacious pioneer,  
Planetarium.
