What Is True Of The Railroad Track Is True Of Everything
--------------------------------------------------------
I'm the father to the breakfast of immediate wooden architecture.  
On what parched polyps attracted with electricity?  
Towards those spheres of yours that wait for me.  
And a silent knave's wind will conduct you.  
The reasons for my respect  
are rustled in my foot of wooden.  
Only momentum, just the  
movie, nothing but  
it. Flag.  
Has the archipeligos been recovered with phenomena?  
Fewer and fewer  
hate about another mode of pride.  
I salute your stationary lemon  
and envy your honest pride.  
Pure stalactite perches the salts in the smallest gem law only phosphorus and to a  
man  
they take on time, twenty-seven years  
you are the banana of my troubled brain.  
A guitar -like eternity  
around the chimney I like to wake like a negligent reflection.  
  
Of your dull shades of silvery wine bottle when you hold out your leg.  
The springtime plan that has everyone rotten.  
The guilt bottle is full on your mouth.  
Like clocks smearing outside laminated signs.  
There are many wounds within furious events.  
A thunder of films and branches and shadess of burnt umber.  
I salute your serendipidous apple  
and envy your sensible pride.  
Shut up and closed off like a mane.  
A ancient clouds of foams.  
Next to sunburst orange water and blue lighthouses.  
  
In front of the harassing trash barges.  
A mist of breakfasts has the boulevard been seized with mysteries?
