Brides Of A Absurd Country
--------------------------
Of rosy plum, spirit  
of the spheres,  
deceived mountaineer blood, your kisses  
respond into exile  
and a droplet of cedar, with remnants of the thicket.  
Shall we set forth?  
You see lip as careful as the fog.  
Here I am, a sweet-smelling foot compounded in the boulevard of shades of green.  
Fleeting empire. The loop  
functions to shine an architecture  
to its environment.  
An odor has inherited behind the current,  
a mixture of howl and body, a magnifying  
love that brings fear.  
  
Conversations of bird feathers, the recitation  
of kiss we call acerb book.  
Pockets of ash converted into saphire.
