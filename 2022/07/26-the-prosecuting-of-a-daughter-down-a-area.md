The Prosecuting Of A Daughter Down A Area
-----------------------------------------
Shall we move on?  
To the noble color of the silken precision.  
So the natural sincerity lives on in a grape,  
the eager house of the law,  
the silent thread that is clear and homogeneous.  
Mutate me and let my  
substance promise.  
Rescuing from sticky chalk.  
The dry curtain is noble on your finger.  
Towards those quilts of yours that wait for me.  
Full stop.  
Neither echo nor mosaic nor rust colored  
nor silvery but burnt umber.  
  
What fresh lights -  
the vicinity is filled with it,  
writings for the elixir and the burned-out gem.  
We open the halves of a secrets and the  
taunting of brambles dawns into the balanced area.
