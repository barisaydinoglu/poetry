From What Are Momenta Fashioned
-------------------------------
And a barbaous door's clay will relinquish you.  
The rustling sea's skin that shines in your sea shell.  
Pasture.  
The railroad track gathering from my foot.  
The torrential star is monastic on your hips.  
Like shaken lunar, momenta  
you - the changeless curves.  
Among the spoiled foam, many decadent pamphlets.  
When the heights is full of neon leg  
next to legless horses and distorted fractious kiss  
and the atrocious droplets and the books  
at last give forth their hushed conspirator.  
Once there was a barbaous giant who  
sought at parties, sitting in a tetrahedron, among sea shells.  
  
Seeking a river  
flew in the changeless drizzle.
