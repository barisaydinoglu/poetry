Since The End Of Undulating
---------------------------
The violenet toucan reflects inside the lion hearted noises.  
Like ghostly bed, suns  
it was the midnight of the ostrich.  
It's a seeking grace of abyss.  
Grew and then perfumed in the night.  
With the flying lineages.  
Outside the sand-colored finger of the fire.  
With its skeleton gallop only sun rise, just the  
praise, nothing but  
it. Guitar.  
Apple of a stole pale awe.  
Refreshing the breakfast of her muscle full of respect.  
  
It was the sunset of the ostrich.
