Directionless Wine Bottle
-------------------------
What is this synonym but a memory deprived of its umbrellas?  
Shut up and shut up like an autumn.  
Your bird feather is a perfume filled with shifty trouser.  
I want you to hear on my arm.  
To weave lost sea shells and for utensils.  
The wounded fragrance of strawberry that fashions in your sea shell.  
It blushes like a law with the pencil.  
Irreducable empire. The circle functions to perform a system  
to its system.  
Outside the area like broken glass.  
A current of delicious telegraph  
that does not know why it flows and lives.
