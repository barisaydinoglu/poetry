Exciting Wet-winged Nostalgia
-----------------------------
Oblivions of a insatiable vessel  
seizing in front of the vicinity around  
a mourning boat,  
brandishing as a ghostly pheasant. But I should be true to science, killing among its silent forests  
so let us  
attempt to speak a story devoid of minor redundancies.  
It is a tale of nauesous trapdoors in the smallest silk propeller you are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the sensible droplets?  
And the clouds trusting splattering its friendships and rejecting them full of  
field and lobster?  
Pure consequence creates the productivities you've asked me what the squirrel is hearing there with his marine lip?  
I reply, the shades of deep brown knows this.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
recover of homes and trousers  
and the affluent cactuss of his native land?  
A wind of bells from her breath and her ears play  
stones of the earth.  
My silent tail enchants you always.  
It's a playing echo of billows of gray smoke.  
For a day, maybe thousand,  
I rested under a ocean wave  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the elder to be in front of.  
Burnt umber rectums of mask,  
transparent seams above a callous mosaic.  
If you were not the apple the enduring moon  
cooks, sprinkling its cheesecake  
across the room.  
  
A opaque dark and nauesous star is wetted in the heights.  
Wave of wave of rivers rolling down the sea.
