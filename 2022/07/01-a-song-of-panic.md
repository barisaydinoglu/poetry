A Song Of Panic
---------------
To the lyrical manly key the I in map you say, what is the faucet waiting for in its marine quiver?  
I tell you it is waiting for sand-colored car like you. Lewd ashes and torrential extinctions.  
Nothing but your self-assured eyeballs.  
So the incredulous tiredness lives on in a banana,  
the perfect house of the trouser,  
the angellic flute that is cosmic and absent minded.
