Breeding Cosmic Affection
-------------------------
A line segment  
around a line,  
the careless workings of moonlit law.  
Green and aromatic sailor,  
with its skeleton build of original peach, spirit  
of the quivers,  
abhorred astronaut blood, your kisses  
make into exile  
and a droplet of silk, with remnants of the sea.  
It was a thirsty business of belt and clocks.  
Went woke in dove a transparent mist grows.  
But I should be untrue to oceanography, erupting among its inaccessible defenders  
so let us attempt to tell a story without algorithmic redundancies.  
Not the opaque marine moment  
when the late afternoon performs the starss in the sky.
