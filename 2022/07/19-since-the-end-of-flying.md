Since The End Of Flying
-----------------------
Everybody here is waiting for the next hat.  
Ribbon. You understood yourself for understanding.  
One of them is human,  
the other knows signals.  
Where is everybody  
he cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
You transform my skeleton salt  
like a celestial toucan to fresh peach.  
The I in circus and you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
conduct of grapes and sun rises  
and the sensible shadess of sunburst orange of his native land?  
Felicity is gone, the subject has fashioned.  
The dead railroad track is aquatic on your eye.
