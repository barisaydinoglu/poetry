A Lemon
-------
Chirping the ritual of her forest full of respect.  
You transform my molested wax  
like a slender squirrel to fresh wine.  
For a day, maybe million,  
I rested under a ocean wave  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the person to be around.  
Outside the yellow brow of the electricity.  
Wave of wave of coats rolling down the sea.  
Against the motionless heights of rotten cathedral.  
Pure probe appreciates the trysts among the boneless sea of fractious wheatfield.  
Where kisses meet  
propellers meet, among and outside and the sound  
of holes, to reach out and store in illusion.  
In your hand of shattering the universe begins to dream of drinking.  
On what wounded puberties created with lightning?  
You've asked me what the bird is promising there with his opaque sunburst orange ears?  
I reply, the sun rise knows this.  
The reasons for my respect  
are appreciated in my fingernails of ceramic.  
It's a pacifying productivity of nights.  
  
But the tryst carried the memory.  
The sunrise laminated signs you in its mortal water.  
  
Once there was a imperalist woman who  
preserved at parties,  
sitting in a tetrahedron, among books.  
Indicates the sea shell's seizing lip.  
In the first take, the incredulous mountaineer  
is prosecuted by a giant. In the second  
take he returns, to carry and to love.  
The calculating cat protects inside the honest trashes.  
To the smooth color of the silk horse.  
A opaque gray and arrogant shoreline is sobbed in the sea.  
Nothing but your equinoctial leg.
