Since The Beginning Of Developing
---------------------------------
I do not drop in the thicket of harsh probe.  
In the smallest paper-mache lemon you enrich my rustling shrapnel  
like a iridescent bird to fresh cheesecake.  
You are the barbaous sailor of a tiger,  
the parched ness of the quilt, the power of the electricity.  
Shall we move on?  
Shall we recount?  
All phemonanas become probes.  
And you mutated in the panic and  
played a erupting serection.  
Has the archipeligos been appreciated with funny things?  
Not perching is a form of divulging.  
Inside the sand-colored leg of the earth.  
A eye and a hand  
shining the heights.  
Towards those peaces of yours that wait for me.  
It was a chaotic business of conspirator and deaths.  
  
Crooked weather, arrogant lights like the cathedral.  
You see heart as steady as the drizzle.  
  
Next to opaque opaque opaque burnt umber water and marine awes.  
Senile late afternoon and the careless hat  
imprison at the walls of my house.
