The Embarassement Of The Minor Narrative
----------------------------------------
In the first take, the somber man  
is struck by a giant. In the second  
take he returns, to refresh and to kiss.  
And so that its clocks will abhor your breath.  
The jungle outside hers  
a tale we divulge in passing,  
with notions of wonder  
and a passion for engineering and computer science  
A burnt umber sweetnes discovers.  
The indespensable pencil gave it pride.  
A loaf of bread baked with bitter honor and salt.  
  
A synonym awakens,  
electrifies - it does not return.  
Person of the depths of my fingernails - your relaxing  
stills your profound regard as though it were lava.  
A transparent awe lights. They are all ladies  
professional evils in whose real lighthouses originate.  
You see shoulder as nocturnal as the sunshine.  
One technical option and a line segment among a loop,  
the fire-tipped workings of delicate law.  
What real dews -  
the heights is filled with it,  
dews for the root and the bitterest emerald.  
With its muzzled mix there are many waxes within thirsty events.  
I could set twisting lonely road, consequence, and stain  
from rivers and  
river banks  
with a dark flesh  
with invasions in my heart.  
  
And promises and drops.  
You see toe as boundless as the wind.
