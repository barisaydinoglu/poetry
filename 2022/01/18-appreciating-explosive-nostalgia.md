Appreciating Explosive Nostalgia
--------------------------------
As if to delude or  
carry or invade. A calculation for camera is the lack thereof.  
A chorus of birds at lunchtime un gathered  
un bristled  
comes to a halt before a current.  
  
Wave of wave of poppies rolling down the sea.  
Noone here is waiting for the next  
femininity.  
Springtime. You stored yourself for blushing.
