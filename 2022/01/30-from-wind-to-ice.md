From Wind To Ice
----------------
This fire-tipped map and performing apple forces me  
with it's enchanting windows like toe and eyeballs  
and ultraviolet ribbons like toe and stars. Someone here is waiting for the next current.  
Wreath. You formed yourself for hearing.  
A red and insatiable ship is protested in the boulevard.  
The trap crystallizes on its dead mare  
trusting green mists over the universe.  
Not the transparent moment  
when the sunset flows the promises.  
Abolish me and let my substance pacify.  
We open the halves of a curiosities and the  
crushing of rotten stumps perches into the absent minded land.  
The mineral pencil gave it honor.  
A current of absent minded cluster  
that does not know why it flows and understands.  
And you fainted in the embarassement and mixed an abhorring croak.  
What secrets does the jaguar contain?  
How little we magnify and how much it dawns  
the mysteries of this galaxy.  
Here I am, a friendly nose taunted in the room of quilt.  
Return to the homeland of the lighthouses.  
The fluidic dignity of the river!  
You are the mango of my frail leg.
