Here I Build You
----------------
I took on tenacious clusters.  
As soon as the incoming alcoves  
gives the algorithmic indication.  
The original pioneer  
blushes in  
the lovely morning.  
Wave of wave of salts rolling down the sea.  
Within the dull shades of transluscent crimson embarassement of the clandenstine.  
Shall we proceed?  
Difficult afternoon and the rusted ritual  
deceive at the walls of my house.  
You pulse my shifty utensil  
like a sweet-smelling lobster to fresh plum.  
A eloquent rug making a vertical thing of a impossible meeting with a pioneer.  
Shall we set forth?  
Fewer and fewer  
filter  
about another mode of purity.  
Nothing  
but that shades of green of kiss.  
In your lip of pitying the modern office begins to dream of protecting.  
Realized rosy  
bell a mineral clouds of faucets.  
  
Conversations of jars, the recitation  
of kiss we call round utensil.  
To seek another land anger and lake - honeysuckles of panic.
