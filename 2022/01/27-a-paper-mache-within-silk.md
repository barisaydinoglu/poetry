A Paper-mache Within Silk
-------------------------
A hushed inscription falls  
even the verdure  
aerial archipeligos in synonym  
to which the metaphor  
will not be crystallized.  
The warmth of your body degrades, the apple of lyrical  
perfumes among.  
The alcove begins in relinquishing your arm.  
The mineral defender gave it happiness.  
The neon crab pulses under the acerb cubicles.  
I do not penetrate in the heights of silent cubicle.  
  
With its difficult respond a secure rug making a resolute thing of a probable meeting with a god.  
I stayed attracted and burnt umber  
in the sea.  
Fashioning from acidulous silicon.  
In your eyelids of illusion the land of souls crystallize.  
  
From ray of sunlight to ray of sunlight,  
hidden fleshes drawn by resplendent channels, a  
sticky key begins to preserve.
