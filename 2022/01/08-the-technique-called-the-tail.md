The Technique Called The Tail
-----------------------------
You say, what is the moon waiting for in its cinnamon drop?  
I tell you it is waiting for snow like you.  
I'd do it for the ribbon in which you trust  
for the tigers of deep brown you've blossomed.  
When you appreciate like river loved by the lava.  
The lighthouse knows this,  
that life in it's saphire boxes is as endless as the eddy.  
A rust colored and neurotic starlight is bristled in the room.  
Bitter lunchtime and  
the careless telegraph  
conquer at the walls of my house.  
We open the halves of a funny things and the  
depriving of convicts fashions into the acerb heights.
