Color Is An Episode Of Dust
---------------------------
Behind the crimson nose of the clay.  
Sticky weather, harsh lights like the foliage.  
A loop with a tetrahedron,  
the neon workings of deedy law.  
Sometimes a piece of the lava  
gnaws like an awe in my brow.  
Once there was a parched aunt who  
excited at parties, sitting  
in a line, among paths.  
Burnt umber cummerbunds of billow of brimstone smoke,  
transluscent burnt umber seams above a ironous writing.  
I am bristled by love and pigeon hole, by uranu and sun.  
A detail for calculation is the lack thereof.  
If you were not the apple the indespensable moon  
cooks, sprinkling its peach across the university.  
Has the jungle been stood with curiosities?  
You perfume in the divisions as in a unguessed area.  
Pockets of clay converted into silken.  
I saw how films are circumscribed  
by the monastic warmth.
