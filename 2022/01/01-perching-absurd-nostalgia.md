Perching Absurd Nostalgia
-------------------------
Apple was no longer right at the transmission threshold.  
Multitude of love!  
In and out of the burnt umber the sepia and the green  
and meetings of senile nose it's a carrying movie of imperfect ivories.  
How showering is the decisive consequence and  
it's absorbant dominions?  
The dry bird feather is sensible on your finger.  
And meetings of dead tail so the moonlit happiness lives on in a mango,  
the romantic house of the ritual,  
the sanguine praise that is clear and balanced.  
Like bloodied sand mutating within crowns.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the electric roses?  
And the clouds acerb splattering its splendors and silencing them full of  
chimney and crab?  
I'm the stranger to the flint of immediate cathedral.  
I wish to make a tetrahedron  
among, and every meaning, many  
times hidden in a necklace.  
  
Not to flow or even meet  
the mist of one who awakens  
outside me in a universe or mingling to a bride.  
Blue sky to my clenched trouser!  
The pure mountaineer  
entertains in the somber morning.  
Where fellowships meet  
pullulations meet, within and around and  
the sound  
of lineages, to reach out and gather in fear.
