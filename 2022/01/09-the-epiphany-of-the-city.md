The Epiphany Of The City
------------------------
What wonderful silences -  
the land is filled with it,  
jars for the prize and the explosive diamond. I saw how natures are recovered  
by the changeless starlight.  
Love is gone, the subject has reflected.  
The affluent dignity of the friendship!  
In your hips of agony the land of reflections magnify.
