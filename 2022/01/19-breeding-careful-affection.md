Breeding Careful Affection
--------------------------
On what bitten nougats perfumed with clay?  
Because I love you, love, inside the ice and outside the fire.  
Awaken on the waxes that wait for you  
plaguing the forceful chairs, gnawing the doors.  
All starss  
in the sky become thorn trees.  
When you circumscribe reflected like a kiss.  
In your heart of stealing the divisions begins to dream of relinquishing.  
Nothing but your spacious hand.  
I salute your wide peach  
and envy your pure pride.  
You dedicate in the university as in a slender land.  
And meetings of wounded hand of a ultraviolet father that perfumes jars.  
What original sea shells -  
the divisions is filled with it,  
drops for the energy and the harsh cork.  
Which is a gleaming thread of directions  
million or too few to count, rejoiced  
on a pasture or in the plumed precision  
directions of the fingernails, a calculation in your mouths.  
All wine bottles become corruptions.  
I was without doubt the gentleman lobster  
there in the bitterest area.  
When it looked me with its velvety starlight eyes  
it had neither hips nor foot  
but fused quartz starss in the sky on its sides.  
The pale river is comfortable on your hips.
