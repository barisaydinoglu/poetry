It Lighted With Kisses
----------------------
A brimstone and blood-stained horse is executed in the field.  
There ought to be an awe of a comfortable marine lake reconciling in a universe.  
One of them is romantic,  
the other knows images.  
Where is nobody  
he says, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Silvery bloodied steels of conspirator,  
transluscent sand-colored seams above a fragmented friendship.  
One of them is mineral,  
the other knows antennae.  
Where is nobody  
She cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Beligerance and aspen - starss in  
the sky of confusion.  
  
What trembles the props of wonder?  
A sun of forests of enduring apple, spirit  
of the affections,  
hated lady blood, your kisses  
blush into exile  
and a droplet of ceramic, with remnants of the land.
