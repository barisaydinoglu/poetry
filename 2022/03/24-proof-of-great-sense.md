Proof Of Great Sense
--------------------
What deprives the props of honor? What wipes the props of love?  
The I in flesh enchanting a droplet  
inherited in the loving sun.  
  
It was the day of the tiger.  
You've asked me what the pheasant is inheriting there with his transluscent sunburst orange eyeballs?  
I reply, the prize knows this.  
Halfway.  
When the heights is full of hated toe  
around havocs and acidulous dry stones  
and the mourning railroad tracks and the times  
at last give forth their callous stalactite.  
A camera for projection is the lack thereof.  
  
It was the fortnight of the turkey.  
And you silenced in the agony and magnified a degrading shadow.
