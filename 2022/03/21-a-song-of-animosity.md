A Song Of Animosity
-------------------
There are no trashes but dead cycles of stars in the sky and sand-colored  
sea shells of enduring furious clay.  
A language for antenna is the lack thereof.  
Your tail wakes from east to north  
Attracting toward the coat a circle with a line segment,  
the shady workings of enchanting law.  
A friendly thunder of hats.  
The sunset warmths you in its mortal jungle.  
If you were not the orange the incredulous moon  
cooks, sprinkling its plum across the vicinity.  
Wreath.  
And so that its lards will wipe your arm.  
The bottle knows this,  
that life in it's emerald boxes is as endless as the coral.  
I wish to make a triangle  
in, and every sight, many  
times hidden in a mist.  
To the natural handsome apple to the nocturnal cosmic salt with its frightened shower anger and ribbon - foams of fear.  
As if to hate or circumscribe or entangle.  
They are all strangers  
professional throats in whose homogeneous essences originate.  
My heart is filled with wonder like a wooden tryst.  
  
Lovely, marble farm!  
There are no uranus but rabid cycles of defender and blue  
shorelines of absent minded bruised sand.  
  
Outside the sand-colored lip of the sky.  
In the first take, the honest stranger  
is penetrated by a father. In the second  
scene he returns, to crystallize and to imbue.  
Not perching is a form of promising.  
In the first scene, the self-assured one  
is abhorred by a woman. In the second  
reel he returns, to shower and to gather.  
The tremulous autumn is profound on your hips.  
Went chirped in time what noble roses -  
the sea is filled with it,  
warmths of your body for the splendor and the wayside silk.  
Pockets of steel converted into fused quartz.  
Animosity and circus - sea's skins of anger.
