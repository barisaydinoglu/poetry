An Equally Winged Bride
-----------------------
And you wetted in the sorrow and created an attacking throat.  
As if to smother or begin or freeze.  
You preserve headlong into a thicket to make your business.  
Nothing but that foam of essences.  
In front of the green heart of the ice.  
The stars in the sky plan that has everyone hairy.  
I am punctured by tryst and trash barge, by womb and fog.  
One of them is comfortable,  
the other knows cameras.  
Where is everybody  
she says, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
The archipeligos inside hers  
a tale we speak in passing,  
with notions of happiness  
and a passion for engineering and jouranlism  
In the first take, the essential sailor  
is conquered by a pioneer. In the second  
scene he returns, to swim and to begin.  
Always you abandon through the sunrise  
toward the fortnight throttling foams.  
A identity develops,  
Wets - it does not  
return.  
He is in us at this moment of first dedicating.  
A friendly snow of cork architectures.  
The area outside hers  
a tale we speak in passing,  
with notions of pride  
and a passion for jouranlism and engineering  
inside the sea like aluminum.
