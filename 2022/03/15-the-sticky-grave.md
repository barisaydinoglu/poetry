The Sticky Grave
----------------
And a rigid well's lightning will stand you.  
Phemonana was no longer below the transmission threshold.  
Your toe loves from east to east  
in the blue curves of the ice.  
Stranger of the depths of my hand - your recovering  
stills your decisive regard as though it were clay.  
Conversations of ripples, the recitation  
of foams we call electric ribbon.
