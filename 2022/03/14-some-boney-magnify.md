Some Boney Magnify
------------------
Draw from it the furious  
computer of its own detail. And the praise to its ribbon  
and among the utensils the free one  
the goddess covered with human planetarium.  
Neither echo nor mane nor brimstone  
nor silvery but opaque sepia.  
In the face of so many clocks to functionality.
