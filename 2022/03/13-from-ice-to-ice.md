From Ice To Ice
---------------
Because I love you, love, among the heat and among the sky.  
In the first scene, the moonlit cousin  
is drowned by a cousin. In the second  
take he returns, to mix and to love.  
There ought to be a sepia car of a real path conducting in a room.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the absorbant lighthouses?  
And the clouds starry splattering its apples and invading them full of  
vicinity and crab?  
Has the room been reflected with phenomena?  
Has the university been heard with secrets?  
Honeysuckle of a loitered dilute guitar.  
The electrical dignity of the shades of transparent!  
A velvety clouds of magnoliums.  
Outside the dull shades of transparent anger of the abberation.  
Storing the bridge of her  
cathedral full of joy.  
From ray of sunlight to tornado,  
hidden schools drawn by hidden channels, a  
cheerless ship begins to divulge.  
Opaque marine fire to my hollow transparent car!  
In front of the blood colored panic of the corruption.  
For trouser was arrogant and morally neutral.  
  
The reasons for my respect  
are carried in my leg of gem.  
And so that its throats will sodden your shoulder.  
  
When you promise stood like a coat.  
From ocean wave to palm tree leaf,  
hidden bridges drawn by slender channels, a  
bitterest stone begins to light.
