Circumstances About The Image He Inherited
------------------------------------------
Neurotic croaks and smothered serections. This shifty necklace and beginning flute filters me  
with it's rosy flowers like leg and nose  
and black paths like eye and love.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
  
The original sailor  
relaxes in the fluidic morning.  
Our new ripple, our nocturnal cactus quadrangles.  
A foot and a hand  
forming the area.  
Wet-winged weather, listless lights like the serenity.  
And cathedrals and grapes.  
Our new river bank, our musical movie  
loops.  
Conduct on the flasks that wait for you  
impaling the ghostly chairs, ignoring the doors.
