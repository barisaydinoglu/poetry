Nothing but that promise of propellers.  
There are many massacres around guilt events.  
Fluidic empire. The loop functions to flow an architecture  
to its architecture.  
From her arm and her foot blossom  
leaves of the earth.  
They twisted it with mechanical echoes.  
Your tail blossoms  
from west to west  
in the face of so many cities to functionality.  
You say, what is the sun waiting for in its cinnamon angel?  
I tell you it is waiting for stars in the sky like you.  
  
Conversations of flower  
heads, the recitation  
of breakfasts we call stationary quiver.  
Of your dark magnolium when you hold out your tail.
