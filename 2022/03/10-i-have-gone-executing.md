I Have Gone Executing
---------------------
On what callous whispers made with electricity?  
The room around hers  
a history we divulge in passing,  
with notions of respect  
and a passion for mountaineering and  
mountaineering  
he is behind us at this moment of first relinquishing.  
The land knows this,  
that life in it's cork boxes is as endless as the springtime.  
The lemon performing from my lip.  
Ghostly sailors and men.  
For me they are public.  
Dew.
