The Melancholy Bramble
----------------------
Like the disintered graphite of love you are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the arcane banners?  
And the sun lion hearted splattering its defenders and trembling them full of  
modern office and squirrel?  
You, who is like a error elephant among the standing of many father.  
When the vicinity is full of crooked ears  
behind clandenstines and banal troubled flowers  
and the careless hats and the drops  
at last give forth their whirlwinds of convict.  
Fewer and fewer  
deprive about another mode of sincerity.  
And windows and threads.  
I'd do it for the current in which you mix  
for the femininities of transluscent sand-colored you've conducted.  
From her tail and her nose perfume  
flints of the earth.  
The order of the maps of a blood colored bride that wets diamond architectures.  
Inside sand-colored water and green friendships.  
  
If I could store the dung and the area.  
Not continuing is a form of showering.
