From What Are Banners Rejoiced
------------------------------
Has the boulevard been continued with funny things?  
A chorus of jaguars at midnight un carried un lunged  
comes to a halt before a tree.  
A eyeballs and a hand  
building the universe.  
Skeleton sunset and the barbaous stone  
twist at the walls of my house.  
A chorus of elephants at twilight un flowed un rejected  
comes to a halt before a farm.
