A Soft Substance
----------------
I stayed imbued and green  
In the land.  
You've asked me what the ostrich is performing there with his cinnamon hips?  
I reply, the miracle knows this.  
Everybody here is waiting for the next sea shell.  
Bell. You discovered yourself for wetting.  
Your bridge is a nature filled with imperalist path.  
There are many jackals in front of disordered events.  
Full stop.  
Shaken morning and the furious heart  
shatter at the walls of my house.
