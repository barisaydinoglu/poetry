Pioneers Of A Absurd Country
----------------------------
It's a seizing angel of acids.  
I  
wish to make a quadrangle  
behind, and every sight, many  
times hidden in a banner.  
And a hollow farm's electricity will respond you.  
Your leg understands from west to north  
The boundless dignity of the rose!  
You awaken in the night as in a musical field.
