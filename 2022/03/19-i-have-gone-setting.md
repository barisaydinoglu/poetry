I Have Gone Setting
-------------------
From ray of sunlight to ray of sunlight,  
hidden maps drawn by enduring channels, a  
delirious foam begins to promise.  
If you were not the apple the musical moon  
cooks, sprinkling its nectarine across the boulevard.  
What is this synonym but a memory harassed of its movies?  
When the university is full of bitten breath  
amid hounds and hushed boney maternities  
and the difficult rituals and the pullulations  
at last give forth their rabid rectum.  
Conversations of promises, the recitation  
of doors we call balanced eddy.  
Noone here is waiting for the next bed.  
Law. You mingled yourself for enriching.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
An odor has rustled among the fellowship,  
a mixture of bloody feather and body, a chirping  
lake that brings anger.  
They loathed it with dead starss in the sky.  
  
Not refreshing is a form of wetting.  
The slender son  
lives in the eloquent morning.  
From her brow and her hand refresh  
femininities of the earth.  
Pacifying the river of her flesh  
full of wonder.
