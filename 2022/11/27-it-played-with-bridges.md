It Played With Bridges
----------------------
Blood-stained extinctions and senile imbroglios.  
A smooth stone -like throat  
to seek another land like putrid mist, bottles  
so the moonlit sincerity lives on in a orange,  
the lyrical house of the grace,  
the myriad lake that is boundless and lion hearted.  
Shall we keep going?  
You say, what is the wine bottle waiting for in its cinnamon drop?  
I tell you it is waiting for mist like you.  
  
The goblet  
trusting from my heart.  
Cordial empire. The line functions to tread a environment  
to its architecture.
