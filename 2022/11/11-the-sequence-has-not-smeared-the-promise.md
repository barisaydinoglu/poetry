The Sequence Has Not Smeared The Promise
----------------------------------------
Purity is gone,  
the subject has enchanted.  
Next to the abducting pigeon holes.  
You - the promising eyelids.  
From harrowing wind to tornado,  
hidden miracles drawn by enduring channels, a  
pale telegraph begins to divulge.  
A moon -like conglomerate  
what is this synonym but a memory killed of its wells?  
Someone here is waiting for the next fragrance of strawberry.  
Warmth. You travelled yourself for mixing.  
Of delicate cheesecake, spirit  
of the emerald architectures,  
imprisoned person blood, your kisses  
rustle into exile  
and a droplet of saphire, with remnants of the modern office.
