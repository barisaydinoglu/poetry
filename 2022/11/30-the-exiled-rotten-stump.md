The Exiled Rotten Stump
-----------------------
The calcerous wreath is loving on your heart.  
Pockets of steel converted into crystal.  
From unrelenting rain to harrowing wind,  
hidden propellers drawn by indespensable channels, a  
crooked light begins to perch.  
You see brow as delicate as the sun.  
It was a silent business of dagger and nights.  
I'd do it for the breakfast in which you shower  
for the love of opaque green you've gathered.  
Pockets of broken glass converted into bolt of silk.  
Only bell, just the  
sphere, nothing but  
it. Lemon.  
All springtimes become havocs.  
Next to the kiss of the night where you sleep,  
a dream drowns into images.  
In the chimney like salt.
