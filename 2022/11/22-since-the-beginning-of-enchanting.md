Since The Beginning Of Enchanting
---------------------------------
What brainwashes the props of joy? Nothing but your decisive brow.  
And outside my hammock, during the midnight, I woke up naked  
and full of decency.  
  
All flower heads become deaths.  
It's a returning magnolium of holes.  
Of your rust colored door when you hold out your leg.  
Marine sky to my hollow light!  
And you faltered in the illusion and dedicated a condemning violence.  
Sometimes a piece of the wind  
disguises like a snow in  
my shoulder.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
fashion of propellers and magnoliums  
and the angellic horses of his native land?  
From blade of grass to uncomfortable turbulence,  
hidden circuss drawn by handsome channels, a  
chaotic fountain begins to fashion.  
The I in soul you, who is like a billow of blood colored smoke ostrich among the flying of many one.  
Inside the turqoise fear of the trash barge.  
If I could play the explication and the boulevard.  
It's a perfuming pencil of wounds.  
  
Closed off and closed off like a stone.  
I saw how  
necklaces are returned  
by the equinoctial smooth ash.  
  
Everybody here is waiting for the next telegraph.  
Transluscent transluscent blue car. You dawned yourself for swimming.  
Pride is gone, the subject has showered.
