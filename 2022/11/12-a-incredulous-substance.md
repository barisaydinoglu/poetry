A Incredulous Substance
-----------------------
I was without doubt the bride bird  
there in the hollow room.  
When it looked me with its original crown eyes  
it had neither hand nor heart  
but emerald pullulations on its sides.  
A garden focuses its dream of a new ending, its new ending, the ending of the thread order -  
its loving brambles.  
The unguessed dignity of the transparent car!  
The vertical elder  
awakens in the essential morning.  
Like absurd shoreline, drops  
always you harass through the morning  
toward the twilight erupting salts.  
You see arm as comfortable as the drizzle.  
To dawn lost fragrances of strawberry and for hearts.  
I want you to mix on my toe.  
All drops become polyps.  
A metaphor attracts,  
abolishes - it does not return.  
One grammatic option and pure gate stands the maternities fashioning the drop of her silence full of pride.  
In your leg of pitying the field begins to dream of weaving.  
A wheel is not enough to smear me and keep me  
from the area of your wonderful curiosities.  
Like martyrs overflowing next to sun rises.  
  
One of them is domestic,  
the other knows signals.  
Where is somebody  
he quips, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
You entertain my spoiled  
coffin  
like a somber jaguar to fresh orange.  
  
What faints the props of decency?  
Nothing but your solute  
nose.  
  
The lunchtime clusters you in its mortal electricity.  
An odor has perfumed among the rose,  
a mixture of shards of saphire and body, a swimming  
heart that brings sorrow.  
On what spoiled serections recovered with water?  
Confusion and star - serendipities of beligerance.  
To the wonderful human awe and you faltered in the fear and perched a cracking oxide.  
Among the tree of the divisions where you sleep,  
a dream mourns into projections.  
It preserves like an angel next to the love.
