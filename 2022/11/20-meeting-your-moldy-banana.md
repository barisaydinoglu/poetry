Meeting Your Moldy Banana
-------------------------
Everything shady with self-assured voices, the salt of the flint  
and piles of noble bread in front of afternoon.  
Like flames mourning next to peaces.  
Aquatic, ceramic  
snow!  
Wave of wave of serendipities rolling down the sea.  
Like careless heart, sweetness  
not forming is a form of awakening.
