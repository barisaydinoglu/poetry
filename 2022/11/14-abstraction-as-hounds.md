Abstraction As Hounds
---------------------
The bleak tiger imbues outside the trusting puberties.  
The ironous jaguar flows among the celestial whispers.  
There are no brambles but acidulous cycles of well and silvery  
river banks of affluent morbid aluminum.  
Sunburst orange abberations of seperation,  
transparent seams above a putrid magnolium.  
It is a tale of dry flames it is a tale of calcerous nails you - the infinite eyelids.  
I salute your stationary cheesecake  
and envy your nocturnal pride.  
Only torrential and to a  
person they take on time, three hundred years  
I wish to make a tetrahedron  
in, and every faith, many  
times hidden in an aroma.  
They are all strangers  
professional lampreys in whose verdure bells originate.  
Come with me to the mask of walls.  
The dashing  
drops protested a perfume developing will light  
the absurd water of a planet.  
Somebody here is waiting for the next curtain.  
Affection. You returned yourself for playing.  
  
Always you replace through the early light of day  
toward the sunrise faltering laws.  
You see heart as original as the fog.  
  
In the first scene, the rosy sailor  
is pitied by a bride. In the second  
take he returns, to create and to develop.  
I salute your loving nectarine  
and envy your naked pride.
