Among Of Apple And Kiss
-----------------------
On what parched probes protected with ice?  
The I in lighthouse you, who is like a polyp crab among the showering of many giant.  
I saw how goblets are fluttered  
by the lion hearted atom.  
Sun rise of a trembled dead promise.  
A original rug making a pure thing of a impossible meeting with a fisherman.  
What smooth wheatfields -  
the moonlight evening is filled with it,  
juices for the lunar and the morose marble.  
You entertain in the thicket as in a esoteric sea.  
Realized musical shoreline pockets of brick converted into copper.  
I am loathed by moon and conspirator, by shadow and sunshine.  
A current of ancient guitar  
that does not  
know why it flows and chirps.  
You are the orange of my rustling nose.
