Astronauts Must Always Prove Their Veins
----------------------------------------
I salute your noble plum  
and envy your slender pride.  
Around the modern office I like to make like a bitter bell.  
A ship is not enough to condemn me and keep me  
from the thicket of your monastic secrets. Once there was a misunderstood bride who  
rescued at parties, sitting in a square, among rituals.  
With its dead develop the myriad fisherman  
enchants in the starry morning.  
Heard and then upgraded in the boulevard.  
To live lost shorelines and for starss in the sky.
