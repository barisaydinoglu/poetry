From What Are Ribbons Lighted
-----------------------------
Pure coal forms the defenders I stayed rejoiced and silvery  
behind the night.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
respond of autumns and moons  
and the blazing alcoves of his native land?  
Salt of a plagued troubled leaf.  
Neither bell nor utensil nor dark  
nor silvery but sand-colored.  
Wave of wave of dews rolling down the sea.  
Everything brutal with vertical voices, the salt of the key  
and piles of scrupulous bread amid fortnight.  
To the soft color of the paper-mache map.
