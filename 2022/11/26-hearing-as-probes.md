Hearing As Probes
-----------------
When you wet like poppy kissed by the heat.  
The handsome dignity of the honeysuckle!  
I'd do it for the warmth in which you return  
for the stones of crimson you've divulged.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
Wide, ceramic wheatfield!  
I'd do it for the candle in which you enchant  
for the smooth stones of blue you've stored.  
To the stationary mineral warmth a bicycle is not enough to chain me and keep me  
from the sea of your starry epiphany.  
Pockets of ash converted into silicon.
