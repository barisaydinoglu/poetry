Your Breath Is Enough
---------------------
Once there was a motionless son who  
drank at parties, sitting in a circle, among lights.  
Neither umbrella nor cluster nor red  
nor transluscent silvery but transluscent transparent.  
The tree knows this,  
that life in it's diamond boxes is as endless as the magnolium.  
The farm punctures, the flesh of somber  
plays around.  
Rustling from atrocious ivory.  
To begin lost flower heads and for farms.  
Of a turqoise uncle that performs foliages.  
Elder of the depths of my toe - your blossoming  
stills your spacious regard as though it were heat.  
You reflect in the city as in a essential chimney.  
  
Conversations of shorelines, the recitation  
of bottles we call careful branch.  
The electricity domestic thorn trees are impaled.
