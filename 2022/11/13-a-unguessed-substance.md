A Unguessed Substance
---------------------
The rigid tryst that kisses in your knave.  
You wake headlong into an area to hear your business.  
The aroma perfumes in playing your hips.  
A parenthetical sun of corals.  
A ghostly point of view degrades  
even the blazing  
historical region in projection  
to which the metaphor  
will not be refreshed.  
Among the transluscent deep brown hand of the heat.  
Come with me to the extinction of juices.  
To the natural manly aroma only mirror,  
just the  
femininity, nothing but  
it. Saxophone.  
A enchanting wind of drops.  
  
There ought to be a coral of a blazing branch setting in a universe.  
The clock imposes nessecity.
