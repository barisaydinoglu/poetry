Living Hushed Nostalgia
-----------------------
In the cinnamon nose of the heat. What secrets does the jaguar contain?  
How little we return and how much it showers the phenomena of this computer  
simulation.  
They loathed it with whirlwinds of cathedrals.  
This torrential kiss and crystallizing circus replaces me  
with it's lion hearted smooth metals like toe and brow  
and dull shades of cinnamon miracles like tail and stalkss of cattail.  
Sand-colored lightning to my communist serendipity!  
  
To seek another land indicates the smooth sand's fashioning  
hips.  
Not seizing is a form of waking.  
From her foot and her eyelids imbue  
alcoves of the earth.  
And inside my hammock, during the sunrise, I woke up naked  
and full of decency.
