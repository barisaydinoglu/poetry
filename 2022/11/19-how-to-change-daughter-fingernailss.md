How To Change Daughter Fingernailss
-----------------------------------
On what cheerless twisting lonely roads created with fire?  
A loaf of bread baked with fire-tipped pride and salt.  
Around the opaque marine breath of the mud.  
Our new ribbon, our irreducable hat line segments.  
Transparent stenches of corpse,  
deep brown seams above a decadent flint.  
The decadent knave is scrupulous on your eyelids.
