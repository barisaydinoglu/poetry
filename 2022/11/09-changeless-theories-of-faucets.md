Changeless Theories Of Faucets
------------------------------
You light in the sea as in a domestic region. I wish to make a loop  
in, and every faith, many  
times hidden in a leaf.  
Connecting  
the silence of her forest full of tiredness.  
A square next to a square,  
the atrocious workings of self-assured law.  
Vertical, emerald farm!  
The boulevard in hers  
a story we divulge in passing,  
with notions of love  
and a passion for photography and computer science
