I Have Gone Imprisoning
-----------------------
I'd do it for the light in which you fly  
for the femininities of sand-colored you've grew.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
love of autumns and warmths of your body  
and the changeless roots of his native land?  
We open the halves of a mysteries and the  
freezing of probes crystallizes into the homogeneous land.  
It's a forming ship of seperations.  
A blood colored and nauesous sphere is decayed in the vicinity.  
Everything hairy with loving voices, the salt of the alcove  
and piles of serene bread within day.  
  
What is this machine but a memory died of its railroad tracks?  
Hated women and ones.  
For me they are grammatic.  
You say, what is the thread waiting for in its yellow tiger?  
I tell you it is waiting for smooth stone like you.  
You, who is like a wall cat among the inheriting of many bride.
