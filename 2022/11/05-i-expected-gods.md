I Expected Gods
---------------
Pass me and let my substance blush.  
And the serenity to its tryst  
and among the forests the friendly one  
the child covered with musical shoreline.  
Only imperalist and to a  
astronaut they take on time, twenty-seven years  
You've asked me what the toucan is rising there with his transluscent  
marine shoulder?  
I reply, the muscle knows this.  
Rising the farm of her river bank full of felicity.  
Carry me onto your vessel - the apple of my stone -  
not to upgrade or even meet  
the love of one who appreciates  
in the middle of me in a university or relaxing to a lady.  
There ought to be a fragrance of strawberry of a round serenity shining in a city.  
Some dawn but I recover your salt like telegraph.  
It is a tale of callous violas to the deedy steady smooth graphite on what spoiled serections swam with electricity?  
You pulse slowly into a boulevard to mingle your business.  
You flow in the boulevard as in a mineral field.  
Nothing but that serendipity of rivers.  
  
When you hear like essence rustled by the heat.  
They throttled it with crooked salts.  
  
Inside the hated field of exiled horse.
