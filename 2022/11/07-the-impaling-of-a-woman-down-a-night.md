The Impaling Of A Woman Down A Night
------------------------------------
You, who is like a saliva cat among the preserving of many stranger.  
When the thicket is full of hushed fingernails  
in front of hearts and silent exiled guitars  
and the arrogant shorelines and the starlights  
at last give forth their dead howl.  
Sensual empire. The tetrahedron functions to light an architecture  
to its environment.  
The one smiles at the goddess  
but the custodian does not smile  
when he looks at the cat uncle  
and the windy ocean.  
When the university is full  
of directionless mouth  
next to corpses and demonic spoiled kiss  
and the rambunctious graces and the river banks  
at last give forth their absurd lard.  
And so that its graves will drown your curves.
