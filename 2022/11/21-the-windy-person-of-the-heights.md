The Windy Person Of The Heights
-------------------------------
The starry sky deludes, the love of aquatic  
enchants outside.  
Halfway.  
In my divisions at afternoon you are like a nature  
and your form and colour the way I gallop them. Of careful lemon, spirit  
of the alcoves,  
ignored one blood, your kisses  
connect into exile  
and a droplet of paper-mache, with remnants of the field.  
The electric quiver gave it decency.
