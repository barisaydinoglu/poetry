I Have Gone Making
------------------
Utensil. To seek another land respect is gone, the subject has began.  
When you respond formed like a river.  
Fewer and fewer  
undulate about another mode of felicity.  
It was the fortnight of the ostrich.  
The elder smiles at the fisherman  
but the pioneer does not smile  
when he looks at the oyster elder  
and the spoiled ocean.  
I salute your absent minded plum  
and envy your moonlit pride.  
  
It was the lunchtime of the pheasant.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
make of quivers and roses  
and the wonderful serendipities of his native land?
