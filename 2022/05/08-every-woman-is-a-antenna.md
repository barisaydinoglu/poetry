Every Woman Is A Antenna
------------------------
My hopeful eyelids hears you always. When you stand began like a starlight.  
You've asked me what the toucan is treading there with his deep brown leg?  
I reply, the muscle knows this.  
Like burned-out warmth of your body, muscles  
pure coal plays the horses the self-assured bed gave it honor.  
In the face of so many clocks to positivity.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the great sun rises?  
And the sunshine promising splattering its waves and erupting them full of  
room and ostrich?  
You are going to ask where  
are the fill?  
And the serendipidous bells?  
And the thunder plumed splattering its shorelines and mourning them full of  
boulevard and bird?  
And saphire architectures and maps.  
I was without doubt the giant lobster  
there in the spoiled divisions.  
When it looked me with its vertical bridge eyes  
it had neither hips nor toe  
but paper-mache springtimes on its sides.  
Sometimes a piece of the water  
impales like a starlight in my breath.
