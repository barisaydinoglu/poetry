The Thirsty City
----------------
Lethargic bloods and wet-winged violas.  
You dawn slowly into a universe to form your business.  
Realized resolute forest you live my misunderstood whisper  
like a decisive crab to fresh cheesecake.  
Brings all the disguises starry skies.  
In  
the first scene, the natural sailor  
is condemned  
by a woman. In the second  
scene he returns, to drink and to swim.  
Went blossomed in pencil you play  
my inaccessible granule  
like a perfect pheasant to fresh nectarine.  
  
Like yeasts shaking behind droplets.  
So the electric joy lives on in an apple,  
the solute house of the flint,  
the essential fragrance of strawberry  
that is blazing and serendipidous.  
There are many vagabonds behind calculating events.  
An odor has protected under the flower,  
a mixture of flame and body, a creating  
dew that brings animosity.  
From her eyeballs and her nose stand  
precisions of the earth.  
And the angel to its warmth of your body  
and among the love the homogeneous one  
the person covered with sensual coral.  
  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
You, who is like a lard iguana among the reconciling of many fisherman.
