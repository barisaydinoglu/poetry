Song For The Stranger Of Inaccessible Trousers
----------------------------------------------
Draw from it the rustling  
identity of its own production. Not the sand-colored moment  
when the midnight lights the pastures.  
To re-cover lost echoes and for friendships.  
As soon as the incoming doors  
gives the grammatic indication.  
Went breathed in essence there are no roosters but shady cycles of farm and cashmire  
defenders of mineral senile broken glass.  
Cleansed, crystal foam!  
In your eye of agony the universe of essences wake.  
What curiosities does the ostrich contain?  
How little we promise and how much it flows the curiosities of this computer simulation.  
  
Of your opaque blood colored sun when you hold out your ears.  
Neurotic darkness and shady beasts.  
Pockets of steel converted into bolt of ceramic.  
I am buried by pasture and coal, by cadaver and wind.  
Come with me to the granule of wounded soldiers.  
Around the autumn of the divisions where you sleep,  
a dream drowns into inscriptions.  
You are the inevitable pioneer of a bird,  
the insufferable ness of the kis, the power of the clay.  
And among my hammock, during the sunrise, I woke up naked  
and full of decency.  
Your bridge is a ripple filled with dead springtime.  
There ought to be a law of a resplendent drop playing in  
a jungle.  
The self-assured femininities loathed the mud  
slender cities are wiped.  
  
I do not drown in the sea of frightened shortcut.  
The I in planetarium where stalkss of cattail meet  
smooth stones meet, among and with and the sound  
of shadows, to reach out and light in fear.
