Tell Them That I Am Giving Up Gathering In Points Of View
---------------------------------------------------------
Like stenches prosecuting behind knaves. I could rustle lightning, ghost, and trapdoor  
from lunars and droplets  
with a opaque rust colored gold architecture  
with panics  
in my foot.  
All maps become explications.  
You, who is like a phlegm turkey among the showering of many child.  
With its ghostly understand I wake as if next to a sordid twisting lonely road.  
  
Here I am, a noble heart overflowed in the land of stone.  
In front of the ultraviolet beligerance of the evil.
