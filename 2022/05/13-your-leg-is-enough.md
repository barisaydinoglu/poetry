Your Leg Is Enough
------------------
But I should be untrue to science, smothering among its blood-stained momenta  
so let us attempt to speak a story without aerial redundancies.  
Everything clenched with cordial voices, the salt of the magnolium  
and piles of sensible bread within day.  
They foreboded it with clotting essences.  
Carry me onto your ship - the kiwi of my circus -  
Our new poppy, our absorbant pullulation tetrahedrons.  
If you were not the wine the homogeneous moon  
cooks, sprinkling its wine across the university.  
In the first reel, the humble custodian  
is conquered by a daughter. In the second  
take he returns, to rustle and to expand.  
A green wine bottle crystallizes.  
Soft, marble  
breakfast!  
Fractious puberties and frail serections.  
In my heights at early light of day you are like a shades of silvery  
and your form and colour the way I light them.
