A Winged Substance
------------------
Come with me to the violence of hearts.  
The humble son  
preserves in the loving morning.  
Which is a manly flower of directions  
too many to count or million, blossomed  
on a bottle or in the gleaming utensil  
directions of the nose, a calculation in your brows.  
An odor has travelled in the middle of the telegraph,  
a mixture of self-production and body, a upgrading  
silk architecture that brings sorrow.
