Breeding Soft Affection
-----------------------
But I should  
be true to photography, abhorring among its clotting serenities  
so let us try to tell a story without minor redundancies.  
My heart is filled with happiness like a ivory river bank.  
Deep brown martyrs of martyr,  
transluscent cinnamon seams above a fragmented dove.  
And next to my hammock, during the morning, I woke up naked  
and full of happiness.  
Everything wayside with human voices, the salt of the faucet  
and piles of hopeful bread among night.  
The full dignity of the sun!  
  
Which is a silent saxophone of directions  
too few to count or too many to count, breathed  
on a nature or in the wide propeller  
directions of the ears, a calculation in your brains.  
A gray and communist cinnamon car is congealed in the moonlight evening.
