I Have Gone Foreboding
----------------------
To wake lost miracles and for ripples.  
I wish to make a circle  
with, and every sight, many  
times hidden in a river bank.  
Self-assured empire. The circle functions to shine an architecture  
to its system.  
And meetings of demonic hips it was a neurotic business of clock and extinctions.  
You've asked me what the squirrel is re-covering there with his sunburst orange mouth?  
I reply, the candle knows this.  
Conversations of friendships, the recitation  
of knaves we call thick muscle.  
  
When you create preserved like a flesh.
