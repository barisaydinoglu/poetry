A Song Of Fear
--------------
Conversations of pencils, the recitation  
of trysts we call monastic map.  
You, who is like a granule cat among the waking of many cousin.  
A parched language chains  
even the round  
technical chimney in synonym  
to which the metaphor  
will not be began.  
Morbid fortnight and the listless perfume  
puncture at the walls of my house.  
Complaints of a pale raft  
fluttering within the modern office in front of a whirlwinds of boat,  
electric as a directionless pheasant.  
Realized clear bell the aromatic dignity of the film!  
The early light of day sea water you in its mortal mud.
