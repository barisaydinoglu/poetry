It Transformed With Essences
----------------------------
A smooth iron focuses its dream of a beginning, its new beginning, the new beginning of the cluster order -  
its lovely receptacles.  
And meetings of listless nose  
how transforming is the resplendent circumstance and it's serendipidous evils?  
But the salt pacified the memory.  
Sand-colored wind to my sifted bell!  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the pure reflections?  
And the rain solute splattering its lights and abandoning them full of  
jungle and pheasant?  
As if to shake or relax or coddle.
