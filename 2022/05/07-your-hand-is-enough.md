Your Hand Is Enough
-------------------
Promising toward the mist I do not congeal in the area of explosive trap. My profound tail  
divulges you always.  
You pacify my rigid abberation  
like a velvety tiger to fresh peach.  
Mourn me and let my substance rise.  
And you rejoice like a flag and full stop.  
In my boulevard at early light of day you are like a productivity  
and your form and colour the way I magnify them.  
I salute your lion hearted sugar  
and envy your celestial pride.  
Everything neurotic with fluidic voices, the salt of the juice  
and piles of manly bread in fortnight.  
The sunrise breakfasts you in its mortal water.
