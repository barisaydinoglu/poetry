From What Are Sweetness Rescued
-------------------------------
The smooth graphite waking from my leg. Sepia self-productions of viola,  
sepia seams above a difficult flint.  
Draw from it the shady  
point of view of its own signal.  
  
To the eloquent myriad flower draw from it the difficult  
antenna of its own language.
