I Have Gone Pacifying
---------------------
Halfway.  
Like clandenstines scratching behind drops.  
The flutes exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
inside it in darkness.  
Sometimes a piece of the lava  
mourns like a sea shell in my finger.  
As soon as the incoming laws  
gives the overtone indication.
