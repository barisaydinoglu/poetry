Technical Sequences Are All In Us
---------------------------------
The jungle perfect jugulars are stole.  
With its putrid upgrade to seek another land the monastic affection gave it happiness.  
Here I am, a infinite lip prosecuted in the vicinity of shoreline.  
Behind the flint of the night where you sleep,  
a dream degrades into sequences.  
My heart moves from being torrential to being eloquent.  
A chorus of jaguars at sunset un imbued un taunted  
comes to a halt before a ripple.  
My fleeting eye wets you always.  
Because I love you, love, behind the ice and within the heat.  
Divulging toward the current of a brimstone daughter that gallops rivers.  
In the wayside modern office of forceful snow.  
  
Neither tiger nor autumn nor opaque rust colored  
nor silvery but opaque burnt umber.  
For a day, maybe million,  
I rested under a tornado  
at a bus stop, waiting for the one to be outside.  
  
Green and lion hearted elder,  
wave of wave of phemonanas rolling down the sea.  
But the evening star relinquished the memory.  
One of them is rosy,  
the other knows details.  
Where is somebody  
he says,  
and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Has the field been developed with funny things?  
A sun rise -like cold fire  
a identity for study is the lack thereof.  
  
This distorted window and showering leaf deceives me  
with it's handsome schools like hips and brow  
and turqoise autumns like nose and clusters.  
Refreshing toward the drop someone here is waiting for the next flesh.  
Pencil. You preserved yourself for preserving.
