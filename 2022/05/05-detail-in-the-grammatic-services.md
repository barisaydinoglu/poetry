Detail In The Grammatic Services
--------------------------------
A quadrangle within a line segment,  
the browbeaten workings of stationary law.  
Multitude of atoms!  
In and out of the cashmire the marine and the marine  
they are all people  
professional noises in whose parsimonious echoes originate.  
A inscription for identity  
is the lack thereof.  
To seek another land and so that its billows of brimstone smoke will penetrate your ears.  
Nothing but that alcove of elixirs.  
In your eye of compounding the jungle begins to dream of pacifying.  
It crystallizes like a hoove amid the momentum.  
Your ship is a umbrella filled with calcerous poppy.  
And you mutated in the confusion and perfumed a falling night.  
A mineral linoleum making a vertical thing of a probable meeting with a goddess.  
  
Full stop.  
Only starlight, just the  
planetarium, nothing but  
it. Soul.
