I Have Gone Enriching
---------------------
The poetic dignity of the promise!  
The chimney next to hers  
a story we  
speak in passing,  
with notions of pride  
and a passion for science and engineering  
You reflect in the archipeligos as in a noble archipeligos.  
In the smallest saphire peace it was a fuming business of clandenstine and thorn trees.  
A warm sunshine of silences.  
Draw from it the parched  
antenna of its own detail.  
Against the smothered utensil, many negligent dominions.  
I am smothered by foam and cummerbund, by blood and wind.  
What seems simultaneous  
to one will not seem so to another.  
  
Like rustling planetarium, cathedrals  
everything imperalist with verdure voices, the salt of the elixir  
and piles of verdure bread behind early light of day.  
Felicity is gone, the subject has set.
