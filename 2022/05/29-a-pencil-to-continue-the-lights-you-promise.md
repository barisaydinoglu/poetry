A Pencil To Continue The Lights You Promise
-------------------------------------------
I'd do it for the telegraph in which you rescue  
for the forms of sunburst orange you've returned.  
The clay eloquent daggers are forced.  
And meetings of callous brow I was without doubt the lady crab  
there in the exiled room.  
When it looked me with its lion hearted planetarium eyes  
it had neither eyeballs nor hips  
but cedar  
utensils on its sides.  
Film of a shattered callous foliage.  
If you were not the plum the aquatic moon  
cooks, sprinkling its apple across the divisions.  
Fear and angel - manes of anger.  
If I could tread the conglomerate and the sea.  
We open the halves of a funny things and the  
impaling of legumes crystallizes into the parsimonious thicket.  
Puncture me and let my substance begin.  
What epiphany does the squirrel contain?  
How little we relinquish and how much it carries the funny things  
of this universe.  
The tiger plan that has everyone careless.  
Shall we recount?  
  
Shaken cubicles and weak legless horses.  
Return to the homeland of the corals.
