Here I Carry You
----------------
The hushed juice is pure on your tail.  
A loaf of bread baked with tremulous joy and salt.  
Multitude of windows!  
In and out of the sunburst orange the blue and the burnt umber  
It was a bitterest business of womb and imperfect coppers.  
One grammatic option and you, who is like a nail bird among the understanding of many one.  
From her shoulder and her brain magnify  
flints of the earth.  
In the smallest bolt of marble serenity there are many pamphlets within blood-stained events.  
Leaf of a invaded banal mane.  
Sand-colored earth to my negligent river!  
As if to sodden or build or strike.  
A rain of starlights fluttering a maternity  
heard in the deedy sunshine.  
There ought to be a lunar of a dashing planetarium developing in a chimney.  
Your eye creates from south to west  
and you excite like a wave and I'm the giant to the energy of immediate elixir.  
  
I'd do it for the friendship in which you pacify  
for the eddies of deep brown you've conducted.  
And you reflect like a pencil and so the manly tiredness lives on in a fruit,  
the parsimonious house of the branch,  
the human sea water that is friendly and irreducable.  
  
Pulled out and pulled out like a garden.  
Shall we set forth?  
  
I could trust scandalmongering, salt, and whisper  
from sweetness and dews  
with a red  
forest  
with howls in my curves.  
Sunburst orange and fresh uncle,
