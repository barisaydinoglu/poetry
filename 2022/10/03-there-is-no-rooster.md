There Is No Rooster
-------------------
And so that its serections will dismantle your brain.  
Outside the fatherless heights of distorted foam.  
Opaque sand-colored corpses of coal,  
silvery seams above a obscene sun.  
Moon.  
Because I love you, love, outside the earth and among the mud.  
In front of the brimstone panic of the nail.  
Of parenthetical cheesecake, spirit  
of the pencils,  
attacked giant blood, your kisses  
gather into exile  
and a droplet of diamond, with remnants of the jungle.  
Love of a changed clotting land.  
A signal drinks,  
shatters - it does not return.  
Be guided by the blazing silence's cactus.
