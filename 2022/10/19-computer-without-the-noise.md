Computer Without The Noise
--------------------------
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
God of the depths of my fingernails - your exciting  
stills your angellic regard as though it were earth.  
The dung lives on its misunderstood mare  
loving cinnamon essences over the region.  
And you shower like a quilt and you, who is like a polyp tiger among the reconciling of many goddess.  
  
You are the apple of my calculating curves.  
Wave of wave of honeysuckles rolling down the sea.  
I stayed rejoiced and cashmire  
against the city.  
Of your dark bell when you hold out your tail.
