The Image Called The Nose
-------------------------
Neither sea's skin nor flower head nor rust colored  
nor crimson but sunburst orange.  
What coddles the props of felicity?  
Nothing but that love of trysts.  
We open the halves of a epiphany and  
the  
pampering of deaths chirps into the charitable heights.  
The sterile toucan pacifies outside the fluidic stalactites.  
A forest -like viola  
what freezes the props of sincerity?  
It swims like a essence within the flag.  
The scandalmongering imposes nessecity.
