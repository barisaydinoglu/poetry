Chirping Wounded Nostalgia
--------------------------
The silent ship is balanced on your tail.  
Opaque cashmire electricity to my lewd cathedral!  
A leg and a eye  
breathing the thicket.  
A juice dedicating will pacify  
the hushed clay of a planet.  
I salute your homogeneous nectarine  
and envy your mineral pride. Not the crimson moment  
when the sunrise enriches the snows.  
In transparent water and sepia clusters.  
Fewer and fewer  
degrade about another mode of purity.  
I was without doubt the mountaineer squirrel  
there in the ironous night.  
When it looked me with its nocturnal maternity eyes  
it had neither leg nor shoulder  
but crystal flowers on its sides.
