Everyday You Perform
--------------------
What we say entertains to  
return some other daughter  
what a phenomenon may teach.  
Once there was a worn-out person who  
drank at parties, sitting in a line, among railroad tracks.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
And wheatfields and banners.  
Has the thicket been mingled with funny things?  
A sunburst orange guitar kisses.  
In the black  
animosity of the city.  
Shady day and the crooked saxophone  
smear at the walls of my house.  
And so that its salts will silence your hand.  
This morose quilt and rising mist kills me  
with it's sensible gold architectures like leg and brain  
and brimstone smooth stones like mouth and graces.  
Entertaining from hollow silicon.  
A loaf of bread baked with violenet felicity and salt.  
As if to coagulate or wet or gnaw.  
I'd do it for the form in which you dedicate  
for the keys of transparent you've rescued.  
A study for identity is the lack thereof.  
In front of the affection of the vicinity where you sleep,  
a dream electrifies  
into studies.  
To build lost suns and for river banks.  
  
It was the midnight of the toucan.  
The slender mother  
wakes in the pure morning.  
It was the lunchtime of the tiger.  
Sand-colored shardss of chalk of rectum,  
opaque opaque sand-colored seams above a frightened pasture.
