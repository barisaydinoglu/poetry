A Diamond Within Copper
-----------------------
My heart is filled with happiness like a paper-mache cluster.  
Like nails shattering amid crowns.  
Living the lemon of her flower head full of respect.  
You've asked me what the pheasant is attracting there with his burnt umber nose?  
I reply, the thread knows this.
