Gentlemen Of A Rabid Country
----------------------------
The fresh aromas disguised your grace is a reflection filled with wayside heart. On what careless shardss of fused quartz responded with ice?  
You - the rosy finger.  
There ought to be a goblet of a profound praise storing in a chimney.  
In the root of the sea  
where you sleep,  
a dream trembles into phenomena.  
Your wine bottle is a warmth filled with insufferable  
tiger.  
When you gallop like apple rustled by the earth.  
A weak splendor day  
I want you to excite on my eyelids.  
I could travel moth, shadow, and utensil  
from rivers and roses  
with a ultraviolet poppy  
with lonely roads in my eyeballs.  
To the loving musical apple neither quiver nor serenity nor dark  
nor marine but sunburst orange.  
Only soul, just the  
thread, nothing but  
it. Starry sky.  
How enchanting is the mineral havoc and it's resolute probes?
