Everyday You Weave
------------------
But I should be untrue to computer science, ignoring among its whirlwinds of paths  
so let us seek to speak a story devoid of aerial redundancies.  
For a day, maybe three hundred,  
I rested under a ray of sunlight  
at a post office, waiting for the one to be within.  
In the crimson shoulder of the clay.  
Pockets of salt converted into chalk.  
The electric dignity of the necklace!
