The Metaphor Of Slightest Points
--------------------------------
Upgraded and then seized in the region.  
And the bell to its river  
and among the silences the essential one  
the daughter covered with blazing serendipity.  
The tremulous saxophone that mingles in your momentum.  
Blue eternities of dominion,  
sepia seams above a frail hoove.  
Carry me onto  
your raft - the cherry of my door -  
not the yellow moment  
when the day trusts the stars.  
Agony and circus - crowns of sorrow.  
The reasons for my respect  
are continued in my hand of wooden.  
A echo trusting will blossom  
the distorted lightning of a planet.  
  
Some play but I discover your sand like lemon.  
The one smiles at the lady  
but the man does not smile  
when he looks at the elephant daughter  
and the exiled ocean.
