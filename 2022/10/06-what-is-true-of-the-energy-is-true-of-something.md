What Is True Of The Energy Is True Of Something
-----------------------------------------------
Be guided  
by the round flower's aspen.  
Chirp on the polyps that wait for you  
conquering the fuming chairs, mourning the doors.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
mingle of drops and dews  
and the incredulous utensils of his native land?  
A projection pulses,  
devours - it does not return.  
  
From tornado to blade of grass,  
hidden ribbons drawn by electrical channels, a  
silent writing begins to entertain.  
A loaf of bread baked with thirsty happiness and salt.
