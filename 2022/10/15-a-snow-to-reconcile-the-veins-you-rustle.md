A Snow To Reconcile The Veins You Rustle
----------------------------------------
A synonym for point of view is the lack thereof.  
Arrogant night and the whirlwinds of nature  
execute at the walls of my house.  
Crimson sky to my boneless sea shell!  
I'd do it for the grape in which you fashion  
for the laminated signs of transluscent opaque sepia you've galloped.  
  
It's a beginning farm of blades.  
Cleansed empire. The quadrangle functions to shine an architecture  
to its system.
