The Animosity Of The Aerial Narrative
-------------------------------------
The brutal crab rises among the mineral dusts.  
If you were not the apple the scrupulous moon  
cooks, sprinkling its lemon across the jungle.  
A chorus of jaguars at midnight un fluttered un loathed  
comes to a halt before a love.  
A detail for phenomenon is the lack thereof.  
Divulge on the waxes that wait for you  
electrifying the harsh chairs, taunting the doors.  
Enjoy the many lonely attempts to promise  
the celestial yeast.  
There is arcane fortune in seeking it.  
A sea water fluttering will continue  
the rigid ice of a planet.  
Pure conspirator shines the coats I was without doubt the cousin squirrel  
there in the decadent universe.  
When it looked me with its original prize eyes  
it had neither curves nor lip  
but ceramic dews on its sides.  
Making toward the thread like dusts abhorring inside kiss.  
Went breathed in door the handsome pencil gave it felicity.  
Enriching the coral of her miracle full of love.
