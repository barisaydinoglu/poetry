I Have Gone Coddling
--------------------
The home relaxes in carrying your curves.  
What we say showers to  
imbue some other son  
what a phenomenon may teach.  
I salute your electrical peach  
and envy your starry pride.  
All muscles become daggers.  
Old warrior's medal.  
Your railroad track is a splendor filled with thirsty farm.  
Conversations of stones, the recitation  
of evening stars we call spacious fellowship.
