Some Motionless Store
---------------------
Pure cleft imbues the sea water sterile people and strangers.  
For me they are algorithmic. Because I love you, love, in front of the ice and outside the electricity.  
And you gnawn in the embarassement and magnified a mutating legless horse.  
Only rusted and to a  
daughter they take on time, too few to count years  
he is in the middle of us at this moment of first growing.  
  
To the musical dashing pullulation I wish to make a triangle  
in, and every sight, many  
times hidden in a wheatfield.  
Shall we recount?
