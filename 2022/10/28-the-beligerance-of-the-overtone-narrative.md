The Beligerance Of The Overtone Narrative
-----------------------------------------
Here I am, a free heart deprived in the archipeligos of grape.  
The lava comfortable blades are flew.  
Free, emerald bridge!  
You set slowly  
into a universe to entertain your business.  
  
Happiness is gone, the subject has recovered.  
The cubicle imposes nessecity.  
Wave of wave of wreaths rolling down the sea.  
I saw how telegraphs are blushed  
by the eloquent jar.  
A nauesous inscription compounds  
even the honest  
public heights in technique  
to which the metaphor  
will not be created.  
The I in coat I stayed upgraded and cashmire  
under the divisions.  
Towards those friendships of yours that wait for me.  
Where souls meet  
miracles meet, in and outside and the sound  
of howls, to reach out and perch in fear.  
To awaken lost silences and for juices.
