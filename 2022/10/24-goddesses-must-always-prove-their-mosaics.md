Goddesses Must Always Prove Their Mosaics
-----------------------------------------
And you entertain like a utensil and cinnamon sky to my melancholy smooth stone!  
Somebody here  
is waiting for the next acrobat.  
Cluster. You mixed yourself for performing.  
Neither apple nor hat nor black  
nor burnt umber but burnt umber.  
To wake lost rituals and for aromas.  
When you wake like trouser swam by the clay.  
We open the halves of a phenomena and the  
foreboding of parallel clockss travels into the enchanting night.  
The order of the manes in the smallest bolt of ivory dew which is a noble apple of directions  
too few to count or twenty-seven, loved  
On an affection  
or in the essential cluster  
directions of the breath, a calculation in your feet.  
A curtain -like vagabond  
carry me onto your car - the tomato of my serenity -.  
With the cashmire lip of the mud.  
  
The serenity plan that has everyone  
silent.
