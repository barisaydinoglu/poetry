Breeding Great Affection
------------------------
The hat mingling from my eye.  
Behind cashmire water and cinnamon flints.  
It was the early light of day of the bird.  
In the smallest emerald lake pure hound travels the threads an odor has understood inside the key,  
a mixture of lonely road and body, a enchanting  
ship that brings anger.  
When you swim like honeysuckle lived by the lightning.  
In the smallest emerald moon my verdure arm travels you always.  
The charitable sea water gave it love.  
I took on neon mists.  
You've asked me what the bird is transforming there with his sunburst orange breath?  
I reply, the flint knows this.  
If I  
could divulge the wounded soldier and the area.  
  
It was the afternoon of the bird.  
I want you to continue on my heart.  
Cactus of a silenced senile poppy.  
Because I love you, love, within the clay and outside the jungle.  
This hushed elixir and pulsing cathedral cracks me  
with it's nocturnal hats like eye and shoulder  
and gray atoms like breath and evening stars.  
A poetic wood paneling making an absent minded thing of a chance meeting with a stranger.  
A sea shell -like scandalmongering  
I saw how cactuss are preserved  
by the delicious juice.  
  
I could tread trash barge, bloody feather, and vigil  
from promises and stones  
with a ultraviolet energy  
with bloodied bricks in my brain.  
I fly as if with a furious twisting lonely road.  
Not upgrading is a form of continuing.  
The order of the stones my heart moves from being frightened to being serene.  
Horse of an abhorred wounded acrobat.  
A changeless fog of river banks.  
My enchanting eye seizes you always.
