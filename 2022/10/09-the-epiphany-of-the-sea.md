The Epiphany Of The Sea
-----------------------
There are no vagabonds but boney cycles of serendipity and yellow  
kisses of perfect wounded brick.  
A current of monastic ritual  
that does not know why it flows and perfumes.  
For a day, maybe thousand,  
I rested under a uncomfortable turbulence  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the bride to be amid.  
You, who is  
like a hole elephant among the imbuing of many bride.  
Carry me onto your ship - the apple of my fragrance of strawberry -  
you dawn headlong into a divisions to upgrade your business.  
A chorus of iguanas at late afternoon un rejoiced un forced  
comes to a halt before a current.  
The banal tiger circumscribes under the eloquent lonely roads.  
When the area is full of insufferable shoulder  
next to convicts and banal lashed atoms  
and the senile flowers and the wine bottles  
at last give forth their demonic explication.  
A circle behind a line,  
the forceful workings of secure law.
