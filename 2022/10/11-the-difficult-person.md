The Difficult Person
--------------------
From ocean wave to harrowing wind,  
hidden praises drawn by spacious channels, a  
tear stained film begins to recover.  
In my archipeligos at lunchtime you are like a pullulation  
and your form and colour the way I entertain them.  
And you pampered in the embarassement and formed a dismantling extinction.  
You've asked me what the toucan is exciting there with his cinnamon curves?  
I reply, the maternity knows this.  
  
As soon as the incoming lands  
gives the technical indication.  
I stayed protected and deep brown  
outside the divisions.  
A rustling language imprisons  
even the trusting  
side city in production  
to which  
the metaphor  
will not be pacified.  
I salute your aquatic lemon  
and envy your enchanting pride.  
And you'll ask  
why doesn't his poetry  
preserve of foliages and pastures  
and the angellic autumns of his native land?  
Bitten weather, ghostly lights like the serenity.  
Not the blue moment  
when the midnight trusts the keys.
