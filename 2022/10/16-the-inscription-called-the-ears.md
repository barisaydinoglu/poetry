The Inscription Called The Ears
-------------------------------
You've asked me what the turkey is mixing there with his opaque blue leg?  
I reply, the ribbon knows this.  
So the esoteric respect lives on in a mango,  
the round house of the flower head,  
the rosy bell that is promising and fleeting.  
The trap imposes nessecity.  
There are no probes but bitter cycles of friendship and transparent  
fragrances of strawberry of acerb acidulous clay.  
Your finger drinks from south to east  
my heart moves from being fatherless to being moonlit.  
You've asked me what the iguana is inheriting there with his blue ears?  
I reply, the lighthouse knows this.  
Towards those lights of yours that wait for me.  
My heart moves from being barbaous to being parsimonious.  
Went showered in sun rise of nocturnal nectarine, spirit  
of the goblets,  
abducted gentleman blood, your kisses  
flutter into exile  
and a droplet of silken, with remnants of the sea.  
If you were not the wine the full moon  
cooks, sprinkling its cheesecake across the jungle.  
  
If I could continue the abberation and the archipeligos.  
Fashioning a bridge  
promised in the moonlit mist.
