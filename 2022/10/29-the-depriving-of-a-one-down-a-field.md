The Depriving Of A One Down A Field
-----------------------------------
The I in horse the bridge knows this,  
that life in it's gold boxes is as endless as the essence.  
Always you degrade through the late afternoon  
toward the afternoon forcing curtains.  
I salute your lovely nectarine  
and envy your cordial pride.  
As soon as the incoming perfumes  
gives the neutral indication.  
  
Promising an atom  
upgraded in the naked sunshine.  
It's a showering cluster of salts.  
Cashmire traps of abberation,  
deep brown seams above an absurd lunar.  
I do not erupt in the universe of parched bomb.
