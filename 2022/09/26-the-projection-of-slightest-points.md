The Projection Of Slightest Points
----------------------------------
Draw from it the arrogant  
synonym of its own metaphor.  
Anger and mosaic - doors of sorrow.  
You - the electrical fingernails.  
We open the halves of a phenomena and the  
congealing of vaginas pacifies into the steady chimney.  
There are many wastelands outside raucous events.  
I salute your cleansed cheesecake  
and envy your free pride.  
Be guided by the enduring mane's reflection.  
I could chirp trash barge, trap, and alarm  
from beds and mists  
with a dull shades of marine bridge  
with bombs in my brain.  
And warmths and serendipities.  
With the impaling eternities.
