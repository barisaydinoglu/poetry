Since The Beginning Of Enchanting
---------------------------------
Nails of a tenacious raft  
circumscribing within the jungle in front of a hollow wheel,  
sweet-smelling as a crooked squirrel.  
To the ancient parsimonious form from her mouth and her brain perch  
elixirs of the earth.  
A reflection -like eternity  
the morbid ostrich discovers outside the deedy legumes.  
A difficult production crushes  
even the angellic  
minor field in calculation  
to which the metaphor  
will not be discovered.  
As if to lunge or fly or electrify.  
The friendly defender gave it felicity.  
Smooth stone was no longer above the recording threshold.  
Halfway. To the pure color of the gold juice.  
One minor option and a chorus of turkeys at night un returned un undulated  
comes to a halt before a home.  
In your eyelids of beligerance the land of energies reconcile.  
Shall we proceed?  
The serenity lights in understanding your hips.  
In your eyelids of embarassement the jungle of shadess of transluscent blue flow.  
I took on frail droplets.  
The pioneer smiles at the god  
but the child does not smile  
when he looks at the pheasant cousin  
and the weak ocean.  
You say, what is the elixir waiting for in its transparent cathedral?  
I tell you it is waiting for lunar  
like you.  
Be guided by the parsimonious garden's time.  
To understand lost pastures and for coats.  
  
Dawn on the wounds that  
wait for you  
fainting the mourning chairs, filtering the doors.  
Weaving a ribbon  
excited in the arcane sun.
