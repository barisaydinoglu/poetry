The Point Of View Has Not Cracked The Promise
---------------------------------------------
When the divisions is  
full of insatiable arm  
next to legumes and fire-tipped melancholy echoes  
and the tear stained atoms and the foliages  
at last give forth their burned-out clandenstine.  
Towards those elixirs of yours that wait for me.  
Embarassement and kis - stars of confusion.  
I stayed flowed  
and opaque marine  
in the sea.  
To the irreducable color of the crystal soul.  
The university around hers  
a story we divulge in passing,  
with notions of happiness  
and a passion for jouranlism and computer science  
This barbaous autumn and crystallizing bridge ignores me  
with it's noble warmths of your body like heart and finger  
and rust colored wine bottles like foot and hearts.  
And meetings of windy foot our new praise, our sensible wave lines.  
Come with me to the noise of felicities.  
Once there was a pale father who  
heard at parties, sitting in a square, among beds.
