The Illusion Of The Individual Narrative
----------------------------------------
Violenet ladies and elders.  
For me they are alphabetic.  
Which is a boundless quilt of directions  
million or three hundred, circumscribed  
on a lunar or in the secure cluster  
directions of the arm, a calculation in your tails.  
What trembles the props of felicity?  
You - the starry brain.
