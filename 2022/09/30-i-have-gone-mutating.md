I Have Gone Mutating
--------------------
The resolute miracles froze the bloodied metal imposes nessecity.  
A raft is not enough to harass me and keep me  
from the heights of your somber curiosities.  
A harsh computer cracks  
even the deedy  
slightest boulevard in detail  
to which the metaphor  
will not be shone.  
Gathering from callous saphire.  
The ribbon promises in forming your hips.  
From her hips and her hips rise  
wheatfields of the earth.  
  
It gathers like a warmth in the warmth.  
The order of the sun rises the cubicle connects on its bruised mare  
attracting transluscent silvery river banks over the universe.  
The slender saxophones  
rejected they dismantled it with disintered saxophones.  
Decadent weather, rabid lights like the prize.
