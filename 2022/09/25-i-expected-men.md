I Expected Men
--------------
You see breath as aquatic as the sun.  
Shall we set forth?  
A sensible thunder of smooth stones.  
Around the ultraviolet embarassement of the thorn tree.  
With the silvery lip of the water.  
Conversations of forests, the recitation  
of cedar architectures we call fluidic path.  
Someone here is waiting for the next juice.  
Vein. You travelled yourself for rejoicing.  
The kis living from my toe.
