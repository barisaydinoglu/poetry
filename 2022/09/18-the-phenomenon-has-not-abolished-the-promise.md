The Phenomenon Has Not Abolished The Promise
--------------------------------------------
Wayside rotten stumps and directionless conspirators.  
Uncle of the depths of my breath - your growing  
stills your eager  
regard as though it were mud.  
Went promised in productivity the enemy imposes nessecity.  
Wave of wave of eddies rolling down the sea.  
I could reconcile wax, oblivion, and cleft  
from aromas and threads  
with a ultraviolet dew  
with traps in my brow.  
Among the forcing trash barges.  
In the face of so many self-productions to animosity.  
My heart is filled with decency like a emerald dew.  
Multitude of mosaics!  
In and out of the burnt umber the marine and the transluscent cinnamon  
be guided by the brandishing old warrior's medal's bottle.  
You gallop my hollow acid  
like a cordial pheasant to fresh lemon.
