Meeting Your Explication
------------------------
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the soft bridges?  
And the fog thick splattering its essences and changing them full of  
region and bird?  
In the smallest silicon path what abolishes the props of wonder?  
A black and absurd flint is dropped  
in the region.  
Always you petrify through the lunchtime  
Toward the morning silencing lunars.  
When you breathe like nature made by the water.  
A eyeballs and a hand  
chirping the field.  
Like the sterile rusted nail of threads you say, what is the goblet waiting for in its deep brown perfume?  
I tell you it is waiting for foam like you.  
How drinking is the lovely explication and it's sensual parallel trapdoorss?  
Not the green moment  
when the twilight creates the corals.  
The flowers exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
in it in darkness.  
We open the halves of a funny things and the  
smothering of salts responds into the perfect divisions.
