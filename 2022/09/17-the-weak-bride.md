The Weak Bride
--------------
But I should be untrue to engineering, changing among its clenched homes  
so  
let  
us seek to tell a story devoid of grammatic redundancies.  
In the first reel, the absent minded man  
is killed by a pioneer. In the second  
take he returns, to divulge and to re-cover.  
Shall we go forward?  
From her finger and her mouth light  
starlights of the earth.  
Always you fly through the holiday  
toward the lunchtime rejecting writings.  
Always you sob through the day  
toward the early light of day shaking hooves.  
For a day, maybe million,  
I rested under  
a harrowing wind  
at  
a post office, waiting for the elder to be amid.
