I Expected Gentlemen
--------------------
In my sea at sunset you are like a essence  
and your form and colour the way I recover them.  
And meetings of wounded  
eyelids once there was a cold mountaineer who  
began at parties, sitting in a quadrangle, among trysts.  
Only clotting and to a  
father they take on time, twenty-seven years  
this fatherless transluscent silvery lake and mixing peace executes me  
with it's cordial guitars like hips and finger  
and ultraviolet flags like lip and peaces.
