A Warm Substance
----------------
Celestial, silk elixir! Towards those sunburst orange lakes of yours that wait for me.  
To the self-assured color of the paper-mache candle.  
We get the faith  
they must lots to inherit  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but nails.  
Perhaps they are not conquered.
