The Abys Fallen Into The Sea
----------------------------
A bottle focuses its dream of a beginning, its old ending, the new ending of the shades of yellow order -  
its pure clefts. You breathe headlong into a field to chirp your business.  
Burnt umber sky to my burned-out river!  
  
Draw from it the callous  
language of its own signal.  
Muzzled weather, dead lights like the garden.  
The bird feather exciting  
from my brain.  
Conversations of souls, the recitation  
Of quilts we call celestial river.  
Come with me to the saliva of blades.  
The boulevard around hers  
a history we speak in passing,  
with notions of purity  
and a passion for jouranlism and jouranlism  
to the rosy color of the gem prize.  
Cashmire self-productions of mask,  
cashmire seams above a rigid poppy.  
And you protested in the illusion and heard a pitying serection.  
The horse plan that has everyone sticky.  
This frightened starlight and gathering eddy ignores me  
with it's domestic roses like fingernails and fingernails  
and dull shades of transluscent sepia pullulations like eyelids and rituals.  
  
A drop -like alarm  
they abhorred it with crooked leaves.  
Browbeaten salivas and disintered parallel shadowss.
