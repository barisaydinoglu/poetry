Technical Productions Are All Among Us
--------------------------------------
Sometimes a piece of the mud  
mourns like a telegraph in my curves.  
Conversations of schools, the recitation  
of leaves we call thick foam.  
One of them is noble,  
the other knows languages.  
Where is nobody  
she quips, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
The guilt lobster blushes inside the incredulous bloods.  
Full stop.  
Billowss of brimstone smoke of a silent airplane  
magnifying behind the universe behind an arrogant train,  
sweet-smelling as a calculating oyster.  
Friendship was no longer above the recording threshold.  
To the fluidic color of the marble apple.  
If I could perfume the jugular and the universe.  
Has the moonlight evening been lighted with funny things?  
  
The cluster plan that has everyone hated.  
This parched farm and pacifying shades of sand-colored conquers me  
with it's profound maternities like leg and breath  
and dark lands like lip and fragrances of strawberry.  
  
Only land, just the  
peace, nothing but  
it. Salt.  
I took on morbid sweetness.  
To the delicious color of the ceramic propeller.  
Nothing but that guitar of ribbons.  
Draw from it the misunderstood  
camera of its own production.
