Since The End Of Pacifying
--------------------------
My heart moves from being sterile to being monastic. I am condemned by green car and thorn tree, by stalactite and sunshine.  
And the salt to its form  
and among the fountains the infinite one  
the mountaineer covered with real alcove.  
From her brow and her toe seek  
branches of the earth.  
Always you compound through the lunchtime  
toward the sunrise abolishing paths.
