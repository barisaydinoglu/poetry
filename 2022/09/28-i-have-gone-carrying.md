I Have Gone Carrying
--------------------
There ought to be a candle of a starry railroad track kissing in a moonlight evening.  
In the lewd room of fuming landscape.  
But I should be untrue to science, wiping among its clotting faucets  
so let us try to tell a story without minor redundancies.  
Neither candle nor stalks of cattail nor opaque black  
nor deep brown but green.  
Behind the decadent boulevard of forceful smooth steel.  
Only fractious and to a  
uncle they take on time, too many to count years  
what incredulous lands -  
the night is filled with it,  
laws for the sea water and the nauesous silicon.  
Be guided by the round vein's perfume.  
I took on fragmented prizes.  
I salute your lovely wine  
and envy your mineral pride.  
Fatherless weather, demonic lights like the tryst.  
Of stationary lemon, spirit  
of the smooth broken glasses,  
killed person blood, your kisses  
blush into exile  
and a droplet of fused quartz, with remnants of the jungle.  
Fisherman of the depths of my toe - your refreshing  
stills your fresh regard as though it were earth.  
Your eyelids entertains from north to west  
protest me and let my substance make.  
It's a seizing elixir of jugulars.  
You are the cherry of my ghostly breath.  
In the first take, the delicious son  
is deluded by a father. In the second  
scene he returns, to swim and to dawn.  
  
And amid my hammock, during the night, I woke up naked  
and full of respect.  
Force me and let my substance enchant.  
You say, what is the foliage waiting for in its cashmire hat?  
I tell you it is waiting for salt like you.  
In the face of so many shortcuts to positivity.
