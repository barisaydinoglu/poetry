The Calculation Called The Lip
------------------------------
The nature knows this,  
that life in it's silicon boxes is as endless as the smooth sand. The throat re-covers on its insatiable mare  
forming sunburst orange keys over the boulevard.  
Yellow depths of enemy,  
green seams above a insatiable foliage.  
  
And you foreboded in the illusion and inherited a falling  
billows of dull shades of sepia smoke.  
If you were not the grape the careful moon  
cooks, sprinkling its lemon across the city.
