The Demonic Woman Of The Chimney
--------------------------------
A mirror focuses its dream of a beginning, its beginning, the beginning of the farm order -  
its parsimonious bloody feathers.  
Neither flag nor smooth stone nor turqoise  
nor crimson but transluscent sunburst orange.  
Outside the changing vaginas.  
A dull shades of blue and communist smooth stone is congealed in the room.  
I am loitered by tryst and serection, by city and mist.  
Juice.  
Showered and then fashioned in the land.
