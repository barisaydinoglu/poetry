Elders Of A Obscene Country
---------------------------
As if to harass or rise or delude.  
Around the moonlight evening I like to build like a directionless blue lake.  
Because I love you, love, among the mud and in the lava.  
Like distorted telegraph, sun rises  
in the first scene, the vertical mother  
is protested by an aunt. In the second  
take he returns, to transform and to pulse.  
You see fingernails as resplendent as the drizzle.  
Draw from it the tenacious  
language of its own point of view.  
Like imperfect crystals faltering inside elixirs.  
Shining a pullulation  
recovered in the serene sun. Neither shades of marine nor stars in the sky nor opaque dark  
nor sand-colored but opaque cinnamon.  
I took on dry bird feathers.  
What we say enriches to  
awaken some other child  
what a synonym may teach.  
The bride smiles  
at the sailor  
but the bride does not smile  
when he looks at the lobster father  
and the clotting ocean.
