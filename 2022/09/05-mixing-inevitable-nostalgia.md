Mixing Inevitable Nostalgia
---------------------------
You see heart as absent minded as the sun.  
A current of sensible current  
that does not know why it flows and lights.  
All natures become lonely roads. A loaf of bread baked with bitterest pride and salt.  
Once there was a insufferable goddess who  
entertained at parties, sitting in a loop, among femininities.
