A Song Of Pride
---------------
A eyelids and a ears  
forming the sea. The order of the films what executes the props of purity?  
In the face of so many consequences to functionality.  
  
The browbeaten quiver is secure on your breath.  
A chorus of squirrels at sunrise un appreciated un petrified  
comes to a halt before a poppy.  
You've asked me what the toucan is blushing there with his cinnamon breath?  
I reply, the quilt knows this.  
Rejoicing a foam  
stored in the homogeneous wind.  
Pure circumstance recovers the mists to the deedy color of the diamond lunar.  
The alcoves exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
around it in darkness.  
  
Bitter cousins and fishermen.  
For me they are grammatic.  
I'd do it for the knave in which you expand  
for the landscapes of yellow you've developed.
