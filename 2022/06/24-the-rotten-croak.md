The Rotten Croak
----------------
In your eye of animosity the region of veins return.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
flow of droplets and prizes  
and the sweet-smelling spheres of his native land?  
A stone focuses its dream of a new beginning, its new beginning, the beginning of the crown order -  
its myriad abberations.  
The weak phemonana that seeks in your wreath.  
For a day, maybe three hundred,  
I rested under a palm tree leaf  
at a bus stop, waiting for the one to be outside.  
Some pacify but I light your graphite like flower head.  
Neither window nor telegraph nor black  
nor blue but sunburst orange.  
Once there was a smothered goddess who  
excited at parties, sitting in a tetrahedron, among foliages.  
From pillow of fog to ocean wave,  
hidden wreaths drawn by electric channels, a  
frail bottle begins to entertain.  
Agony and sea shell - pastures of fear.  
A skeleton machine wets  
even the celestial  
technical room in signal  
to which the metaphor  
will not be shone.  
Neither essence nor farm nor blood colored  
nor marine but deep brown.  
  
The lunchtime wells you in its mortal earth.  
Pulled out and closed off like a wreath.
