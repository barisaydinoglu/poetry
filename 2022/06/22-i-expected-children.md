I Expected Children
-------------------
Noone here is waiting for the next  
essence.  
Eddy. You shone  
yourself for growing.  
Like the violenet ash of telegraphs in the smallest copper sea shell indicates the wine bottle's refreshing hips.  
Only windy and to a  
goddess they take on time, thousand years  
we get the meaning  
they must lots to magnify  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but whispers.  
Perhaps they are not undulated.  
Closed off and pulled out like a tryst.  
Somber, crystal silence!  
Of aquatic wine, spirit  
of the mists,  
congealed mother blood, your kisses  
connect into exile  
and a droplet of cedar, with remnants of the university.  
The curtain electrifies, the flesh of lion hearted  
understands inside.  
The cosmic maternities froze I stayed relaxed and sunburst orange  
inside the university.  
  
Wave of wave of bridges rolling down the sea.  
In your foot of beligerance the chimney of lighthouses blossom.
