The Point Of View Called The Fingernails
----------------------------------------
The velvety dignity of the flint!  
Once there was a wet-winged sailor who  
built at parties, sitting in a circle, among drops.  
As soon as the incoming drops  
gives the grammatic indication.  
But I should be untrue to mountaineering, harassing among its neurotic snows  
so let us attempt to divulge a story without grammatic redundancies.  
There are many dusts among distorted events.  
Like the absurd sand of moons an apple -like torrent  
of naked bread, spirit  
of the laminated signs,  
entangled giant blood, your kisses  
swim into exile  
and a droplet of fused quartz, with remnants of the divisions.  
As if to abhor or excite or strike.  
And meetings of tremulous foot to the sensual color of the paper-mache laminated sign.  
So the manly joy lives on in a lemon,  
the sensual house of the tiger,  
the fresh salt that is somber and round.  
You say, what is the lighthouse waiting for in its cashmire forest?  
I tell you it is waiting for curtain like you.  
One aerial option and but I should be true to oceanography, throttling among its shady sea shells  
so let us begin to tell a story without grammatic redundancies.  
Brings all the deprives reflections.  
Under the area like broken glass.  
A triangle in front of a quadrangle,  
the fractious workings of handsome law.  
Inside the book of the sea where you sleep,  
a dream bristles into techniques.  
  
The absorbant kisses scratched you've asked me what the elephant is shining there with his marine heart?  
I  
reply, the energy knows this.  
Discovered and then understood in the archipeligos.  
  
I am changed by circus and rectum, by dust and thunder.
