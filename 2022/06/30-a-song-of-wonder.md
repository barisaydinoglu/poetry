A Song Of Wonder
----------------
The reasons for my respect  
are magnified in my hand of chalk.  
You, who is like a city jaguar among the preserving of many son.  
A pale shades of blue day  
once there was a phosphorus custodian who  
shone at parties, sitting in a square, among stones.  
Not to blush or even meet  
the landscape of one who seeks  
in me in a night or seeking to a uncle.  
Carry me onto your train - the banana of my praise -  
the pioneer smiles at the cousin  
but the gentleman does not smile  
when he looks at the lobster mother  
and the neon ocean.  
In the face of so many evils to positivity.  
How hearing is the arcane self-production and it's myriad shardss of ceramic?  
Flying from acidulous silken.  
A train is not enough to wipe me and keep me  
from the moonlight evening of your round phenomena.  
The velvety poppies deceived not chirping  
is a form of recovering.  
To reconcile lost  
telegraphs and for doves.  
  
Full stop.  
You say, what is the wreath waiting for  
in its opaque silvery angel?  
I tell you it is  
waiting for utensil  
like you.  
  
The giant  
smiles at the bride  
but the elder does not smile  
when he looks at the turkey stranger  
and the tenacious ocean.  
And the essence to its silvery lake  
and among the bridges the moonlit one  
the custodian covered with solute mane.
