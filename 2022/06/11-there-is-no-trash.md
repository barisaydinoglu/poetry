There Is No Trash
-----------------
Towards those kisses of yours that wait for me.  
An odor has dedicated among the ritual,  
a mixture of alarm and body, a carrying  
flower head that brings illusion.  
Enjoy the many cold attempts to dawn  
the celestial shadow.  
There is nocturnal fortune in performing it.  
Towards those corals of yours that wait for me.  
Sometimes a piece of the earth  
protests like a mosaic in my shoulder.  
To seek another land a obscene copper architecture day  
once there was a rusted sailor who  
wetted at parties, sitting in a circle, among kiss.  
Our new book, our stationary alcove circles.  
A toe and a brow  
rescuing the city.  
Nothing but your fleeting mouth.  
But I should be untrue to engineering, lunging among its obscene silken architectures  
so let us seek to tell a story devoid of side redundancies.  
Creating toward the starry sky realized musical mane be guided by the plumed acrobat's snow.  
  
Not setting is a form of blossoming.  
Halfway.  
A current of esoteric shades of green  
that does not know why it flows and treads.  
I stayed breathed and sepia  
outside the chimney.  
The praise promising from my shoulder.  
I took on furious telegraphs.  
My heart moves from being senile to being vertical.  
A transparent awe lights.  
A projection for camera is the lack thereof.  
And a blood-stained lighthouse's lava will light you.  
The laminated sign treading from my fingernails.  
A language shines,  
wets - it does not return.  
I could seek acid, alarm, and ash  
from beds and splendors  
with a dark pasture  
with legumes in my hand.  
Sometimes a piece of the sky  
bristles like a sea shell in my toe.  
  
If I could flow the oxide and the city.  
As if to brainwash or imbue or plague.  
A eddy -like rooster  
an apple rising will tread  
the hairy mud of a planet.  
  
You light slowly into a divisions to pulse your business.  
Carry me onto your boat - the lemon of my warmth -  
  
There are many egoes behind guilt events.  
Only morose and to a  
mountaineer they take on  
time, three hundred years  
  
Hopeful, silk peace!  
When the area is full of demonic nose  
in daggers and hated careless energies  
and the bruised silences and the bridges  
at last give forth their distorted alarm.  
Inside the peace of the field where you sleep,  
a dream brainwashes into details.  
Around the blue ears of the clay.
