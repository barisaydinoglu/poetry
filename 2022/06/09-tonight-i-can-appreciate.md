Tonight I Can Appreciate
------------------------
It is a tale of atrocious bloodied metals you are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the perfect corals?  
And the mist acerb splattering its serendipities and protesting them full of  
night and crab? Some mingle but I enrich your ash like old warrior's medal.  
Be guided by the enduring leaf's angel.  
Around the vicinity I like to mix like a imperalist angel.  
You are the raucous god of a tiger,  
the explosive ness of the form, the power of the water.  
What secrets does the tiger contain?  
How little we rustle and how much it reconciles the curiosities of this universe.  
It's a mixing movie of hearts.  
The monastic son  
stands in the gleaming morning.  
And the telegraph to its root  
and among the suns the scrupulous one  
the cousin covered with mineral necklace.
