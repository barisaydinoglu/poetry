What Is True Of The Mirror Is True Of Everything
------------------------------------------------
When you perch dedicated like an acrobat.  
You are the rotten astronaut of a bird,  
the demonic ness of the forest, the power of the earth.  
A misunderstood metaphor ignores  
even the hopeful  
overtone heights in technique  
to which the metaphor  
will not be entertained.  
A rain of goblets the silk architecture knows this,  
that life in it's cedar boxes is as endless as the kis.  
Like the bitter sand of kiss towards those flutes of yours that wait for me.  
I was without doubt the one tiger  
there in the fatherless thicket.  
When it looked me with its lovely coral eyes  
it had neither hand nor hand  
but diamond droplets on its sides.  
Always you filter through the midnight  
toward the morning lunging warmths.
