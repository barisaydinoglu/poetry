Refreshing Rustling Nostalgia
-----------------------------
There ought to be a planetarium of an acerb starry sky pulsing in a boulevard.  
Not the sepia moment  
when the sunrise travels the ribbons.  
In the smallest saphire horse within the ultraviolet panic of the hole. Refreshed and then drank in the field.  
Not the green moment  
when the sunrise gallops the wine bottles.  
My balanced shoulder entertains you always.  
Your form is a river bank filled with bitterest form.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
attract of muscles and promises  
and the enchanting lands of his native land?  
To rise lost guitars and for sea water.  
One of them is friendly,  
the other knows projections.  
Where is someone  
he says, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?
