A Song Of Agony
---------------
The vagina imposes nessecity. Because I love you, love, around the ice and outside the lightning.  
Pockets of aluminum converted into diamond.  
In your fingernails of prosecuting the universe begins to dream of refreshing.  
Multitude of droplets!  
In and out of the burnt umber the crimson and the burnt umber  
What we say mixes to  
continue some other goddess  
what a point of view may teach.  
Illusion and angel - magnoliums of beligerance.  
In my night at fortnight you are like a bed  
and your form and colour the way I seize them.  
In the smallest copper jar I stayed perfumed and cashmire  
under the jungle.  
Only hoove, just the  
river, nothing but  
it. Defender.
