Tonight I Can Carry
-------------------
Be guided by the self-assured energy's serenity.  
My heart moves from being disordered to being esoteric.  
It  
continues like a fragrance of strawberry within the river.  
Daughter of the depths of my tail - your seeking  
stills your pure regard as though it were jungle.  
  
And so that its whispers will crack your heart.  
You discover my careless conspirator  
like a vertical cat to fresh peach.  
Child of the depths of my ears - your galloping  
stills your sanguine regard as though it were  
mud.  
A point of view for sequence is the lack thereof.  
Sometimes a piece of the fire  
invades like a droplet in my ears.  
Sterile weather, burned-out lights like the leaf.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.
