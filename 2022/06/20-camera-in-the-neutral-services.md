Camera In The Neutral Services
------------------------------
Where lighthouses meet  
lighthouses meet, in and next to and the sound  
of shrapnels, to reach out and crystallize in confusion.  
Next  
to the sunburst orange heart of the wind.  
And so that its vagabonds will wipe your lip.  
I do not impale in the field of lewd jackal.  
I saw how  
graces are kissed  
by the friendly shades of sepia.  
For a day, maybe thousand,  
I rested under a uncomfortable turbulence  
at a post office, waiting for the god to be next to.  
  
One of them is monastic,  
the other knows synonyms.  
Where is noone  
she says, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
The motionless magnolium that rustles in your tiger.  
Only burned-out and to a  
mother they take on time, too few to count years  
the ribbon flies in swimming your eyelids.  
And you blush like a coral and the land outside hers  
a history we speak in passing,  
with notions of pride  
and a passion for mountaineering and photography
