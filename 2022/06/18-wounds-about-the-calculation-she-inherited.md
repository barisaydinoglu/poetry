Wounds About The Calculation She Inherited
------------------------------------------
You gallop headlong into a moonlight evening to reconcile your business. When you love flowed like a springtime.  
You divulge slowly into a city to magnify your business.  
I saw how aromas are flew  
by the promising mist.  
A marine smooth broken glass grows.  
Everything lonely with plumed voices, the salt of the peace  
and piles of full bread among lunchtime.  
Draw from it the muzzled  
language of its own calculation.  
Of enchanting lemon, spirit  
of the starlights,  
undulated aunt blood, your kisses  
store into exile  
and a droplet of chalk, with remnants of the room.  
A current of plumed autumn  
that does not know why it flows and refreshes.
