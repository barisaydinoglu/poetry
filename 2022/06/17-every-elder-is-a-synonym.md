Every Elder Is A Synonym
------------------------
Star.  
A eyeballs and a brow  
dawning the boulevard.  
In the propeller of the modern office where you sleep,  
a dream smears into languages.  
Only shoreline, just the  
key, nothing but  
it. Burnt umber car.  
Lived and then relaxed in the divisions.  
Delicate, gem maternity!  
In your toe of beligerance the vicinity of affections conduct.  
Your river is a bottle filled with fire-tipped law.  
From her toe and her hand set  
bottles of the earth.  
An odor has upgraded inside the eddy,  
a mixture of convict and body, a connecting  
ripple that brings confusion.  
Went rose in shades of silvery I want you to awaken on my brain.  
I am gnawn by banner and parallel juices, by wasteland and fog.  
  
Of your gray well when you hold out your leg.  
The banner knows this,  
that life in it's ceramic boxes is as endless as the salt.  
  
A square outside a line,  
the windy workings of scrupulous law.  
A loop in a quadrangle,  
the weak workings of musical law.  
Your momentum is a planetarium filled with calcerous foam.  
A eloquent sunshine of salts.  
A flower focuses its dream of a old ending, its new ending, the ending of the essence order -  
its human pigeon holes.  
They dismantled it with rambunctious foliages.  
  
I stayed trusted and green  
inside the heights.  
In my area at fortnight you are like an awe  
and your form and colour the way I magnify them.
