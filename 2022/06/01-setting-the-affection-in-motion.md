Setting The Affection In Motion
-------------------------------
The depth trusts on its brutal mare  
showering silvery shorelines over the vicinity.  
Halfway.  
Wave of wave of aspens rolling down the sea.  
Starry, fused quartz key!  
Shifty bloodied clays and negligent legless horses.  
A curves and an arm  
dedicating the heights.  
A brow and a hand  
performing the moonlight evening.
