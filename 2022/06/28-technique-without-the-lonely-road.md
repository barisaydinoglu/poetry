Technique Without The Lonely Road
---------------------------------
In the first reel, the celestial mother  
is crushed by a uncle. In the second  
scene he returns, to gallop and to recover.  
Shall we recount?  
And meetings of worn-out eyelids where suns meet  
wells meet, in and outside and the sound  
of serections, to reach out and  
make in panic.  
In the smallest silicon droplet woke and then sought in the heights.  
Egoes of a difficult train  
flowing in front of the boulevard among an atrocious car,  
original as a senile crab.  
A foot and a toe  
shining the region.  
  
To the humble aquatic eddy the vertical railroad track gave it joy.  
And meetings of clenched nose on what acidulous self-productions swam with lightning?  
With its tenacious connect the sea's skin knows this,  
that life in it's paper-mache boxes is as endless as the praise.  
And hats and branches.  
What is this point of view but a memory deformed of its sun rises?  
A chorus of iguanas at sunset un excited un throttled  
comes to a halt before a promise.  
Shall we keep going?  
The reasons for my respect  
are flowed in my eyeballs of paper-mache.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
hear of quilts and laws  
and the celestial roses of his native land?  
Crystallizing the ship of her branch full of respect.  
And the evening star to its awe  
and among the flower heads the serendipidous one  
the giant covered with vertical coral.
