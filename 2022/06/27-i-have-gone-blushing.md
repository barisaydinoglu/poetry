I Have Gone Blushing
--------------------
Amid the brimstone fear of the womb.  
The pure wheatfield gave it tiredness.  
You, who is like a oxide lobster among the wetting of many goddess.  
It's a protecting flag of wombs.  
Only lemon, just the  
magnolium, nothing but  
it. Root.  
Like croaks decaying around mists.  
And meetings of nauesous ears outside the mourning evening star, many difficult conglomerates.  
Some protect but I drink your broken glass like nature.  
  
The parsimonious daughter  
dedicates in the resolute morning.  
Brings all the penetrates threads.
