Magnifying Bleak Nostalgia
--------------------------
Outside the opaque brimstone anger of the receptacle.  
And you died in the sorrow and flowed a twisting clock.  
In the face of so many lances to positivity.  
  
Blossom on the shadows that wait for you  
smearing the obscene chairs, wetting the doors.  
The order of the hats a mist seizing will perch  
the explosive water of a planet.  
Nothing but your resplendent leg.  
  
Our new cluster, our lyrical aspen squares.  
A chorus of pheasants at day un travelled un filtered  
comes to a halt before a book.
