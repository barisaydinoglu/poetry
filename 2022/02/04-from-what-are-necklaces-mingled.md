From What Are Necklaces Mingled
-------------------------------
It is a tale of disintered darkness your nose promises from east to south  
the awes exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
outside it in darkness.  
Fewer and fewer  
twist about another mode of pride.  
There are no receptacles but phosphorus cycles of farm and yellow  
mirrors of clear bitten steel.  
The man smiles at the sailor  
but the daughter does not smile  
when he looks at the lobster father  
and the acidulous ocean.  
On what calcerous dusts formed with ice?  
In your breath of foreboding the chimney begins to dream of waking.
