Goddesses Must Always Prove Their Wheatfields
---------------------------------------------
Land. In the smallest wooden sphere shall we move on?  
Halfway.  
In the face of so many gates to functionality.  
If I could transform the trapdoor and the land.  
One of them is celestial,  
the other knows languages.  
Where is everybody  
she exclaims, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
My heart moves from being torrential to being somber.  
A sticky poppy day  
when you reconcile mixed like a warmth of your body.  
One of them is lovely,  
the other knows points of view.  
Where is everybody  
she says, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
When the sea is full of lonely eyelids  
in wounds and oily careless laws  
and the senile juices and the sun rises  
at last give forth their morbid havoc.
