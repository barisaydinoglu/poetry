The Lard Fallen Into The Sea
----------------------------
Among yellow water and burnt umber bird feathers.  
It was a whirlwinds of business of salt and depths.  
In the face of so many vigils to animosity.  
Faucet of a plagued nauesous map.  
Enjoy the many muzzled attempts to inherit  
the solute flame.  
There is sensible fortune in re-covering it.  
I'm the child to the reflection of immediate lunar.  
Only clotting and to a  
goddess they take on time, million years  
On what fuming extinctions upgraded with mud? With its nauesous rustle for a day, maybe twenty-seven,  
I rested under a blade of grass  
at a bus stop, waiting for the bride to be among.  
When you play gathered like a pasture.  
In your leg of loathing the land begins to dream of blushing.  
Everybody here is waiting for the next aroma.  
Bed. You continued yourself for rescuing.
