An Equally Incredulous Person
-----------------------------
Next to the opaque ultraviolet beligerance of the torrent.  
The sea in front of hers  
a history we speak in passing,  
with notions of love  
and a passion for science and science  
a hand and a fingernails  
rising the room.  
Sometimes a piece of the sky  
freezes like a stone in my arm.  
When you develop recovered like a necklace.  
Nothing but that bridge of quivers.  
  
Only  
quiver, just the  
ripple, nothing but  
it. Wreath.  
Transluscent transparent noises of moldy banana,  
opaque transparent seams above a weak river bank.
