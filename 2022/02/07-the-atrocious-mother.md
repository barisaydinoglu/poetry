The Atrocious Mother
--------------------
A honest mist of homes. For a day, maybe three hundred,  
I rested under a blade of grass  
at a bus stop, waiting for the cousin to be within.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
  
Angellic, diamond cathedral!  
I saw how old warrior's medals are rescued  
by the essential springtime.
