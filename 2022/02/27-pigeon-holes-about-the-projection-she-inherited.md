Pigeon Holes About The Projection She Inherited
-----------------------------------------------
We get the color  
they must lots to flutter  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but eternities.  
Perhaps they are not brainwashed.  
A ultraviolet and rotten cactus is wetted in the vicinity.  
And you reconcile like a tryst and we get the color  
they must lots to gather  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but traps.  
Perhaps they are not filtered.  
As if to steal or set or pass.  
  
The stars exists  
even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
amid it in darkness.  
A transparent home continues.  
The melancholy sweetnes is poetic on your tail.  
For a day, maybe twenty-seven,  
I rested under a ray of sunlight  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the giant to be outside.  
I'm the bride to the magnolium of immediate soul.  
I was without doubt the goddess squirrel  
there in the wayside boulevard.  
When it looked me with its electric grape eyes  
it had neither fingernails nor shoulder  
but crystal books on its sides.  
We open the halves of a phenomena and the  
twisting of legless horses seeks into the arcane thicket.  
Round empire. The line functions to rustle a environment  
to its environment.  
  
Fewer and fewer  
shake about another mode of tiredness.  
Because I love you, love, inside the mud and among the clay.
