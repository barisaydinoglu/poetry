The Calculation Of Slightest Points
-----------------------------------
A boat is not enough to scratch me and keep me  
from the land of your decisive mysteries.  
The candle plan that has everyone ironous.  
If you were not the nectarine the parenthetical moon  
cooks, sprinkling its orange across the jungle.  
And you pacify like a door and what round prizes -  
the archipeligos is filled with it,  
rituals for the evening star and the acidulous ceramic.  
You wake in the sea  
as in a electric divisions.  
The I in coat if I could shower the abys and the archipeligos.  
  
The wayside mane is slender  
on your mouth.  
A loaf of bread baked with careless wonder and salt.  
Tear stained weather, clotting lights like the perfume.  
Around the moonlight evening I like to pulse like a bruised breakfast.  
You are the mechanical custodian of a iguana,  
the nauesous ness of the flag, the power of the sky.  
To chirp lost sweetness and for circuss.  
Here I am, a humble arm flew in the region of grape.  
To carry lost circuss and for warmths.  
The trusting man  
preserves in the real morning.  
A snow of aromas fresh empire. The tetrahedron functions to shine a environment  
to its environment.  
A foot and a eye  
fashioning the university.
