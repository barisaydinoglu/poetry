Metaphor With The Clock
-----------------------
A pure carpet making an aquatic thing of a impossible meeting with a pioneer.  
What is this inscription but a memory  
prosecuted of its friendships?  
Halfway.  
The natural tryst gave it honor.  
Of enduring nectarine, spirit  
of the landscapes,  
forced sailor blood, your kisses  
swim into exile  
and a droplet of cedar, with remnants of the thicket.  
Our new praise, our parenthetical flint squares.  
Your finger trusts from east to north  
if you were not the grape the gleaming moon  
cooks, sprinkling its lemon across the moonlight evening.  
The echo drinking from  
my breath.  
Flesh was no longer  
above the recording threshold.  
Here I am, a honest leg passed in the area of river bank.  
You say, what is the foam waiting for in its opaque opaque silvery stalks of cattail?  
I tell you it is waiting for sea's skin like you.
