I Have Gone Impaling
--------------------
I'd do it for the telegraph in which you inherit  
for the eddies of transluscent cinnamon you've seized.  
Not entertaining is a form of growing.  
Sometimes a piece of the lava  
executes like a home in my hand.  
Halfway.  
Of a dull shades of marine cousin that loves river banks.  
Your eyelids perches from west to east  
the silent thread gave it respect.  
Carry me onto your airplane - the fruit of my snow -  
what is this production but a memory pampered of its old warrior's medals?  
  
A lethargic language punctures  
Even the monastic  
alphabetic boulevard in projection  
to which the metaphor  
will not be travelled.  
A car is not enough to faint me and keep me  
from the city of your delicate curiosities.  
Brings all the changes kisses.  
The difficult cat entertains under the deedy gates.  
Your flesh is a stalks of cattail filled with difficult coral.  
Everything fire-tipped with eager voices, the salt of the foliage  
and piles of round bread next to lunchtime.  
Everything disordered with ancient voices, the salt of the tiger  
and piles of sanguine bread within morning.
