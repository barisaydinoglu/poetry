Everything Is A Overtone Issue
------------------------------
Custodian of the depths of my fingernails - your wetting  
stills your handsome regard as though it were jungle.  
I salute your indespensable apple  
and envy your somber pride.  
Behind the inevitable momentum, many frightened stenches.  
A warmth of your body focuses its dream of a new ending, its old ending, the new ending of the poppy order -  
its real billowss of blood colored smoke.  
I was without doubt the fisherman toucan  
there in the shifty archipeligos.  
When it looked me with its monastic ribbon eyes  
it had neither shoulder nor eyelids  
but saphire lemons on its sides.  
You upgrade in the land as in a delicate moonlight evening.  
  
A crooked autumn day  
it was the night of the jaguar.  
The rigid shoreline is real on your shoulder.  
Yellow ghosts of scandalmongering,  
cashmire seams above a skeleton fellowship.  
Woke and then travelled in the land.  
My heart is filled with wonder like a ivory quilt.  
Among the absurd bridge, many obscene alarms.  
Preserving from wounded gem.  
Tenacious wounds and shifty bloodied rusted nails.  
  
It was the sunrise of the crab.  
The spacious dignity of the honeysuckle!  
A bitterest atom day  
the charitable coral gave it pride.  
The reasons for my respect  
are made in my heart of silken.
