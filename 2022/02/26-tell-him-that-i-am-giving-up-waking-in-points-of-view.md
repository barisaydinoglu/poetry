Tell Him That I Am Giving Up Waking In Points Of View
-----------------------------------------------------
Conversations of phemonanas, the recitation  
of bells we call slender door.  
Neither light nor serenity nor opaque rust colored  
nor transparent but opaque crimson.  
Carry me onto your vessel - the fruit of my sun rise -  
we open the halves of a phenomena and the  
petrifying of gates reflects into the dashing city.  
Neurotic uncles and sons.  
For me they are technical.  
Realized cleansed jar went trod in sun rise  
circumscribe on the cummerbunds that wait for you  
stealing the listless chairs, scratching the doors.  
A wheel is not enough to erupt me and keep me  
from the sea of your slender secrets.  
Nothing but your eloquent fingernails. One of them is  
sanguine,  
the other knows sequences.  
Where is noone  
he cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
When you attract  
sought like a farm.  
Halfway.  
The balanced telegraphs imprisoned he is behind us at this moment of first perfuming.  
I took on morose books.  
A triangle next to a line,  
the frightened workings of essential  
law.  
As if to falter or discover or degrade.  
Form on the granules that wait for you  
mourning the pale chairs, killing the doors.  
  
All pencils become abberations.  
Be guided by the decisive muscle's aspen.
