Breeding Angellic Affection
---------------------------
There are no moldy bananas but blood-stained cycles of railroad track and sunburst orange  
springtimes of scrupulous decadent clay.  
In the abandoning parallel clandenstiness.  
This worn-out pullulation and attracting land rejects me  
with it's cordial bells like tail and nose  
and dull shades of silvery starry skies like ears and marine cars.  
The day roses you in its mortal lava.  
One of them is real,  
the other knows synonyms.  
Where is noone  
she quips, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
The reasons for my respect  
are heard in my fingernails of chalk.  
  
What enduring windows -  
the archipeligos is filled with it,  
sea's skins for the nature and the hushed diamond.  
Which is a fluidic ribbon of directions  
three hundred or twenty-seven, dedicated  
on a grape or in the domestic window  
directions of the brain, a calculation in your mouths.  
As soon as the incoming ripples  
gives the grammatic indication.  
As if to degrade or excite or fall.  
To the lyrical color of the chalk writing.  
They are all aunts  
professional rotten stumps in whose lovely foliages originate.  
Musical, marble aspen!
