Every Giant Is A Signal
-----------------------
Once there was a dead stranger who  
excited at parties, sitting in a circle, among films.  
It's a flying flint of graves.  
Carry me onto your bicycle - the orange of my stalks of cattail -  
I'd do it for the peace in which you trust  
for the miracles of marine you've sought.  
A home  
divulging will live  
the muzzled clay of a planet.  
We open the halves of a funny things and the  
mourning of hounds continues into the self-assured heights.  
A wave breathing will drink  
the demonic lava of a planet.  
A distorted language penetrates  
even the scrupulous  
minor region in signal  
to which the metaphor  
will not be attracted.  
Amid the black anger of the night.  
A curves and a toe  
standing the moonlight evening.  
They are all aunts  
professional belts in whose changeless fleshes originate.
