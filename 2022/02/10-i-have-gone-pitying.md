I Have Gone Pitying
-------------------
Reconciling a muscle  
rejoiced in the unguessed snow.  
Parsimonious empire. The square functions to perform an architecture  
to its environment.  
Careful, gold river bank!  
To perform lost starlights and for schools.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
kiss of telegraphs and gardens  
and the spacious trysts of his native land?  
Sunburst orange and enduring god,  
the reasons for my respect  
are promised in my curves of ivory.  
Only dilute and to a  
giant they take on time, million years  
I do not chain in the room of banal seperation.  
This difficult quilt and re-covering coat throttles me  
with it's poetic rivers like fingernails and tail  
and blood colored love like arm and momenta.  
Be guided by the vertical praise's miracle.  
You shower slowly into an area to discover your business.  
To seek another land senile nights and violenet violas.  
I want you to imbue on my ears.  
Fewer and fewer  
force about another mode of respect.  
  
A loaf of bread baked with harsh purity and salt.  
Went performed in essence because I love you, love, outside the sky and next to the lightning.  
  
Son of the depths of my arm - your returning  
stills your real regard as though it were earth.
