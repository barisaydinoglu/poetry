Breeding Delicate Affection
---------------------------
To seek another land I took on rambunctious landscapes.  
What mysteries does the ostrich contain?  
How little we magnify and how much it relaxes the secrets of this universe.  
In the first take, the homogeneous mountaineer  
is abolished by a son. In the second  
reel he returns, to magnify and to develop.  
Salt of a smothered smothered bird feather.  
It travels like a smooth brick with the old warrior's medal.  
You wet slowly into an archipeligos to reconcile your business.  
I saw how beds are relaxed  
by the noble warmth.  
But I should be true to oceanography, abhorring among its banal wine bottles  
so let us begin to tell a story without neutral redundancies.  
To the human color of the paper-mache femininity.  
Where candles meet  
keys meet, with and outside and the sound  
of pigeon holes, to reach  
out and drink in illusion.  
My heart is filled with honor like a glass grace.  
  
This delirious shades of cinnamon and upgrading springtime rejects me  
with it's slender breakfasts like foot and fingernails  
and dark  
manes like nose and silences.  
The reasons for my respect  
Are pacified in my eyelids of silicon.
