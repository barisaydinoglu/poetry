The Sifted Trap
---------------
The starry sky knows this,  
that life in it's gold boxes is as endless as the bottle.  
The laws exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
inside it in darkness.  
Your burnt umber car  
is a coat filled with hollow stone.  
The afternoon precisions you in its mortal wind.  
Conversations of schools, the recitation  
of keys we call ancient quilt.  
Our new window, our resplendent starlight tetrahedrons.  
In the smallest silicon stone  
swim on the trash barges that wait for you  
scratching the wayside chairs, forcing the doors.  
You say, what is the marine car waiting for in its crimson bottle?  
I tell you it is waiting for maternity like you.  
A rusted splendor day  
a fragrance of strawberry -like granule  
they mutated it with smothered goblets.  
Everything negligent with mineral voices, the salt of the mane  
and piles of cosmic bread behind sunrise.  
And stars and pullulations.
