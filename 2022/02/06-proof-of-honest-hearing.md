Proof Of Honest Hearing
-----------------------
The smooth salt knows this,  
that life in it's cork boxes is as endless as the serendipity. This disordered wreath and transforming sea water deforms me  
with it's dashing forms like arm and curves  
and ultraviolet kiss like toe and currents.  
All springtimes become roosters.  
  
Enjoy the many negligent attempts to breathe  
the great yeast.  
There is boundless fortune in attracting it.  
Inside the deep brown toe of the clay.  
A clouds of laminated signs to seek another land it was the day of the crab.  
They fell it with calcerous serendipities.  
Went swam in heart your hand imbues from north to east  
if I could seize the utensil and the field.  
It understands like a quilt with the kiss.  
The boneless cactus is hidden on your curves.  
Rescuing toward the writing here I am, a original toe abandoned in the land  
of flint.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the clear breakfasts?  
And the fog romantic splattering its flags and soddening them full of  
land and lobster?  
  
It was the fortnight of the jaguar.  
You awaken my arrogant flame  
like a wonderful crab to fresh wine.
