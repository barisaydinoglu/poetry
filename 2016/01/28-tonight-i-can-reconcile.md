Tonight I Can Reconcile
-----------------------
I wish to make a circle  
outside, and every faith, many  
times hidden in a diamond architecture.  
In the smallest saphire shoreline a image relinquishes,  
hates - it does not return.  
But the film blossomed the memory.  
Once  
there was a disordered son who  
recovered at parties, sitting in a line segment, among candles.  
Perfuming from sterile cedar.  
Banal weather, brutal lights like the starry sky.  
  
Lampreys of a lonely helicopter  
appreciating outside the vicinity outside a calculating helicopter,  
starry as a insatiable ostrich.  
There are no violences but pale cycles of dove and green  
beds of real demonic aluminum.  
They changed it with whirlwinds of currents.  
When you mingle reconciled like a railroad track.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
conduct of acrobats and farms  
and the serene rivers of his native land?  
The insufferable alcove that chirps in your ribbon.  
One side option and I salute your perfect cheesecake  
and envy your parenthetical pride.  
They are all cousins  
professional nougats in whose indespensable roses originate.  
  
A helicopter is not enough to sob me and keep me  
from the archipeligos of your comfortable phenomena.  
Swimming toward the poppy and a demonic bed's heat will discover you.  
  
A mosaic performing will magnify  
the hollow sky of a planet.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.
