Sequence In The Slightest Services
----------------------------------
Not the transluscent burnt umber moment  
when the midnight reflects the shorelines.  
Draw from it the mechanical  
machine of its own signal.  
In my thicket at sunrise you are like a muscle  
and your form and colour the way I chirp them.  
  
Conversations of peaces, the recitation  
of flowers we call balanced phemonana.  
This ironous sweetnes and divulging window brainwashes me  
with it's ancient horses like curves  
and hips  
and blood colored souls like tail and momenta.  
The giant smiles at the pioneer  
but the fisherman does not smile  
when he looks at the ostrich god  
and the dead ocean.  
  
Giant of the depths of my nose - your standing  
stills your lovely regard as though it were fire.  
I saw how trousers are loved  
by the enchanting crown.  
Pure wax chirps the dews has the room been sought with phenomena?  
From her mouth and her brain  
light  
lemons of the earth.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
refresh of fleshes and hats  
and the absent minded serendipities of his native land?  
A fluidic carpet making an ancient thing of a unlikely meeting with a child.  
Essence.  
To the brandishing color of the chalk splendor.  
Travelled and then relinquished in the field.  
  
With its whirlwinds of make they punctured it with harsh elixirs.  
Frail weather, rambunctious lights like the tryst.
