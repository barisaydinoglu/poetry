It Trusted With Starlights
--------------------------
The gentleman smiles at the son  
but the daughter does not smile  
when he looks at the oyster woman  
and the inevitable ocean.  
A sunburst orange cathedral seeks.  
To seek another land to the iridescent spacious lemon from uncomfortable turbulence to harrowing wind,  
hidden juices drawn by steady channels, a  
arrogant tiger begins to weave.  
Everything rabid with angellic voices, the salt of the wine bottle  
and piles of electrical bread inside twilight.  
The jungle inside hers  
a story we divulge in passing,  
with notions of respect  
and a passion for computer science and science  
cinnamon electricity to my burned-out key!  
When you understand fashioned like a crown.  
Outside the deceiving dominions.  
Because I love you, love, in front of the mud and next to the mud.  
In the red illusion of the error.  
Distorted beasts and smothered trashes.
