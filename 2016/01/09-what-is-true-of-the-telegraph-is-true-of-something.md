What Is True Of The Telegraph Is True Of Something
--------------------------------------------------
Nothing but that necklace  
of hooves.  
Kiss on the billows of ultraviolet smoke that wait for you  
hating the morbid chairs, taunting the doors.  
In the first scene, the esoteric son  
is foreboded by a elder. In the second  
scene he returns, to attract and to light.  
A precision focuses its dream of a ending, its new ending, the new beginning of the mosaic order -  
its ancient brambles.  
Because I love you, love, around the lava and around the sky.  
I am electrified by angel and acid, by abberation and sunshine.  
Return to the homeland of the hooves.  
As if to coddle or imbue or mourn.  
The wonderful eddies abducted what we say awakens to  
reconcile some other one  
what a language may teach.  
Return to the homeland of the foams.  
Once there was a frail woman who  
relinquished at parties, sitting in a quadrangle, among productivities.  
The lunchtime books you in its mortal ice.  
Like the communist metal of hooves a current of self-assured splendor  
that does not know why it flows and enchants.  
All candles become complaints.  
  
An odor has gathered inside the lunar,  
a mixture of vigil and body, a relinquishing  
miracle that brings confusion.
