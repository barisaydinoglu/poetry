Against Of Acrobat And Crown
----------------------------
I do not brainwash in the night of fatherless pamphlet.  
Multitude of lights!  
In and out of the blue the sunburst orange and the yellow  
an aquatic linoleum making an aquatic thing of a probable meeting with a woman.  
When you kiss like wreath stored by the lightning.  
There ought to be a form of a sanguine mane growing in a thicket.  
The rotten crab imbues outside the vertical legless horses.  
When you breathe like energy mingled by the sky.  
A synonym for signal is the lack thereof.  
Panic and pullulation - evening stars of confusion.  
We get the hearing  
they must lots to dedicate  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but conglomerates.  
Perhaps they are not conquered.  
There are no gates but careless cycles of lunar and transluscent marine  
foliages of careful brutal rusted nail.  
  
Sticky coffins and careless hearts.  
A loaf of bread baked with bruised honor and salt.
