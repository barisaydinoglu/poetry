Since The End Of Harassing
--------------------------
Trash barges of a dry vessel  
setting inside the field around a phosphorus boat,  
musical as a lonely pheasant. I gather as if amid a shaken lonely road.  
A loaf of bread baked with bitter felicity and salt.  
The thorn tree loves on its difficult mare  
kissing cashmire shadess  
of crimson over the field.  
Not to dawn or even meet  
the flint of one who imbues  
inside me in a universe or pulsing to a goddess.  
The cinnamon lake plan that has everyone browbeaten.  
And meetings of rabid heart to the homogeneous color of the copper fellowship.  
If I could dedicate the twisting lonely road and the area.  
When the chimney is full of decadent ears  
among wastelands and phosphorus lashed suns  
and the sticky elixirs and the fellowships  
at last give forth their wounded rooster.  
Towards those horses of yours that wait for me.  
Conversations of hearts, the recitation  
of moons we call serene productivity.  
The receptacle begins on its senile mare  
transforming cashmire femininities over the divisions.  
You upgrade in the chimney as in a balanced divisions.  
Carry me onto your bicycle - the fruit of my dew -  
  
Inside transparent water and transluscent deep brown movies.  
Here I am, a iridescent eyelids foreboded in the room of warmth.
