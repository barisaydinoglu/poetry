The Image Has Not Died The Promise
----------------------------------
If I could tread  
the legume and the night.  
A square inside a line segment,  
the dry workings of perfect law.  
What we say relaxes to  
reconcile some other lady  
what a computer may teach.  
Among transluscent sepia water and cashmire kisses.  
Aunt of the depths of my brow - your re-covering  
stills your real regard as though it were heat.  
Rescuing a bottle  
wetted in the verdure mist.  
  
Shoreline.  
The boneless bird promises outside the velvety panics.
