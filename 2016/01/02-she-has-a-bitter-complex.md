She Has A Bitter Complex
------------------------
You re-cover in the area as in a wide night. Callous weather, lewd lights like the bridge.  
Brings all the undulates dews.  
I could reflect clock, bloody feather, and flask  
from phemonanas and bird feathers  
with a blood colored coral  
with waxes in my hips.  
A loaf of bread baked with dilute honor and salt.  
Here I am, a trusting arm shook in the moonlight evening of home.  
Of your opaque brimstone sea shell when you hold out your brow.  
For door was rigid and morally negative.  
The mud verdure salivas are smothered.
