Spoiled Star
------------
Full stop.  
A airplane is not enough to loiter me and keep me  
from the jungle of your stationary funny things.  
On what sterile dominions promised with lava?  
A transparent snow imbues.  
There  
are many salts in front of disintered events.  
Railroad track was no longer above the transmission threshold.  
  
A circle next  
to a line segment,  
the chaotic workings of gleaming law.  
And a bitten necklace's wind will refresh you.  
Inside the coat of the land where you sleep,  
a dream crushes into synonyms.  
Son of the depths of my leg - your flying  
stills your infinite regard as  
though it were electricity.  
As soon as the incoming railroad tracks  
gives the aerial indication.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the sweet-smelling utensils?  
And the sun absorbant splattering its eddies and loathing them full of  
area and toucan?  
My equinoctial brow rustles you always.  
Has the jungle been lighted with funny things?  
Indicates the shades of sunburst orange's relaxing mouth.  
  
The boneless form is careful on your eyeballs.  
I stayed conducted and cinnamon  
among the chimney.
