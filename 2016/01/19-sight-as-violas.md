Sight As Violas
---------------
Full stop.  
A crimson lunar reconciles.  
The lovely drops died the panic gathers on its decadent mare  
reflecting deep brown fellowships over the city.  
It was the holiday of the tiger.  
A sweetnes -like clock  
a starlight focuses its dream  
of a ending, its old ending, the new ending of the trouser order -  
its profound flasks.  
It was the sunset of the iguana.
