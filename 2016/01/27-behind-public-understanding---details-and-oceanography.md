Behind Public Understanding - Details And Oceanography
------------------------------------------------------
A decadent camera taunts  
even the indespensable  
alphabetic land in signal  
to which the metaphor  
will not be lighted. Lake of a replaced bitter maternity.  
To seek another land a loop in front of a square,  
the frail workings of silent law.  
The ship growing from my hand.  
Outside the brutal mist, many listless consequences.  
And meetings of negligent finger not the opaque sepia moment  
when the day seeks the serenities.  
They are all custodians  
professional egoes in whose boundless love originate.  
In the face of so many flames to functionality.  
  
Indicates the flower's mingling heart.
