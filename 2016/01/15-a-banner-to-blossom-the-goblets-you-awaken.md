A Banner To Blossom The Goblets You Awaken
------------------------------------------
Multitude of branches!  
In and out of the marine the yellow and the transluscent sepia  
neither wine bottle nor faucet nor red  
nor marine but blue.  
You dedicate my wet-winged oxide  
like a somber pheasant to fresh plum.  
Galloping from communist cork.  
Pockets of iron converted into glass.  
You blossom my bleak death  
like a wonderful tiger to fresh plum.  
Around the overflowing sticks.  
Fewer and fewer  
Freeze about another mode of wonder.  
My heart is filled with purity like a saphire drop.  
Like the thirsty metal of writings bottle.
