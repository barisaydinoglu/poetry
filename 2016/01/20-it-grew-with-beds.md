It Grew With Beds
-----------------
When you carry like flower flowed by the earth.  
There ought to be a bridge of a slender stars in the sky carrying in a divisions.  
Shining the perfume of her door full of tiredness.  
In the rigid archipeligos of inaccessible path.  
  
Towards those perfumes of yours that wait for me.  
Everything fuming with poetic voices, the salt of the necklace  
and piles of esoteric bread behind night.
