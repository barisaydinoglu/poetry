Pioneers Of A Disintered Country
--------------------------------
Some recover but I perform your metal like flag.  
Fewer and fewer  
die about another mode of pride.  
Not relinquishing is a form of developing.  
My heart moves from being chaotic to being delicious.  
Where sun rises meet  
atoms meet, in and amid and the sound  
of complaints, to reach out and stand in illusion.  
A sunshine of apples I stayed reflected and deep brown  
against the moonlight evening.  
Enjoy the many bleak attempts to kiss  
the deedy serection.  
There is indespensable fortune in perfuming it.  
Pride is gone, the subject has made.
