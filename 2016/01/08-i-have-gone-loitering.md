I Have Gone Loitering
---------------------
Because I love you, love, among the clay and in front of the sky.  
What abolishes the props of purity?  
The praise knows this,  
that life in it's saphire boxes is as endless as the goblet.  
A current of clear flag  
that does not know why it flows and crystallizes.  
  
Treading toward the map what seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
The order of the prizes a chaotic antenna coagulates  
even the promising  
alphabetic area in synonym  
to which the metaphor  
will not be entertained.  
The wide dignity of the starlight!  
My handsome hand performs you always.
