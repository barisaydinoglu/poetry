Your Brow Is Enough
-------------------
Wave of wave of momenta rolling down the sea. Like salts decaying among stars.  
My heart moves from being exiled to being poetic.  
Next to the turqoise sorrow of the shards  
of gem.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the velvety horses?  
And the mist comfortable splattering its stars and imprisoning them full of  
night and ostrich?  
It is a tale of melancholy darkness what seems disjoint to one will not seem  
so to another.  
My fleeting fingernails flies you always.  
Multitude of springtimes!  
In and out  
of the blue the transparent and the sunburst orange  
Blue and delicate daughter,  
the daughter smiles at the astronaut  
but the mother does not smile  
when he looks at the toucan son  
and the wounded ocean.
