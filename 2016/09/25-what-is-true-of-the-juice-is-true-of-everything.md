What Is True Of The Juice Is True Of Everything
-----------------------------------------------
In your eye of animosity the chimney of foams kiss.  
Tiredness is gone, the subject has preserved.  
From her arm and her fingernails flutter  
sea water of the earth.  
The awe enriching from my breath.  
Infinite, crystal heart!  
Deep brown and dashing lady,  
pockets of metal converted into paper-mache.  
What we say sets to  
chirp some other custodian  
what a metaphor may teach.  
Shut out and closed off like a laminated sign.  
The branch living from my breath.  
When you magnify trod like a heart.  
But the saxophone gathered the memory.  
The city next to hers  
a history we divulge in passing,  
with notions of felicity  
and a passion for computer science and engineering
