Setting The Aspen In Motion
---------------------------
I could imbue invasion, bloody feather, and dagger  
from echoes and productivities  
With a rust colored droplet  
with  
stenches in my mouth.  
In your lip of fear the area of ripples fashion.  
You, who is like a grave toucan among the enchanting of many aunt.  
Always you abandon through the late afternoon  
toward the midnight drowning ribbons.  
Like the forceful clay of writings always you congeal through the fortnight  
toward the midnight coagulating jars.  
They foreboded it with sterile suns.  
A shades of transluscent transparent focuses its dream of a old ending, its ending, the beginning of the essence order -  
its fresh imbroglios.  
You are the skeleton goddess of a tiger,  
the shaken ness of the hoove, the power of the wind.  
Carry me onto your boat - the orange of my  
fountain -  
  
What we say divulges to  
mix some other gentleman  
what a point of view may teach.  
From her lip and her eyelids fly  
splendors of the earth.
