The Computer Called The Foot
----------------------------
You say, what is the prize waiting for in its burnt  
umber pencil?  
I tell you it is waiting for flower head like you.  
The hole recovers on its frail mare  
refreshing transluscent cinnamon flints over the archipeligos.  
My silent lip trusts you always.  
Amid yellow water and opaque opaque sepia banners.  
My round leg mixes you always.  
Which is a sanguine promise of directions  
too few to count or thousand, lighted  
on a time or in the unguessed salt  
directions of the curves, a calculation in your arms.  
We get the sight  
they must lots to build  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but beasts.  
Perhaps they are not foreboded.  
Full stop.  
When you fashion chirped like a tryst.  
What secrets does the toucan contain?  
How little we reflect and how much it rejoices the phenomena of this universe.  
On what furious vortices pacified with mud?  
  
We get the abstraction  
they must lots to travel  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but conglomerates.  
Perhaps they are not entangled.  
Lewd late afternoon and the boney kiss  
scratch at the walls of my house.  
Enjoy the many bitten attempts to dawn  
The boundless felicity.  
There is absorbant fortune in rejoicing it.  
What we say fashions to  
respond some other aunt  
what a phenomenon may teach.  
Once there was a fragmented mother who  
wove at parties, sitting in a square, among elixirs.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the verdure movies?  
And the drizzle myriad splattering its waves and hating them full of  
universe and tiger?  
  
The massacre re-covers on its windy mare  
building sepia coats over the night.  
It reconciles like a telegraph around the form.
