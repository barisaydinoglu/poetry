From What Are Keys Inherited
----------------------------
I am dismantled by tiger and beast, by polyp and clouds.  
Always you pass through the holiday  
toward the afternoon loitering trousers.  
Has the thicket been wetted with secrets?  
Always you loathe through the late afternoon  
toward the twilight mourning manes.  
Lunge me and let my substance wet.  
And among my hammock, during the twilight, I woke up naked  
and full of tiredness.  
The puberty imposes nessecity.  
I took on absurd productivities.  
I saw how serendipities are chirped  
by the spacious quiver.  
Foam was no longer below the transmission threshold.  
Indicates the pencil's rising breath.
