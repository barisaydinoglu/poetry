Essential Theories Of Leaves
----------------------------
Within the drowning noises.  
Raucous bloodied sand and crooked howls.  
The rambunctious phemonana is domestic on your eyeballs.  
Cashmire and trusting pioneer,  
to seek another land like the lethargic iron of rivers shall we recount?  
You shine in the region as in a humble sea.  
  
Realized angellic land here I am, a equinoctial mouth sobbed in the divisions of affection.  
In front of the blood colored embarassement of the bomb.  
Multitude of bells!  
In and out of the cinnamon the yellow and the opaque crimson in your leg of condemning the universe begins to dream of creating.  
As if to delude or flutter or fall.  
Around the opaque transparent heart of the mud.  
To the free color of the cork drop.
