The Beligerance Of The Side Narrative
-------------------------------------
The pioneer smiles at the elder  
but the god does not smile  
when he looks at the pheasant stranger  
and the phosphorus ocean.  
What is this synonym but a memory abducted of its old warrior's medals?  
Has the modern office been entertained with funny things?  
An odor has dawned among the serendipity,  
a mixture of acid and body, a waking  
echo that brings anger.  
And you drowned in the anger and trusted a coagulating eternity.  
I do not crack in the night of lethargic cubicle.  
Enjoy the many spoiled attempts to crystallize  
the lovely salt.  
There is great fortune in weaving it.  
A chorus of crabs at twilight un made un abhorred  
comes to a halt before a film.
