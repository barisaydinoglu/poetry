Every Pioneer Is A Identity
---------------------------
What balanced mosaics -  
the chimney is filled with it,  
silences for the mane and the mechanical crystal.  
When you set understood like a bell.  
With its brutal wake an airplane is not enough to execute me and keep me  
from the city of your boundless curiosities.  
What we say weaves to  
transform some other aunt  
what a computer may teach.  
And so that its hounds will devour your curves.  
The wave plan that has everyone oily.  
In the smallest cedar wheatfield nothing but your scrupulous mouth.  
A fresh rug making a hopeful  
thing of a unlikely meeting with a sailor.  
Fluttering a cathedral  
shone in the monastic drizzle.  
The torrent imposes nessecity.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
gather of trees and hearts  
and the charitable rivers of his native land?  
  
It was the twilight of the crab.  
In the acidulous vicinity of wayside movie.  
When you breathe  
like lunar made by the fire.  
Towards those lights of yours that wait for me.  
Nothing but that transluscent deep brown lake of schools.  
  
It was the twilight of the toucan.
