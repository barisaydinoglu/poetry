Everything Is A Grammatic Issue

Indicates the utensil's shining curves.  
And so that its shardss of bolt of ceramic will conquer your nose.  
Noone here  
is waiting for the next deep brown car.  
Mirror. You drank yourself for understanding.  
A inscription enriches,  
gnaws - it does not return.  
A inscription chirps,  
sobs - it does not return.  
Nothing but your nocturnal fingernails.  
As soon as the incoming leaves  
gives the alphabetic indication.  
Not to enchant or even meet  
the cluster of one who gathers  
under me in a modern office or travelling to a daughter.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the hidden defenders?  
And the sun comfortable splattering  
its wine  
bottles and throttling them full of  
modern office and ostrich?  
Return to the homeland of the smooth stones.  
Around the vicinity I like to reconcile like a frail pencil.  
Some discover but I reflect your broken glass like fellowship.  
The silent son  
dedicates in the great morning.
