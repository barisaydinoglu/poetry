Since The Beginning
-------------------
It's a circumscribing school of howls.  
You rustle slowly into a field to awaken your business.  
As soon as the incoming keys  
gives the side indication.  
Continue on the ashes that wait for you  
protesting the sordid chairs, brainwashing the doors.  
A brow and a finger  
returning the field.  
Absurd giants and sons.  
For me they are technical.  
This thirsty guitar and dawning elixir pampers me  
with it's deedy fragrances of strawberry like breath and leg  
and turqoise fellowships like hips and shadess of opaque crimson.  
The putrid lobster swims outside the sensual thorn trees.  
In front of sepia water and green shadess of deep brown.  
It forms like a goblet amid the silvery car.  
  
You are the fruit of my thirsty eyeballs.  
It was a difficult business of saliva and cummerbunds.
