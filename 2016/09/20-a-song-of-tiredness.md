A Song Of Tiredness
-------------------
In your lip of foreboding the thicket begins to dream of growing.  
Within sand-colored water and sand-colored telegraphs.  
The lonely road dedicates on its obscene mare  
weaving crimson landscapes over the divisions.  
The father smiles at the one  
but the astronaut does not smile  
when he looks at the toucan custodian  
and the bitter ocean.
