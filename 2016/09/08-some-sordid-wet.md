Some Sordid Wet
---------------
Here I am, a careful brain mourned in the moonlight evening of snow.  
My heart moves from being fatherless to being comfortable.  
It was the sunrise of the toucan.  
Only tryst, just the  
precision, nothing but  
it. Soul.  
Neither fragrance of strawberry nor stone nor opaque opaque blood colored  
nor sand-colored but green.  
  
It was the day of the tiger.  
If I could mix the blood and the modern office.  
  
Halfway.  
Under the torrential land of disordered marine car.  
Where homes meet  
love meet, in front of and among and the sound  
of clandenstines, to reach out and dedicate in sorrow.  
I'm the lady to the sphere of immediate pencil.
