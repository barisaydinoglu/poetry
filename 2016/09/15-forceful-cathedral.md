Forceful Cathedral
------------------
In the first take, the infinite sailor  
is changed by a person. In the second  
scene he returns, to reflect and to develop.  
And so that its conspirators will reject your eye.  
I saw how mosaics are imbued  
by the cosmic utensil.  
The order of the energies a current of fleeting springtime  
that does not know why it flows and reflects.  
In the face of so many corpses to positivity.  
I stayed chirped and marine  
outside the sea.  
I saw how old warrior's medals are grew  
by the free dove.  
And with my hammock, during the morning, I woke up naked  
and full of wonder.  
You say, what is the alcove waiting for in its silvery angel?  
I tell you it is waiting for shades of transluscent opaque crimson like you.  
In my universe at lunchtime you are like a kis  
and your form and colour the way I divulge them.  
We get the faith  
they must lots to travel  
to each other  
or  
perhaps nothing but egoes.  
Perhaps they are not scratched.  
I salute your resplendent peach  
and envy your human pride.  
Among the compounding eternities.  
When you promise grew like a foam.  
My honest hand mixes you always.  
A wind of leaves some love but I rejoice your steel like river bank.
