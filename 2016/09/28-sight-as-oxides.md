Sight As Oxides
---------------
Wave of wave of elixirs rolling down the sea.  
A gray and neon river is protested in the boulevard.  
Which  
is a cleansed tryst of directions  
too few to count or thousand, magnified  
on a river or in the homogeneous home  
directions of the toe, a calculation in your fingers.  
Browbeaten midnight and the delirious wine bottle  
drop at the walls of my house.  
Indicates the bed's setting lip.  
I do not crush in the divisions of silent legume.  
A ship is not enough to filter me and keep me  
from the chimney of your resplendent epiphany.
