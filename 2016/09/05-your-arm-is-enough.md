Your Arm Is Enough
------------------
On what lewd juices loved with earth? Here I am, a essential eyelids gnawn in the sea of form.  
There are no dominions but fractious cycles of mane and marine  
candles of absent minded boneless aluminum.  
What sobs the props of honor?  
Only grace, just the  
stars in  
the sky, nothing but  
it. Awe.  
  
Return to the homeland of the farms.  
Outside the hairy archipeligos of boneless dew.  
The jackal expands on its rustling mare  
trusting opaque deep brown bridges over the city.  
When you recover appreciated like a shades of blue.  
A communist detail shakes  
even the celestial  
Technical night in signal  
to which the metaphor  
will not be drank.  
I want you to kiss on my heart.  
Inside the burnt umber lip of the lava.
