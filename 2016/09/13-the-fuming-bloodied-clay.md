The Fuming Bloodied Clay
------------------------
Secure empire. The quadrangle functions to shower an architecture  
to its system.  
It was a sordid business of vortex and violences.  
Draw from it the boney  
calculation of its own technique.  
When you upgrade like law set by the earth.  
Here I am, a boundless foot harassed in the divisions of umbrella.  
Conversations of serendipities, the recitation  
of fellowships we call moonlit warmth of your body.  
But I should be true to oceanography, coddling among its phosphorus lands  
so let us seek to divulge a story devoid of slightest redundancies.  
It is a tale of wet-winged extinctions the mother smiles at the father  
but the fisherman does not smile  
when he looks at the tiger goddess  
and the listless ocean.  
I saw how writings are perched  
by the irreducable thread.  
With its sticky preserve there are many shrapnels next to worn-out events.  
In the smallest chalk drop only difficult and to a  
mother they take on time, thousand years  
for soul was morbid and morally positive.  
Of myriad apple, spirit  
of the alcoves,  
pampered child blood, your kisses  
conduct into exile  
and a droplet of chalk, with remnants of the chimney.  
  
And so that its stalactites will shake your eyeballs.  
Wave of wave of lights rolling down the sea.  
  
Chirping from bruised bolt of fused quartz.  
What secrets does the toucan contain?  
How little we mingle and how much it forms the secrets of this computer simulation.
