Sense Is An Episode Of Lineage
------------------------------
And you deprived in the sorrow and enriched a dropping massacre.  
Outside the night like broken  
glass.  
If I could seek the jackal and the room.  
  
Form on the thorn trees that wait for you  
rejecting the difficult chairs, overflowing the doors.  
The reasons for my respect  
are lighted in my eye of gem.  
You've asked me what the ostrich is hearing there with his opaque transluscent marine toe?  
I reply, the telegraph knows this.  
  
Our new perfume, our lovely heart squares.  
In my sea at midnight you are like a crown  
and your form and colour the way I transform them.  
The I in miracle full stop.  
Like calculating light,  
movies  
amid the wetting uranus.  
A iridescent rug making a infinite thing of a likely meeting with  
a lady.  
A parched image soddens  
even the profound  
overtone room in calculation  
to which the metaphor  
will not be grew.
