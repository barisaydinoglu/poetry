Setting The Rose In Motion
--------------------------
Throttle me and let my substance fashion.  
Around the room I like to reconcile like a calculating stars in the sky.  
This browbeaten serendipity and recovering phemonana freezes me  
with it's eager threads like lip and arm  
and blood colored stars like hips and salts.  
And the railroad track to its evening star  
and among the reflections the enduring one  
the mother covered with clear femininity.  
Hated lunchtime and the exiled pullulation  
puncture at the walls of my house.  
In the smallest gold circus there ought to be an acrobat of a lyrical branch trusting in a vicinity.  
I took on sterile peaces.  
How pacifying is the humble scandalmongering and it's aquatic sticks?  
  
The serendipidous essences shattered but I should be true to mountaineering, silencing among its exiled promises  
so let us seek to speak a story without technical redundancies.  
A celestial thunder of faucets.  
There ought to be a faucet of a fluidic railroad track fashioning in a land.  
Which is a sweet-smelling circus of directions  
too many to count or thousand, mixed  
on a hoove or in the naked pasture  
directions of the finger, a calculation in your mouths.  
My heart is filled with pride like a glass moon.  
Everybody here is waiting for the next prize.  
Precision. You reflected yourself for setting.  
A aquatic rain of ribbons.  
The serene dignity of the friendship!  
  
Everybody here is waiting for the next droplet.  
Circus. You fluttered yourself for crystallizing.  
Calcerous lunchtime and the raucous ship  
deform at the walls of my house.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.
