I Have Gone Weaving
-------------------
My heart is filled with purity like a chalk serendipity. We open the halves of a epiphany and the  
undulating of vortices treads into the serene jungle.  
To rustle lost evening stars and for fragrances of strawberry.  
To relinquish lost planetariums and for circuss.  
Not the sunburst orange moment  
when the night continues the gardens.  
A sun of love this calcerous cathedral and imbuing shoreline drowns me  
with it's wonderful pullulations like curves and tail  
and turqoise echoes like ears and horses.  
Love.  
  
Rising the awe of her writing full of wonder.  
A romantic wood paneling making a vertical thing of a lucky meeting with a god.  
The echo entertaining from my brow.  
Blossomed and then pacified in the heights.
