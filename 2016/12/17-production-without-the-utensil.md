Production Without The Utensil
------------------------------
When the boulevard is full of lewd arm  
outside massacres and sifted hated paths  
and the blood-stained laws and the perfumes  
at last give forth their mechanical hound. Multitude of roots!  
In and out of the blue the opaque transluscent transluscent cashmire and the sepia the pale well that performs in your essence.  
Where muscles meet  
defenders meet, among and in and the sound  
of cummerbunds, to reach out and expand in beligerance.  
They punctured it with neurotic perfumes.  
A serendipity -like clandenstine  
enjoy the many whirlwinds of attempts to hear  
the arcane enemy.  
There is blazing fortune in dawning it.  
Of wide nectarine, spirit  
of the droplets,  
fell giant blood, your kisses  
make into exile  
and a droplet of silken, with remnants of the city.  
Shut up and pulled out like a nature.  
You mix in the city as in a rosy moonlight evening.
