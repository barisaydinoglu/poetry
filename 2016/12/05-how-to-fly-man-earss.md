How To Fly Man Earss
--------------------
Outside the dead night of troubled bridge.  
A mist -like twisting lonely road  
all wreaths become depths.  
I could inherit invasion, circumstance,  
and jugular  
from spheres and evening stars  
with a ultraviolet wine bottle  
with probes in my shoulder.  
The pale serendipity is perfect on your shoulder.  
Stone.  
A chorus of elephants at lunchtime un lived un punctured  
comes to a halt before an autumn.  
  
With its inevitable appreciate the magnolium knows this,  
that life in it's paper-mache boxes is as endless as the maternity.  
Against the universe like graphite.  
You create in the modern office as in a serendipidous  
heights.  
You, who is like a stalactite squirrel among the playing of many god.  
And hooves and movies.  
Your poppy is an affection filled with disintered tree.  
I salute your clear plum  
and envy your myriad pride.
