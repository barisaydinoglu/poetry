A Cork Within Emerald
---------------------
Brings all the shatters corals.  
I'd do it for the railroad track in which you entertain  
for the threads of opaque green you've preserved.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
breathe of flower heads and  
sweetness  
and the sensible juices of his native land?  
What is this computer but a memory throttled of its sweetness?  
Shall we move on?  
The water comfortable noises are hated.  
A blazing rug making a silent thing of a unlikely meeting with a woman.  
The faucet develops in protecting your curves.  
I salute your delicious plum  
and envy your slender pride.  
  
You see heart as electric as the mist.  
A current of unguessed flesh  
that does not know why it flows and upgrades.
