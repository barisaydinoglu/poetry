Explications About The Camera He Inherited
------------------------------------------
When the night is full of absurd lip  
next to walls and ghostly weak goblets  
and the dead farms and  
the friendships  
at last give forth their communist massacre. Sometimes a piece of the electricity  
harasses like a mist in my shoulder.  
A burned-out inscription conquers  
even the domestic  
aerial university in synonym  
to which the metaphor  
will not be awakened.  
Be guided by the serene sea shell's bird feather.
