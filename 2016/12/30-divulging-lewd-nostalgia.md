Divulging Lewd Nostalgia
------------------------
Always you tremble through the midnight  
toward the early light of day sobbing lighthouses.  
Your breath develops from north to west  
I am stole by trouser and acid, by circumstance and sunshine.  
You - the eager hand.  
The order of the telegraphs the rigid elephant understands outside the enduring oblivions.  
A inscription rises,  
erupts - it does not return.  
A quiver -like ego  
has the area been expanded with funny things?
