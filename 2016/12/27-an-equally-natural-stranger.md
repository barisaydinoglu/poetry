An Equally Natural Stranger
---------------------------
I salute your cleansed nectarine  
and envy your thick pride.  
I was without doubt the sailor jaguar  
there in the wet-winged divisions.  
When it looked me with its human foam eyes  
it had neither brain nor eyeballs  
but cork threads on its sides.  
When you grow like cathedral stored by the lightning.  
And reflections and apples.
