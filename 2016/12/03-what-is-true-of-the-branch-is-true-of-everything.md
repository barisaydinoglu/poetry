What Is True Of The Branch Is True Of Everything
------------------------------------------------
Among the fractious night of tenacious muscle.  
You've asked me what the crab is reconciling there with his transparent hips?  
I reply, the warmth knows this.  
Come with me to the ego of torrents.  
Nothing but that utensil of films.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
form of mirrors and serenities  
and the naked warmths of his native land?  
Vagabonds of a banal airplane  
refreshing among the vicinity in a cold ship,  
cleansed as a harsh pheasant.  
I could entertain cummerbund, oblivion, and clandenstine  
from forms and wreaths  
with a black telegraph  
with conspirators in my curves.  
Monastic, silken stars in the sky!  
From her foot and her mouth crystallize  
kiss of the earth.  
Person of the depths of my lip - your seeking  
stills your clear regard as though it were mud.
