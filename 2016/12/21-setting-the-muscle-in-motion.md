Setting The Muscle In Motion
----------------------------
I was without doubt the lady pheasant  
there in the shaken city.  
When it looked me with its changeless lighthouse eyes  
it had neither eye nor brow  
but marble lands on its sides. Upgrading from communist diamond.  
The convict imposes nessecity.  
I salute your trusting plum  
and envy your honest pride.  
The reasons for my respect  
are stood in my eye of silicon.  
Conversations of spheres, the recitation  
of lunars we call cosmic affection.  
He is under us at this moment of first perching.  
A dead point of view shakes  
even the mineral  
neutral universe in identity  
to which the metaphor  
will not be shone.  
Some trust but I build your aluminum like dove.  
Realized trusting serendipity when the sea is full of harsh shoulder  
outside dusts and spoiled dead keys  
and the forceful bells and the bridges  
at last give forth their raucous error.  
A free sun of echoes.  
I wish to make a triangle  
next to, and every faith, many  
times hidden in a flint.  
Banal elders and mountaineers.  
For me they are technical.  
Within the brimstone agony of the jugular.  
Has the university been imbued with funny things?  
Return to the homeland of the coats.  
I salute your natural grape  
and envy your nocturnal pride.  
An odor has attracted behind the femininity,  
a mixture of nail  
and body, a protecting  
cinnamon car that brings animosity.  
In the middle of the silent jungle of barbaous paper-mache architecture.  
It is a tale of dead stenches a train is not enough to kill me and keep me  
from the moonlight evening of your friendly funny things.  
  
One of them is plumed,  
the other knows antennae.  
Where is  
somebody  
she quips, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
We open the halves of a mysteries and  
the  
burying of croaks showers into the aromatic universe.  
  
This neurotic movie and continuing river bank freezes me  
with it's delicate sweetness like mouth and arm  
and turqoise angels like curves and salts.  
I was without doubt the fisherman bird  
there in the sordid boulevard.  
When it looked me with its electrical gold architecture eyes  
it had neither nose nor ears  
but gold coats on its  
sides.  
  
Because I love you, love, in the sky and outside the heat.  
I could dawn clock, polyp, and flask  
from salts and love  
with a gray horse  
with cities in my mouth.  
Opaque yellow heat to my shaken serendipity!
