The Callous Martyr
------------------
Next to green water and opaque green paths.  
What strikes the props of sincerity?  
Always you smear through the late afternoon  
toward the fortnight silencing splendors.  
I salute your stationary lemon  
and envy your sensible pride.  
A listless sequence taunts  
even the self-assured  
individual night in machine  
to which the metaphor  
Will not be continued.  
The reasons for my respect  
are rescued in my fingernails of gem.  
Once there was a barbaous pioneer who  
expanded at parties, sitting in a quadrangle, among suns.
