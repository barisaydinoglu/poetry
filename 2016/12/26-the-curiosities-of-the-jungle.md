The Curiosities Of The Jungle
-----------------------------
My nocturnal curves seizes you always.  
Listless circumstances and tear stained alarms.  
When you chirp like mist conducted by the clay.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
divulge of bells and knaves  
and the wide salts of his native land?  
Whispers of a negligent helicopter  
circumscribing among the field with a fire-tipped boat,  
silent as a ironous crab.  
Rising toward the necklace around the green leg of the fire.  
Dead weather, exiled lights like the sweetnes.  
The earth eloquent receptacles are abandoned.  
Here I  
am, a domestic heart conquered in the archipeligos of snow.  
Not to flutter or even meet  
the bridge of one who relinquishes  
outside me in a heights or flowing to a father.
