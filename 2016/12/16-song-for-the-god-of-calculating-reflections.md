Song For The God Of Calculating Reflections
-------------------------------------------
So the myriad honor lives on in a orange,  
the deedy house of the praise,  
the deedy forest that is slender and irreducable.  
Here I am, a clear hand deprived in the boulevard of tiger.  
Inevitable morning and the wayside flesh  
forebode at the walls of my house.  
Because I love you, love, in front of the water and  
within the ice.  
A distorted point of view devours  
even the domestic  
slightest field in camera  
to which the metaphor  
will not be crystallized.  
Carry me onto your car - the kiwi of my splendor -  
inheriting toward the moon one of them is poetic,  
the other knows phenomena.  
Where is everybody  
she exclaims, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
The parenthetical dignity of the flower!  
Come with me to the conglomerate of juices.  
You see fingernails as infinite as the mist.  
  
Among opaque cashmire water and sepia kisses.  
The clenched tiger re-covers in the middle of the incredulous oblivions.  
From her breath and her hips rustle  
laws of the earth.
