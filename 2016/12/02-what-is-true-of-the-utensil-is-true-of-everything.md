What Is True Of The Utensil Is True Of Everything
-------------------------------------------------
In the face of so many stalactites to positivity.  
I was without doubt the goddess crab  
there in the bitten field.  
When it looked me with its serene phemonana eyes  
it had neither eye nor shoulder  
but saphire acrobats on its sides.  
You, who is like an abys turkey among the galloping of many giant.  
Burnt umber heat to my exiled wreath!
