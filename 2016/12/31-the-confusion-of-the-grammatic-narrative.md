The Confusion Of The Grammatic Narrative
----------------------------------------
Yellow serections of conspirator,  
deep brown seams above a clenched cluster.  
My resolute heart conducts you always.  
The puberty dawns on its hated mare  
rejoicing blue forests over the boulevard.  
Neither breakfast nor form nor brimstone  
nor sand-colored  
but marine.  
And the reflection to its vein  
and among the faucets the aquatic one  
the lady covered with vertical current.  
It was a shifty business of enemy and juices.  
Pure funeral expands the ripples not to promise or even meet  
the hat of one who excites  
under me in a chimney or mingling to a lady.  
In the land like sand.  
From harrowing wind to tornado,  
hidden flower heads drawn by absent minded channels, a  
spoiled heart begins to travel.  
Father of the depths of my  
curves - your galloping  
stills your aromatic regard as though it were heat.  
For a day, maybe too many to count,  
I rested under a uncomfortable turbulence  
at a bus stop, waiting for the man to be with.  
But the warmth expanded the memory.  
Violenet uncles and uncles.  
For me they are public.
