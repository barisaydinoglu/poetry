Breeding Steady Affection
-------------------------
I'm the god to the telegraph of immediate planetarium.  
In your tail of panic the thicket of acrobats fly.  
When you wake enriched like a muscle.  
A rain of evening stars the saxophone plan that has everyone rusted.  
Here I am, a blazing heart fainted in the university of shoreline.  
Nothing but that farm of clusters.  
Making toward the movie I appreciate as if in front of a lashed massacre.  
I could awaken dominion, jugular, and panic  
from flutes and lemons  
with a black perfume  
with uranus in my curves.  
Conversations of fellowships, the recitation  
of writings we call gleaming law.  
What lion hearted echoes -  
the archipeligos is filled with it,  
drops for the bed and the wayside bolt of marble.  
Your mouth connects from north to north  
because I love you, love, with the mud and within the ice.  
The book coddles, the serendipity of round  
enriches around.  
But I should be true  
to science, loathing among its fuming reflections  
so let us attempt to speak a story without public redundancies.  
The musical dignity of the landscape!
