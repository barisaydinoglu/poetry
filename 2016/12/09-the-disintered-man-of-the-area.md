The Disintered Man Of The Area
------------------------------
You see ears as wonderful as the thunder.  
And meetings of pale breath all currents become salivas.  
Neither school nor foam nor rust colored  
nor marine but sunburst orange.  
The emerald architecture plan that has everyone lashed.  
Not the deep brown moment  
when the lunchtime expands the threads.  
The star plan that has everyone boneless.  
A smothered technique drowns  
even the lyrical  
aerial sea in language  
to which the metaphor  
will not be discovered.  
I want you to refresh on my breath.  
  
You say, what is the grace waiting for in its cinnamon bottle?  
I tell you it is waiting for banner like you.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the spacious coats?  
And  
the rain honest splattering its fellowships and passing them full of  
modern office and elephant?  
A hand and a breath  
creating the city.
