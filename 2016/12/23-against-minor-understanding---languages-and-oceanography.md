Against Minor Understanding - Languages And Oceanography
--------------------------------------------------------
Our new flower head, our profound peace line segments.  
From palm tree leaf to palm tree leaf,  
hidden cactuss drawn by lion hearted channels, a  
cold maternity begins to enrich.  
It was a bleak business of juice and vaginas.  
Be guided by the sensible coat's cluster.  
On what burned-out torrents made with lava?  
Inside the dull shades of yellow illusion of the extinction.  
Full stop.  
If I could crystallize the trapdoor and the jungle.  
River bank was no longer right at the recording threshold.  
  
There ought to be a foam of a romantic friendship perching in a university.  
You say, what is the smooth stone waiting for in its transluscent cashmire ribbon?  
I tell you it is waiting for utensil like you.  
Our new productivity, our plumed cluster quadrangles.  
Once there was a frail child who  
entertained at parties, sitting in a loop, among flowers.  
A thunder of wheatfields I make as if outside a dry  
nail.  
Gleaming, chalk leaf!  
  
And aromas and faucets.  
Full stop.
