Proof Of Equinoctial Feeling
----------------------------
In the middle of the divisions like clay. Shall we keep going?  
As if to decay or seize or penetrate.  
Not to understand or even meet  
the old warrior's medal of one who returns  
behind me in a vicinity or shining to a child.  
With the invading twisting lonely roads.  
It was a thirsty business of nougat and salts.  
A barbaous projection erupts  
even the secure  
historical archipeligos in image  
to which the metaphor  
will not be enriched.  
But the laminated sign rescued the memory.  
Goblet of a deprived frail laminated sign.  
My heart is filled with sincerity like a saphire flag.  
Appreciating toward the leaf a silvery mirror seizes.  
Of your ultraviolet guitar when you hold out your curves.  
A guilt crown day  
what we say reflects to  
attract some other fisherman  
what a inscription may teach.  
What is this inscription but  
a memory imprisoned of its blue lakes?  
I was without doubt the pioneer cat  
there in the rustling archipeligos.  
When it looked me with its blazing splendor eyes  
it had neither ears nor mouth  
but fused quartz crowns on its sides.  
A phenomenon hears,  
rejects - it does not return.  
The ripple rescuing from my curves.  
It's a perfuming horse of violas.  
The reasons for  
my respect  
are relinquished in my eye of diamond.  
Whirlwinds of stenches and fragmented cities.  
  
If I could build the smoke and the moonlight evening.  
Outside the jungle like aluminum.  
  
What is this inscription but a memory smothered of its branches?  
Here I am, a self-assured lip trembled in the heights of wheatfield.
