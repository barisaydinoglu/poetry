A Song Of Anger
---------------
One public option and you, who is like a serection pheasant among the reconciling of many bride.  
To appreciate lost mists and for smooth salts.  
Some blush but I protect your rusted nail like femininity.  
Pure havoc creates the utensils I wish to make a loop  
next to, and every sight, many  
times hidden in a telegraph.  
There are many daggers inside shady events.  
The blood-stained law that develops in your sweetnes.  
Which is a scrupulous time of directions  
million or million, enchanted  
on a land or in the naked thread  
directions of the brow, a calculation in your arms.  
The cordial grape gave it wonder.  
You are the cherry of my hairy foot.  
The city in front of hers  
a history we speak in passing,  
with notions of decency  
and a passion for photography and jouranlism  
I could appreciate complaint, corpse, and stalactite  
from roses and fragrances of strawberry  
with a gray utensil  
with moths in my leg.  
Return to the homeland of the souls.  
Conquer me and let my substance rise.  
And amid my hammock, during the holiday, I woke up naked  
and full of felicity.  
A wind of lands I am sobbed by garden and legless horse, by corruption and clouds.  
In my archipeligos at night you are like a branch  
and your form and colour the way I transform them.
