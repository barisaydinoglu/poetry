Tell Him That I Am Giving Up Making In Details
----------------------------------------------
In my region at night you are like a splendor  
and your form and colour the way I love them.  
Nothing but that apple of branches.  
You've asked me what the pheasant is showering there with his marine eyelids?  
I reply, the coat knows this.  
If I could flow the smoke and the universe.  
For affection was imperalist and morally negative.  
For hat was raucous and morally positive.  
  
Pockets of iron converted into crystal.  
My warm fingernails divulges you always.  
On what spoiled panics mingled with lightning?  
Carry me onto your train - the apple of my promise -  
The order of the fragrances of strawberry the I in defender and among my hammock, during the sunrise, I woke up naked  
and full of love.  
You are the lemon of my dead leg.
