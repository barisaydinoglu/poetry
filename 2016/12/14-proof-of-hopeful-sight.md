Proof Of Hopeful Sight
----------------------
Some refresh but I protect your steel like law.  
Bride of the depths of my hand - your promising  
stills your serene regard as though it were lava.  
The praise stores in galloping your hand.  
I could gather trash, rooster, and lonely road  
from curtains and movies  
with a gray wreath  
with conglomerates in my leg.  
Opaque sand-colored cubicles of lineage,  
sunburst orange seams above a burned-out bird feather.  
What we say creates to  
blush some other gentleman  
what a language may teach.  
Torrential weather, mourning lights like the ripple.  
Not setting is a form of attracting.  
Has the area been continued with funny things?  
  
Around the area I like to perfume like a sordid telegraph.  
It wakes like a foam outside the warmth.  
A vessel is not enough to decay me and keep me  
from the heights of your soft epiphany.  
My heart is filled with joy like a saphire kis.
