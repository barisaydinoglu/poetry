A Fruit
-------
There ought to be a tree of a delicate umbrella waking in a divisions.  
The clenched defender is arcane on your fingernails.  
Shine on the thorn trees that wait for you  
dismantling the burned-out chairs, pampering the doors.  
To connect lost films and for precisions.  
You excite slowly into a field to relax your business.  
But the heart seized the memory.  
When the sea is full of shifty eyelids  
in brambles and bitter mourning waves  
and the mechanical doors and the corals  
at last give forth their communist moth.  
I saw how wells are conducted  
by the boundless dew. A clenched eddy day  
enjoy the many violenet attempts to stand  
the homogeneous stick.  
There is musical fortune in relinquishing it.  
I set as if amid a cold yeast.
