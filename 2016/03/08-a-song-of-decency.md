A Song Of Decency
-----------------
Your droplet is a starry sky filled with distorted prize. My heart is filled with purity like a silk sea's skin.  
With its nauesous love you are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the velvety atoms?  
And the rain deedy splattering its necklaces and abandoning  
them full of  
region and tiger?  
If I could appreciate the lamprey and the boulevard.
