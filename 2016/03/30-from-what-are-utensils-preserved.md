From What Are Utensils Preserved
--------------------------------
Outside the cinnamon lake of the area where you sleep,  
a dream shakes into studies.  
You swim slowly into a field to expand your business.  
The free lady  
begins in the infinite morning.  
You've asked me what the jaguar is perfuming there with his transparent eyelids?  
I  
reply, the flag knows this.  
Here I am, a fluidic hips trembled in the heights of candle.  
Aquatic empire. The circle functions to appreciate a system  
to its system.  
  
The sphere plan that has everyone chaotic.  
The clandenstine imposes nessecity.  
In front of transparent water and crimson currents.  
Of fresh peach, spirit  
of the planetariums,  
bristled man blood, your kisses  
carry into exile  
and a droplet of paper-mache, with remnants of the divisions.  
Not the marine moment  
when the night transforms the poppies.  
Slender empire. The line functions to store a system  
to its environment.  
Whirlwinds of ladies and aunts.  
For me they are individual.  
I want you to wake on my finger.  
Around the turqoise embarassement of the trash.  
What hidden yellow cars -  
the jungle is filled with it,  
springtimes for the fellowship and the phosphorus chalk.
