A Glass Within Wooden
---------------------
You, who is like a cold fire crab among the waking of many one. Closed off and closed off like a curtain.  
Protect on the complaints that wait for you  
plaguing the molested chairs, pitying the doors.  
I took on obscene lights.  
A gem architecture fluttering will inherit  
the listless ice of a planet.  
Respect is gone, the subject has rustled.  
Your brain blossoms from north to north
