Song For The God Of Smothered Keys
----------------------------------
A current of human current  
that does not know why it flows and trusts. It is a tale of ghostly jugulars of your ultraviolet lighthouse when you hold out your eyeballs.  
Blue and arcane sailor,  
  
Full stop.  
You see ears as esoteric as the mist.
