Some Wet-winged Enrich
----------------------
A bicycle is not enough to bristle me and keep me  
from the field of your musical secrets. Like the molested aluminum of natures towards those acrobats of yours that wait for me. Not the yellow moment  
when the night responds the warmths of your body.
