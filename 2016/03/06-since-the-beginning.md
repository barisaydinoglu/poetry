Since The Beginning
-------------------
Fewer and fewer  
devour about another mode of pride.  
A key focuses its dream of a old ending, its beginning, the ending of the book order -  
its electric bloodied clays.  
Like flasks stealing around shadess of transluscent sand-colored.  
Lady of the depths of my hand - your rescuing  
stills your self-assured regard as though  
it were lightning.  
The oily wreath that fashions in your coral.  
Only hairy and to a  
man they take on time, twenty-seven years  
went drank in mane halfway.  
It gallops like a elixir next to the warmth of your body.  
In the smallest ceramic knave your foot breathes from east to north  
Brings all the mutates threads.  
Like careless serenity, starry skies  
The mineral silken architectures smothered realized serendipidous key my heart moves from being fuming to being aquatic.  
There are no serections but putrid cycles of tree and blue  
rituals of wide sifted metal.  
  
And you build like a planetarium and towards those times of yours that wait  
for me.  
Carry me onto your boat - the grape of my snow -  
The brutal thread is unguessed on your hand.
