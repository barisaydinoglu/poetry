A Silicon Within Ceramic
------------------------
Cinnamon fire to my silent branch!  
And meetings of bitterest ears a current of noble well  
that does not know why it flows and preserves.  
Pulse on the legumes that wait for you  
sobbing the lashed chairs, flying the doors.  
With deep brown water and burnt umber ripples.  
The tear stained ostrich preserves among the electric violences.  
Around sand-colored water and silvery hats.  
And with my hammock, during the twilight, I woke up naked  
and full of wonder.  
It is a tale of violenet clocks has the divisions been expanded with phenomena?  
I saw how lands are enchanted  
by the starry ship.  
Neither evening star nor honeysuckle nor brimstone  
nor transparent but sepia.  
  
My heart is filled with purity like a saphire window.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the romantic elixirs?  
And the clouds trusting splattering its miracles and fainting them full of  
field and iguana?  
What is this sequence but a memory sobbed of its writings?  
I rescue as if behind a nauesous throat.  
I salute your friendly lemon  
and envy your spacious pride.  
Fewer and fewer  
abandon about another mode of honor.  
Wonder is gone, the subject has rustled.  
In the middle of the difficult flesh, many tremulous juices.  
Not the cashmire moment  
when the night returns the horses.
