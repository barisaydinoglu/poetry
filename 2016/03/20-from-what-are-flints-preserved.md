From What Are Flints Preserved
------------------------------
A car is not enough to abhor me and keep me  
from the area of your clear mysteries.  
Light on the cold fires that wait for you  
devouring the clenched chairs, invading the doors.  
The giant smiles at the astronaut  
but the bride does not smile  
when he looks at the crab pioneer  
and the dead ocean.  
It was the morning of the bird.  
A current of nocturnal bridge  
that does not know why it flows and blossoms.  
Of somber lemon, spirit  
of the stones,  
undulated man blood, your kisses  
set into exile  
and a droplet of glass, with remnants of the field.  
Went attracted in sea water in the face of so many nougats to animosity.  
A bottle focuses its dream of a ending, its new ending, the beginning of the kiss order -  
its musical bones.  
Mane of a undulated motionless film.  
So the lovely happiness lives on in a lemon,  
the romantic house of the sun,  
the decisive kiss that is eloquent and brandishing.  
Draw from it the lashed  
technique of its own study.  
  
It was the sunrise of the tiger.  
It was the early light of day of the ostrich.  
In my thicket at twilight you are like a guitar  
and your form and colour the way I light them.  
In the first take, the arcane father  
is wetted by a fisherman. In the second  
reel he returns, to rescue and to reflect.  
As soon as the incoming natures  
gives the individual indication.  
Forming a tree  
fashioned in the absorbant clouds.  
Your finger attracts from east to south  
I took on rambunctious dews.  
One of them is somber,  
the other knows details.  
Where is someone  
she cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
  
It was the twilight of the tiger.  
Wave of wave of phemonanas rolling down the sea.  
I wish to make a quadrangle  
behind, and every sense, many  
times hidden in a door.  
For window was raucous and morally negative.  
  
Man of the depths of my hips - your gathering  
stills your stationary regard as though it were heat.  
Inside the rust colored anger of the rectum.
