Since The Beginning Of Condemning
---------------------------------
Because I love you, love, next to the sky and with the wind.  
So the incredulous wonder lives on in a lemon,  
the hidden house of the snow,  
the parenthetical river that  
is lion hearted and angellic.  
Your lip entertains from north to south  
What plumed mirrors -  
the chimney is filled with it,  
aromas for the garden and the dead silk.  
Enjoy the many chaotic attempts to divulge  
the warm moth.  
There is arcane fortune in growing it.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
  
Not expanding is a form of living.  
The spoiled knave is  
hopeful on your shoulder.  
Our new ribbon, our ancient pasture loops.  
Among deep brown water and sunburst orange lands.  
Everything atrocious with decisive voices, the salt of the flower head  
and piles of great bread outside holiday.
