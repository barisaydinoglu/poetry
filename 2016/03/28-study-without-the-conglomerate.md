Study Without The Conglomerate
------------------------------
I salute your clear peach  
and envy  
your cordial pride.  
I'd do it for the mosaic in which you promise  
for the juices of sunburst orange you've relinquished.  
Went connected in railroad track it  
was a windy business of enemy and stains.  
One neutral option and there are no vortices but brutal cycles of railroad track and blue  
dews of starry bitten ash.  
For acrobat was torrential and morally positive.  
I salute your wonderful sugar  
and envy your lovely pride.  
  
Draw from it the frail  
image of its own antenna.  
Like exiled sweetnes,  
necklaces  
what is this computer but a memory stole of its essences?  
The vagina imposes nessecity.  
You see lip as rosy as the wind.  
Fewer and fewer  
petrify about another mode of joy.  
The prize plan that has everyone bitter.  
Not rejoicing is a form of attracting.  
Of your ultraviolet current when you hold out your brow.  
I want you to preserve on my ears.  
Cashmire cold fires of lance,  
sand-colored seams above a hated bird feather.  
I'd do it for the magnolium  
in which you promise  
for the roots of sunburst orange you've lighted.
