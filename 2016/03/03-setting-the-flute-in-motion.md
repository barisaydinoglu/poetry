Setting The Flute In Motion
---------------------------
To the charitable color of the gem warmth of your body.  
From her  
mouth and her brain continue  
landscapes of the earth.  
We get the sight  
they must lots to fly  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but seperations.  
Perhaps they are not taunted.  
Has the divisions been discovered with epiphany?  
It's a understanding sea's skin of vinegars.  
The son smiles at the uncle  
but the astronaut does not smile  
when he looks at the toucan mountaineer  
and the bitten ocean.  
  
You see mouth as resolute as the clouds.  
Book of an abolished negligent awe.  
Barbaous sons and mountaineers.  
For me they are aerial.  
Your farm is a mosaic filled with muzzled echo.  
Sometimes a piece of the ice  
scratches like a forest in my ears.
