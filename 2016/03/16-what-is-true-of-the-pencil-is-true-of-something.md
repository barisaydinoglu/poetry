What Is True Of The Pencil Is True Of Something
-----------------------------------------------
For a day, maybe too few to count,  
I rested under a unrelenting rain  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the person to be inside. My heart is filled with sincerity like a chalk branch.  
Your ears hears from west to south  
and a burned-out nature's water will connect you.  
A loop amid a line  
segment,  
the rambunctious workings of profound law.  
I could attract parallel havocs, self-production, and ego  
from souls and spheres  
with a gray soul  
with blades  
in my ears.  
I want you to crystallize on my heart.  
  
If you were not the cheesecake the parsimonious moon  
cooks, sprinkling its apple across the thicket.  
Of a turqoise elder that flutters lakes.  
It blushes like a wheatfield inside the angel.
