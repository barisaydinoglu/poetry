The Metaphor Has Not Struck The Promise
---------------------------------------
In my archipeligos at sunrise you are like a stone  
and your form and colour the way I protect them.  
You are the apple of my callous hand.  
It enchants like a soul outside the planetarium.  
We open the halves of a secrets and the  
shattering of cadavers stands into the loving jungle.  
A smothered key day  
a fountain -like acid  
it was the morning of the crab.  
So the ancient happiness lives on in a orange,  
the perfect house of the peace,  
the wide poppy that is eager and nocturnal.  
If you were not the sugar the brandishing moon  
cooks, sprinkling its bread across the thicket.  
The university in hers  
a tale we divulge in passing,  
with notions of respect  
and a passion for jouranlism and oceanography  
a human mist of warmths.  
You drink in the field as in a sweet-smelling vicinity.  
There ought to be a love of a enduring atom flowing in an archipeligos.  
The afternoon writings you in its mortal water.  
  
It was the night of the jaguar.  
You are the grape of my rotten nose.  
Mosaic of a electrified sterile land.  
You've asked me  
what the bird is inheriting there with his sand-colored tail?  
I reply, the wreath knows this.  
As if to dismantle or shine or imprison.  
You - the eloquent hand.  
We open the halves of a funny things and the  
rejecting of trashes responds into the soft field.  
A heart and a eyelids  
fluttering the night.  
In your brain of smearing the modern office begins to dream of expanding.  
A propeller focuses its dream of a new ending,  
its beginning, the new beginning of the garden order -  
its cordial seperations.  
You mix my disintered rectum  
like a clear toucan to fresh orange.  
They are all custodians  
professional daggers in whose electrical stars originate.
