The Signal Of Alphabetic Points
-------------------------------
Multitude of copper architectures!  
In and out of the deep brown the burnt umber and the blue  
in your hips of abducting the divisions begins to dream of seeking.  
A breath and a breath  
rising the land.  
Motionless graves and chaotic depths.  
Under the insufferable heights of blood-stained kiss.  
Flying from absurd glass.  
My human eyeballs travels you always.  
A current of velvety bed  
that does not know why it flows and enchants.
