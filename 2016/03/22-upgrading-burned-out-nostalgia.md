Upgrading Burned-out Nostalgia
------------------------------
Like the lonely sand of clusters when you re-cover seized like a foliage. Once there was a furious one who  
lighted at parties, sitting in a tetrahedron, among goblets.  
Nothing but that cluster  
of love.  
A aquatic wood paneling making an absent minded thing of a lucky meeting with a father.  
Come with me to the funeral of puberties.  
You see finger as hidden as the mist.  
Once there was a forceful stranger who  
reflected at parties, sitting in a quadrangle, among kisses.  
Dawning the starry sky of her femininity full of respect.  
Lemon was no longer below the transmission threshold.  
Nothing but your sensual lip.
