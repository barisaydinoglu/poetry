A Lemon
-------
You see leg as infinite as the mist.  
Which is a balanced dove of directions  
too many to count or too few to count, played  
on a lighthouse or in the hopeful splendor  
directions of the brow, a calculation in your breaths.  
Enchanting, crystal praise!  
To seek another land because I love you, love, behind the fire and outside the earth.  
The midnight quivers you in its mortal lava.
