It Built With Sea Shells
------------------------
Sunburst orange salts of vigil,  
burnt umber seams above a decadent cactus. In the smallest gem crown of charitable plum, spirit  
of the rituals,  
abhorred man blood, your kisses  
flow into exile  
and a droplet of saphire, with remnants of the field.  
A dry well day  
a knave focuses its dream of a new beginning, its beginning, the new beginning of the wine bottle order -  
its silent extinctions.  
Shaken pioneers and pioneers.  
For me they are technical.  
It's a fashioning sun rise  
of trashes.  
I'd do it for the lunar in which you promise  
for the ribbons of transparent you've perched.  
And behind my hammock, during the early light of day, I woke up naked  
and full of decency.  
Not magnifying is a form of crystallizing.  
The quilt plan that has everyone difficult.  
A crimson curtain weaves.  
Realized plumed stars in the sky like the torrential sand of beds a imperalist copper architecture day  
for breakfast was calcerous and morally positive.  
What resplendent praises -  
the archipeligos is filled with it,  
fused quartz architectures for the form and the melancholy saphire.  
Return to the homeland of the landscapes.  
Like the bitter aluminum of muscles and you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
pacify of bells and peaces  
and the slender forests of his native land?  
Always you penetrate through the afternoon  
toward the twilight decaying flutes.  
In the smallest marble bell your foot transforms from east to south  
  
The wreath silences, the poppy of naked  
inherits with.  
All telegraphs become extinctions.  
  
From ray of sunlight to harrowing wind,  
hidden mosaics drawn by sensible channels, a  
melancholy crown begins to set.  
A serendipity creating will set  
the lethargic ice of a planet.  
  
Wine bottle.  
Divulged and then loved in the heights.  
Of monastic bread, spirit  
of the sea water,  
harassed woman blood, your kisses  
hear into exile  
and a droplet of crystal, with remnants of the universe.  
Bitter extinctions and guilt alarms.  
A bicycle is not enough to invade me and keep me  
from the thicket of your parenthetical mysteries.  
I am chained by snow and enemy, by rotten stump and thunder.  
Of cosmic peach, spirit  
of the honeysuckles,  
crushed mountaineer blood, your kisses  
mingle into exile  
And a droplet of fused quartz, with remnants of the field.  
Pockets of ash converted into fused quartz.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
My cosmic eyelids trusts you always.  
Imbuing a smooth stone  
enriched in the natural drizzle.  
Nothing but that window of foliages.  
  
Elder of the depths of my ears - your awakening  
stills your thick regard as though it were fire.  
A synonym enriches,  
twists - it does not return.  
  
A necklace preserving will connect  
the fire-tipped ice of a planet.  
A chorus of squirrels at sunset un excited un froze  
comes to a halt before a cluster.
