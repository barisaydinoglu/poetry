How To Sodden Sailor Lips
-------------------------
From tornado to blade of grass,  
hidden maternities drawn by aquatic channels, a  
bitter horse begins to flutter.  
Sorrow and pencil - flints  
of beligerance.  
When you return like elixir travelled by the sky.  
One alphabetic option and your defender is a law filled with atrocious stalks of cattail.  
My heart moves from being rigid to being decisive.  
Shall we keep going?  
Pride is gone, the subject has built.  
Wave of wave of juices rolling down the sea.  
We get the abstraction  
they must lots to begin  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but havocs.  
Perhaps they are not shook.  
Pulled out and  
closed off like a bridge.  
But the lake woke the memory.
