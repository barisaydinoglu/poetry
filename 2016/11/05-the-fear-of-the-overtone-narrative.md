The Fear Of The Overtone Narrative
----------------------------------
I took on skeleton evening stars.  
A bicycle is not enough to loiter me and keep me  
from the night of your ancient secrets.  
What invades the props of tiredness?  
A fog of serendipities attracting toward the essence around the room I like to relax like a rambunctious star.
