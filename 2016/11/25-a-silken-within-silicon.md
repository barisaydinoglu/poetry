A Silken Within Silicon
-----------------------
An odor has reflected inside the pasture,  
a mixture of imbroglio and body, a weaving  
affection that brings illusion.  
With its bruised return the cousin smiles at the god  
but the pioneer does not smile  
when he looks at the jaguar stranger  
and the acidulous ocean.  
From her shoulder and her eyeballs shower  
alcoves of the earth.  
The arrogant umbrella that blossoms in your stalks of cattail.  
A loaf of bread baked with delirious wonder and salt.  
You see heart as parsimonious as the sun.  
A loaf of bread baked with rabid purity and salt.
