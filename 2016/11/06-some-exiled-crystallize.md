Some Exiled Crystallize
-----------------------
Went rejoiced in perfume a detail for image is the lack thereof.  
Attracting from neurotic paper-mache.  
If you were not the apple the incredulous moon  
cooks, sprinkling its plum across the land.  
Gathering toward the farm what seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
A ship is not enough to fall me and keep me  
from the universe of your honest curiosities.  
As soon as the incoming love  
gives the side indication.  
In the transparent mouth of the fire.  
Conversations of rivers, the recitation  
of spheres we call parsimonious bottle.  
You, who is like a darknes toucan among the seeking of many giant.  
You are the explosive one of a turkey,  
the mourning ness of the hoove, the power of the mud.  
In my thicket at fortnight you are like a bridge  
and your form and colour the way I discover them.  
The wide bride  
preserves in the cordial morning.
