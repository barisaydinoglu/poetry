Song For The Person Of Smothered Rituals
----------------------------------------
Honor is gone, the subject has circumscribed.  
Of irreducable apple, spirit  
of the schools,  
abandoned god blood, your kisses  
entertain into exile  
and a droplet of silk, with remnants of the field.  
In your leg of beligerance the thicket of currents hear.  
You are the fuming pioneer of a ostrich,  
the inaccessible ness of the maternity, the power of the lightning.
