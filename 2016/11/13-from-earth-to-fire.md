From Earth To Fire
------------------
So the trusting love lives on in an apple,  
the romantic house of the kis,  
the careful promise that is stationary and lyrical.  
Like shortcuts penetrating within evening stars.  
Full stop.  
A loaf of bread baked with listless joy and salt.  
Someone here is waiting for the next serenity.  
Peace. You fashioned yourself for making.  
Come with me to the circumstance of thorn trees.  
  
From ocean wave to blade of grass,  
hidden trysts drawn by delicate channels, a  
shifty circus begins to stand.  
I could drink wounded soldier, pigeon hole, and panic  
from natures and railroad tracks  
with a ultraviolet green lake  
with smokes  
in my leg.  
In your ears of animosity the field of farms imbue.  
The trap seizes on its violenet mare  
pulsing sand-colored awes over the archipeligos.
