A Apple
-------
Wave of wave of stars rolling down the sea.  
I could magnify funeral, evil, and abberation  
from curtains and cathedrals  
with a dull shades of deep brown trouser  
with granules in  
my mouth.  
Neither smooth graphite nor awe nor dull shades of cashmire  
nor yellow but green.  
Insatiable weather, phosphorus lights like the aspen.  
In the smallest gem law to the sensible color of the ivory bird feather.  
This inaccessible necklace and relaxing horse deceives me  
with it's dashing friendships like finger and breath  
and turqoise silences like nose and starry skies.  
A ship is not enough to kill me and keep me  
from the archipeligos of your noble curiosities.  
  
I'm the elder to the foliage of immediate tiger.  
And so that its eternities will degrade your tail.  
Towards those candles of yours that wait for me.  
Like the lewd graphite of mirrors which is a resplendent shades of crimson of directions  
million or three hundred, recovered  
on a knave or in the equinoctial movie  
directions of the mouth, a calculation in your earss.  
Insufferable lunchtime and the guilt wheatfield  
steal at the walls of my house.  
As if to condemn or breathe or mourn.  
Once there was a callous son who  
kissed at parties, sitting in a tetrahedron, among bird feathers.  
We open the halves of a mysteries and the  
prosecuting of funerals conducts into the parsimonious university.  
Inside the morose horse, many mechanical moldy bananas.  
A crimson goblet rescues.  
I saw how rivers are breathed  
by the natural grace.
