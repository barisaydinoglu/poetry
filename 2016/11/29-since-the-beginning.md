Since The Beginning
-------------------
A current of spacious springtime  
that does not know why it flows and refreshes. The stars in the sky brainwashes, the prize of aquatic  
gallops within. A rustling flesh day  
when you chirp entertained like a railroad track.  
As soon as the incoming guitars  
gives the grammatic indication.
