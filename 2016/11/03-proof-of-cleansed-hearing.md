Proof Of Cleansed Hearing
-------------------------
The order of the landscapes I fly as if amid a ironous self-production. The noise imposes nessecity.  
I saw how springtimes are wove  
by the natural vein.  
And meetings of windy shoulder I wish to make a square  
among, and every sense, many  
times hidden in an acrobat.  
To the manly color of the silk serenity.  
From uncomfortable turbulence to tornado,  
hidden doves drawn by irreducable channels, a  
dead writing begins to pacify.  
The garden knows this,  
that life in it's ceramic boxes is as endless as the dew.  
With the kiss of the modern office where you sleep,  
a dream loiters into cameras.  
Behind the chaotic sea of chaotic light.  
The shaken tiger is deedy on your foot.
