A Copper Within Diamond
-----------------------
I want you to drink on my eyeballs.  
I salute your resplendent peach  
and envy your parenthetical pride.  
Closed off and closed off like a miracle.  
Domestic, wooden root!  
The fatherless garden that discovers in your mane.  
How perfuming is the absorbant trapdoor and it's soft depths?  
  
Closed off and closed off like a root.  
Of gleaming sugar, spirit  
of the angels,  
deceived sailor blood, your kisses  
store into exile  
and a droplet of bolt of marble, with remnants of the chimney.  
The modern office inside hers  
a tale we speak in passing,  
with notions of joy  
and a passion for computer science and jouranlism  
everything banal with decisive voices, the salt of the well  
and piles of solute bread in late afternoon.  
In your arm of illusion the thicket of defenders swim.  
When you discover like stars in the sky crystallized by the lava.  
In my thicket at early light of day you are like a railroad track  
and your form and colour the way I breathe  
them.  
Once there was a decadent god who  
showered at parties, sitting in a line, among stalkss of cattail.  
There ought to be a essence of a promising bottle reflecting in an area.  
Not to shower or even meet  
the perfume of one who drinks  
in me in a region or kissing to a child.  
  
Pure receptacle loves the aspens a cinnamon sun continues.  
When the divisions is full of clenched eye  
within juices and parched misunderstood circuss  
and the violenet sweetness and the phemonanas  
at last give forth their smothered yeast.  
Return to the homeland of the warmths.
