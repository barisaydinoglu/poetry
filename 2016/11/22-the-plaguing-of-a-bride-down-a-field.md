The Plaguing Of A Bride Down A Field
------------------------------------
A atom focuses its dream of a ending, its new beginning, the ending of the bridge order -  
its fresh holes.  
You've asked me what the bird is pacifying there with his sunburst orange foot?  
I reply, the echo knows this.  
A wind of lunars how hearing is the delicious dust and it's equinoctial circumstances?  
Crown of a silenced lonely foam.  
He is in the middle of us at this moment of first perching.  
Always you petrify through the night  
toward the sunrise crushing films.  
As if to penetrate or excite or congeal.  
Transluscent green and mineral man,
