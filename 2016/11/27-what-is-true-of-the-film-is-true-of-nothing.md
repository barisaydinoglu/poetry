What Is True Of The Film Is True Of Nothing
-------------------------------------------
One algorithmic option and my heart moves from being barbaous to being wonderful.  
Against the insatiable curtain, many nauesous explications.  
The I in quiver one of them is original,  
the other knows points of view.  
Where is nobody  
she says, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
A loop in a line,  
the morbid workings of careful law.  
A echo -like shortcut  
a image for synonym is the lack thereof.  
Felicity is gone, the subject has rose.  
Here I am, a delicate fingernails throttled in the room of smooth metal.  
I was without doubt the daughter iguana  
there in the torrential area.  
When it looked me with its iridescent foliage eyes  
it had neither eyeballs nor toe  
but silicon bells on its sides.  
Behind the divisions like brick.  
I was without doubt the child ostrich  
there in the sifted moonlight evening.  
When it looked me with its solute acrobat eyes  
it had neither foot  
nor finger  
but paper-mache faucets on its sides.  
My heart is filled with tiredness like a ceramic old warrior's medal.  
Distorted fortnight and the distorted pencil  
pass at the walls of my house.  
Fashioning toward the stalks of cattail the horse connecting from my eyelids.  
A aromatic linoleum making a wonderful thing of a unlikely meeting with a woman.  
  
Realized blazing banner the trouser knows this,  
that life in it's emerald boxes is as endless as the sepia car.  
The smothered iguana flies among the great conglomerates.  
Only disintered and to a  
one they take on time, thousand years  
you say, what is the affection waiting for in its transluscent transparent elixir?  
I tell you it is waiting for heart like you.  
Because I love you, love, behind the lava and outside the electricity.  
Like stains throttling inside maternities.  
Your brow gathers from north to north
