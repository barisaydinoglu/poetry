The Beast Fallen Into The Sea
-----------------------------
The fractious miracle that chirps in your warmth. Pockets of clay converted into crystal.  
When the archipeligos is full of mourning brow  
next to salivas and troubled rigid  
perfumes  
and the bitten cactuss and the angels  
at last give forth their rigid wall.  
Shall we set forth?
