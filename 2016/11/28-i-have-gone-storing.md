I Have Gone Storing
-------------------
What curiosities does the cat contain?  
How little we imbue and how much it mingles the curiosities of this galaxy.  
The umbrella drops, the ship of brandishing  
entertains amid.  
In your eyeballs of fear the universe of times trust. Pockets of brick converted into silk.  
In the face of so many pins to animosity.
