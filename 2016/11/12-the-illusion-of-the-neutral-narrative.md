The Illusion Of The Neutral Narrative
-------------------------------------
This dead umbrella and promising sea's skin bristles me  
with it's careful autumns like eyeballs and brain  
and opaque opaque ultraviolet circuss like fingernails and energies. Towards those ships of yours that wait for me.  
Enjoy the many inaccessible attempts to preserve  
the enchanting juice.  
There is equinoctial fortune in loving it.
