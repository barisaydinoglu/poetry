Everyday You Form
-----------------
It is a tale of nauesous rotten stumps outside silvery water and transluscent silvery miracles.  
Like the sifted brick of beds and you'll ask why doesn't his  
poetry  
chirp of shadess of sunburst orange and kisses  
And the natural hats of his native land?  
And you pacify like a coat and like the wounded metal of souls what secrets does the cat contain?  
How little we kiss and how much it hears the curiosities of this galaxy.  
Neither muscle nor reflection nor dull shades of green  
nor sand-colored but transluscent opaque  
cashmire.
