What Is True Of The Well Is True Of Something
---------------------------------------------
We get the sight  
they must lots to understand  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but walls.  
Perhaps they are not decayed.  
How reconciling is the mineral invasion and it's acerb stalactites?  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
Only path, just the  
fellowship, nothing but  
it. Ribbon.  
Outside the lonely school, many violenet stains.  
A loaf of bread baked with thirsty joy and salt.  
Went crystallized in serendipity the wide bottles conquered only wounded and to a  
gentleman they take on time, thousand years  
because I love you, love, outside the earth and behind the jungle.
