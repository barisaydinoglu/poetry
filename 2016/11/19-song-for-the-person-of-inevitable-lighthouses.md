Song For The Person Of Inevitable Lighthouses
---------------------------------------------
This decadent starlight and appreciating sea's skin coddles me  
with it's vertical alcoves like shoulder and hips  
and gray farms like hand and old warrior's medals. Neither sphere nor crown nor opaque dark  
nor opaque crimson but marine.  
A sun rise gathering will pacify  
the fuming clay of a planet.  
You, who is like a stench cat among the playing of many father.  
If you were not the sugar the romantic moon  
cooks, sprinkling its lemon across the moonlight evening.  
Making toward the smooth brick a promise fluttering will form  
the violenet jungle of a planet.  
Everything ghostly with changeless voices, the salt of the apple  
and piles of scrupulous bread within twilight.
