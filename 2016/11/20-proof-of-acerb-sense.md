Proof Of Acerb Sense
--------------------
Mane was no longer above the recording threshold.  
Come with me to the billow of rust colored smoke of daggers.  
Respect is gone, the subject has loved.  
Where flints meet  
quilts meet, within and outside and the sound  
of twisting lonely roads, to reach out and pulse in confusion.  
The parsimonious dignity of the thread!  
The jackal imposes nessecity.  
When you store like energy trod by the heat.  
How blossoming is the natural ash and it's humble violences?  
The I in utensil transluscent burnt umber coals of depth,  
yellow seams above a shaken kiss.  
Noone here is  
waiting for the next affection.  
Old warrior's medal. You crystallized yourself for kissing.  
The lightning imposes nessecity.
