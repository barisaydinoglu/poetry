Since The Beginning Of Passing
------------------------------
Nothing but your aquatic toe. A foliage -like bomb  
I stayed lived and burnt umber  
among the modern office. And fragrances of strawberry and serendipities.  
A delirious school day  
not to flow or even meet  
the form of one who forms  
inside me in a university or blossoming to an aunt.
