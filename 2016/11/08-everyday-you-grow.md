Everyday You Grow
-----------------
I do not taunt in the field of blood-stained violence.  
A plumed snow of forests.  
The I in serenity what arcane homes -  
the heights is filled with  
it,  
affections for the branch and the frightened chalk.  
The starry dignity of the maternity!  
  
From ray of sunlight to tornado,  
hidden guitars drawn by resplendent channels, a  
sticky miracle begins to perform.
