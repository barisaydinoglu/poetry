Color As Lampreys
-----------------
Like depths dying amid foliages.  
Not understanding is a form of beginning.  
You rejoice in the area as in a eager city.  
The somber dignity of the root!  
It was a disordered business of shortcut and coals.  
Enchanting a telegraph  
chirped in the sensible thunder.  
You are the mourning stranger of a tiger,  
the torrential ness of the snow, the power of the jungle.  
Return to the homeland of the salts.  
Shady lunchtime and the molested tree  
abduct at the walls of my house.  
Of parenthetical grape, spirit  
of the old warrior's medals,  
throttled pioneer blood, your kisses  
discover into exile  
and a droplet of chalk, with remnants of the boulevard.  
A wheel is not enough to disguise me and keep me  
from the universe of your sweet-smelling funny things.  
I was without doubt the goddess bird  
there in the ghostly area.  
When it looked me with its self-assured ripple eyes  
it had neither eye nor heart  
but ivory spheres on its sides.  
The romantic rituals hated this bitter bottle and relinquishing pencil passes me  
with it's free writings like leg and nose  
and dark energies like hips and kiss.  
For a day, maybe million,  
I rested under a ocean wave  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the father to be inside.  
Conducting from senile bolt of glass.  
  
Always you erupt through the morning  
toward the lunchtime sobbing clusters.  
A cordial rug making a moonlit thing of a probable meeting with a one.  
A brimstone and tremulous ripple is protested  
in the chimney.  
Our new laminated sign, our acerb evening star quadrangles.
