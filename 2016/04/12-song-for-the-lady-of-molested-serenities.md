Song For The Lady Of Molested Serenities
----------------------------------------
Everything dead with loving voices, the salt of the dove  
and piles of lyrical bread with fortnight.  
Perfume on the utensils that wait for you  
flying the guilt chairs, lunging the doors.  
Towards those peaces of yours that wait for me.  
Of your opaque rust colored river when you hold out your brow.  
The cold elephant shines among the romantic shortcuts.  
Inside the erupting cubicles.  
Like hearts passing with praises.  
The reasons for my respect  
are stored in my brow of emerald.  
Closed off and pulled out like a current.  
Brings all the decays trousers.  
With green water and yellow mists.  
A forceful metaphor attacks  
even the steady  
algorithmic thicket in study  
to which the metaphor  
will not be flowed.  
The modern office in hers  
a story we divulge in passing,  
with notions  
of respect  
and a passion for photography and jouranlism
