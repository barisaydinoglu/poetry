Faith As Cummerbunds
--------------------
Pale smokes and dry rotten stumps.  
In your brow of ignoring the archipeligos begins to dream of perching.  
The calculating root that returns in your dove.  
Because I love you, love, outside the fire and amid the jungle.  
Not to carry or even meet  
the sea shell of one who makes  
in the middle of me in a sea or pacifying to a lady.  
In the turqoise beligerance of the circumstance.
