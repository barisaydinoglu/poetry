The Raucous Clandenstine
------------------------
Decency is gone, the subject has awakened.  
Be guided by the full fellowship's coat.  
Careless pamphlets and morbid complaints.  
You've asked me what the crab is relinquishing there with his cashmire nose?  
I reply, the defender knows this.  
A flower focuses its dream of a new beginning, its new ending, the new ending of the path order -  
its handsome vigils.  
Not expanding is a form of preserving.  
A transparent goblet shines.  
A brain and a eye  
carrying the field.  
A antenna rustles,  
executes - it does not return.  
Stone.
