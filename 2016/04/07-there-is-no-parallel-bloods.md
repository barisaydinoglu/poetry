There Is No Parallel Bloods
---------------------------
Halfway.  
The sensible threads silenced a sterile tryst day  
this hushed utensil and building sea water scratches me  
with it's cosmic atoms like eyeballs and finger  
and opaque brimstone threads like lip and ripples.  
  
Expand on the juices that wait for you  
erupting the banal chairs, freezing the doors.  
To play lost fellowships and for trysts.  
  
And you taunted in the beligerance and conducted an abducting imbroglio.  
Some seize but I make your salt like home.  
Come with me to the dominion of conspirators.  
I was without doubt the aunt jaguar  
there in the phosphorus university.  
When it looked me with its blazing movie eyes  
it had neither hips nor  
tail  
but copper breakfasts on its sides.
