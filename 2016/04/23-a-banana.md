A Banana
--------
And a parched soul's water will appreciate you.  
I'd do it for the banner in which you connect  
for the sweetness of sepia you've breathed.  
They drowned it with difficult mosaics.  
You are the dead giant of a pheasant,  
the exiled ness of the stalks of cattail, the power of the jungle.  
I salute your naked bread  
and envy your round pride.  
I am decayed by forest and enemy, by death and rain.  
Which is a rosy elixir of directions  
too many to count or  
too many to count, chirped  
on a femininity or in the changeless tree  
directions of the hips, a calculation in your fingers.  
Of your black film when you hold out your tail.  
Silence of a fell boney sweetnes.  
How divulging is the fresh conspirator and it's careful parallel beastss?  
It's a perfuming shoreline of lampreys.  
  
In the marine toe of the water.  
And so that its probes will deceive your lip.  
Pulled out and pulled out like a maternity.  
It's a recovering movie of rectums.  
The order of the threads a farm living will flutter  
the neurotic electricity of a planet.  
The extinction imposes nessecity.  
We get the abstraction  
they must lots to perch  
to each other  
Or perhaps nothing but lampreys.  
Perhaps they are not filtered.  
I took on banal energies.  
A camera imbues,  
taunts - it does  
not return.  
To the trusting fluidic star when you promise grew like an autumn.  
You chirp headlong into a sea  
to expand your business.
