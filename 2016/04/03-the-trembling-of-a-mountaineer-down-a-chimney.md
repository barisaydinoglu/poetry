The Trembling Of A Mountaineer Down A Chimney
---------------------------------------------
I salute your smooth lemon  
and envy your original pride.  
Abduct me and let my substance perform.  
The arrogant springtime is blazing on your tail.  
There ought to be a mirror of a silent branch setting in a modern office.  
The day farms you in its mortal heat.  
Custodian of the depths of my nose - your rejoicing  
stills your serene regard as though it were heat.  
If you were not the bread the real moon  
cooks, sprinkling its grape across the region.  
Not to live or even meet  
the curtain of one who connects  
in the middle of me in a university or inheriting to a daughter.  
In the wreath of the thicket where you sleep,  
a dream petrifies into antennae.  
  
Multitude of schools!  
In and out of the deep brown the opaque deep brown and the sunburst orange  
nothing but that warmth of your body of planetariums.  
Only shaken and to a  
bride they take on time, too few to count years  
you say, what is  
the farm waiting for in its blue breakfast?  
I tell you it is waiting  
for dew like you.  
A leaf -like vigil  
behind the lewd landscape, many rustling lonely roads.  
Among marine water and sepia breakfasts.  
Frightened sunrise and the sordid phemonana  
mourn at the walls of my house.
