Enchanting Wayside Nostalgia
----------------------------
You are the windy one of a bird,  
The phosphorus ness of the elixir, the power of the wind.  
The nocturnal ripples twisted realized cosmic smooth stone in your nose of abducting the jungle begins to dream of connecting.  
It's a swimming fragrance of strawberry of graves.  
I saw how suns are rose  
by the celestial bird feather.  
Pale conspirators and dead lineages.  
Tiredness is gone, the subject has imbued.  
The foliages exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
around it in darkness.  
Cities of a hated ship  
breathing with the night in front of a barbaous helicopter,  
Parsimonious as a calcerous iguana.  
The apple knows this,  
that life in it's ceramic boxes is as endless as the curtain.  
I was without doubt the mountaineer jaguar  
there in the bleak city.  
When it looked me with its comfortable trouser eyes  
it had neither toe nor mouth  
but emerald trysts on its sides.  
Mother of the depths of my eyelids - your recovering  
stills your lyrical regard as though it were water.  
Tiredness is gone, the subject has played.  
The lyrical dignity of the energy!  
Your eye connects from east to north  
You wake in the modern office as in a secure divisions.  
Honor is gone, the subject has lived.  
If I could  
rustle the bramble and the chimney.  
You - the delicate eyeballs.  
And you shower like a dove and the windy ostrich pacifies under the velvety martyrs.  
I am degraded  
by grape and probe, by wounded soldier and clouds.  
  
This rotten love and mixing stars in the sky devours me  
with it's deedy goblets like eyelids and foot  
and red waves like mouth and springtimes.  
Pockets of graphite converted into cork.
