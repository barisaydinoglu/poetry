What Is True Of The Candle Is True Of Everything
------------------------------------------------
As if to electrify or wake or attack. Panic and flint - films of beligerance.  
To make lost telegraphs and for essences.  
An odor has heard inside the springtime,  
a mixture  
of corruption and body, a responding  
angel that brings sorrow.  
Be guided by the lyrical flower's fellowship.  
Fewer and fewer  
attack about another mode of pride.  
Starlight of a chained insatiable starlight.  
From unrelenting rain to uncomfortable turbulence,  
hidden cathedrals drawn by wide channels, a  
furious saxophone begins to appreciate.  
Among the opaque transluscent cinnamon leg of the electricity.
