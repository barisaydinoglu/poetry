The Epiphany Of The Modern Office
---------------------------------
She is among us at this moment of first developing.  
A leaf creating will develop  
the lonely water of a planet.  
Transform on the traps that wait for you  
degrading the fuming chairs, twisting the doors.  
Moonlit, glass home!  
One of them is decisive,  
the other knows cameras.  
Where is noone  
he cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
It's a trusting femininity of vigils.  
Went perfumed in guitar the nature knows this,  
that life in it's silken boxes is as endless as the candle.  
And among my hammock, during the sunrise, I woke up naked  
and full of felicity. What is this synonym but a memory pampered of its telegraphs?  
Multitude of defenders!  
In and out of the sand-colored the burnt umber and the green  
of your red aroma when you hold out your eye.  
To light lost breakfasts and for bells.
