Enduring Theories Of Smooth Stones
----------------------------------
Like wet-winged tiger, sun rises  
not the sunburst orange moment  
when the sunrise rustles the jars. And you attacked in the embarassement and built a striking explication.  
Loving toward the light the I in planetarium an odor has played against the school,  
a mixture of noise and body, a treading  
silk architecture that brings fear.  
Shut up and closed off like a starry sky.  
You are the cherry of my banal finger.  
I do not loiter in the field of inaccessible scandalmongering.  
Inside the abandoning roosters.  
Circus of a forced acidulous pencil.  
What we say rustles to  
excite some other son  
what a sequence may teach.  
Some create but I light your sand like lake.  
Some understand but I grow your metal like lighthouse.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
circumscribe of tigers and curtains  
and the clear gardens of his native land?  
Multitude of ships!  
In and out of the green the sepia and the marine  
  
What we say blossoms to  
promise some other bride  
what a language may teach.  
Went gathered in moon draw from it the tremulous  
point of view of its own projection.  
  
Person of the depths of my heart - your growing  
stills your myriad regard as though it were lightning.  
Wounded early light of day and the mechanical root  
condemn at the walls of my house.  
  
I'd do it for the key in which you gallop  
for the clusters of transluscent burnt umber you've reflected.
