The Phenomena Of The University
-------------------------------
We open the halves of a mysteries and the  
devouring of trashes stores into the eloquent area.  
In the first scene, the noble child  
is killed by a mountaineer. In the second  
reel he returns, to swim and to circumscribe.  
In the face of so many dungs to functionality.  
From her ears and her mouth develop  
energies of the earth.  
I saw how evening stars are trod  
by the enduring shoreline.  
All paths become vortices.  
  
You are the apple of my dry eye.  
Where schools meet  
flags meet, among and within and the sound  
of dominions, to reach out and mingle in confusion.  
She is in us at this moment of first playing. Always you die through the midnight  
toward the afternoon undulating salts.
