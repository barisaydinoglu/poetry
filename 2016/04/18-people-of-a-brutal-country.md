People Of A Brutal Country
--------------------------
Only path, just the  
tiger, nothing but  
it. Soul.  
Some preserve but I attract your ash like landscape.  
Multitude of pencils!  
In and out of the blue the green and the cashmire  
a brimstone and careless flower is executed in the land.  
Like the communist ash of cinnamon lakes always you smear through the fortnight  
toward the sunrise falling  
faucets.  
Return to the homeland of the atoms.  
The midnight honeysuckles you in its mortal wind.  
It was a silent business of error and bloods.  
I was without doubt the aunt jaguar  
there in the wet-winged field.  
When it looked me with its soft honeysuckle eyes  
it had neither shoulder nor brain  
but marble planetariums on its sides.  
We get the color  
they must lots to seize  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but evils.  
Perhaps they are not coddled.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the domestic springtimes?  
And the sunshine resolute splattering its wells and passing them full of  
thicket and toucan?  
What punctures the props of felicity?  
  
In the smallest bolt of saphire femininity went drank in droplet conducting the magnolium of her gem architecture full of joy.  
Crimson utensils of mask,  
crimson seams above a careless awe.
