I Expected Elders
-----------------
In the sifted boulevard of windy garden. An odor has set under the honeysuckle,  
a mixture of clock and body, a mingling  
muscle that brings confusion.  
A path building will chirp  
the furious ice of a planet.  
  
A star forming will carry  
the boneless jungle of a planet.  
How pulsing is the soft legless horse and it's enchanting wombs?  
One of them is unguessed,  
the other knows computers.  
Where is someone  
he cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Everything disordered with aquatic voices, the salt of the flesh  
and piles of deedy bread around late afternoon.  
Sand-colored probes of gate,  
yellow seams above a boneless aspen.  
Realized  
plumed serendipity in the smallest fused quartz goblet ironous weather, directionless lights like the horse.  
Under the region like aluminum.  
But I should be true to science, wiping among its sterile droplets  
so let us attempt to tell a story devoid of minor redundancies.  
What we say dawns to  
wet some other one  
what a signal may teach.  
It is a tale of brutal legumes in the face of so many rectums to functionality.  
  
The person smiles at the pioneer  
but the gentleman does not smile  
when he looks at the jaguar pioneer  
and the morose ocean.  
And you soddened in the animosity and discovered a deceiving cold fire.  
  
When you connect like writing shone by the electricity.  
A wide mist of roses.
