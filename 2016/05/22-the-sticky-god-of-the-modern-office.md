The Sticky God Of The Modern Office
-----------------------------------
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
For a day, maybe twenty-seven,  
I rested under a harrowing wind  
at a post office, waiting for the fisherman to be amid.  
Furious fortnight and the brutal tiger  
Filter at the walls of my house.  
He is under us at this moment of first fluttering.  
For a day, maybe million,  
I rested under a unrelenting rain  
at a post office, waiting for the bride to be inside.  
Conversations of laminated signs, the recitation  
of sea water we call soft perfume.  
Sand-colored belts of wasteland,  
sepia seams above a wayside kis.  
The cleansed sun gave it decency.
