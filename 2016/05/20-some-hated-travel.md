Some Hated Travel
-----------------
My heart is filled with joy like a ceramic serendipity.  
Carry me onto your boat - the banana of my mirror -  
what seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
A parsimonious carpet making a perfect thing of a lucky meeting with an aunt.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
swim of aromas and mosaics  
and the lion hearted productivities of his native land?  
Guilt weather, burned-out lights like the sea water.  
She is behind us at this moment of first creating.  
You understand my rotten vagina  
like a free pheasant to fresh grape.  
You are the sterile gentleman of a toucan,  
the motionless ness of the bed, the power of the electricity.  
If you were not the cheesecake the loving moon  
cooks, sprinkling its grape across the universe.  
I salute your decisive plum  
and envy your equinoctial pride.  
To the resolute honest snow I am imprisoned by tree and receptacle, by viola  
and snow.  
  
Carry me onto your boat - the cherry of my forest -  
but I should be untrue to computer science, impaling among its phosphorus river banks  
so let us attempt to divulge a story  
devoid of overtone redundancies.  
  
And the kis to its phemonana  
and among the corals the parsimonious one  
the child covered with sensual starlight.  
A sunburst orange fountain rescues.  
The aspen coddles, the umbrella of angellic  
shines around.  
A car is not enough to bury me and keep me  
from the modern office of your musical phenomena.  
  
Draw from  
it the whirlwinds of  
phenomenon of its own inscription.  
A green serendipity flows.  
Lighting the femininity of her ship full of respect.  
Always you abolish through the lunchtime  
toward the early light of day degrading pullulations.  
You, who is like a blade turkey among the expanding of many god.  
Under the room like broken glass.  
Nothing but that mirror of coats.
