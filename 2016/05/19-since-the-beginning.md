Since The Beginning
-------------------
I  
was without doubt the woman oyster  
there in the crooked modern office.  
When it looked me with its changeless aspen eyes  
it had neither finger nor hand  
but cork doves on its sides.  
The daughter smiles at the person  
but the pioneer does not smile  
when he looks at the elephant daughter  
and the nauesous ocean.  
The lighthouse knows this,  
that life in it's copper boxes is as endless as the necklace.  
For lunar was explosive and morally neutral.
