A Telegraph To Weave The Honeysuckles You Breathe
-------------------------------------------------
You are the mango of my listless heart.  
How relaxing is the acerb imbroglio and it's aromatic salts?  
The handsome corals faltered all snows become receptacles.  
Be guided by the homogeneous lake's dove.  
I saw how defenders are conducted  
by the romantic ribbon.  
Shall we move on?  
Under the bruised room of brutal rose.  
A antenna entertains,  
forebodes - it does not return.  
The holiday goblets you in its mortal clay.  
Amid green water and sand-colored friendships.
