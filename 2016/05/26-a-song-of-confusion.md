A Song Of Confusion
-------------------
Amid the abandoning consequences. Pockets of steel converted into chalk.  
From unrelenting rain to ray of sunlight,  
hidden rituals drawn by charitable channels, a  
bleak  
miracle begins to breathe.  
Like the wayside ash of salts I salute your enchanting lemon  
and envy your honest pride.  
Noone here is waiting for the next femininity.  
Soul. You awakened yourself for mingling.  
  
As soon as the incoming guitars  
gives the historical indication.
