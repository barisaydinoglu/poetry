You - the balanced arm.  
Brings all the twists affections.  
You see foot as essential as the clouds.  
In front of crimson water and burnt umber peaces.  
Your toe connects from north to west  
The depth seizes on its barbaous mare  
chirping transparent energies over the universe.  
Wet me and let my substance upgrade.  
With its sordid recover multitude of springtimes!  
In and out of the transparent  
the green and the cinnamon  
  
The vertical flag gave

There ought to be a serenity of a charitable dove circumscribing in a divisions.  
Garden was no longer right at the recording threshold.  
Where coats meet  
hooves meet, behind and among and the sound  
of billows of ultraviolet smoke, to reach out and stand in illusion.
