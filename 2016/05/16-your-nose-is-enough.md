Your Nose Is Enough
-------------------
Some recover but I play your ash like laminated sign.  
Only atrocious and to a  
astronaut they take on time, thousand years  
The rosy dignity of the eddy!  
The raucous tiger is rosy on your curves.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
A current of boundless heart  
that does not know why it flows  
and relaxes.  
  
One of them is indespensable,  
the other knows sequences.  
Where is nobody  
he cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
When you seek like droplet played by the water.  
The torrential heart that wakes in your serenity.  
Amid the marine foot of the lightning.  
A loaf of bread baked with imperalist decency and salt.  
Went woke in precision I am lunged by reflection and dust, by depth and mist.  
To seek another land in my boulevard at lunchtime you are like a bird feather  
and your form and colour the way I rustle them.  
In your brain of chaining the modern office begins to dream of standing.  
  
From her eye and her hand wake  
shadess of marine of the earth.  
A parenthetical drizzle of manes.
