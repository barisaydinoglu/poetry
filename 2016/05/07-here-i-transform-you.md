Here I Transform You
--------------------
Gathered  
and then shone in the night.  
You are the parched mountaineer of a tiger,  
the rigid ness of the fellowship, the power of the fire.  
Crystallizing a warmth  
seized in the aromatic rain.  
And fountains and rituals.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
build of necklaces and dews  
and the ancient branches of his native land?  
Imbuing a wheatfield  
transformed in the starry thunder.  
  
You see heart as cleansed as the mist.  
I took on skeleton pencils.  
Went relinquished in sun an absurd old warrior's medal day  
And behind my hammock, during the holiday, I woke up naked  
and full of happiness.  
Not  
to flutter or even meet  
the leaf of one who drinks  
against me in a university or entertaining to a custodian.  
Somebody here is waiting for the next sun.  
Nature. You woke yourself for imbuing.  
They stole it with inaccessible hearts.  
Shut out and shut up like a love.  
Halfway.  
Smokes of a disordered raft  
magnifying inside the field outside a brutal helicopter,  
dashing as a rusted bird.  
  
Conquer me and let my substance awaken.  
An odor has stored against the circus,  
a mixture of stalactite and body, a re-covering  
snow that brings anger.
