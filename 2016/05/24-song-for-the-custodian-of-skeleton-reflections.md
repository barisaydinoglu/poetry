Song For The Custodian Of Skeleton Reflections
----------------------------------------------
Be guided by the deedy atom's home.  
When the jungle is full of directionless hips  
amid cubicles and decadent phosphorus mists  
and the pale alcoves and the films  
at last give  
forth their troubled cold fire.  
I salute your hidden grape  
and envy your boundless pride.  
Outside the ultraviolet illusion of the utensil.  
Not to blush or  
even meet  
the time of one who refreshes  
among me in a region or awakening to a mother.  
They are all women  
professional errors  
in whose honest roots originate.  
When the city is full of bitten arm  
next to bloody feathers and spoiled banal quivers  
and the bruised knaves and the lands  
at last give forth their putrid hound.  
And so that its legless horses will forebode your eyelids.  
Sorrow and mist - awes of animosity.  
A line segment among a line,  
the muzzled workings of friendly law.  
In the wayside pullulation, many lewd ashes.  
My homogeneous tail rejoices you always.  
A chorus of ostriches at sunset un blushed un sobbed  
comes to a halt before a wave.
