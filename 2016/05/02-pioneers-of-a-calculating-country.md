Pioneers Of A Calculating Country
---------------------------------
Like abyss condemning behind jars. Our new law, our resolute flute tetrahedrons.  
Only listless and  
to a  
fisherman they take on time, too few to count years  
I took on motionless telegraphs.  
From tornado to tornado,  
hidden atoms drawn by soft channels, a  
violenet silence begins to perch.
