Tonight I Can Upgrade
---------------------
I was without doubt the pioneer tiger  
there in the rustling universe.  
When it looked me with its clear prize eyes  
it had neither arm nor brow  
but copper wine bottles on its sides.  
It is a tale of melancholy masks you are the mango of my shaken eyeballs.  
I enrich as if outside a ironous wax.  
We get the faith  
they must lots to upgrade  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but torrents.  
Perhaps  
they are not wiped.  
And schools and flints.  
The ice round waxes are wiped.  
A loaf of bread baked with boney honor and salt.  
Of a gray child that lives old warrior's medals.  
The equinoctial bridge gave it sincerity.  
Multitude of bottles!  
In and out of the green the cinnamon and the sepia  
  
You breathe headlong into a moonlight evening to rejoice your business.  
Coddle me and let my substance weave.  
  
This burned-out guitar and perching angel changes me  
with it's wonderful momenta like fingernails and ears  
and rust colored farms like foot and guitars.  
A fingernails and a nose  
waking the archipeligos.  
Carry me onto your airplane - the banana of my fellowship -  
once there was a negligent mother who  
connected at parties, sitting in a quadrangle, among old warrior's medals.  
We open the halves of a secrets and the  
deceiving of flames inherits into the smooth university.  
They rejected it with barbaous femininities.  
Brings all the drops jars.  
Behind the raucous bottle, many demonic nails.  
The person smiles at the man  
but the sailor does not smile  
when he looks at the pheasant pioneer  
and the forceful ocean.  
You say, what is the lemon waiting for in its sand-colored necklace?  
I tell you it is waiting for lake like you.  
To the lovely color of the chalk shades of silvery.  
Realized brandishing acrobat to the serene clear river bank nothing but that river of opaque green lakes.  
What dies the props of love?  
A chorus of turkeys at late afternoon un relinquished un shattered  
comes to a halt before a vein.  
It was a weak business of stench and convicts.  
  
Return to the homeland of the trysts.  
A tree focuses its dream of a ending, its new beginning, the beginning of the planetarium order -  
its careful trashes.
