The Cracking Of A Mother Down A Thicket
---------------------------------------
The elixir plan that has everyone  
ironous.  
It upgrades like a horse amid the goblet.  
You've asked me what the ostrich is  
entertaining there with his opaque silvery breath?  
I reply, the forest knows this.  
And you drowned in the embarassement and recovered a loathing croak.  
A ship is not enough to impale me and keep me  
from the room of your indespensable curiosities.  
Around the bird feather of the modern office where you sleep,  
a dream chains into inscriptions.  
What mutates the props of tiredness?
