I Have Gone Galloping
---------------------
You've asked me what the squirrel is rejoicing there with his sand-colored foot?  
I reply, the echo knows this. If you were not the plum the sensual moon  
cooks, sprinkling its cheesecake across the vicinity.  
In your curves of shaking the land begins to dream of blushing.  
  
Conversations of rivers, the recitation  
of sea's skins we call humble promise.
