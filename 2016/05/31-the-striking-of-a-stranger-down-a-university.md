The Striking Of A Stranger Down A University
--------------------------------------------
A fellowship -like parallel twisting lonely roads  
has the moonlight evening been lived with secrets?  
From her hand and her leg inherit  
ripples of the earth.  
Not the cashmire moment  
when the sunrise treads the silences.  
The misunderstood elephant builds among the moonlit havocs.
