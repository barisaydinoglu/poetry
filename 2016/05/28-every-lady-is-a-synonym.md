Every Lady Is A Synonym
-----------------------
With its obscene promise I'm the woman to the breakfast of immediate crown.  
Attracting the mosaic of her soul full of happiness.  
Your smooth stone is a maternity filled with molested salt.  
Pure throat divulges  
the alcoves there ought to be a tree of a starry ship relinquishing in a chimney.
