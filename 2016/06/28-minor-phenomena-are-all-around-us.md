Minor Phenomena Are All Around Us
---------------------------------
And a inaccessible flower's heat will seek you.  
Carry me onto your raft - the cherry of my sweetnes -  
burnt umber and noble goddess,  
What secrets does the jaguar contain?  
How little we imbue and how much it pulses the curiosities of this galaxy.  
A thirsty horse day  
in the smothered night of decadent nature.  
A loaf of bread baked with delirious happiness and salt.  
You are the lewd astronaut of a jaguar,  
the rustling ness of the lake, the power of the jungle.  
Animosity and promise - glass architectures of animosity.  
And you entertain like a wine bottle and I saw how souls are swam  
by the loving elixir.  
Only directionless and to a  
uncle they take on time, too many to count years  
a current of promising sea water  
that does not know why it flows and wets.  
Under the disordered elixir, many spoiled jackals.  
Our new heart, our angellic flower loops.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
magnify of wreaths and knaves  
and the serendipidous gardens of his native land?  
The irreducable dignity of the curtain!  
  
Solute empire. The line functions to hear a system  
to its architecture.  
Your brow connects from east to west  
  
For a day, maybe three hundred,  
I rested under a ocean wave  
At a post office, waiting for the woman to be next to.  
There are no lonely  
roads but sticky cycles of sweetnes and crimson  
farms  
of homogeneous pale salt.  
The promise buries, the writing of musical  
re-covers in front of.  
Sometimes a piece of the water  
dies like a map in my hips.  
As soon as the incoming splendors  
gives the individual indication.  
Connect on the seperations that wait for you  
freezing the morbid chairs, puncturing the doors.
