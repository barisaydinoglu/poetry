A Kiwi
------
And so that its jugulars will steal your eyelids.  
Wave of wave of clusters rolling down the sea.  
And meetings of rambunctious curves shall we go forward?  
Here I am, a sanguine hand lunged in the city of sun rise.  
Hat was no longer right at the transmission threshold.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
tread  
of prizes and momenta  
and the electrical banners of his native land?  
We open the halves of a mysteries and the  
brainwashing of corpses enchants into the angellic vicinity.
