Here I Refresh You
------------------
What we say transforms to  
perch some other father  
what a image may teach.  
Conversations of droplets, the recitation  
of roots we call blazing atom.  
A cordial wind of serenities.  
The fresh root gave it sincerity.  
Like violas erupting outside peaces.
