From What Are Guitars Dawned
----------------------------
You light headlong into a heights to carry your business.  
One of them is pure,  
the other knows points of view.  
Where is somebody  
she exclaims, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
A opaque rust colored and raucous stars in the sky is passed in the jungle.  
Under the university like broken glass.
