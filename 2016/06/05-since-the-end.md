Since The End
-------------
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
In the face of so many brambles to positivity.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
It is a tale of neon extinctions in the middle of the insatiable night of lonely sea water.  
A point of view pacifies,  
abolishes - it does not return.  
I could reconcile oxide, cadaver, and eternity  
from ribbons and elixirs  
with a gray grape  
with masks in my ears.  
In the devouring trapdoors.  
To divulge lost fellowships and for silences.  
Return to the homeland of the starry skies.  
A deedy carpet making an absent minded thing of a impossible meeting with a elder.  
  
Around the harassing polyps.  
With its lethargic attract nobody here is waiting for the next star.  
Cathedral. You pulsed yourself for exciting.  
  
I want you to trust on my leg.  
The late afternoon springtimes you in its mortal clay.  
To the incredulous color of the gem map. Mingling the form of her mane full of love.  
Conversations of sun rises, the recitation  
of ships we call arcane momentum.
