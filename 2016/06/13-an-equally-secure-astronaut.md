An Equally Secure Astronaut
---------------------------
You dawn in the thicket as in a myriad room.  
What clear gardens -  
the boulevard is filled with it,  
Cathedrals for the magnolium and the tenacious paper-mache.  
Realized musical wreath to pacify lost planetariums and for pencils. They soddened it with frightened promises.  
Conversations of flower heads, the recitation  
of lakes we call loving grace.
