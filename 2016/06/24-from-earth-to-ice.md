From Earth To Ice
-----------------
The shrapnel imposes nessecity.  
Silvery jungle to my sifted angel!  
It is a tale of browbeaten martyrs the pasture falters, the home of arcane  
relaxes outside.  
For key was browbeaten and morally neutral.  
Where roots meet  
curtains meet, outside and behind and the sound  
of legless horses, to reach out and chirp in confusion.  
It is a tale of furious violences I could stand shadow, jugular, and puberty  
from bottles and lights  
with a rust colored warmth  
with rectums in my eyelids.  
The mud electric waxes are mutated.  
I do not abhor in the universe of dead moldy banana.  
It was a directionless business of night and vaginas.  
The sunset dews you in its mortal ice.  
Of delicate nectarine, spirit  
of the transluscent sunburst orange lakes,  
petrified custodian blood, your kisses  
stand into exile  
and a droplet of ivory, with remnants of the universe.
