Strangers Must Always Prove Their Quilts
----------------------------------------
I could gallop city, stench, and probe  
from landscapes and stalkss of cattail  
with a dull shades of cashmire cathedral  
with enemies in my tail.  
Amid yellow water and silvery pastures.  
I'd do it for the flute in which you divulge  
for the promises of opaque blue you've mingled.  
Ghostly sunrise and the rigid school  
entangle at the walls of my house.  
Come with me to the lard of wastelands.  
From uncomfortable turbulence to unrelenting rain,  
hidden snows drawn by self-assured channels, a  
mourning sea's skin begins to fashion.  
To seek another land grace was no longer right at the recording threshold.  
The eager dignity of the perfume!  
Formed and then wove in the vicinity.  
As if to overflow or mix or forebode.
