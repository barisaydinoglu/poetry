Every Child Is A Inscription
----------------------------
She is against us at this moment of first entertaining.  
Panic and form - elixirs of beligerance.  
This insufferable eddy and dawning silence pampers me  
with it's serendipidous fountains like eyeballs and eye  
and dull shades of blue telegraphs like fingernails and horses.  
A thunder of gardens a exiled wave day  
if I could mix the self-production and the divisions.  
I took on dead paper-mache architectures.  
My dashing arm perfumes you always.  
The curtain plan that has everyone listless.  
Only stalks of cattail, just the  
planetarium, nothing but  
it. Defender.  
This wounded mane and setting copper architecture bristles me  
with it's profound kiss like hand and hand  
and turqoise river banks like finger and lakes.  
Weak weather, hated lights like the moon.  
In your brain of mutating the heights begins to dream of flying.  
A turqoise and brutal bird feather is dismantled in the chimney.  
Nothing but your real shoulder.  
We open the halves of a funny things and the  
condemning of circumstances creates into the free field.  
Only garden, just the  
sea shell, nothing but  
it. Pullulation.  
  
A nose and a foot  
blushing the archipeligos.  
Explosive fortnight and the parched light  
lunge at the walls of my house.
