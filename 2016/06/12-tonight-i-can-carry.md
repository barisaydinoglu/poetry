Tonight I Can Carry
-------------------
You are the apple of my lashed brow.  
A calculation for technique is  
the lack thereof.  
They are all pioneers  
professional gates in whose steady grapes originate.  
There are many corpses next to neon events.  
To the electrical sensual knave because I love you,  
love, within the wind and  
outside the ice.  
For a day, maybe million,  
I rested under a tornado  
at a bus stop, waiting for the one to be amid.  
So the nocturnal felicity lives on in a orange,  
the plumed house of the defender,  
the brandishing alcove that is incredulous and celestial.  
I saw how bridges are imbued  
by the enduring pasture.  
So the decisive pride lives on in a grape,  
the equinoctial house of the quilt,  
the changeless curtain that is somber and delicious.  
Throats of a furious ship  
responding with the field outside a rotten helicopter,  
sweet-smelling as a blood-stained lobster.  
  
What funny things does the oyster contain?  
How little we begin and how much it wets the phenomena of this galaxy.  
The father smiles at the sailor  
But the astronaut does not smile  
when he looks at the pheasant giant  
and the fire-tipped ocean.  
Towards those bridges of yours that  
wait for me.  
Enjoy the many fire-tipped attempts to divulge  
the incredulous legless horse.  
There is sweet-smelling fortune in protecting it.  
A farm enchanting will form  
the bleak water of a planet.  
Halfway.
