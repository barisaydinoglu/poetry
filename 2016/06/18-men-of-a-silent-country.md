Men Of A Silent Country
-----------------------
A loaf of bread baked with difficult respect and salt. What secure kiss -  
the jungle is filled with it,  
energies for the ripple and the lethargic cedar.  
I stayed sought and marine  
against the universe.  
  
I begin as if with a parched ego.
