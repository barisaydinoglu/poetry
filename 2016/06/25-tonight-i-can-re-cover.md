Tonight I Can Re-cover
----------------------
Nothing but that cactus of femininities.  
What we say reconciles to  
rejoice some other pioneer  
what a signal may teach.  
Outside the clenched film, many frail nights.  
A identity protects,  
drowns - it does not return.  
  
Within the burying shortcuts.  
Come with me to the saliva of violences.  
I am wiped by marble architecture and lance, by imbroglio and snow.  
The divisions amid hers  
a history we tell in passing,  
with notions of wonder  
and a passion for jouranlism and computer science  
a loaf of bread baked with mourning sincerity and salt.  
Developing toward the guitar I'd do it for the evening star in which you play  
for the starry skies of marine you've drank.  
  
The shards of cork imposes nessecity.  
You say, what is the aspen waiting for in its silvery necklace?  
I tell you it is waiting for flag like you.
