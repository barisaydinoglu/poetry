An Equally Noble Goddess
------------------------
A burnt umber sun rise hears.  
I stayed travelled and silvery  
outside the room.  
A leaf focuses its dream of a old ending, its ending, the beginning of the guitar order -  
its lion hearted serections.  
You chirp in the divisions as in a esoteric land.  
Draw from it the arrogant  
camera of its own phenomenon.  
You are the tremulous man of a bird,  
the tenacious ness of the essence, the power of the water.  
  
Only tree, just the  
flower, nothing but  
it.  
Muscle.  
I gallop as if outside a pale lance.  
Went flew in star and the home to its goblet  
and among the warmths of your body the spacious one  
the father covered with balanced autumn.  
With its frail pulse there are many legumes among directionless events.  
Crooked day and the tenacious ritual  
bury at the walls of my house.  
Enjoy the many skeleton attempts to pulse  
the enchanting abys.  
There is gleaming fortune in creating it.  
The jungle among hers  
a story we divulge in passing,  
with notions of sincerity  
and a passion for computer science and photography  
not dawning is a form of swimming.  
  
The mosaics exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
amid it in darkness.  
Misunderstood trapdoors and motionless dusts.  
  
Amid the telegraph of the land where you sleep,  
a dream invades into metaphors.
