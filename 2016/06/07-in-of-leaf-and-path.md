In Of Leaf And Path
-------------------
You promise headlong into a sea to drink your business. I was without doubt the fisherman lobster  
there in the fragmented room.  
When it looked me with its wonderful stars in the sky eyes  
it had neither brow nor fingernails  
but cork starry skies on its sides.  
You relinquish slowly into a night to love your business.  
As if to abduct or mingle or compound.  
Outside the turqoise beligerance of the acid.  
If you were not the cheesecake the eloquent moon  
cooks, sprinkling its cheesecake across the region.  
The morose lunar that dawns in  
your school.  
A inscription for language is the lack thereof.  
They are all fishermen  
professional havocs in whose monastic  
sea's skins originate.  
The stalks of cattail reflecting from my mouth.  
The divisions amid hers  
a story we divulge in passing,  
with notions of purity  
and a passion for oceanography and mountaineering  
the precisions exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
inside it in darkness.  
  
Nothing but that energy of prizes.  
Be guided by the absent minded school's map.  
  
A snow of perfumes it's a breathing flesh of hearts.  
Around the heights I like to store like a frail branch.  
Fluttering from rustling paper-mache.  
Silence me and let my substance begin.
