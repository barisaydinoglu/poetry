The Ironous Aunt
----------------
Realized plumed old warrior's medal what secrets does the toucan  
contain?  
How little we enrich and how much it rescues the phenomena of this galaxy.  
I salute your wonderful apple  
and envy your natural pride.  
I salute your aromatic orange  
and envy your sensual pride.  
Halfway.  
  
My heart moves from being blood-stained to being acerb.  
I could recover violence, pigeon hole, and whisper  
from spheres and flutes  
with a dark smooth rusted nail  
with conspirators in my brain.
