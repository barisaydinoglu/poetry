A Fleeting Substance
--------------------
Wave of wave of coats rolling down the sea.  
The cactuss exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
among it in darkness.  
Wave of wave of sea shells rolling down the sea.  
Inside the cashmire brow of the earth.  
The cosmic sailor  
pulses in the vertical morning. What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
My indespensable eyeballs awakens you always.
