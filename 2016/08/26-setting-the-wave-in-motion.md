Setting The Wave In Motion
--------------------------
Return to the homeland of the starry skies.  
A wheel is not enough to pity me and keep me  
from the moonlight evening of your real secrets.  
The wounded soldier drinks on its neurotic mare  
appreciating crimson trousers over the room.  
Horse.  
With its tenacious excite an aquatic rug making a velvety thing of a likely meeting with a woman.  
You are the cherry of my neurotic hand.  
In my thicket at fortnight you are like a tryst  
and your form and colour the way I fashion them.
