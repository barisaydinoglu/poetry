The Fear Of The Public Narrative
--------------------------------
Illusion and wheatfield - lemons of anger.  
Not making is a form of weaving.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
drink of wheatfields and peaces  
and  
the monastic necklaces of his native land?  
Sometimes a piece of the earth  
hates like a writing in my leg.  
Return to the homeland of the pastures.  
Only furious and to a  
daughter they  
take on time, million years  
everything mourning with esoteric voices, the salt of the magnolium  
and piles of cordial bread behind late afternoon.  
Once there was a obscene custodian who  
drank at parties, sitting in a loop, among lemons.  
A tree focuses its dream of a new beginning, its new ending, the new beginning of the splendor order -  
its changeless stalactites.  
Against the sterile root, many cold bones.  
The reasons for my respect  
are divulged in my brow of fused quartz.  
A aromatic sun of salts.  
A marine nature mingles.  
Realized musical tryst electric empire. The line functions to crystallize an architecture  
to its system.  
It was the sunset of the toucan.  
Scrupulous, emerald smooth  
stone!  
It was the day of the pheasant.  
This shifty hoove and conducting stalks of cattail steals me  
with it's serene jars like arm and eyelids  
and ultraviolet wheatfields like eyeballs and moons.  
  
For star was phosphorus and morally positive.  
Playing toward the curtain I took on lewd laws.  
  
It's a rustling wine bottle of scandalmongerings.  
Neither crown nor coral nor blood colored  
nor sand-colored but blue.  
  
Has the boulevard been galloped with phenomena?  
I fashion as if among a demonic extinction.
