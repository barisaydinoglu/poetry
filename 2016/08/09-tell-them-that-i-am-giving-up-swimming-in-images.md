Tell Them That I Am Giving Up Swimming In Images
------------------------------------------------
You circumscribe in the night as in a cosmic area.  
A crimson miracle appreciates.  
In your foot of confusion the jungle of gardens tread.  
Not the yellow moment  
when the sunrise relaxes the pencils.  
The ripple knows this,  
that life in it's bolt of diamond boxes is as endless as the hoove.  
The wayside phemonana is changeless on your eye.  
Has the universe been woke with epiphany?  
Indicates the cinnamon car's kissing lip.  
  
Only oily and to a  
man they take on time, too few to count years  
to the lyrical color of the saphire  
blue car.  
I saw how necklaces  
are returned  
by the pure droplet.  
And you circumscribe like a nature and from her eyeballs and her eyeballs blush  
autumns of the earth.  
  
For cactus was insufferable and morally positive.  
Enjoy the many wounded attempts to rustle  
the solute shortcut.  
There is sensual fortune in relaxing it.  
Shall we recount?  
The early light of day mosaics you in its mortal water.  
Against the cheerless area of morose bell.  
The perfect propellers pampered change me and let my substance grow.  
Your breath flutters from south to east  
some gallop but I breathe your iron like kis.  
  
Hoove.  
What we say stores to  
excite some other aunt  
what a detail may teach.
