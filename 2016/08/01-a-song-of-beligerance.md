A Song Of Beligerance
---------------------
When you respond like book stood by the water.  
The arcane dignity of the eddy!  
A quadrangle within a line segment,  
the callous workings of changeless law.  
Lewd coals and crooked invasions.  
A cashmire grace circumscribes.  
You seize in the heights as in a hidden room.  
Boney weather, decadent lights like the flute.  
Heart. For sea's skin was rusted and morally negative.
