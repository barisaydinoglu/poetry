The Melancholy Stranger
-----------------------
Burnt umber pigeon holes of darknes,  
blue seams above a calcerous root.  
When you travel like sun perfumed by the clay.  
Not to form or even meet  
the reflection of one who attracts  
against me in a boulevard or connecting to a uncle.  
Outside the mourning acrobat, many lonely throats.  
Sanguine, bolt of silk sun!  
In your eyeballs of illusion the moonlight evening of umbrellas dedicate.  
  
Silvery and poetic goddess,  
school of a scratched difficult land.  
For elixir was callous and morally neutral.  
Fashioning a reflection  
flew in the friendly snow.  
I stayed appreciated and sunburst orange  
outside the room.  
Sweetnes of a died lethargic femininity.  
Neither star nor ritual nor dark  
nor cashmire but cinnamon.
