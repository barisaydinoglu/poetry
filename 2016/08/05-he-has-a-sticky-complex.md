He Has A Sticky Complex
-----------------------
To seek another land I stayed preserved and yellow  
in the middle of the night.  
Shall we set forth?  
Pulled out and pulled out like a grace.  
But the droplet  
returned the memory.  
Nothing but your balanced leg.  
And so that its stains will erupt your nose.  
The steady cousin  
mingles in the cordial morning.  
Nothing but that pencil  
of waves.  
Woke and then developed in the heights.  
A loaf  
of bread baked with acidulous purity and salt.  
  
Blood-stained night and the bitter perfume  
change at the walls of my house.  
With its whirlwinds of wet I saw how waves are perched  
by the sanguine candle.  
  
Not recovering is a form of showering.  
Around the field I like to form like an atrocious hoove.
