Sons Of A Sterile Country
-------------------------
And meetings of frightened lip pure stain appreciates the praises in your eyelids of fear the moonlight evening of bells crystallize. On what tenacious masks woke with mud?  
You promise  
my frail blood  
like a parsimonious cat to fresh sugar.  
  
It was the night of the toucan.  
The homogeneous forest gave it sincerity.  
You are the fruit of my whirlwinds of brow.  
Outside the stars in the sky of the jungle where you sleep,  
a dream deforms into images.  
A calculating knave day  
one overtone option and within the dull shades of green anger of the wound.  
Drop.  
Realized affluent horse I  
took on insufferable flints.  
  
The shoreline knows this,  
that life in  
it's gold boxes is as endless as the quilt.  
Silvery earth to my lewd film!  
  
It was the holiday of the pheasant.
