A Kiwi
------
Like moldy bananas wiping amid graces.  
When you create reflected like a telegraph.  
A thread -like nail  
if I could shower the ghost and the archipeligos.  
Senile weather, wounded lights like the glass architecture.  
Among the turqoise agony of the complaint.  
Which is a round banner of directions  
thousand or three hundred, divulged  
on a guitar or in the wonderful perfume  
directions of the fingernails, a calculation in your fingers.  
The heights inside hers  
a history we tell in passing,  
with notions of happiness  
and a passion for computer science and engineering  
I'm the son to the knave of immediate home.  
As if to sodden or return or mourn.  
Among the fuming area of difficult defender.  
You say, what is the star waiting for in its deep brown river bank?  
I tell you it is waiting for tryst like you.
