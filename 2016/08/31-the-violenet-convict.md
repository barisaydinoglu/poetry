The Violenet Convict
--------------------
I do not compound in the vicinity of fire-tipped corpse.  
A chorus of pheasants at afternoon un wove un prosecuted  
comes to a halt before a flint.  
There are no pigeon holes but melancholy cycles of heart and sepia  
lemons of enduring fragmented iron.  
Towards those serendipities of yours that wait for me.  
When you drink like autumn responded by the heat.  
An odor has mingled in the middle of the quilt,  
a mixture of stain and body, a drinking  
precision that brings beligerance.  
  
With its distorted gather in front of the dark embarassement of the coal.  
So the lion hearted decency lives on in a cherry,  
the parenthetical house of the flute,  
the decisive wave that is spacious and starry.  
For fellowship was decadent and morally positive.  
Towards those aromas of yours that wait for me.  
  
You perfume in the jungle as in a careful boulevard.  
The utensil plan that has everyone crooked.
