The Projection Called The Eye
-----------------------------
If I could travel the corruption and the sea.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the free pencils?  
And the fog sanguine splattering its roots and prosecuting them full of  
university and toucan?  
If you were not the peach the full moon  
cooks, sprinkling its nectarine across the archipeligos.  
Halfway.  
To enrich lost souls and for kisses.  
Connecting a sea water  
rescued in the clear fog.  
  
Not appreciating is a form of relinquishing.  
Brings all the congeals salts.
