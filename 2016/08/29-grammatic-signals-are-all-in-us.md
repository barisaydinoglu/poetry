Grammatic Signals Are All In Us
-------------------------------
You see brow as stationary as the thunder.  
You dedicate my dry yeast  
like a domestic pheasant to fresh nectarine.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
wet of aromas and trysts  
and the thick saxophones of his native land?  
What we say fashions to  
reflect some other son  
what a metaphor may teach.  
  
I saw how warmths are flew  
by the dashing serendipity.  
Amid the rust colored animosity of the consequence.  
Atom.  
Among the archipeligos like ash.  
Which is a round horse of directions  
thousand or twenty-seven, fashioned  
on a heart or in the blazing reflection  
directions of the lip, a calculation in your eyelidss.  
Not recovering is a form of rustling.  
  
Return to the homeland of the shadess of transluscent transparent.  
I took on sterile starss in the sky.
