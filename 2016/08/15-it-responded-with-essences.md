It Responded With Essences
--------------------------
Nothing but your verdure tail.  
Fewer and fewer  
pamper about another mode of felicity.  
Time of a undulated molested sea water.  
Towards those beds of yours that wait for me.  
The moldy banana continues on its violenet mare  
promising cinnamon droplets over the boulevard.  
In the face of so many dungs to functionality.  
As if to abolish or awaken or devour.  
You say, what is the starlight waiting for in its silvery breakfast?  
I tell you it is waiting for stone like you.  
One of them is electric,  
the other knows metaphors.  
Where is somebody  
He quips, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Pockets of ash converted into marble.  
It continues like a juice outside the soul.  
Come with me to the granule of cities.  
But the mist showered the memory.  
Outside the killing legless horses.  
  
A vein growing will drink  
the callous heat of a planet.
