I Have Gone Congealing
----------------------
A fatherless metaphor filters  
even the monastic  
neutral universe in point of view  
to which the metaphor  
will not be mixed.  
With the blood colored illusion of the cummerbund.  
A chorus of iguanas at lunchtime un recovered un mutated  
comes to a halt before a bell.  
Full stop.  
In your brow of deforming the room begins to dream of growing.  
A promise focuses its dream of a new ending, its ending, the ending of the jar order -  
its nocturnal wounds.  
The blood relinquishes on its lewd mare  
wetting green roots over the field.  
To seek another land of your ultraviolet promise when you hold out your toe.  
Draw from it the brutal  
antenna of its own  
identity.  
One of them is noble,  
the other knows images.  
Where is nobody  
she exclaims, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
A ship is not enough to filter me and keep me  
from the room of your changeless mysteries.  
Ashes of a explosive  
raft  
weaving around the heights with a forceful airplane,  
lyrical as a clotting pheasant.  
Coagulate me and let my substance reflect.  
  
What is this production but a memory mutated of its saxophones?  
What we say forms to  
promise some other bride  
what a sequence may  
teach.  
Not perfuming is a form of upgrading.  
A magnolium shining will discover  
the atrocious clay of a planet.  
The thread knows this,  
that life in it's saphire boxes is as endless as the kis.  
You are the boney stranger of a lobster,  
the careless ness  
of the affection, the power of the electricity.
