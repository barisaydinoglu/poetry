A Song Of Fear
--------------
To the moonlit color of the gold shoreline. Not forming is a form of upgrading.  
What is this identity but a memory pampered of its bottles?  
The starlight forebodes, the sun rise of loving  
forms amid.  
Animosity and knave - cathedrals of illusion.  
A acrobat -like legless horse  
rising from mourning glass.  
Eddy.
