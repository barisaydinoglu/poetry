Metaphor In The Minor Services
------------------------------
A bicycle is not enough to sodden me and keep me  
from the room of your solute funny things.  
You perform headlong into a universe to promise your business.  
The resolute flowers buried I want you to magnify on my breath.  
The landscape plays in creating your brow.  
Halfway.  
Yellow massacres of evil,  
sepia seams above a insatiable smooth stone.  
Here I am, a full hand froze in the sea of laminated sign.  
To the balanced color of the ceramic propeller.  
What we say lives to  
wet some other goddess  
what a technique may teach.  
Halfway.
