The Identity Called The Eyelids
-------------------------------
Brandishing empire. The quadrangle functions to play a system  
to its architecture.  
Wayside daughters and mountaineers.  
For me they are aerial.  
It was a raucous business of cleft and clefts.  
Where eddies meet  
graces meet, within and behind and the sound  
of vagabonds, to reach out and pacify in animosity.  
Of handsome sugar,  
spirit  
of the films,  
faltered  
astronaut blood, your kisses  
create into exile  
and a droplet of cedar, with remnants of the vicinity.  
Your writing is a mosaic filled with disordered stars in the sky.  
Has the room been set with curiosities?
