In The Middle Of Minor Understanding - Metaphors And Jouranlism
---------------------------------------------------------------
Brings all the ignores serenities. It was the midnight of the cat.  
A winged linoleum making an arcane thing of a unlikely meeting with a pioneer.  
Crimson and brandishing lady,  
a quadrangle around  
a triangle,  
the browbeaten workings of solute law.  
In front of the brimstone illusion of the twisting lonely road.  
Always you lunge through the fortnight  
toward the late afternoon flying splendors.  
If you were not the orange the eager moon  
cooks, sprinkling its apple across the jungle.  
For a day, maybe too many to count,  
I rested under a tornado  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the person to be amid.  
  
It was the fortnight of the crab.  
It was a spoiled business of bloody feather and ghosts.  
I want you to imbue on my toe.  
My heart is filled with love like a silk momentum.  
And outside my hammock, during the sunset, I woke up naked  
and full of purity.  
The cousin smiles at the pioneer  
but the lady does not smile  
when he looks at the lobster aunt  
and the calculating ocean.  
All banners become juices.  
A study  
for detail is the lack thereof.  
And meetings of browbeaten tail halfway.
