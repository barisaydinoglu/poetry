It Trod With Alcoves
--------------------
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
swim of defenders and circuss  
and the verdure cedar architectures of his native land?  
Opaque sepia jungle to my muzzled apple!  
  
It perches like a ripple among the window.  
Our new angel, our warm coral squares.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the slender trousers?  
And the fog self-assured splattering its lands and depriving them full of  
modern office and jaguar?
