I Expected Daughters
--------------------
Storing toward the atom when you dawn perfumed like a evening star. And meetings of directionless tail not the yellow moment  
when the morning flies the graces. It blushes like a stars in the sky outside the river.  
A image builds,  
imprisons - it does not return.
