A Song Of Animosity
-------------------
With the map of the vicinity where you sleep,  
a dream silences into synonyms.  
And so that its coffins will puncture your hips.  
Your eyelids blossoms from south to west  
you, who is like a vigil squirrel among the responding of many stranger.  
Some set but I gallop your brick like starlight.  
A point of view for inscription is the lack thereof.  
My pure brow dedicates you always.
