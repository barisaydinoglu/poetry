Some Clotting Rise
------------------
The inevitable juice that rescues in your coral. For sea water was atrocious and morally negative.  
A directionless book day  
Like arrogant key, love  
where quilts meet  
trysts meet, behind and among and the sound  
of traps, to reach out and swim in anger.  
Sometimes a piece of the clay  
petrifies like a faucet in my toe.
