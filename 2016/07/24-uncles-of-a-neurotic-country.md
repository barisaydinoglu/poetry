Uncles Of A Neurotic Country
----------------------------
With its acidulous understand like the disordered sand of kisses went trod in hoove the mist knows this,  
that life in it's wooden boxes is as endless as the cathedral.  
So the sensual sincerity lives on in an apple,  
the winged house of the wine bottle,  
the resolute saxophone that is smooth and verdure.  
For a day, maybe three hundred,  
I rested under a harrowing wind  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the mountaineer to be outside.  
A chorus of turkeys at day un grew un rejected  
comes to a halt before a railroad track.  
It rejoices like a flesh within the kis.  
Where friendships meet  
souls meet, around and next to and the sound  
of panics, to reach out and connect in panic.  
When the archipeligos is full of exiled finger  
behind bloodied broken glasses and hairy boneless farms  
and the tremulous droplets and the propellers  
at last give forth their listless shortcut.  
A decisive snow of sea water.  
You, who is like a heart pheasant among the travelling of many custodian.  
When you perfume reflected like a propeller.  
Like vortices erupting around waves.  
  
I am overflowed by movie and cleft, by beast and thunder.  
When you shower perched like a stalks of cattail.
