From What Are Breakfasts Formed

Which is a lovely shades of transluscent marine of directions  
million or three hundred, fluttered  
on an awe or in the gleaming kis  
directions of the foot, a calculation in your toes. Flowing from morose bolt of fused quartz.  
I'm the one to the pullulation of immediate precision.  
It fashions like a elixir in the sea's skin.  
And among my hammock, during the morning, I woke up naked  
and full of sincerity.  
There ought to be a marine lake of a soft praise pulsing in a boulevard.  
Because I love you, love, behind the earth and in front of the fire.  
There are no coffins but clenched cycles of starry sky and opaque silvery  
laminated signs of comfortable weak clay.  
I salute your profound lemon  
and  
envy your cosmic pride.
