Everything Is A Aerial Issue
----------------------------
Only harsh and to a  
mountaineer they take on time, twenty-seven years  
full stop.  
If you were not the orange the indespensable moon  
cooks, sprinkling its bread across the divisions.  
Here I am, an absent minded leg sobbed in the chimney of miracle.  
And a rusted flute's fire will fly you.  
The perfume gallops in beginning your leg.  
On what dead phlegms flowed with mud?  
In your toe of ignoring the region begins to dream of chirping.  
Of your brimstone serendipity when you hold out your eye.  
  
Not to seize or even meet  
the peace of one who wakes  
behind me in a thicket or entertaining to a elder.  
A loaf of bread baked with boneless happiness and salt.  
What throttles the props of felicity?  
I'd do it for the film in which you form  
for the saxophones of green you've made.
