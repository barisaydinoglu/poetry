Some Insufferable Pulse
-----------------------
Shifty salts and careless shrapnels.  
The dew rejoices in rejoicing your brow.  
If I could re-cover the lonely road and the moonlight evening.  
The plumed grapes flew of secure sugar, spirit  
of the candles,  
congealed god blood, your kisses  
reflect into exile  
and a droplet of silicon, with remnants of the universe.  
  
The garden plan that has everyone boney.  
Within the brainwashing violences.  
The affection enriching from my brain.  
In the face of so many shadows to functionality.  
The snow appreciates in lighting your arm.  
Pure noise attracts the starlights in front of transparent water and opaque cashmire graces.  
A droplet focuses its dream of a beginning, its ending, the new ending of the nature order -  
its resplendent extinctions.  
In the face of so many receptacles to positivity.
