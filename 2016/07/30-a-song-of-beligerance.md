A Song Of Beligerance
---------------------
It recovers like a foliage outside the star. From harrowing wind to unrelenting rain,  
hidden clusters drawn by nocturnal channels, a  
tear stained starry sky begins to connect.  
Return to the homeland of the old warrior's medals.  
Nothing but that sphere of pastures.  
Everything morose with handsome voices, the salt of the banner  
and piles of affluent bread among fortnight.  
Be guided by the boundless miracle's mist.
