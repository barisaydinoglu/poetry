The Machine Of Minor Points
---------------------------
Realized deedy telegraph some swim but I mingle your broken glass like magnolium.  
A study travels,  
cracks - it does not return.  
Only eddy, just the  
bell, nothing but  
it. Wine bottle.  
Around the archipeligos I like to imbue like a phosphorus awe.  
Pioneer of the depths of my leg - your crystallizing  
stills your serendipidous regard as though it were sky.  
The bitten sun is rosy on your heart.  
I'd do it for the path in which you perform  
for the flutes of transluscent transluscent blue you've promised.  
Return to the homeland of the warmths.  
Pockets of ash converted into silk.  
Kiss on the trapdoors that wait for you  
lunging the mourning chairs, attacking the doors.  
On what calculating vagabonds discovered with lava?  
  
Of a brimstone astronaut that stands rituals.  
Of friendly cheesecake, spirit  
of the moons,  
deceived man blood, your kisses  
reconcile into exile  
and a droplet of glass, with remnants of the modern office.
