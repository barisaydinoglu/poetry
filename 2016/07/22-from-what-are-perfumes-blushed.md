From What Are Perfumes Blushed
------------------------------
Return to the homeland of the aspens. From ray of sunlight to harrowing wind,  
hidden dews drawn by wonderful channels, a  
hollow banner begins to kiss.  
I was without doubt the one bird  
there in the weak archipeligos.  
When it looked me with its promising light eyes  
it had neither brow nor nose  
but marble stars on its sides.  
The burned-out pullulation is eager on your eyelids.
