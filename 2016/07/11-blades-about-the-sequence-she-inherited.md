Blades About The Sequence She Inherited
---------------------------------------
Sometimes a piece of the heat  
taunts like a bell in my shoulder.  
A nauesous projection buries  
even the resplendent  
overtone sea in phenomenon  
to which the metaphor  
will not be stood.  
Around burnt umber water and sand-colored pastures.  
It's a beginning bridge of sticks.  
Breathe on the corpses that wait for you  
protesting the explosive chairs, overflowing the doors.  
My heart is filled with felicity like a bolt of copper candle.  
As if to filter or store or throttle.  
Return to the homeland of the leaves.  
Among the loathing violas.  
For bird feather was rigid and morally negative.  
To the solute color of the marble soul.  
On what disintered gates excited with ice?  
For a day, maybe three hundred,  
I rested under a palm tree leaf  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the cousin to be amid.
