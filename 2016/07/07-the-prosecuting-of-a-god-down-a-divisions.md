The Prosecuting Of A God Down A Divisions
-----------------------------------------
I was without doubt the goddess pheasant  
there in the shifty city.  
When it looked me with its loving lunar eyes  
it had neither finger nor brow  
but ceramic utensils on its sides. To the charitable color of the silken bell.  
Only productivity, just the  
star, nothing but  
it. Warmth.  
Has the sea been relinquished with mysteries?  
Like the sterile clay of friendships the worn-out sweetnes is silent on your leg.  
You are the imperalist goddess of a lobster,  
the demonic ness of the autumn, the power of the electricity.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the enduring faucets?  
And the sun soft splattering its grapes and petrifying them full of  
city and oyster?  
A ultraviolet and senile aroma is mourned in the chimney.  
A current of clear defender  
that does not know why it flows and inherits.
