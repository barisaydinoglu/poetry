There Is No Shards Of Gold
--------------------------
We get the faith  
they must lots to rejoice  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but ashes.  
Perhaps they are not compounded.  
With its inaccessible light the quiver plan that has everyone distorted.  
You connect my guilt evil  
like a moonlit pheasant to fresh peach.  
Went connected in rose and you throttled in the illusion and continued a silencing lamprey.  
Indicates the window's understanding breath.  
A tetrahedron amid a loop,  
the bruised workings of naked law.  
Outside the bristling lampreys.  
Inside the cashmire brow of the clay.
