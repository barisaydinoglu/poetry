Everything Is A Alphabetic Issue
--------------------------------
The jungle with hers  
a tale we speak in passing,  
with notions of purity  
and a passion for oceanography and science  
a current of indespensable land  
that does not know why it flows and loves.  
The breakfast creates in flying your fingernails.  
One of them is warm,  
the other knows computers.  
Where is someone  
he exclaims, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
So the noble respect lives on in a orange,  
the sanguine house of the cactus,  
the nocturnal leaf that is moonlit and moonlit. Pockets of sand converted into copper.  
The nature rejoicing from my mouth.  
A boat is not enough to crush me and keep me  
from the chimney of your stationary epiphany.  
You've asked me what the toucan is rising there with his cashmire fingernails?  
I reply, the tiger knows this.  
My heart is filled with pride like a glass foliage.  
Here I am, an aquatic fingernails impaled in the room of light.  
One technical option and among the senile laminated sign, many hollow utensils.
