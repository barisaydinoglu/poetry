Since The End Of Flying
-----------------------
The lyrical dignity of the flute!  
I was without doubt  
the sailor jaguar  
there in the shaken modern office.  
When it looked me with its steady stone eyes  
it had neither mouth nor nose  
but silk stars on its sides.  
The apple protecting from my shoulder.  
In the first scene, the cleansed elder  
is taunted by a giant. In the second  
take he returns, to blossom and to chirp.  
Transformed and then created in the room.  
Shall we recount?  
Mingled and then discovered in the night.  
A sepia atom lives.  
A clouds of perfumes the parallel clefts breathes on its muzzled mare  
hearing burnt umber forms over the night.  
Behind the lewd femininity, many demonic vaginas.  
But the sea's skin recovered the memory.  
  
When you store discovered like a droplet.  
And a cold tryst's wind will blossom you.
