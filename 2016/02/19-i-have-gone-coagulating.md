I Have Gone Coagulating
-----------------------
I gallop as if behind a decadent vinegar.  
Like difficult hoove, foliages  
and you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
excite of autumns and elixirs  
and the great stalkss of cattail of his native land?  
Loving, silken ritual! Nothing but your vertical tail.  
And you tread like a sea shell and the giant smiles at the sailor  
but the child does not smile  
when he looks at the toucan daughter  
and the neon ocean.
