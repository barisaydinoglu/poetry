What Is True Of The Tiger Is True Of Everything
-----------------------------------------------
If you were not the plum the absorbant moon  
cooks, sprinkling its bread across the city. Neither sun rise nor femininity  
nor rust colored  
nor cashmire but sunburst orange.  
Burnt umber lava to my demonic key!  
Like trash barges replacing behind veins.
