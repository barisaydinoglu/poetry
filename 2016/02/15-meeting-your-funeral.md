Meeting Your Funeral
--------------------
Someone here is waiting for the next rose.  
Essence. You perfumed yourself for understanding.  
My acerb eyelids wakes you always.  
The weak key is aquatic on your hips.  
But I should be true to jouranlism, shaking among its tenacious fleshes  
so let us begin to divulge a story without technical redundancies.  
Which is a human horse of directions  
too few to count or twenty-seven, seized  
on a curtain or in the blazing honeysuckle  
directions of the heart, a calculation in your legs.  
And a directionless cluster's electricity will build you.
