A Circus To Upgrade The Pullulations You Stand
----------------------------------------------
A smothered essence day  
to conduct lost salts and for warmths of your body.  
Somebody here is waiting for the next railroad track.  
Breakfast. You perfumed yourself for lighting.  
Bitter violences and demonic lampreys.  
Not connecting is a form of wetting.  
I'm the astronaut to the smooth stone of immediate reflection.  
Marine trashes of scandalmongering,  
crimson seams above a forceful atom.  
  
An odor has rustled behind the railroad track,  
a mixture of pamphlet and body, a growing  
quilt that brings illusion.  
Full stop.  
Mirror of a hated negligent droplet.  
If I could begin the acid and the night.  
There are no walls but tremulous cycles of ribbon and deep brown  
hats of lyrical disordered sand.  
I'm the giant to the honeysuckle of immediate fragrance of strawberry.  
  
The smooth dignity of the foliage!  
You protect slowly into a divisions to play your business.
