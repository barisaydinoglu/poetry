Some Decadent Love
------------------
A thick sunshine of laminated signs.  
Halfway.  
Law.  
Among cashmire water and transluscent cashmire umbrellas.  
Next to sand-colored water and cashmire banners.  
Only jar, just the  
hoove, nothing but  
it. Propeller.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
re-cover of pencils and kiss  
and the honest acrobats of his native land?  
Wide empire. The triangle functions to shower a system  
to its architecture.  
Not to gather or even meet  
the drop of one who flies  
under me in a moonlight evening or crystallizing to an aunt.
