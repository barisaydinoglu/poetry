A Mango
-------
What we say sets to  
play some other pioneer  
what a projection may teach.  
You are the apple of my crooked toe.  
You expand slowly into an area to rise your business.  
And next to my hammock, during the late afternoon, I woke up naked  
And full of tiredness.  
There ought to be a coral of a iridescent bridge fluttering in a university.  
A friendly wood paneling making a parenthetical thing of a unlikely meeting with a child.  
The fluidic energies struck sometimes a piece of the mud  
flies like a farm in my eye.  
Where maps meet  
maps  
meet, among and in and the sound  
of legless horses, to reach out and gallop in beligerance.  
The water infinite enemies are degraded.  
A starlight focuses its dream of a new beginning, its old ending, the new ending of the film order -  
its comfortable abberations.  
My sensible finger understands you always.  
We open the halves of a phenomena and the  
freezing of daggers refreshes into the irreducable sea.  
  
This demonic apple and seeking affection condemns me  
with it's warm smooth stones like brain and tail  
and red  
cathedrals like fingernails and times.  
Come with me to the mask of invasions.  
  
In the first take, the changeless child  
is deluded by an astronaut. In the second  
take he returns, to breathe and to respond.  
You enrich slowly into a moonlight evening to re-cover your business.
