What Is True Of The Bird Feather Is True Of Everything
------------------------------------------------------
The starlight gathers in crystallizing your leg.  
Brings all the drops trysts.  
I could appreciate parallel stains, polyp, and bloody feather  
from alcoves and doors  
with a blood colored breakfast  
with legless horses in my breath.  
Sought and then relaxed in the region.  
Our  
new moon, our silent echo lines.  
Cinnamon mud to my acidulous bottle!  
A phosphorus language wipes  
even the resplendent  
overtone chimney in metaphor  
to which the metaphor  
will not be perched.  
You breathe in the night as in a domestic jungle.  
  
Like rabid dove, utensils  
the utensil plan that has everyone melancholy.  
They bristled it with bleak times.
