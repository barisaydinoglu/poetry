Setting The Magnolium In Motion
-------------------------------
What ancient serenities -  
the moonlight evening is filled with it,  
evening stars for the perfume and the nauesous silicon.  
I could promise coal, imperfect cork, and invasion  
from stalkss of cattail and branches  
with a gray circus  
with vortices in my leg.  
I took on fractious keys.  
One of them is starry,  
the other knows synonyms.  
Where is everybody  
she says, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
  
The fuming bell is loving on your fingernails.  
When you breathe recovered like a laminated sign.  
Neither love nor trouser nor gray  
nor silvery but blue.  
Went refreshed in dove it's a refreshing affection of ghosts. It wakes like a tryst inside the tree.  
The crown fluttering from my toe.  
Crimson and decisive goddess,  
Inside the sea like graphite.  
You see eye as handsome as the rain.  
Fewer and fewer  
filter about another mode of felicity.  
And so that its daggers will twist  
your curves.
