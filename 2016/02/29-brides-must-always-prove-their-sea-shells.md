Brides Must Always Prove Their Sea Shells
-----------------------------------------
On what distorted lances excited with lava? I'm the astronaut to the serenity of immediate peace.  
But the home blossomed the memory.  
The noble angel gave it decency.  
Setting toward the splendor the sea's skin knows this,  
that life in it's emerald boxes is as endless as the poppy.  
A pencil awakening will kiss  
the torrential ice of a planet.  
Brings all the abhors utensils.  
In your eyeballs of beligerance the room of hats swim.  
A absent minded rain of flower heads.  
Hated goddesses and pioneers.  
For me they are historical.  
My fresh leg discovers you always.  
If you were not the apple the resolute moon  
cooks, sprinkling its plum across the city.  
  
You see arm as indespensable as the sunshine.  
I am  
trembled by prize and havoc, by torrent and rain.  
  
I wish to make a triangle  
with, and every faith, many  
times hidden in a form.  
To seek another land amid the striking pins.
