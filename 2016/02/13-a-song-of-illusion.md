A Song Of Illusion
------------------
Sepia and moonlit father,  
a senile old warrior's medal day  
the cummerbund divulges on its brutal mare  
forming sunburst orange wreaths over the divisions.  
Among the necklace of the university where you sleep,  
a dream electrifies into antennae.  
He is inside us at this moment of first rustling.
