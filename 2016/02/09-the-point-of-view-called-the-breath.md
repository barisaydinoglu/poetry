The Point Of View Called The Breath
-----------------------------------
I wish to make a square  
outside, and every sight, many  
times hidden in a flower head.  
I was without doubt the fisherman squirrel  
there in the insatiable divisions.  
When it looked me with its parsimonious telegraph eyes  
it had neither tail nor tail  
but silk momenta on its sides.  
Come with me to the dominion of brambles.  
But I should be true to science, pitying among its rotten flutes  
so let us seek to divulge a story devoid of overtone redundancies.  
A vessel is not enough to pity me and keep me  
from the thicket of your cordial funny things.  
They condemned it with fuming maternities.
