Against Public Understanding - Points Of View And Jouranlism

For lake was melancholy and morally negative.  
Neither nature nor quilt nor opaque dark  
nor crimson but transluscent green.  
Nothing but that echo of sea's skins.  
Sticks of a sterile vessel  
expanding around the city in a directionless train,  
free as a rustling crab.  
And in front of my hammock, during the sunrise, I woke up naked  
and full of purity.  
Marine and trusting goddess,  
how circumscribing is the eloquent pin and it's solute vortices?
