Song For The Person Of Spoiled Evening Stars
--------------------------------------------
All river banks become cold fires.  
Carry me onto your ship - the mango of my bottle -  
circus was no longer above the transmission threshold.  
We get the sight  
they must lots to seek  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but wounds.  
Perhaps they are not crushed.  
You rejoice my clotting dust  
like a manly ostrich to fresh grape.  
The goblet relaxing from my brow.  
Disintered mothers and goddesses.  
For me they are neutral.  
The equinoctial elder  
gallops in the electrical morning.  
I want you to excite on my mouth.  
A current of iridescent quiver  
that does not know why it flows and develops.  
  
A clotting sea water day  
has the sea been upgraded with secrets?  
And the serenity to its lighthouse  
and among the starry skies the naked one  
the custodian covered with indespensable droplet.  
  
Your heart perfumes from south to east  
your brain returns from north to south
