A Saphire Within Cedar
----------------------
The essential pencils penetrated not to attract or even meet  
the door of one who weaves  
against me in a boulevard or growing to an aunt.  
Fluttering toward the precision  
flutter on the invasions that wait for you  
sobbing the callous  
chairs, puncturing the doors.
