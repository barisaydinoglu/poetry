From What Are Starss In The Sky Travelled
-----------------------------------------
The I in soul multitude of warmths!  
In and out of the transluscent deep brown the yellow and the transluscent transluscent cinnamon  
it's a exciting coral of daggers.  
A current of profound angel  
that does not know why it flows and loves.  
Chirped and then circumscribed in the region.  
Chirping from insufferable ceramic.  
Nothing but that bell of echoes.  
Towards those faucets of yours that wait for me.  
From pillow of fog to ocean wave,  
hidden sea water drawn by irreducable channels, a  
imperalist heart begins to refresh.  
A chorus of pheasants at fortnight un made un fainted  
comes to a halt before a wreath.  
A loaf of bread baked with tenacious tiredness and salt.  
He is outside us at this moment of first setting.  
I salute your verdure grape  
and envy your warm pride.  
You, who is like a flask cat among the fluttering of many daughter.  
You, who is like a flask bird among the beginning of many pioneer.  
The prize knows this,  
that life in it's ivory boxes is as endless as the hoove.  
From unrelenting rain to palm tree leaf,  
hidden bird feathers drawn by mineral channels, a  
dead nature begins to shine.  
Dilute weather, fragmented lights like the cactus.  
  
Everything rabid with soft voices, the salt of the old warrior's medal  
and piles of ancient bread amid lunchtime.  
Fewer and fewer  
abolish about another mode of respect.  
  
You see toe as electric as the fog.  
The alarm imposes nessecity.  
The serene starss in the sky harassed I'd do it for the sea shell in which you store  
for the corals of cinnamon you've fluttered.  
Behind the area like aluminum.
