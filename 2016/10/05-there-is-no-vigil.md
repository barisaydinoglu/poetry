There Is No Vigil
-----------------
In the smallest glass honeysuckle but the shoreline travelled the memory. I am deprived by pullulation and shadow, by womb and wind.  
Which is a resplendent  
snow of directions  
twenty-seven or too many to count, made  
on a movie or in the cosmic snow  
directions of the brain, a calculation in your hearts.  
Angellic, glass hat!  
My heart is filled with respect like a cedar window.
