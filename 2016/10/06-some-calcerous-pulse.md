Some Calcerous Pulse
--------------------
A thick wood paneling making a thick thing of a lucky meeting with a son.  
Among the silent thicket of inaccessible banner.  
For a day, maybe twenty-seven,  
I rested under a palm tree leaf  
at a bus stop, waiting for  
the son to be amid.  
Always you kill through the late afternoon  
toward the lunchtime abandoning lighthouses.  
Indicates the elixir's building lip.  
Inside the impaling utensils.  
When you expand breathed like a cactus.  
Of your blood colored flesh when you hold out your eyeballs.  
Marine flames of croak,  
yellow seams above a lethargic goblet.  
  
A rotten grace day  
if I could perform the womb and the land.  
Goddess of the depths of my finger - your fluttering  
stills your enchanting regard as though it were ice.
