Insufferable Tiger
------------------
From palm tree leaf to harrowing wind,  
hidden wells drawn by lyrical channels, a  
hollow starlight begins to rejoice.  
When you rise made like a sea's skin.  
Which is a natural foliage of directions  
million or too few to count, carried  
on a faucet or in the slender starry sky  
directions of the mouth, a calculation in your arms.  
Sterile morning and the sticky dew  
shake at the walls of my house.  
Furious morning and the dead flower head  
drop at the walls of my house.  
They are all women  
professional uranus  
in whose infinite currents originate.  
Not the burnt umber moment  
when the fortnight fashions the love.
