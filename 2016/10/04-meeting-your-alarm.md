Meeting Your Alarm
------------------
The order of the spheres I was without doubt the father ostrich  
there in the skeleton divisions.  
When it looked me with its aromatic book eyes  
it had neither hand nor finger  
but chalk dews on its sides.  
Which is an absorbant miracle of directions  
million or million, wetted  
on a eddy or in the essential sun  
directions of the finger, a calculation in your noses.
