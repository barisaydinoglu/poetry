Language In The Neutral Services

Has the land been performed with curiosities?  
Our new film, our clear railroad track quadrangles.  
Only flesh, just the  
nature, nothing but  
it. Echo.  
I wish to make a circle  
outside, and every feeling, many  
times hidden in a quilt.  
Green gates of saliva,  
opaque deep brown seams above a senile bird feather.
