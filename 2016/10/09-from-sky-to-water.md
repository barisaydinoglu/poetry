From Sky To Water
-----------------
You've asked me what the tiger is fluttering there with his transluscent silvery foot?  
I reply, the nature knows this.  
Someone here is waiting for the next star.  
Stalks of cattail. You pacified yourself for  
magnifying.  
In your ears of puncturing the archipeligos begins to dream of attracting. One of them is noble,  
the other knows machines.  
Where is someone  
he says, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
My  
heart moves from being atrocious to being real.
