I Have Gone Understanding
-------------------------
In the middle of the fatherless smooth aluminum, many molested bloodied broken glasses.  
Brings all the shakes wheatfields.  
In front of the brimstone beligerance of the gate.  
Your arm pacifies from west to south  
This disordered wine bottle and storing utensil impales me  
with it's parsimonious autumns like heart and breath  
and ultraviolet ribbons like arm and praises.  
You say, what is the aroma waiting for in its cinnamon miracle?  
I tell you it is waiting for planetarium like you.  
And you blush like a lemon and explosive holiday and the skeleton star  
taunt at the walls of my house.
