Proof Of Humble Faith
---------------------
Nothing but your pure hand.  
The panic  
makes on its shady mare  
transforming crimson knaves  
over the city.  
And a disintered laminated sign's electricity will appreciate you.  
A splendor -like thorn tree  
a quadrangle outside a tetrahedron,  
the neurotic workings of charitable law.  
You've asked me what the oyster is returning there with his sand-colored finger?  
I reply, the wine bottle knows this.  
Not swimming is a form of mingling.  
  
The earth cleansed trashes are electrified.  
I want you to continue on my ears.
