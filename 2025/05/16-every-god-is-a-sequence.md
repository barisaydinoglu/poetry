Every God Is A Sequence
-----------------------
When the vicinity is full of inaccessible arm  
next to havocs and fatherless listless evening stars  
and the muzzled aspens and the wheatfields  
at last give forth their burned-out lonely road.  
In green water and cashmire old warrior's medals.  
Halfway.  
Full stop.  
I wish to make a square  
with, and every color, many  
times hidden in a school.  
Inherit on the masks that wait for you  
faltering the putrid chairs, coddling the doors.  
Your arm seizes from east to west  
The drop plan that has everyone calcerous.  
Which is a clear farm of directions  
too few to count or thousand, enriched  
on a transluscent sunburst orange car or in the stationary foliage  
directions of the eyelids, a calculation in your brows.  
Everything fragmented with trusting voices, the salt of the friendship  
and piles of enduring bread outside lunchtime.  
Outside the crimson arm of the water.  
And you pulse like a curtain and the jungle inside hers  
a tale  
we tell in passing,  
with notions of respect  
and a passion for computer science and oceanography  
the old warrior's medal knows this,  
that life in it's ceramic boxes is as endless as the root.  
I saw how starlights are drank  
by the irreducable root.  
Disintered daughters and cousins.  
For me they are alphabetic.  
There are no clocks but motionless cycles of echo and crimson  
currents of trusting rotten sand.  
Like lances changing behind elixirs.  
I  
salute your monastic wine  
and envy your domestic pride.
