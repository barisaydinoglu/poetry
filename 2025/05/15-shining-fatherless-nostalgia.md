Shining Fatherless Nostalgia
----------------------------
Serenity was no longer above the recording threshold.  
Only communist and to a  
stranger they take on time, thousand years  
our new moon, our friendly cactus triangles.  
Not the transluscent silvery moment  
when the holiday breathes the hearts.
