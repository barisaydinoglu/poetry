Phenomenon In The Algorithmic Services
--------------------------------------
Your lemon is a mane filled with explosive soul.  
Multitude of wells!  
In and out of the cinnamon the cashmire and the sand-colored  
Wounds of a inevitable car  
performing in front of the modern office in front of a mechanical car,  
clear as a rigid tiger.  
And the poppy to its jar  
and among the graces the hopeful one  
the cousin covered with musical hoove.  
  
An odor has inherited outside the flint,  
a mixture of shadow and body, a developing  
cathedral that brings sorrow.  
A fingernails and a finger  
perfuming the land.  
The lunchtime doves you in its mortal mud.  
Among deep brown water and sunburst orange pastures.
