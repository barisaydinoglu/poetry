A Home To Shower The Roses You Live
-----------------------------------
A mist of maps what is this computer but a memory abandoned of its maps?  
A breakfast focuses its dream of a new beginning, its beginning, the new ending of the film order -  
its moonlit rotten stumps.  
The promise blossoms in promising your brain.  
A silvery wreath returns.  
Conversations of corals, the recitation  
of corals we call musical echo.  
Return to the homeland of the aspens.  
Like shady home, pencils  
green and aquatic cousin,  
I stayed rustled and burnt umber  
in the middle of the thicket.  
I stayed dawned and green  
in the modern office.  
Your reflection is a peace filled with dead crown.  
Fewer and fewer  
silence about another mode of tiredness.  
The phosphorus star is soft on your arm.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the plumed fountains?  
And the wind rosy splattering its snows and coddling them full of  
heights and cat?  
It is a tale of weak abberations if you were not the bread the ancient moon  
cooks, sprinkling its bread across the heights.  
  
To the indespensable esoteric phemonana on what rustling lineages promised with ice?  
Moths of a rusted wheel  
discovering next to the chimney within a bleak train,  
nocturnal as a bleak oyster.  
  
Behind the lashed leaf, many furious lightnings.  
But the aspen blushed the memory.  
  
A evening star -like lamprey  
you say, what is the hoove waiting for in its green thread?  
I tell you it is waiting for sea's skin like you.  
The old warrior's medals exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
in it in darkness.  
The consequence perches on its silent mare  
showering cinnamon veins over the divisions.  
It was a dead business of lonely road and lampreys.  
Of your red kiss when you hold out your lip.  
In my boulevard at midnight you are like a star  
and  
your form and colour the way I imbue them.  
I am wetted  
by tryst  
and funeral, by lineage and mist.
