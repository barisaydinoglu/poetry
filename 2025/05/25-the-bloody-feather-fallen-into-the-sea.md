The Bloody Feather Fallen Into The Sea
--------------------------------------
We get the color  
they must lots to dedicate  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but cummerbunds.  
Perhaps they are not conquered.  
I am smothered by love and salt, by dung and sunshine.  
The conglomerate  
imposes nessecity.  
Which is a homogeneous flower head of directions  
million or twenty-seven, showered  
on a bridge or in the blazing utensil  
directions of the nose, a calculation in your legs.  
A nose and a hips  
carrying the chimney.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the homogeneous droplets?  
And the rain angellic splattering its lights and scratching them full of  
jungle and pheasant?  
  
It was a bitter business of trash barge and martyrs.  
The invasion imposes nessecity.  
My electric nose flies you always.  
Opaque yellow and eager one,  
It is a tale of hated errors crystallizing a droplet  
reconciled in the acerb mist.
