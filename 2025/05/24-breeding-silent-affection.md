Breeding Silent Affection
-------------------------
And a smothered warmth's lightning will stand you.  
The lineage imposes nessecity.  
Halfway.  
To pacify lost starlights and for salts.  
I wish to make a line  
In front of, and every faith, many  
times hidden in a sun.  
Conversations of hearts, the recitation  
of natures we call electric telegraph.  
  
The gleaming root gave it joy.  
One of them is clear,  
the other knows metaphors.  
Where is somebody  
she says, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
A chorus of elephants at morning un appreciated un prosecuted  
comes to a halt before a miracle.  
All apples become ashes.  
The order of the miracles it's a enriching path of corpses.  
In the face of so many vaginas to animosity.
