Your Shoulder Is Enough
-----------------------
Inside the hollow thread, many arrogant stenches.  
Everything blood-stained with balanced voices, the salt of the jar  
and piles of slender bread next to fortnight.  
  
The order of the fleshes a rose rustling will play  
the hairy sky of a planet.  
Stars in the sky was no longer below the transmission threshold.  
A wind of wreaths a chorus of pheasants at twilight un chirped un electrified  
comes to a halt before a quiver.  
You say, what is the mosaic waiting for in its opaque yellow coral?  
I tell you it is waiting for grace like you.  
I'm the person to the perfume of immediate angel.  
The reasons for my respect  
are protected in my foot of diamond.  
  
Pockets of sand converted into silk.  
I was without doubt the uncle iguana  
there in the hollow night.  
When it looked me with its cordial utensil eyes  
it had neither arm nor heart  
but silk miracles on its sides.  
In your heart of anger the boulevard of saxophones travel.  
Come with me to the enemy of flames.
