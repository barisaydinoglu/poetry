How To Abolish Mountaineer Brains
---------------------------------
When you perfume like stone reflected by the heat.  
Reflecting toward the lemon if you were not the bread the velvety moon  
cooks, sprinkling its wine across the jungle.  
It sets like a juice amid the smooth rusted nail.  
For a day, maybe thousand,  
I rested under a palm tree leaf  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the uncle to be with.  
You see eyeballs as incredulous as the thunder.  
Nothing but your unguessed lip.  
  
If you were not the apple the electric moon  
cooks, sprinkling its sugar across the university.  
Conversations of manes, the recitation  
of droplets we call resplendent warmth.  
Not the cinnamon moment  
when the holiday promises the flutes.  
The reflection plan that has everyone violenet.  
A current of ancient miracle  
that  
does not know why it flows and trusts.  
Realized stationary flower head be guided by the fresh alcove's kiss.  
Has the university been travelled with secrets?
