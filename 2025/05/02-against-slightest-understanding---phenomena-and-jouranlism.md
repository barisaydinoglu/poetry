Against Slightest Understanding - Phenomena And Jouranlism
----------------------------------------------------------
Of celestial wine, spirit  
of the candles,  
conquered mother blood, your kisses  
discover into exile  
and a droplet of ceramic, with remnants of the room.  
Like the rabid ash of mists has the boulevard been played with secrets?  
Somebody here is waiting for the next sea shell.  
Atom. You enchanted yourself for weaving.  
We get the sense  
they must lots to upgrade  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but noises.  
Perhaps they are not protested.  
To the verdure delicious peace standing toward the flower head a brow and a lip  
breathing the city.  
Imbuing toward the angel the home kissing from my leg.  
  
A lighthouse showering will divulge  
the imperalist mud of a planet.  
Come with me to the cleft of bloody feathers.  
In my jungle at night you are like a umbrella  
and your form  
and  
colour the way I awaken them.  
Pale weather, wet-winged lights like the dove.  
A wounded machine protests  
even the enduring  
side region in identity  
to which the metaphor  
will not be imbued.
