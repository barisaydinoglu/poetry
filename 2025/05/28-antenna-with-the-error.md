Antenna With The Error
----------------------
In front of the moon of the land where you sleep,  
a dream strikes into phenomena.  
Sometimes a piece of the sky  
trembles like a sweetnes in my shoulder.  
Conversations of telegraphs, the recitation  
of elixirs we call iridescent laminated sign.  
Neither reflection nor grace nor brimstone  
nor blue but yellow.  
A loaf of bread baked with tenacious purity and salt.  
Draw from it the wet-winged  
point of view of its own phenomenon.  
One of them is equinoctial,  
the other knows machines.  
Where is noone  
she cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
They pampered it with putrid wells.  
In your heart of confusion the chimney of bottles carry.  
When the modern office is full of motionless ears  
within salivas and harsh pale times  
and the hushed honeysuckles and the quilts  
at last give forth their burned-out self-production.  
Like granules mutating within tigers.  
Our new serendipity, our full femininity loops.
