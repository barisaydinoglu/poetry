Your Eyeballs Is Enough
-----------------------
The poetic  
dignity of the well!  
Be guided by the electrical pencil's film.  
And you shattered in the panic and awakened a bristling hound.  
Enjoy the many rabid attempts to weave  
the sensible viola.  
There is full fortune in developing it.  
  
Not to develop or even meet  
the flute of one who seizes  
inside me in a moonlight evening or returning to an aunt.  
This worn-out phemonana and relinquishing awe deforms me  
with it's resolute shorelines like shoulder and finger  
and gray awes like finger and atoms.  
Come with me  
to the city of moldy bananas.  
The croak reconciles on its sifted mare  
recovering sepia promises over the sea.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
Nothing but your noble heart.  
In the first reel, the loving pioneer  
is sobbed by a child. In the second  
reel he returns, to connect and to gallop.
