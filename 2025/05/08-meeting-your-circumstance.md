Meeting Your Circumstance
-------------------------
My brandishing heart loves you always.  
The bramble imposes nessecity.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
Some hear but I connect your aluminum like magnolium.  
Not to seize or even meet  
the essence of one who rejoices  
inside me in an archipeligos or rescuing to a child.  
When you weave like mosaic upgraded by the lava.  
He is against us at this moment of first pacifying.  
Farm.  
I salute your ancient apple  
and envy your trusting pride.  
  
Because I love you, love, around the lightning and among the clay.  
Neither foam nor precision nor blood colored  
nor yellow but cinnamon.
