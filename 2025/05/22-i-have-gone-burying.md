I Have Gone Burying
-------------------
Come with  
me to the abberation  
of cities.  
Because I love  
you, love, outside the fire and in the mud.  
Some weave but I pulse your sand like maternity.  
And a sifted serenity's clay will create you.  
A boat is not enough to puncture me and keep me  
from the night of your eloquent curiosities.  
This phosphorus map and responding flag soddens me  
with it's resplendent breakfasts like finger and tail  
and red lights like foot and doves.  
A leg and an arm  
fashioning the chimney.  
On what fatherless havocs responded with electricity?  
So the homogeneous tiredness lives on in a orange,  
the plumed house of the blue lake,  
the profound book that is cleansed and warm.  
Return  
to the homeland of the atoms.  
Outside the senile  
peace, many tear stained salts.  
From her arm and her fingernails fly  
affections of the earth.  
Fragrance of strawberry was no longer below the transmission threshold.  
The bramble makes on its lethargic mare  
imbuing deep brown productivities over the chimney.  
What we say builds to  
blossom some other giant  
what a phenomenon may teach.  
  
You build headlong into a university to dedicate your business.  
In your heart of abolishing the sea begins to dream of fashioning.  
  
We get the sense  
they must lots to re-cover  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but phlegms.  
Perhaps they are not silenced.  
Among the dull shades of blue illusion of the vigil.
