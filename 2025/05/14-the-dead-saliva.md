The Dead Saliva
---------------
If I could protect the throat and the jungle.  
Where horses meet  
aspens meet, in and outside and the sound  
of gates, to reach out and breathe in fear.  
When you rustle transformed like a key.  
Pockets of iron converted into crystal.  
Of a red god that breathes wheatfields.  
When you re-cover played  
like a door.  
Round, bolt of marble sea water!
