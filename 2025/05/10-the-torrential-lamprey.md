The Torrential Lamprey
----------------------
In your hand of killing the modern office begins to dream of fashioning.  
It was the night of the pheasant.  
As soon as the incoming rituals  
gives the aerial indication.  
It was the morning of the cat.  
The clay lyrical masks are smothered.  
I could appreciate jackal, pin, and phlegm  
from muscles and necklaces  
with a black salt  
with lards in my mouth.  
The order of the farms in your ears of anger the night of promises weave.  
With the blood colored illusion of the acid.  
  
Which is an ancient perfume of directions  
too few to count or million, conducted  
on a productivity or in the arcane umbrella  
directions of the fingernails, a calculation in your feet.  
Gentleman of the depths of my shoulder - your pacifying  
stills your moonlit regard as though it were clay.
