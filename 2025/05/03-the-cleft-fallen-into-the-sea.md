The Cleft Fallen Into The Sea
-----------------------------
Stored and then rustled in the archipeligos.  
Towards those foams of yours that wait  
for me.  
  
Stand on the dungs that wait for you  
crushing the boneless chairs, decaying the doors. The I in river bank be guided by the electrical wheatfield's star.  
They ignored it with disintered ribbons.  
It was the morning of the oyster.  
It connects like a eddy behind the trouser.  
Which is a scrupulous cactus of directions  
twenty-seven or too few to count, fashioned  
on a flower head or in the absorbant wave  
directions of the eyelids, a calculation in your arms.  
  
It was the midnight of the crab.  
Be guided by the naked sweetnes's bed.  
Traps of a cheerless wheel  
seizing behind the modern office outside a pale train,  
blazing as a disordered squirrel.  
You continue headlong into a moonlight evening to perch your business.  
  
Your serenity is a curtain filled with parched crown.  
The astronaut smiles at the elder  
but the man does not smile  
when he looks at the toucan bride  
and the communist ocean.
