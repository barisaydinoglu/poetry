Every Giant Is A Sequence
-------------------------
Smooth,  
emerald fellowship!  
The order of the umbrellas where maternities meet  
suns meet, amid and in front of and the sound  
of shortcuts, to reach out and begin in fear.  
Sea's skin was no longer right at the transmission threshold.  
  
And meetings of sifted finger you, who is like a lightning elephant among the weaving of many gentleman.  
The directionless pheasant attracts in the domestic sticks.  
Sorrow and time - kiss of fear.  
The water wide complaints are conquered.  
All ripples become oblivions.  
In the middle of the archipeligos like aluminum.  
When you continue like quiver began by the jungle.
