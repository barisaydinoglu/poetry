The Harsh Pioneer Of The Boulevard
----------------------------------
Inside the cheerless drop, many inevitable consequences.  
I'd do it for the ritual in which you fashion  
for the lakes of cinnamon you've galloped.  
Around the vicinity I like to seize like a demonic mist.  
The sky charitable wombs are protested.  
  
Of a turqoise woman that treads bottles.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
You are the apple of my rusted eye.  
Precision.  
A turqoise and boney tree is conquered in the moonlight evening.  
Drop me and let my substance wet.  
  
When you travel like sea shell mixed by the wind.  
Nothing but your mineral eye.
