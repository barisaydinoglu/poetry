Men Must Always Prove Their Phemonanas
--------------------------------------
Come with me to the lamprey of violas.  
Reflection.  
If you were not the orange the parsimonious moon  
cooks, sprinkling its sugar across the heights.  
Only crooked and to a  
person they take on time, too many to count years  
Clear empire. The line functions to relinquish a environment  
to its system.  
And so that its lonely roads will petrify your arm.  
I'd do it for the autumn in which you crystallize  
for the trousers of green you've gathered.  
The essences exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
in front of it in darkness.  
When you pacify like sea's skin rose by the earth.  
Some gallop but I expand your salt like femininity.
