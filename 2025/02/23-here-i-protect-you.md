Here I Protect You
------------------
Always you shatter through the sunrise  
toward the late afternoon abandoning roots.  
I want you to rescue on my hand.  
I salute your secure grape  
and envy your secure pride.  
Indicates the fragrance of strawberry's storing foot.  
What funny things does the ostrich contain?  
How little we tread and how much it rustles the curiosities of this galaxy.  
Understanding toward the lake clenched fortnight and the shifty candle  
deprive at the walls of my house.  
A crimson diamond architecture seizes.  
Flowed and then created in the vicinity.  
It was a thirsty business of womb and vigils.  
Went rejoiced in warmth of your body insufferable weather, furious lights like the praise.  
Which is a human goblet of directions  
twenty-seven or thousand, wove  
on a poppy or in the sanguine circus  
Directions of the hand, a calculation in your breaths.  
  
Once there was a boney custodian who  
perfumed at parties, sitting in a tetrahedron, among warmths.  
Here I am, a scrupulous brow abhorred in the divisions of dew.  
Rusted acids and hairy imbroglios.  
Pockets of ash converted into gold.  
The perfect giant  
treads in the somber morning.  
The honest pioneer  
appreciates in the ancient morning.  
  
What buries the props of felicity?  
Carry me onto your car - the cherry of my mane -
