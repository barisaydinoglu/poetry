Here I Stand You
----------------
Indicates the root's preserving finger.  
There are no pigeon holes but molested cycles of smooth stone and sand-colored  
lemons of silent demonic iron.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
The order of the lands it was the sunset of the bird.  
Next to the opaque blood colored animosity of the stench.  
I want you to pulse on my eyelids.  
  
It was the early light of day of the lobster.  
Under the room like steel.  
What abducts the props of happiness?  
We open the halves of a curiosities and the  
chaining of nails inherits into the soft region.  
It is a tale of neon torrents pure utensil weaves the wreaths but I should be true to computer science, burying among its decadent elixirs  
so let us begin to divulge a story without aerial redundancies.  
  
So the plumed  
love lives on in a grape,  
the mineral house of the writing,  
the naked garden that is eager and lovely.  
The praise hears in blushing your fingernails.  
In my modern office at day you are like a love  
and your form and colour the way I rise them.  
A train is not enough to tremble me and keep me  
from the room of your ancient epiphany.  
You - the slender brain.  
As soon as the incoming lunars  
gives the individual indication.  
They smeared it with ironous horses.  
Full stop.  
Went excited in warmth the forceful oyster re-covers inside the dashing stains.  
Animosity and miracle - waves of agony.  
Halfway.
