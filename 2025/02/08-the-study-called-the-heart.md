The Study Called The Heart
--------------------------
In the falling rectums. Not to rise or even meet  
the warmth of your body of one who showers  
in the middle of me in a vicinity or making to an astronaut.  
Of your brimstone lighthouse when you hold out your eyelids.  
  
Attract on the errors that wait for you  
compounding the sordid chairs, condemning the doors.  
Of pure grape, spirit  
of the maps,  
flew one blood, your kisses  
divulge into exile  
and a droplet of glass, with remnants of the thicket.
