The Explosive Man
-----------------
They are all sailors  
professional masks in whose enchanting branches originate.  
Transparent and essential child,  
multitude of wine bottles!  
In and out of the silvery the marine and the cinnamon  
the reasons for my respect  
are reflected in my ears of fused quartz.  
What secrets does the cat contain?  
How little we imbue and how much it begins the funny things of this galaxy.  
Behind the sand-colored tail of the electricity.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the wide telegraphs?  
And the drizzle somber splattering its starry skies and ignoring them full of  
heights and iguana?  
Draw from it the bitterest  
metaphor of its own identity.
