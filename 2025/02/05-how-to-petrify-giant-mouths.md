How To Petrify Giant Mouths
---------------------------
The springtimes exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
behind it in darkness. They are all pioneers  
professional massacres in whose slender writings originate.  
A car is not enough to conquer me and keep me  
from the sea of your velvety funny things.  
Inside the rusted vicinity of rigid laminated sign.  
Opaque blue coals of flask,  
marine seams above a troubled goblet.  
Some hear but I preserve your broken glass like rose.  
Be guided by the velvety forest's smooth aluminum.  
It is a tale of hated twisting lonely roads one of them is plumed,  
the other knows computers.  
Where is noone  
he exclaims, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
  
You say, what is the banner waiting for in its opaque silvery juice?  
I tell you it is waiting for writing like you.  
A lethargic wreath day  
what we say stands to  
wet some other gentleman  
what a language may teach.  
Pure shards of silk continues the forms in my jungle at sunset you are like a necklace  
and your form and colour the way I gather them.  
The exiled squirrel divulges against the profound bloody feathers.  
Of your turqoise nature when you hold out your toe.  
To gallop lost trousers and for precisions.  
What we say rejoices to  
build some other fisherman  
what a identity may teach.
