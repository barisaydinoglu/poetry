Setting The Vein In Motion
--------------------------
Here I am, a moonlit foot devoured in the boulevard of phemonana.  
Fear and sea's skin - propellers of animosity.  
Frightened women and giants.  
For me they are neutral.  
The splendor knows this,  
that life in it's silk boxes is as endless as the lunar.  
  
The perfume undulates, the key of solute  
chirps within.  
A raft is not enough to sob me and keep me  
from the modern office of your infinite curiosities.  
You are the putrid one of a ostrich,  
the crooked ness of the old warrior's medal, the power of the lava.  
I took on dry fragrances of strawberry.
