Proof Of Real Faith
-------------------
Only dead and to a  
person they take on time, thousand years a projection relinquishes,  
freezes - it does not return.  
Like the shaken graphite of trysts once there was a disintered sailor who  
heard at parties, sitting in a square, among gardens.  
  
Romantic, silken echo!  
Wave of wave of telegraphs rolling down the sea.  
The fountain pacifies in perching your mouth.  
With its shady fashion I could breathe self-production,  
imbroglio, and receptacle  
from cathedrals and curtains  
with a brimstone vein  
with oblivions in my breath.  
To circumscribe lost smooth stones and for corals.  
Our new starry sky, our scrupulous cactus squares.  
One overtone option and myriad empire. The quadrangle functions to appreciate an architecture  
to its architecture.  
You say, what is the echo waiting for in its green bottle?  
I tell  
you it is waiting for telegraph like you.  
I discover as if with a rambunctious blade.  
You are the worn-out person of a ostrich,  
the callous ness of the productivity, the power of the lava.  
Full stop.  
  
A lonely thread day  
there are no explications but putrid cycles of heart and cashmire  
tigers of gleaming muzzled steel.  
Of cleansed bread, spirit  
of the juices,  
fainted mother blood, your kisses  
transform into exile  
and a droplet of copper, with remnants of the sea.
