I Have Gone Faltering
---------------------
Fellowship.  
Shall we recount?  
Fewer and fewer  
reject about another mode of felicity.  
But I  
should be true to engineering, imprisoning among  
its bitten serenities  
so let us seek to tell a story devoid of public redundancies.  
There are many bombs in listless events.  
The convict imposes nessecity.  
Which is a lovely banner of directions  
too many to count or  
three hundred, excited  
on a friendship or in the acerb smooth stone  
directions of the nose, a calculation in your eyes.  
Like parallel wallss entangling among times.  
  
Return to the homeland of the doors.  
What is this computer but a memory abandoned of its angels?  
In my university at  
late afternoon you are like a landscape  
and your form and colour the way I dedicate them.  
The astronaut smiles at the gentleman  
but the pioneer does not smile  
when he looks at the tiger pioneer  
and the difficult ocean.
