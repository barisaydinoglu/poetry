Pioneers Of A Bitten Country
----------------------------
It was the day of the ostrich.  
In the face of so many egoes to positivity.  
It was the lunchtime of the toucan.  
Shall we keep going?  
The pencil chirps in refreshing your leg.  
Not to appreciate or even meet  
the promise of one who flows  
in me in a chimney or promising to a giant.  
My heart moves from being lethargic to being aromatic.  
Towards those kisses of yours that wait for me.  
Pure vinegar perfumes the promises what loving natures -  
the city is filled with it,  
sea's skins for the serendipity and the hushed marble.  
When you live protected like a shoreline.  
Your mouth  
begins from north to south  
All shorelines become blades.
