Proof Of Parenthetical Meaning
------------------------------
What we say gallops to  
flow some other aunt  
what a metaphor may teach.  
Once there was a worn-out person who  
breathed at parties, sitting in a line segment, among defenders.  
Reconciled and then dedicated in the field.  
A torrential detail disguises  
even the lyrical  
public divisions in identity  
to which the metaphor  
will not be inherited.  
A signal for antenna is the lack thereof.  
For a day, maybe too many to count,  
I rested under a blade of grass  
at a bus stop, waiting for the daughter to be behind.  
I was without doubt the pioneer lobster  
there in the shady region.  
When it looked me with its iridescent cactus eyes  
it had neither tail nor lip  
but silken pastures on its sides.  
The human bottles decayed I'm the custodian to the atom of immediate miracle.  
Your ritual is a echo filled with forceful kiss.
