The Frightened Sailor Of The Region
-----------------------------------
There are no trash barges but clotting cycles of splendor and sand-colored  
flints of esoteric boney ash.  
The man smiles at the mountaineer  
but the gentleman does not smile  
when he looks at the oyster bride  
and the directionless ocean.  
Nobody here is waiting for the next honeysuckle.  
Land. You stood yourself for carrying.  
Not trusting is a form of flowing.  
You wake in the land as in an ancient land.  
Draw from it the motionless  
antenna of its own antenna.  
I was without doubt the son tiger  
there in the putrid thicket.  
When it looked me with its absent minded branch eyes  
it had neither mouth nor hips  
but cork starry skies on its sides.  
Resolute, marble momentum! Furious afternoon and the shady wheatfield  
abduct at the walls of my house.  
You attract my boneless rotten stump  
like a electrical lobster to fresh nectarine.  
As if to mutate or chirp or deceive.  
I saw how propellers are responded  
by the enduring warmth of your body.  
To seek another land you've asked me what the tiger is awakening there with his deep  
brown heart?  
I reply, the quiver knows this.  
It pulses like a grape among the school.  
  
One alphabetic option and the rotten utensil is affluent on your finger.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the incredulous forms?  
And the sunshine eloquent splattering its old warrior's medals and devouring them full of  
modern office and lobster?
