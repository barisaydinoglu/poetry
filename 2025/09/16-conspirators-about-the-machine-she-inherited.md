Conspirators About The Machine She Inherited
--------------------------------------------
A sepia sea shell makes.  
I took on worn-out lemons.  
And so that its bombs will scratch your fingernails.  
Sterile holiday and the wounded echo  
delude at the walls of my house.  
Consequences of a smothered vessel  
appreciating next to the city in front of a harsh ship,  
angellic as a phosphorus iguana.  
So the nocturnal happiness lives on in a orange,  
the round house of the mane,  
the stationary heart that is delicate and human.  
A synonym responds,  
loiters - it does not return.  
Has the vicinity been recovered with epiphany?  
Opaque crimson ice to my rabid candle!  
You are the kiwi of my fuming shoulder.  
The dove expands in blossoming your fingernails.
