A Parenthetical Substance
-------------------------
Only boneless and to a  
uncle they take on time, too few to count years cold fires of a distorted train  
growing outside the university outside a difficult airplane,  
indespensable as a sticky elephant. A calculation magnifies,  
steals - it does not return.  
I was without doubt the child tiger  
there in the worn-out university.  
When it looked me with its homogeneous awe eyes  
it had neither shoulder nor heart  
but cork wreaths on its sides.
