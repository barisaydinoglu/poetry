Uncles Must Always Prove Their Trysts
-------------------------------------
It reconciles like a bottle within the candle.  
Drinking from crooked copper.  
You play slowly into a night to reconcile your business.  
Halfway.  
  
Only lake, just the  
angel, nothing but  
it. Pasture.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the pure  
cinnamon lakes?  
And the sun natural splattering its horses and bristling them full of  
sea and iguana?  
Someone here is waiting for the next stars in the sky.  
Snow. You returned yourself for enriching.  
You promise my careless conglomerate  
like a rosy toucan to fresh plum.  
Nothing but your affluent fingernails.
