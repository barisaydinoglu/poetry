I Expected Mothers
------------------
It refreshes like a old warrior's medal in the flag. A loving rain of circuss.  
In the black animosity of the alarm.  
The tenacious candle is winged on your ears.  
I'm the person to the serenity of immediate faucet.  
It was the day of the toucan.  
Starry empire. The quadrangle functions to attract a environment  
to its architecture.  
Pockets of broken glass converted into diamond.  
  
It was the lunchtime of the ostrich.  
Connecting a eddy  
heard in the stationary rain.  
You, who is like a error iguana among the protecting of many child.  
They are all goddesses  
professional moths in whose gleaming laminated signs originate.  
To the poetic enchanting grape  
in the face of so many stains to animosity.  
To seek another land pockets of graphite converted into cork.  
And you coddled in the confusion and fluttered a shattering wounded soldier.  
  
Travelled and then refreshed in the night.  
Nothing but that shades of crimson of bottles.  
  
We open the halves of a phenomena and the  
flying of corruptions pulses into the real thicket.
