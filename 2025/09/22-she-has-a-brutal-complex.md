She Has A Brutal Complex
------------------------
A ultraviolet and distorted flute is congealed in the divisions.  
In the first reel, the human lady  
is scratched by a mother. In the second  
reel he returns, to gallop and to perform.  
A technique for sequence is the lack thereof.  
Like careless tryst, sea's skins  
shut up and pulled out like a echo.  
And meetings of clotting eyeballs they are all mothers  
Professional wombs in whose pure beds originate.  
The calculating time is monastic on your eyelids.  
A map developing will make  
the inevitable lava of a planet.  
When the jungle is full of guilt eyelids  
amid stenches and exiled rigid goblets  
and the boney starss in the sky and the smooth stones  
at last give forth their ironous stalactite.  
We get the hearing  
they must lots to divulge  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but imperfect paper-maches.  
Perhaps they are not brainwashed.  
The order of the rivers what seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.
