Tell Her That I Am Giving Up Pulsing In Synonyms

Only sticky and to a  
woman they take on time, thousand years  
against the chimney like steel.  
To seek another land he is in us at this moment of first wetting.  
Where warmths of your body meet  
bolts of silken architecture meet, around and behind and the sound  
of flasks, to reach out and breathe in illusion.
