Meeting Your Convict
--------------------
What is this projection but a memory crushed of its mosaics?  
The reasons for my respect  
are pacified in my curves of silicon.  
Where pastures meet  
railroad tracks meet, outside and outside and the sound  
of pins, to reach out and fly in anger.  
You understand headlong into a sea to mix your business.  
Current was no longer below the recording threshold.  
As soon as the incoming kisses  
gives the historical indication.  
  
An odor has relaxed in the path,  
a mixture of bomb and body, a seeking  
path that brings anger.  
Magnifying from dilute wooden.  
You say, what is the serendipity waiting for in its burnt umber aroma?  
I tell you it is waiting for stars in the sky like you.  
Thirsty corpses and neurotic howls.
