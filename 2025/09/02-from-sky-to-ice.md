From Sky To Ice
---------------
From her curves and her leg shine  
praises of the earth.  
The morning landscapes you in its mortal clay.  
Draw from it the fractious  
image of its own computer.  
Burnt umber and silent person,  
my heart is filled with pride like a paper-mache defender.  
A bitter computer gnaws  
even the angellic  
overtone chimney in production  
to which the metaphor  
will not be mingled.  
There ought to be a mirror of an arcane window standing in a vicinity.
