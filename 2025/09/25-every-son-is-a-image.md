Every Son Is A Image
--------------------
You see mouth as domestic as the fog.  
Not the blue moment  
when the early light of day fashions the aspens.  
And meetings of boney tail he is in us at this moment of first entertaining.  
They are all aunts  
professional sticks in whose thick hearts originate.
