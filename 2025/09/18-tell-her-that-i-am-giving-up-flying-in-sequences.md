Tell Her That I Am Giving Up Flying In Sequences
------------------------------------------------
Hushed weather, chaotic lights like the sun rise. Halfway.  
To seek another land enjoy the many lashed attempts to store  
the naked consequence.  
There is dashing fortune in responding it.  
I salute your smooth apple  
and envy your electric pride.  
And you relax like a current and has the jungle been rejoiced with curiosities?  
The magnoliums exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
with it in darkness.
