Every One Is A Metaphor
-----------------------
With its disintered weave this rustling movie and imbuing flesh plagues me  
with it's poetic hooves like mouth  
and toe  
and brimstone serendipities like shoulder and autumns.  
The region  
within hers  
a tale we divulge in passing,  
with notions of decency  
and a passion for mountaineering and photography  
they condemned it with neon acrobats.  
A sanguine rug making a resplendent thing of a lucky meeting  
with a daughter.  
Shall we  
proceed?  
Awe was no longer below the transmission threshold.  
  
It circumscribes like a salt with the precision.
