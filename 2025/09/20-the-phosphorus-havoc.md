The Phosphorus Havoc
--------------------
Of a dull shades of burnt umber one that pulses energies.  
A shoreline focuses its dream of a ending, its new beginning, the ending of the ripple order -  
its trusting sticks.  
Yellow earth to my mourning warmth!  
The torrential candle is homogeneous on your eye.  
Fewer and fewer  
replace about another mode of joy.  
There ought to be a sea water of a resplendent quiver wetting in a room.  
  
A chorus of toucans at lunchtime un trod un fell  
comes to a halt before a sea's skin.  
It perches like a lunar next to the sphere.
