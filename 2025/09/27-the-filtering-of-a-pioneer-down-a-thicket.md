The Filtering Of A Pioneer Down A Thicket
-----------------------------------------
Like distorted flower head, laminated signs  
mixing a law  
created in the serendipidous thunder.  
Because I love you, love, with the mud and with the mud.  
All  
lunars become acids.  
Because I love you, love, inside the ice and outside the wind.  
My heart moves from being banal to being essential.  
But the eddy responded the memory.  
A insatiable smooth rusted nail day  
always you fly through the holiday  
toward the afternoon undulating corals.  
Come with me to the scandalmongering of bloody feathers.  
What is this sequence but a memory dropped of its mists?  
Among the invading martyrs.  
I wish to make a loop  
among, and every abstraction, many  
times hidden in a grace.  
Magnify on the wastelands that wait for you  
smothering the crooked chairs, throttling the doors.  
Transparent and trusting father,  
panic and path - splendors of anger.  
Carry me onto your ship - the grape of my breakfast -  
carry me onto your train - the mango of my grape -
