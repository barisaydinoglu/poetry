A Sensual Substance
-------------------
The smooth stone expands in treading your curves.  
A burnt umber saxophone  
crystallizes.  
Outside opaque burnt umber water and blue mosaics.  
Enchanting empire. The square functions to perch a environment  
to its system.  
A chorus of ostriches at fortnight un preserved un died  
comes to a halt before a banner.  
I perfume as if inside a senile shrapnel.  
For a day, maybe twenty-seven,  
I rested under a unrelenting rain  
at a bus stop, waiting for the sailor to be within.
