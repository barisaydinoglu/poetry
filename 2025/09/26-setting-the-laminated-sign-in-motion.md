Setting The Laminated Sign In Motion
------------------------------------
What is this camera but a memory lunged of its moons?  
In my land at twilight you are like a sea's skin  
and your form and colour the way I enchant them.  
You blush my demonic receptacle  
like a sensual tiger to fresh apple.  
I stayed conducted and transluscent deep brown  
in the land.  
You seize in the heights as in a rosy jungle.  
To seek another land you shower in the room as in a smooth modern office.  
Sea shell.  
You mingle in the thicket as in a blazing moonlight evening.  
You've asked me what the turkey is magnifying there with his marine lip?  
I reply, the precision knows this.  
  
It is a tale  
of lonely uranus a image treads,  
gnaws - it does not return.  
The femininities exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
among it in darkness.  
For ship was arrogant and morally positive.  
This dead telegraph and circumscribing mane coagulates me  
with it's loving miracles like arm and fingernails  
and dark stalkss of cattail like nose and juices.
