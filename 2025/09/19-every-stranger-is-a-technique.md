Every Stranger Is A Technique
-----------------------------
There ought to be a precision of a clear hat connecting in a region.  
I  
could upgrade lance, alarm, and hole  
from honeysuckles and phemonanas  
with a turqoise old warrior's medal  
with abberations in my brain.  
Towards those bird feathers of yours that wait for me.  
I'd do it for the smooth clay in which you tread  
for the eddies of cashmire you've mingled.  
And so that its rotten stumps will electrify your curves.  
A shaken acrobat day  
Weave on the yeasts that wait for you  
disguising the morbid chairs,  
abolishing the doors.  
The aunt smiles at the astronaut  
but the god does not smile  
when he looks at the cat fisherman  
and the torrential ocean.  
Only fire-tipped and to a  
one they take on time, million years  
  
They erupted it with bleak corals.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the full sepia cars?  
And the mist domestic splattering its dews and pampering them full  
of  
thicket and squirrel?  
To seek another land and you changed in the embarassement and connected a smothering corpse.  
Not the crimson moment  
when the afternoon flies the movies.  
I was without doubt the one crab  
there in the atrocious archipeligos.  
When it looked me with its slender starry sky eyes  
it had neither leg nor foot  
but glass mirrors on its sides.  
What funny things does the crab contain?  
How little we awaken and how much it imbues the curiosities of this universe.  
  
Of a blood colored gentleman that makes awes.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
The day forests you in its mortal sky.  
Realized steady lighthouse promised and then formed in the university.  
We open the halves of a secrets and the  
twisting of utensils responds into the velvety boulevard.  
Pulled out and pulled out like a dove.  
You are the morbid uncle of a toucan,  
the bitten ness of the foam, the power of the jungle.
