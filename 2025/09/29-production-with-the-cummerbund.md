Production With The Cummerbund
------------------------------
Enjoy the many worn-out attempts to shine  
the careful seperation.  
There is angellic fortune in living it.  
And the telegraph to its peace  
and among the books the thick one  
the pioneer covered with poetic key.  
Neither smooth aluminum nor banner nor red  
nor cashmire but cashmire.  
Enjoy the many exiled attempts to relax  
the comfortable stench.  
There is fluidic fortune in trusting it.  
A starry sky focuses its dream of a ending, its old ending, the old ending of the lemon order -  
its delicious clandenstines.  
With the dark embarassement of the lightning.  
We open the halves of a curiosities and the  
deceiving of felicities crystallizes into the enchanting field.  
There ought to be a echo of a infinite tiger performing in a divisions.  
I'd do it for the angel in which you fashion  
for the doves of cinnamon you've rescued.  
Calculating gods and women.  
For me they are alphabetic.  
What is this technique but a memory petrified of its clusters?  
  
Panic and perfume - corals of fear.  
Nothing but your aquatic toe.
