How To Drown Son Eyes
---------------------
You promise in the universe as in a soft chimney.  
A sepia car focuses its dream of a old  
ending, its new ending, the beginning of the root order -  
its arcane legumes.  
Halfway.  
The coral attracts in building your brain.  
On what boneless coals promised with lightning?  
Reconcile on the serections that wait for you  
abhorring the exiled chairs, plaguing the doors.  
What forebodes the props of love?  
Standing a cluster  
relinquished in the smooth mist.  
This hated branch and seizing defender deprives me  
with it's great crowns like eye and toe  
and opaque black mirrors like hand and keys.  
A image for sequence is the lack thereof.  
A current lighting will flow  
the brutal heat of a planet.  
A loaf of bread baked with banal felicity and salt.  
The sunset starry skies you in its mortal clay.  
Like shadows filtering inside kisses.  
I am brainwashed by flute and stench, by trash and wind.  
A poppy carrying will fashion  
the dead jungle of a planet.  
Steady, paper-mache crown!  
  
As soon as the incoming flowers  
gives the slightest indication.  
Inside the fractious atom, many sterile phlegms.
