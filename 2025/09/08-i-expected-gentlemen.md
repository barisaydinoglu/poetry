I Expected Gentlemen
--------------------
Which is a resolute angel of directions  
too many to count or three hundred, reflected  
on a muscle or in the fleeting drop  
directions of the eye, a calculation in your hipss. Like complaints disguising among cinnamon cars.  
Your aspen is a fellowship filled with tear stained stalks of cattail.  
I gather as if in front of a violenet convict.  
Nothing but that droplet of keys.  
  
Where clusters meet  
mosaics meet, outside and inside and the sound  
of bloods, to reach out and relax in animosity.  
Wipe me and let my substance set.  
From her eyelids and her shoulder rescue  
clusters of the earth.  
Our new starlight, our aquatic smooth brick quadrangles.
