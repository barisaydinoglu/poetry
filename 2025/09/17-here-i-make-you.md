Here I Make You
---------------
The wind deedy daggers are ignored.  
A current of handsome dew  
that does not know why it flows and drinks.  
The senile star is hopeful on your eye.  
It sets like a flint next to the umbrella.  
What funny things does the crab contain?  
How little we carry and how much it attracts the funny things of this computer simulation.  
You've asked me what the tiger is wetting there with his transparent arm?  
I reply, the fellowship knows this.  
To rescue  
lost fellowships and for productivities.  
Rigid gates and banal clocks.
