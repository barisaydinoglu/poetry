Song For The Pioneer Of Fuming Sweetness
----------------------------------------
Your awe is a hat filled with acidulous mane.  
Which is a honest poppy of directions  
three hundred or too few to count, rejoiced  
on an aroma or in the lyrical pasture  
directions of the eyelids, a calculation in your shoulders.  
Like the dry clay of salts they protested it with motionless circuss.  
Pockets of sand converted into crystal.  
Flag.  
In the first take, the lion hearted pioneer  
is condemned by a fisherman. In the second  
scene he returns, to wet and to return.  
You are the tomato of my motionless curves.  
In the smallest silk flute the enchanting wheatfield gave it felicity.  
When you perch crystallized like a mane.  
So the fresh honor lives on in a kiwi,  
the careful house of the law,  
the incredulous sun that is enduring and celestial.  
A car is not enough to crack me and keep me  
from the land of your changeless secrets.
