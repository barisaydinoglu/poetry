Here I Re-cover You
-------------------
A stationary fog of candles.  
Inside the fire-tipped divisions of lashed fellowship.  
The ghostly school that kisses in your flower head.  
And meetings of imperalist nose for a day, maybe too few to count,  
I rested under a harrowing wind  
at a bus stop, waiting for the pioneer to be with.  
So the vertical happiness lives on in a grape,  
the mineral house of the necklace,  
the iridescent mane that is vertical and hopeful.  
Blue corruptions of corruption,  
marine seams above a distorted ribbon.  
A cashmire smooth salt chirps.  
The manly rituals smothered I salute your serendipidous nectarine  
and envy your careful pride.  
I saw how apples are blossomed  
by the steady horse.  
This blood-stained alcove and seeking faucet invades me  
with it's irreducable prizes like brow and curves  
and opaque blood colored paths like ears and springtimes.  
Towards those forests of yours that wait for me.  
A language for inscription  
is the lack thereof.  
Some recover but I preserve your aluminum like pullulation.  
We get the feeling  
they must lots to pacify  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but oxides.  
Perhaps they are not erupted.  
He is under us at this moment of first travelling.  
Under the land like graphite.
