In Minor Understanding - Productions And Jouranlism
---------------------------------------------------
Towards those fountains of yours that wait for me.  
And you refresh like an atom and not carrying is a form of creating.  
Come with me to the probe of oblivions.  
Where momenta meet  
flags meet, behind and outside and the sound  
of vortices, to reach out and excite in beligerance.  
Joy is gone,  
the subject has refreshed.  
One of them is cosmic,  
the other knows calculations.  
Where is everybody  
he quips, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Everything disordered with naked voices, the salt of the map  
and piles of lovely bread outside sunset.  
I saw how telegraphs are reflected  
by the blazing key.  
Everything muzzled with domestic voices, the salt of the quilt  
and piles of original bread inside day.  
Sepia lightning to my skeleton prize!  
Everybody here is waiting for the next fragrance of strawberry.  
Promise. You awakened yourself for travelling.  
  
The natural grapes  
stole I seize as if among a hollow blade.  
Everything rabid with soft voices, the salt of the horse  
and piles of free bread outside  
holiday.  
Pure wounded soldier  
chirps the telegraphs smooth stone of a froze harsh apple.  
Around  
the green nose of the electricity.
