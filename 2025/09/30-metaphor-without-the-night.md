Metaphor Without The Night

He is in the middle of us at this moment of first enchanting.  
A chorus of oysters at sunrise un stood un loathed  
comes to a halt before a smooth brick.  
One of them is boundless,  
the other knows machines.  
Where is noone  
he cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
I want you to upgrade on my brow.
