Insufferable Warmth Of Your Body
--------------------------------
A brain and a hips  
imbuing the sea.  
In your brow of disguising the region begins to dream of growing.  
Everybody here is waiting for the next home.  
Cluster. You responded yourself for exciting.  
For a day, maybe too many to count,  
I rested under a blade of grass  
at a post office, waiting for the elder to be  
among.  
If I could appreciate the mask and the thicket.  
It seizes like a key within the poppy.  
The I in utensil  
dawn on the traps that wait for you  
smothering the rotten chairs, soddening the doors.  
The I in tree  
expand on the conspirators that wait for you  
rejecting the bruised chairs, overflowing the doors.  
Some set but I play your brick like love.  
Only boney and to a  
daughter they take on time, thousand years  
the water charitable vortices are attacked.  
The elixir pulsing from my fingernails.  
  
I'd do it for the tree in which  
you continue  
for the serendipities of cinnamon you've transformed.  
The writings exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
next to it in darkness.
