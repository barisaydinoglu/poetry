Proof Of Clear Hearing
----------------------
A chorus of toucans at holiday un transformed un fell  
comes to a halt before a curtain.  
And the flower to its shades of marine  
and among the autumns the vertical one  
the gentleman covered with naked grape.  
You - the velvety curves.  
My heart is filled with love like a paper-mache window.  
How flowing is the lovely moldy banana and it's fluidic circumstances?  
The resplendent astronaut  
responds  
in the poetic morning.  
  
In my moonlight evening at morning you are like a fragrance of strawberry  
and your form  
and colour the way I love them.  
Travelling the cluster of her soul full of respect.
