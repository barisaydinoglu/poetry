From What Are Roots Rejoiced
----------------------------
We get the color  
they must lots to continue  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but oblivions.  
Perhaps they are not condemned.  
You set my bleak legless horse  
like a celestial ostrich to fresh orange.  
So the equinoctial love lives on in a banana,  
the loving house of the poppy,  
The great awe that is gleaming and soft.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the lion hearted apples?  
And the thunder hopeful splattering its friendships and overflowing them full of  
vicinity and toucan?
