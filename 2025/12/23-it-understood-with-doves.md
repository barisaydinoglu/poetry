It Understood With Doves
------------------------
In the face of so many sticks to functionality.  
The mosaic knows this,  
that life in it's wooden boxes is as endless as the reflection.  
In the red embarassement of the beast.  
The mosaic discovers in reconciling your hand.  
You've asked me what the turkey is perfuming there with his transparent eyelids?  
I reply, the current knows this.  
And you perform like a light and bridge was no longer below the recording threshold.  
  
In the smallest gem candle I do not drown in the field of fatherless bone.  
Against the arrogant promise, many boneless lineages.  
Mourning shardss of gem and lethargic scandalmongerings.  
But the planetarium excited the memory.  
What velvety poppies -  
the divisions is filled with it,  
juices for the fountain and the rambunctious ivory.  
Of your gray momentum when you hold out your tail.  
I saw how utensils are stood  
by the sweet-smelling necklace.  
What freezes the props of felicity?  
  
I want you to chirp on my finger.  
The acidulous aspen that reconciles in your starlight.  
  
Cashmire and mineral one,  
and a torrential praise's lava will weave you.  
I want you to imbue on my heart.  
A loaf of bread baked with motionless honor and salt.
