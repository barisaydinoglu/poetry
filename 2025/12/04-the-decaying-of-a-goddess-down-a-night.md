The Decaying Of A Goddess Down A Night
--------------------------------------
Blossoming the lunar of her maternity full of happiness.  
But I should be untrue to computer science, abhorring among its ghostly angels  
so let us seek to speak a story devoid of slightest redundancies.  
Wave of wave of sea water rolling down the sea. If you were not the peach the manly moon  
cooks, sprinkling its orange across the moonlight evening.  
A irreducable snow of hearts.
