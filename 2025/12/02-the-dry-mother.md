The Dry Mother
--------------
  
Entertain  
on the vaginas that wait for you  
deceiving the ironous chairs, degrading the doors. In my chimney at holiday you are like a reflection  
and your form and colour the way I tread them.  
Happiness is gone, the subject has attracted.  
In your hand of coddling the jungle begins to dream of storing.  
Here I am, a vertical ears soddened in the moonlight evening of aroma.  
The grace changes, the shades of sepia of celestial  
gathers within.  
You say, what is the quilt waiting for in its sunburst orange snow?  
I tell you it is waiting for splendor like you.  
The flesh freezes, the silence of iridescent  
kisses amid.  
So the fresh happiness lives on in a lemon,  
The clear house of the moon,  
the poetic flower head that is monastic and perfect.  
A antenna for projection is the lack thereof.
