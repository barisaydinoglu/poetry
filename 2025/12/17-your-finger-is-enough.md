Your Finger Is Enough
---------------------
The reasons for my respect  
are formed in my ears of ivory. Wave of wave of dews rolling down the sea.  
Your ears makes  
from north to east  
understood and then built in the boulevard.  
A banner focuses its dream of a old ending, its new beginning, the new beginning of the evening star order -  
its  
cosmic serections.  
You are the orange of my ghostly hand.  
If you were not the cheesecake the great moon  
cooks, sprinkling its bread across the jungle.  
I want you to stand on my fingernails.  
  
All maps become corruptions.  
How lighting is the resolute explication and it's unguessed lightnings?  
Behind the morbid city of communist bottle.  
In the arrogant moonlight evening of furious planetarium.  
Not travelling is a form of enchanting.  
Pockets of steel converted into marble.  
Not the transluscent cashmire moment  
when the sunset conducts the friendships.
