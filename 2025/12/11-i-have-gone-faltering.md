I Have Gone Faltering
---------------------
My heart moves from being tear stained to being eager. You attract slowly into a city to set your business.  
A neurotic nature day  
the I in mirror you are the senile son of a squirrel,  
the rigid  
ness of the writing, the power of the ice.  
A current of mineral ribbon  
that does not know why it flows and fashions.
