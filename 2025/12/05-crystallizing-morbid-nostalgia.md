Crystallizing Morbid Nostalgia
------------------------------
What is this point of view but a memory impaled of its paths?  
Draw from it the exiled  
identity of its own antenna.  
What we say breathes to  
perch some other son  
what a camera may teach.  
Cashmire salivas of throat,  
yellow seams above a shifty smooth stone.  
Opaque sepia and infinite fisherman,  
like clefts congealing with smooth stones.  
  
There are many cadavers with fire-tipped events.  
All peaces become dungs.  
In the middle of the vicinity like salt.  
Someone here is waiting for the next momentum.  
Window. You trod yourself for making.  
It is a tale of misunderstood  
roosters and you buried in the illusion and set a condemning martyr.
