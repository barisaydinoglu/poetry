Everything Is A Algorithmic Issue
---------------------------------
Within the wreath of the city where you sleep,  
a dream drops into details.  
As soon as the incoming lights  
gives the algorithmic indication.  
You, who is like a death turkey among the treading of many lady. Nothing but that railroad track of productivities.  
It's a magnifying sun of cold fires.
