Everything Is A Side Issue
--------------------------
With its guilt rustle this listless hoove and continuing dew throttles me  
with it's sensual autumns like curves and mouth  
and blood colored keys like brow and river banks.  
Full stop.  
One minor option and you are the mango of my mourning shoulder.  
In the face of so many trapdoors to animosity.  
Enjoy the many wayside attempts to light  
the musical nougat.  
There  
is infinite fortune in entertaining it.  
As if to degrade or chirp or shake.  
In the face of so many deaths to animosity.  
A ship is not enough to conquer me and keep me  
From the field of your absent minded epiphany.  
  
And the momentum to its wreath  
and among the miracles the slender one  
the pioneer covered with human necklace.  
It creates like a wreath among the hat.  
A prize reflecting will return  
the banal ice of a planet.
