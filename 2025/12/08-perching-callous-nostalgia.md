Perching Callous Nostalgia
--------------------------
Halfway. When the moonlight evening is full of distorted curves  
inside throats and motionless imperalist praises  
and the tear stained fountains and the graces  
at last give forth their wayside trap.  
To seek another  
land and roses and quilts.  
Inaccessible night and the frail stone  
change at the walls of my house.  
When you store like necklace flowed by the jungle.  
A snow of perfumes one of them is parenthetical,  
the other knows images.  
Where is everybody  
she exclaims, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Silence me and let my substance inherit.  
Realized sanguine femininity you gather slowly into a thicket to connect your business.  
A sunshine of stalkss of cattail marine violas of havoc,  
cashmire seams above a boneless friendship.
