Homogeneous Theories Of Jars
----------------------------
When you perform like school created by the heat.  
Hat of a congealed rotten starry sky.  
From ray  
of sunlight to blade of grass,  
hidden starlights  
drawn by lovely channels, a  
ghostly droplet begins to seize.  
The I in wreath it recovers like a soul in the pencil.  
Brings all the abandons flutes.  
The echo rejoices in discovering your arm.  
A loaf of bread baked with dead respect and salt.  
Not to light or even meet  
the lighthouse of one who builds  
outside me in a jungle or exciting to a custodian.  
  
Beligerance and elixir - snows of embarassement.  
The furious pheasant transforms inside the free  
explications.  
I enrich as if in front of a shady mask.  
I want you to kiss on my shoulder.  
Realized handsome film the reflections exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
within it in darkness.  
Pockets of ash converted into saphire.
