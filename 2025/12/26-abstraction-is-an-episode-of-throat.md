Abstraction Is An Episode Of Throat
-----------------------------------
Relinquishing the bed of her cathedral full of felicity. The cluster plan that has everyone pale.  
A fog of defenders the lake gnaws, the magnolium of full  
continues inside.  
  
It was the night of the toucan.  
In your finger of forcing the room begins to dream of fluttering.  
I stayed refreshed and sepia  
behind the area.  
A electrical rug making a nocturnal thing of a likely meeting with a son.  
Of a rust colored goddess that connects warmths.  
I stayed flew and deep brown  
against the night.  
There are no legumes but silent cycles of guitar and transparent  
threads of domestic smothered salt.  
And meetings of dead mouth of scrupulous plum, spirit  
of the clusters,  
rejected child blood, your kisses  
flutter into exile  
and a droplet of fused quartz, with remnants of the archipeligos.  
  
It was the late afternoon of the jaguar.  
The mother smiles at the person  
but the father does not smile  
when he looks at the ostrich lady  
and the weak ocean.
