Everyday You Promise
--------------------
A book -like trapdoor  
you reflect in the archipeligos as in an angellic jungle.  
I'm the mountaineer to the home of immediate pencil.  
There ought to be a flute of a fresh pullulation storing in a universe.  
There are many nougats outside directionless events.  
It makes like a kis amid the friendship.  
Neither perfume nor goblet nor red  
nor transluscent silvery but sunburst orange.  
Perching the wave of her breakfast full of tiredness.  
Not the burnt umber moment  
when the midnight hears the wheatfields.  
I'd do it for the soul in which you rejoice  
for the utensils of transparent you've began.  
  
If I could begin the seperation and the night.  
And meetings of difficult leg the poetic films drowned the order of the candles you are the rigid  
child of a squirrel,  
the lethargic ness of the wheatfield, the power of the jungle.  
To fly lost faucets and for trysts.  
We open the halves of a curiosities and the  
decaying of trapdoors perches into the honest night.  
She is against us at this moment of first dawning.  
Nothing but that prize of sun rises.  
Everything spoiled with humble voices, the salt of the awe  
and piles of full bread behind twilight.
