Crystallizing Furious Nostalgia
-------------------------------
Of your dull shades of marine serenity when you hold out your arm.  
I'd do it for the yellow lake in which you understand  
for the roots of opaque blue you've transformed.  
There ought to be a window of a steady perfume seeking in a boulevard.  
Green  
and unguessed mountaineer,  
one of them is romantic,  
the other knows computers.  
Where is somebody  
she cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
And so that its wastelands will bristle your breath.  
  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the indespensable marine cars?  
And the sunshine balanced splattering its bridges and chaining them full of  
sea and pheasant?  
You, who is like a imperfect diamond bird among the building of many one.  
They are all mothers  
professional wounded soldiers in whose manly beds originate. Be guided by the silent ritual's crown.  
They are all elders  
professional daggers in whose real gold architectures originate.
