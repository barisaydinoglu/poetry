A Fused Quartz Within Silk
--------------------------
Neither rose nor fellowship nor red  
nor marine but sepia.  
Like uranus wiping behind bottles.  
Around the city I like to reconcile like a boneless serenity.  
The wounded soldier reconciles on its muzzled mare  
enriching cinnamon wine bottles over the sea.  
To the cordial brandishing lemon what seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
In front of sunburst orange water  
and cashmire movies.  
And a banal maternity's jungle will rise you.
