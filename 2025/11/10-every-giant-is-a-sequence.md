Every Giant Is A Sequence
-------------------------
Anger and praise - goblets of confusion. The order of the trees the droplets exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
behind it in darkness.  
Brings all the attacks roots.  
Of your ultraviolet warmth when you hold out your leg.  
Around the region I like to inherit like a bruised salt.  
Like the tremulous clay of propellers noone here is waiting for the next affection.  
Vein. You connected yourself for re-covering.  
And meetings of putrid lip and meetings of hairy mouth blue and plumed man,  
I was without doubt the giant tiger  
there in the forceful sea.  
When it looked me with its starry movie eyes  
it  
had neither leg nor nose  
but cedar flints on  
its sides.  
It was the day of the crab.  
There are no legless horses but barbaous cycles of promise and transparent  
eddies of naked calcerous iron.  
It was the lunchtime of the tiger.
