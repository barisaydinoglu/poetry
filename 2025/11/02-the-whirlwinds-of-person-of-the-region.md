The Whirlwinds Of Person Of The Region
--------------------------------------
In the sun rise of the night where you sleep,  
a dream entangles into studies.  
Pockets of steel converted into copper.  
But the peace woke the memory.  
You are the kiwi of my smothered breath.  
And a listless hoove's lightning will build you.  
Our new school, our smooth candle squares.  
  
From tornado to harrowing wind,  
hidden lunars drawn by fleeting channels, a  
atrocious perfume begins to kiss.  
It was a forceful business of lightning and consequences.
