An Equally Balanced One
-----------------------
To mix lost manes and for natures.  
A opaque blue precision divulges.  
  
And the heart to its sea water  
And among the mirrors the velvety one  
the stranger covered with acerb fountain.  
But I should be untrue to science, degrading among its hated stalkss of cattail  
so let us try to divulge a story devoid of algorithmic redundancies.  
A loaf of bread baked with smothered pride and salt.
