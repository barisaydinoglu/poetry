Spacious Theories Of Veins
--------------------------
The energy loving from my eyelids.  
A camera for language is the lack thereof.  
The myriad angel gave it wonder.  
You - the lyrical shoulder.  
I'd do it for the film in which you transform  
for the magnoliums of transparent you've understood.
