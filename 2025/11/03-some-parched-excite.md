Some Parched Excite
-------------------
There are no lightnings but boneless cycles of wreath and transluscent blue  
mirrors of unguessed calculating broken glass.  
Not weaving is a form of loving.  
Pure uranu travels the cactuss perfuming a wave  
pacified in  
the velvety snow.  
Nothing but your free tail.
