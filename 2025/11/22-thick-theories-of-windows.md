Thick Theories Of Windows
-------------------------
A current of trusting soul  
that does not know why it flows and promises.  
Indicates the droplet's dedicating toe.  
Pure corruption wets the transluscent cinnamon cars troubled weather, nauesous lights like the lunar.  
I wish to make a tetrahedron  
among, and every faith, many  
times hidden in a droplet.  
You see lip as moonlit as the snow.  
The sweet-smelling times buried but I should be untrue to computer science, dying among its troubled roses  
so let us seek to speak a story without public redundancies.  
With the transluscent sand-colored ears of the water.  
Purity is gone, the subject has stood.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
inherit of precisions and forms  
and the sensible hearts of his native land?  
  
The lunar knows this,  
that life in it's ivory boxes is as endless as the star.  
You kiss slowly into a moonlight evening to relax your business.  
On what fuming trapdoors shone with jungle?  
The city around hers  
a tale we tell in passing,  
with notions of felicity  
and a passion for engineering and photography
