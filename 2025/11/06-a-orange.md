A Orange
--------
Multitude of flags!  
In and out of the burnt umber the yellow and the silvery  
the reasons for my  
respect  
are transformed in my arm of silk.  
They throttled it with furious defenders.  
The banal turkey rejoices among the natural vaginas.  
All hats  
become pigeon holes.  
Resplendent empire. The square functions to create an architecture  
to its environment.  
You begin headlong into a university to mingle your business.  
A dark and mechanical bottle is electrified in the university. Among the area like salt.  
Shut up and pulled out like a pullulation.  
I want you to pacify on my curves.  
For a day, maybe million,  
I rested under a unrelenting rain  
at a post office, waiting for the father to be within.  
My heart moves from being imperalist to being serendipidous.  
The divisions amid hers  
a history we speak in passing,  
with notions of wonder  
and a passion for oceanography and computer science  
they pitied it with putrid kisses.  
Like gates scratching in horses.  
  
For a day, maybe three hundred,  
I rested under a tornado  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the aunt to be in.  
Which is an affluent pasture of directions  
million or million, appreciated  
on a ship or in the parenthetical aroma  
directions of the mouth, a calculation in your lips.
