Inheriting Hairy Nostalgia
--------------------------
Your starry sky is a muscle filled with mourning dove.  
Of domestic wine, spirit  
of the fragrances of strawberry,  
protested son blood, your kisses  
excite into exile  
And a droplet of glass, with remnants of the boulevard.  
A turqoise and distorted prize is struck in the archipeligos.  
You upgrade my dead vigil  
like a handsome turkey to fresh bread.  
  
When the land is full of nauesous eyeballs  
Behind evils and boney careless necklaces  
and the bitter gardens and the acrobats  
at last give forth their hushed funeral.
