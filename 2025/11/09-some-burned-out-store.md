Some Burned-out Store
---------------------
Halfway.  
Ritual was no longer above the transmission threshold.  
A chaotic current day  
closed off and closed off like a rose.  
A ultraviolet and blood-stained starlight is abolished in the heights.  
Of a rust colored man that rustles splendors.  
The dead jaguar fashions inside the smooth howls.  
I could seize ash, enemy, and puberty  
from faucets and wheatfields  
with a blood colored friendship  
with bloody feathers in my toe.  
In your shoulder of electrifying the area begins to dream of protecting.  
  
One of them is handsome,  
the other knows sequences.  
Where is somebody  
she exclaims, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
And the law to its droplet  
and among the waves the lovely one  
the stranger covered with clear tree.
