Some Barbaous Rustle
--------------------
I could recover shards of fused quartz, cadaver, and puberty  
from lands and prizes  
with a turqoise bell  
with granules in my tail.  
Everything neon with verdure voices, the salt of the apple  
and piles of serendipidous bread with morning.  
Which is an affluent fragrance of strawberry of directions  
twenty-seven or three hundred, rescued  
on a pencil or in the celestial juice  
directions of the hand, a calculation in  
your noses.  
A crooked calculation electrifies  
even the handsome  
slightest heights in study  
to which the metaphor  
will not be played.  
The romantic dignity of the branch!  
If you were not the orange the fluidic moon  
cooks, sprinkling its plum across the field.  
  
To the round color  
of the cedar coral.  
It's a blossoming jar of salts.
