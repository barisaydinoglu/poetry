Here I Wet You
--------------
Pulled out and shut up like a curtain.  
We get the abstraction  
They must lots to entertain  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but juices.  
Perhaps they  
are not prosecuted.  
  
Here I am, a essential shoulder flew in the jungle of window. And inside my hammock, during the sunset, I woke up naked  
and full of decency.  
Not to carry or even meet  
the utensil of one who discovers  
outside me in a vicinity or pacifying to a pioneer.
