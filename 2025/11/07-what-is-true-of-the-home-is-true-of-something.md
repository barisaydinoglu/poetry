What Is True Of The Home Is True Of Something
---------------------------------------------
Draw from it the calculating  
computer of its own calculation.  
An odor has shone among the heart,  
a mixture of wound and body, an awakening  
landscape that brings embarassement.  
One of them is romantic,  
the other knows signals.  
Where is everybody  
she says, and when can we see  
what  
is going to happen?  
The laminated sign knows this,  
that life in it's diamond boxes is as endless as the muscle.  
  
A drizzle of precisions if I could reconcile the billows of rust colored smoke and the university.  
I was without doubt the son bird  
there in the boney city.  
When it looked me with its somber home eyes  
it had neither breath nor foot  
but paper-mache rivers on its sides.
