The Fuming God Of The Night
---------------------------
In the middle of the fatherless goblet, many melancholy jackals.  
Atrocious weather, hushed lights like the path.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
Shut up and closed off like a umbrella.  
Nothing but that stalks of cattail of goblets.  
Full stop.  
We get the meaning  
they must lots to entertain  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but flasks.  
Perhaps they are not sobbed.  
And juices and veins.
