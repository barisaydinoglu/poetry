A Ceramic Within Crystal
------------------------
A raft is not enough to kill me and keep me  
from the field of your spacious mysteries.  
Went set in time I could expand bone, legless horse, and bomb  
from manes and bridges  
with a blood colored reflection  
with roosters in my foot.  
Towards those warmths of yours that wait for me. To seek another land a nose  
and a mouth  
crystallizing the land.  
Sometimes a piece of the fire  
strikes like a trouser in my eyelids.
