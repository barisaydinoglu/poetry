A Fruit
-------
With its tremulous expand the forceful eddy that wets in your momentum. Among the overflowing brambles.  
An odor has drank against the form,  
a mixture of bloody feather and body, a returning  
goblet that brings sorrow.  
  
The reasons for my respect  
are mixed in my fingernails of gem.  
The lady smiles at the bride  
but the custodian does not smile  
when he looks at the tiger one  
and the neon ocean.  
Conversations of smooth sand, the recitation  
of muscles we call romantic ritual.  
What drops the props of sincerity?  
To the cosmic lovely sweetnes a line outside a square,  
the worn-out workings of eager law.  
Decadent cities and cheerless stenches.  
A drizzle of doors the friendships exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
next to it in darkness.
