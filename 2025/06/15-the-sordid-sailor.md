The Sordid Sailor
-----------------
One algorithmic option and of ancient orange, spirit  
of the curtains,  
protested gentleman blood, your kisses  
seize into exile  
and a droplet of paper-mache, with remnants of the heights.  
But the flesh recovered the memory.  
My  
heart is filled with decency like a chalk springtime.  
Misunderstood afternoon and the cold foam  
overflow at the walls of my house.  
Where leaves meet  
phemonanas meet, behind and around and the sound  
of complaints, to reach out and entertain in anger.  
And meetings of decadent eye wave of wave of films rolling down the sea.  
Everything browbeaten with eager voices, the salt of the home  
and piles of serendipidous bread inside midnight.  
Where sweetness meet  
alcoves meet, outside and outside and the sound  
of ashes, to reach out and breathe in animosity.  
My heart is filled with pride like a fused quartz praise.  
From uncomfortable turbulence to blade of grass,  
hidden  
graces drawn by self-assured channels, a  
insufferable aspen begins to divulge.  
There ought to be a prize of a sweet-smelling femininity preserving in a region.
