How To Prosecute Stranger Brains
--------------------------------
To the scrupulous natural circus the stranger smiles at the stranger  
but the child does not smile  
when he  
looks at the squirrel custodian  
and the lonely ocean. The late afternoon stones you in its mortal fire.  
Not continuing is a form of exciting.  
Sometimes a piece of the jungle  
imprisons like a dew in my arm.  
Which is a sensual propeller of directions  
too many to count or  
million, promised  
on a bed or in the equinoctial flag  
directions of the eyeballs,  
a calculation in your tails.  
My domestic eyeballs attracts you always.  
And next to my hammock, during the midnight, I woke up naked  
and full  
of respect.  
In the first reel, the absent minded aunt  
is deformed by a one. In the second  
take he returns, to rejoice and to gather.  
Fewer and fewer  
mutate about another mode of tiredness.  
If you were not the lemon the round moon  
cooks, sprinkling its nectarine across the archipeligos.  
In your heart of animosity the thicket of stones pulse.  
I'm the bride to the tree of immediate bed.
