Since The Beginning Of Electrifying
-----------------------------------
You say, what is the horse waiting for in  
its  
transluscent sunburst orange cathedral?  
I tell you it is waiting for fellowship like you. A delirious synonym steals  
even the irreducable  
side area in identity  
to which the metaphor  
will not be expanded.  
Nothing but your sensible lip.  
Acerb, silk alcove!
