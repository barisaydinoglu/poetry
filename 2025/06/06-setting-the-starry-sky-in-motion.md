Setting The Starry Sky In Motion
--------------------------------
Human, paper-mache maternity!  
Blossoming the tiger of her salt full of love.  
It is a tale of sifted clandenstines iridescent empire. The circle functions to wake an architecture  
to its architecture.  
Your faucet is a wheatfield filled with frail heart.  
  
Next to cinnamon water and transparent rituals.  
I saw how landscapes are carried  
by the dashing ship.
