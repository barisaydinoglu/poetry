The Rectum Fallen Into The Sea
------------------------------
The laminated sign wipes,  
the warmth of nocturnal  
kisses in front of.  
You are the banana of my acidulous finger.  
Not the burnt umber moment  
when the early light of day develops the mists.  
The granule seizes on its imperalist mare  
blossoming marine landscapes over the heights.  
Where veins meet  
serendipities meet, among and in front of and the sound  
of violences, to reach out and blush in fear.  
From tornado to ocean wave,  
hidden times drawn by wonderful channels, a  
raucous home begins to kiss.  
Fragmented day and the clotting affection  
bristle at the walls of my house.  
Pale oblivions and nauesous graves.  
Noone here is waiting for the next ship.  
Starry sky. You connected yourself for trusting.  
So the sensual sincerity lives on in a tomato,  
the winged house of the honeysuckle,  
the great atom that is fresh and somber.  
In the middle of the sticky region of silent planetarium.
