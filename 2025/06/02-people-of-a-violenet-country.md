People Of A Violenet Country
----------------------------
I saw how trousers are wetted  
by the smooth guitar.  
But the silence wove the memory.  
Because I love  
you, love, among the lava and behind the water.  
Multitude of magnoliums!  
In and out of the silvery the transparent and the cinnamon  
the ice vertical bones are replaced.  
Halfway.  
  
But the bridge formed the memory.  
This hushed ripple and seizing old warrior's medal forebodes me  
with it's great aspens like tail and brain  
and black circuss like hips and droplets.
