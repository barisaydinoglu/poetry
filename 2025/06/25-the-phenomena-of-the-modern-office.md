The Phenomena Of The Modern Office
----------------------------------
Where flutes meet  
awes meet, within and with and the sound  
of trapdoors, to reach out and develop in illusion.  
Inside yellow water and silvery precisions.  
My heart moves from being arrogant to being nocturnal.  
A parenthetical  
rug making a winged thing of a unlikely meeting with an aunt.  
A rain of saxophones the morose iguana re-covers in the human shortcuts.
