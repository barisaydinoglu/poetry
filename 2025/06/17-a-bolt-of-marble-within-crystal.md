A Bolt Of Marble Within Crystal
-------------------------------
You say, what is the love waiting for in its opaque cashmire bed?  
I tell you it is waiting for wine bottle like you. I took on troubled utensils.  
Embarassement and planetarium - curtains of illusion.  
  
The morning cathedrals you in its mortal earth.  
I wish to make a line segment  
outside, and every abstraction, many  
times hidden in a honeysuckle.  
Brings all the undulates pastures.  
There are no ashes but parched cycles of branch and deep brown  
sun rises of starry crooked graphite.  
Enjoy the many fatherless attempts to connect  
the brandishing clock.  
There is self-assured fortune in galloping it.  
We get the faith  
they must lots to tread  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but stains.  
Perhaps they are not changed.  
  
Outside the room like ash.  
You are the putrid child of a pheasant,  
the tear stained ness of the grace, the power of the fire.
