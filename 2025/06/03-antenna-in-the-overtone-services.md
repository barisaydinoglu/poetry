Because I love you, love, behind the fire and inside the ice. Like the tremulous ash of prizes movie.  
Rescuing from senile fused quartz.  
With the phemonana of the room where you sleep,  
a dream faints into sequences.  
And so that its egoes will silence your toe.  
A tail and a eyelids  
living the heights.  
Our new map, our wide heart loops.  
Carry me onto your raft - the mango of my tiger -  
what seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.
