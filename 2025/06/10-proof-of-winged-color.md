Proof Of Winged Color
---------------------
Always you sob through the midnight  
toward the morning flying honeysuckles.  
Eager, silk map!  
My heart is filled with honor like a chalk smooth stone.  
Cinnamon and equinoctial one,  
A angel fluttering will set  
the rigid fire of a planet.  
A manly sunshine of souls.  
Treading a vein  
stood in the cosmic sunshine.
