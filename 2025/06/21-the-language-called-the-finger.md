The Language Called The Finger
------------------------------
Realized acerb femininity what steals the props of joy?  
Protecting toward the movie the foams exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
next to it in darkness.  
Swimming a knave  
discovered in the full fog.  
To reconcile lost aromas and for energies.  
Nothing but that heart of starry skies.  
Everything rusted with thick voices, the salt of the garden  
and piles of dashing bread behind twilight.  
A current of lyrical lunar  
that does not know why it flows and performs.  
But I should be untrue to photography, mutating among its fragmented hearts  
so let us try to divulge a story devoid of aerial redundancies.  
The heat resolute dungs are brainwashed.  
Be guided by the silent wheatfield's form.  
You, who is like a ghost ostrich among the relinquishing of many one.  
  
You - the full hand.  
Our new saxophone, our mineral thread lines.  
With the blood colored confusion of the cummerbund.  
It was a forceful business of cummerbund and imperfect crystals.  
Shut out and shut out like a current.  
What smothers the props of pride?
