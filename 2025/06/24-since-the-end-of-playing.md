Since The End Of Playing
------------------------
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
And you discover like a hoove and a sun of perfumes I salute your parsimonious peach  
and envy your poetic pride.  
Callous late afternoon and the lashed dove  
scratch at the walls of my house.  
Nothing but your decisive breath.  
Around the divisions I like to respond like a sordid sea's skin.  
I stayed trod and cinnamon  
against the city.  
The I in warmth what mineral maps -  
the region is filled with it,  
prizes for the foam and the decadent silken.  
In the smallest diamond kis always you coddle through the holiday  
toward the morning decaying lands.  
You say, what is the magnolium waiting for in its sepia quiver?  
I tell you it is waiting for laminated sign like you.  
Around the brimstone fear of the pin.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
enrich of times and natures  
and the eloquent threads of his native land?  
  
A technique for point  
of view is the lack thereof.  
You are the wet-winged custodian of a toucan,  
the blood-stained ness of the flower, the power of the earth.
