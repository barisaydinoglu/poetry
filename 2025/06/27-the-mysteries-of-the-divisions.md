The Mysteries Of The Divisions
------------------------------
Bitten twilight and the callous school  
crush at the walls of my house.  
It was the sunset of the cat.  
For shades of cinnamon was calcerous and morally negative.  
Conversations of fragrances of strawberry, the recitation  
of energies we call free circus.  
  
It was the late afternoon of the jaguar.  
The blood lives on its torrential mare  
rejoicing silvery autumns over the sea.  
This directionless shades of transluscent transparent and weaving crown degrades me  
with it's naked lights like arm and arm  
and gray forests like hips and friendships.  
There ought to be a silicon architecture of a serendipidous mane weaving in an area.  
Some continue but I flutter your sand like femininity.  
Around the universe I like to magnify like a delirious shades of cinnamon.  
And you drink like a banner and only telegraph, just the  
drop, nothing but  
it. Candle.  
  
Inside cashmire water and green apples.  
I attract as if next to a delirious juice.  
But I should be untrue to science, falling among its rusted gardens  
so let us attempt to tell a story devoid of alphabetic redundancies.  
Has the field been breathed with secrets?  
Because I love you, love, within the fire and outside the jungle.  
Verdure, silken farm!  
I do not abolish in the moonlight evening of directionless beast.  
A phenomenon for computer is the lack thereof.  
A square with a circle,  
the forceful workings of lyrical law.
