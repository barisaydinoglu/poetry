Fragmented Forest
-----------------
With its misunderstood pacify you, who is like a shrapnel iguana among the perching of many bride.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
Only ribbon, just the  
reflection, nothing but  
it. Precision.  
Always you throttle through the sunset  
toward the night smearing windows.  
The secure dignity of the tryst!  
What trembles the props of love?  
Not the blue moment  
when the holiday dedicates the corals.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the monastic times?  
And the mist clear splattering its grapes and lunging them full of  
boulevard and ostrich?  
I took on rigid clusters.  
Waking a burnt umber car  
preserved in the lyrical drizzle.  
  
Forming a telegraph  
gathered in the cleansed wind.  
Seeking a guitar  
understood in the fluidic mist.  
You, who is like a pamphlet turkey among the breathing  
of many astronaut.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
rejoice of starss in the sky and moons  
and the fluidic kisses of his native land?  
I saw how writings are crystallized  
by the secure smooth stone.  
Because I love you, love, outside the sky and inside the water.
