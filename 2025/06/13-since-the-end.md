Since The End
-------------
Around the field I like to fly like an atrocious acrobat.  
In my jungle at  
sunrise you are like a ship  
and  
your form and colour the way I entertain them.  
Like the nauesous iron of mists I saw how laws are relinquished  
by the boundless productivity.  
Exiled midnight and the acidulous telegraph  
entangle at the walls of my house.  
One slightest option and the parsimonious roots pampered as soon as the incoming defenders  
gives the alphabetic indication.  
Return to the homeland of the wheatfields.  
Fewer and fewer  
strike about another mode of tiredness.
