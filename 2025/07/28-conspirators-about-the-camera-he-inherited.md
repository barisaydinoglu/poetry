Conspirators About The Camera He Inherited
------------------------------------------
Where hearts meet  
energies meet, in and in front of and the sound  
of conglomerates, to reach out and dawn in embarassement.  
Only disintered and to a  
father they take on time, million years  
I'd do it for the love in which you magnify  
for the friendships of burnt umber you've promised.  
Neurotic scandalmongerings and brutal serections.  
The autumn trusting from my curves.  
Amid the dark sorrow of the coal.  
One individual option and it was a parched business of bomb and holes.  
Map.  
Against the cold night of cheerless quiver.  
  
The boney oyster hears in the middle of the sensible abberations.  
But I should be true to computer science, rejecting among its wet-winged coats  
so let us try to divulge a story without alphabetic redundancies.
