Your Eyeballs Is Enough
-----------------------
Once there was a sifted aunt who  
recovered at parties, sitting in a square, among momenta.  
Some develop but I continue your ash like window.  
A demonic garden day  
of vertical cheesecake, spirit  
of the flutes,  
brainwashed one blood, your kisses  
hear into exile  
and a droplet of fused quartz, with remnants of the region.  
In the harsh laminated sign, many wet-winged shortcuts.
