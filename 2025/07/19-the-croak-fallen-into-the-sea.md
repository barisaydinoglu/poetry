The Croak Fallen Into The Sea
-----------------------------
The shadow imposes nessecity.  
You've asked me what the pheasant is creating there with his deep brown heart?  
I reply, the school knows this.  
  
Rejoice on the coals that wait for you  
entangling the rustling chairs, deluding the doors.  
You blush my dead imbroglio  
like a rosy jaguar to fresh plum.  
And you deprived in the sorrow and seized a compounding stick.  
Pockets of salt converted into glass.  
I'm the goddess to the flower head of immediate wine bottle.  
What we say shines to  
begin some other astronaut  
what a detail may teach.  
And a lashed aroma's clay will attract you.  
Around the city I like to inherit like a disintered wave.  
Behind the thirsty field of inevitable phemonana.
