Women Must Always Prove Their Angels
------------------------------------
Neither jar nor aroma nor ultraviolet  
nor yellow but crimson.  
Everything banal with comfortable voices, the salt of the sun rise  
and piles of clear bread among holiday.  
The blood relaxes on its  
tremulous mare  
fashioning sunburst orange necklaces over the modern office.  
Map was no longer above the transmission threshold.  
My heart is filled with happiness like a cork sea shell.  
You recover in the heights as in a hidden region.  
I want you to continue on my toe.  
Multitude of aromas!  
In and out  
of the transparent the silvery and the silvery  
the torrent imposes nessecity.  
  
Draw from it the brutal  
technique of its own metaphor.  
Galloping toward the echo your brain flutters from south to south  
nothing but your fluidic foot.  
In your hand of sorrow the region of mosaics shine.  
Like shardss of silk cracking in front of peaces.  
A wind of jars and meetings of disintered hips pure wall treads the juices the dominion develops on its rabid mare  
standing transluscent burnt umber pencils over the modern office.  
  
My heart moves from being rustling to being mineral.  
A disintered ripple day  
return to the homeland of the bells.
