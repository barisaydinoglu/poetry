The Inscription Of Algorithmic Points
-------------------------------------
Once there was an atrocious aunt who  
conducted at parties, sitting in a line, among ships.  
You say, what is the bridge waiting for in its sunburst orange sweetnes?  
I tell you it is waiting for defender like you.  
I do not wipe in the boulevard of arrogant night.  
In your nose of cracking the divisions begins to dream of beginning.  
A airplane is not enough to loiter me and keep me  
from the jungle of your charitable secrets.  
Only sea shell, just the  
book, nothing but  
it. Crimson car.  
They are all ladies  
professional clandenstines in whose silent kiss originate.  
Of a red woman that awakens doves.  
I saw how laws are excited  
by the smooth muscle.  
  
Full stop.  
What handsome maps -  
the heights is filled with it,  
starlights for the wheatfield and the whirlwinds of marble.  
Only flesh, just the  
phemonana, nothing but  
it. Droplet.  
Draw from it the violenet  
synonym of its own phenomenon.  
A callous mosaic day  
In the first scene, the great father  
is fainted by a pioneer. In the second  
scene he returns, to perform and to divulge.  
And so that its deaths will drop your arm.  
To rejoice lost stalkss of cattail and for paths.  
The I in umbrella a current of original smooth stone  
that does not know why it flows and flows.  
I fashion as if amid a lewd enemy.  
Nothing but your plumed lip.  
You've asked me what the ostrich is kissing there with his deep brown ears?  
I reply, the umbrella knows this.  
  
Time.  
A vessel is not enough to abduct me and keep me  
from the sea of your gleaming funny things.
