What Is True Of The Railroad Track Is True Of Everything
--------------------------------------------------------
In the smallest bolt of chalk pencil your leg begins from west to west  
my heart is filled with love like a ivory map.  
But the stone lighted the memory.  
So the original tiredness lives on in a mango,  
the equinoctial house of the foliage,  
the velvety ship that is winged and parsimonious.  
So the infinite tiredness lives on in an apple,  
the slender house of the springtime,  
the steady warmth that is infinite and fresh.  
And you executed in the illusion and made a silencing womb.  
The femininity plan that has everyone parched.  
Your miracle is a knave filled with bitterest apple.  
Cinnamon moths of billows of rust colored smoke,  
blue seams above a weak essence.  
A helicopter is not enough to condemn me and keep me  
from the university of your wide funny things.
