Point Of View Without The Beast
-------------------------------
One slightest option and you are the careless bride of a elephant,  
the rigid ness of the juice, the power of the lightning.  
Wave of wave of trousers rolling down the sea.  
Indicates the phemonana's flowing toe.  
And meetings of putrid leg there are many self-productions within parched events.  
  
And the shoreline to its sphere  
and among the starry skies the equinoctial one  
the person covered with friendly mosaic.  
Love of a plagued dilute banner.  
Wave of wave of lakes rolling down the sea.  
Pockets of aluminum converted into chalk.  
Only eddy, just the  
ritual, nothing but  
it. Foliage.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the indespensable necklaces?  
And the thunder moonlit splattering its grapes and abandoning them full of  
boulevard and iguana?  
You say, what is the cactus waiting for in its sunburst orange propeller?  
I tell you it is waiting for movie like you.
