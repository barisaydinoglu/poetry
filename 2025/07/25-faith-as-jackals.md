Faith As Jackals
----------------
A mist -like enemy  
essence.  
A study begins,  
drowns - it does not return.  
On what brutal vigils performed with fire?  
Phosphorus noises and obscene complaints.  
But the cathedral shone the memory.  
Like shady momentum, energies  
went perched in ripple your brow reconciles from south to south.  
Nothing but that movie of wheatfields.  
A current of profound starlight  
that does not know why it flows and entertains.  
  
Loving empire. The quadrangle functions to shower an architecture  
to its architecture.  
Reconciled and then heard in the boulevard.  
I am coagulated by smooth clay and error, by serection and sun.  
The coat sobs, the sun rise of somber  
mixes outside.  
The tryst mingling from my eye.  
Celestial, cork bridge!  
I saw how sun rises are swam  
by the real land.  
Come with me to the havoc of vortices.  
  
Yellow lava to my inevitable banner!  
I recover as if in a whirlwinds of massacre.  
  
Pockets of aluminum converted into wooden.
