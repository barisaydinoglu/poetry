Since The Beginning Of Dismantling
----------------------------------
Stranger of the depths of my tail - your divulging  
stills your honest regard as though it were fire.  
I wish to make a quadrangle  
outside, and every sight, many  
times hidden in a kis.  
An odor has returned in the middle of the circus,  
a mixture of billows of red smoke and body, a understanding  
fountain that brings sorrow.  
If I could connect the trash  
barge and the jungle.  
Hairy cubicles and hushed receptacles.  
The reasons for my respect  
are flew in my brain of paper-mache.  
  
We open the halves of a funny things and the  
shattering of oblivions begins into the enduring universe.
