The Neon Bride
--------------
And within my hammock, during the afternoon, I woke up naked  
and full of decency. The fortnight forms you in its mortal earth.  
Silvery jugulars  
of corpse,  
yellow seams above a hairy miracle.  
Always you silence through the afternoon  
toward the sunset puncturing wells.  
I stayed expanded and sand-colored  
behind the boulevard.  
Precision.
