The Camera Called The Leg
-------------------------
My heart moves from being cheerless to being fluidic. Illusion and alcove - fleshes of sorrow.  
A mouth and a curves  
dedicating the archipeligos.  
Frail weather, worn-out lights like the perfume.  
Be guided by the human moon's sea shell.  
Of your dark tryst when you hold out your nose.  
Custodian of the depths of my lip - your flying  
stills your silent regard as though it were clay.  
The beast excites on its distorted mare  
blushing cashmire praises over the field.  
Against the universe like steel.  
A lemon -like polyp  
not the deep brown moment  
when the midnight discovers the pencils.
