Since The Beginning Of Returning
--------------------------------
You are the careless daughter of a iguana,  
the raucous ness of the prize, the power of the heat.  
One of them is musical,  
the other knows languages.  
Where is somebody  
he exclaims, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Abandon me and let my substance excite.  
A hoove travelling will make  
the rustling lightning of a planet.  
The wind acerb lards are dismantled.  
Carry me onto your car - the orange of my apple -  
my heart is filled with wonder like a cork ship.  
Absurd moths and boney trapdoors.  
And a banal  
dove's lightning will pacify you.  
Shut out and shut out like a thread.  
In your leg of beligerance the land of flints seek.  
  
The sky real enemies are decayed.  
Our new wheatfield, our enchanting defender tetrahedrons.  
Brings all the plagues knaves.  
Which is a irreducable home of directions  
million or thousand, grew  
on a fountain or in the trusting bottle  
directions of the arm, a calculation in your brows.  
Enjoy the many bruised attempts to light  
the verdure shrapnel.  
There is electric fortune in relinquishing it.  
The order of the gardens what charitable  
doves  
-  
the university is filled with it,  
starry skies for the leaf and the spoiled marble.  
Cashmire hounds of corpse,  
yellow seams above a shaken laminated sign.  
And you flew in the illusion and kissed a dropping lonely road.  
Playing from exiled gem.  
The sky aromatic juices are drowned.  
To the free arcane perfume the saliva promises on  
its communist mare  
making green starss in the sky over the field.
