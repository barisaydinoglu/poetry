Meeting Your Jackal
-------------------
On what bitten imperfect saphires loved with clay?  
In my moonlight evening at twilight you are like a saxophone  
and your form and colour the way I stand them.  
In your brain of imprisoning the jungle begins to dream of flowing.  
You are the arrogant elder of a pheasant,  
the shifty ness of the momentum, the power of the fire.  
Towards those forms of yours that wait for me.  
To seek another land a mist of mists your nose flies from north to east  
of your black ship when you hold out your toe.
