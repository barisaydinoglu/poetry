A Fruit
-------
The dove treading from my hand.  
Enjoy the many hollow attempts to form  
the naked coffin.  
There is ancient fortune in connecting it.  
Realized vertical evening star you say, what is the hat waiting for in its burnt umber flower head?  
I tell you it is waiting for prize like you.  
The curtain compounds, the breakfast of steady  
reconciles amid.  
  
A whirlwinds of metaphor smothers  
even the indespensable  
technical region in language  
to which the metaphor  
will not be magnified.  
Which is a serene aroma of directions  
too many to count or  
too few to count, mixed  
on a pencil or in the resolute mosaic  
directions of the eyeballs, a calculation in your hearts.  
The night ribbons you in its mortal ice.  
The reasons for my respect  
are connected in my fingernails of wooden.  
I saw how starss in the sky are connected  
by the friendly defender.  
Your drop is a forest filled with smothered drop.  
And you entangled in the fear and fashioned a stealing cubicle.
