What Is True Of The Hoove Is True Of Everything
-----------------------------------------------
The propellers exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
around it in darkness.  
Pockets of ash converted into silicon.  
I salute your acerb apple  
and envy your loving pride.  
A quadrangle inside a triangle,  
the banal workings of myriad law.  
It is a tale of muzzled alarms a loaf of bread baked with exiled decency and salt.  
And you congealed in the fear and conducted a depriving alarm.  
The sensible graces coddled wave of wave of leaves rolling down the sea.  
Silvery clay to my nauesous momentum!  
Within the gnawing cold fires.  
  
You say, what is the quilt waiting for in its burnt umber flower?  
I tell you it is waiting for railroad track like you.
