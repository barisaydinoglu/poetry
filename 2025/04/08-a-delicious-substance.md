A Delicious Substance
---------------------
Next to the compounding massacres.  
The sailor smiles at the astronaut  
but the gentleman does not smile  
when he looks at the tiger pioneer  
and the calcerous ocean.  
You are the tenacious lady of a bird,  
the bitten ness of the faucet, the power of the heat.  
Conquer me and let my substance seize.  
  
The echo shines in seizing your brow.  
A motionless detail drops  
even the loving  
neutral night in calculation  
to which the metaphor  
will not be relaxed.
