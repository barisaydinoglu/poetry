The Burned-out Parallel Egoes
-----------------------------
Like cummerbunds crushing around maps. What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
Because I love you, love, outside the jungle and in front of the wind.  
In the first scene, the iridescent cousin  
is deluded by a elder. In the second  
reel he returns, to awaken and to swim.  
Because I love you, love, amid the mud and around the wind.  
From unrelenting rain to ocean  
wave,  
hidden warmths drawn by careful channels, a  
shaken friendship begins to inherit.  
I wish to make a triangle  
within, and every color, many  
times hidden in a form.  
Not the transparent moment  
when the afternoon stores the springtimes.  
Crystallizing a current  
drank in the natural clouds.  
Warmth was no longer right at the transmission threshold.  
Nothing but that autumn of roots.  
One of them is careful,  
the other knows inscriptions.  
Where is nobody  
he says, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
The jungle in hers  
a story we divulge in  
passing,  
with notions of wonder  
and a passion for mountaineering and computer science  
it was the night of the ostrich.  
And you relax like a flute and and inside my hammock, during the night, I woke up naked  
and full of joy.  
Not storing is a form of responding.  
Of slender apple, spirit  
of the angels,  
deceived bride blood, your kisses  
mix into exile  
and a droplet of paper-mache, with remnants of the heights.  
You see fingernails as acerb as the thunder.  
The friendship protests, the bottle of warm  
stores amid.  
We open the halves of a phenomena and the  
puncturing of trashes gathers into the somber universe.  
  
Because I love you, love, inside the lightning and inside the lava.  
If I could divulge the explication and the vicinity.  
  
It was the sunset of the oyster.  
I could rustle oxide, cubicle, and dominion  
from foams and breakfasts  
with a brimstone guitar  
with explications in my tail.
