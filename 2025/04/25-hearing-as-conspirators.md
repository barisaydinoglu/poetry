Hearing As Conspirators
-----------------------
As soon as the incoming necklaces  
gives the overtone indication.  
In your foot of illusion the jungle of yellow cars upgrade.  
Beligerance and awe - laws of illusion.  
What we say fashions to  
weave some other goddess  
what a image may teach.  
You refresh my wet-winged stench  
like a balanced turkey to fresh wine.  
An odor has lighted outside the juice,  
a mixture of corpse  
and body, a imbuing  
lake that brings agony.  
Your finger relaxes from north to north  
Around the archipeligos I like to shine like a negligent sun.  
The rotten stump imposes nessecity.  
The child smiles at the stranger  
but the uncle does not smile  
when he looks at the turkey woman  
and the oily ocean.  
Come with me to the alarm of darkness.  
It's a responding umbrella of phlegms.  
Around the area I like to create like a banal rose.  
This hollow movie and growing serenity conquers me  
with it's parsimonious reflections like mouth and toe  
and ultraviolet saxophones like eye and wreaths.  
With its dead entertain here I am,  
a manly eyelids mourned in the boulevard of film.
