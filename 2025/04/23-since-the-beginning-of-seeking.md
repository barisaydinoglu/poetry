Since The Beginning Of Seeking
------------------------------
Shut up and shut out like a bed.  
I salute your slender orange  
and envy your delicate pride.  
Come with me to the probe of polyps.  
Growing the horse of her essence full of pride.  
We get the sight  
they must lots to imbue  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but beasts.  
Perhaps  
they are not impaled.  
My heart moves from being violenet to being free.  
The child smiles at the uncle  
but the elder does not smile  
when he looks at the cat custodian  
and the whirlwinds of ocean.  
Enriching a rose  
kissed in the scrupulous sun.  
Pockets of broken glass converted into saphire.  
Crimson and electric sailor,  
your planetarium is a window filled with troubled mane.
