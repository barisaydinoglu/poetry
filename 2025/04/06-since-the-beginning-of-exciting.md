Since The Beginning Of Exciting
-------------------------------
My heart moves from being dilute to being electric. Neither quilt nor home nor dark  
nor burnt umber but yellow.  
Because I love you, love, in the earth and next to the earth.  
Pockets of aluminum converted into chalk.  
Because I love you, love, within the lightning and next to the sky.  
As if to pity or conduct or reject.  
Of a blood colored fisherman that pulses phemonanas.  
Inside the city like clay.  
Flowed and then entertained in the land.  
Wave of wave of cathedrals rolling down the sea.
