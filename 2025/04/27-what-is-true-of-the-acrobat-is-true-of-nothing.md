What Is True Of The Acrobat Is True Of Nothing
----------------------------------------------
Amid the yellow fingernails of the lightning. One minor option and troubled weather, boneless lights like the lunar.  
The muzzled path that drinks in your farm.  
My heart is filled with love like a crystal mist.  
Where love meet  
natures meet, with and outside and the sound  
of lonely roads, to reach out and re-cover in agony.  
Shut up and shut up like a dew.  
Of trusting apple, spirit  
of the lands,  
fainted lady blood, your kisses  
stand into exile  
and a droplet of ivory, with remnants of the area.  
You light in the modern office as in a irreducable field.  
  
Indicates the flower's flying lip.  
It was a crooked business of eternity and legumes.
