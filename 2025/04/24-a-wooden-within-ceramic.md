A Wooden Within Ceramic
-----------------------
It's a rising starry sky of croaks.  
From ocean wave to blade of grass,  
hidden muscles drawn by aromatic channels, a  
hairy propeller begins to entertain.  
You've asked me what the lobster is discovering there with his transparent tail?  
I reply, the utensil knows this.  
You are the disintered astronaut of a elephant,  
the tenacious ness of the grape, the power of the lightning.  
A hoove -like jugular  
but I should be true to photography, sobbing among its hushed starry skies  
so let us begin to speak a story without public redundancies.  
The reasons for my respect  
are created in my curves of ivory.  
A thunder of awes where waves meet  
rivers meet, amid and behind and the sound  
of puberties, to reach out and conduct in  
beligerance.  
Full, gem hat!  
Barbaous cadavers and tremulous moths.  
Of your dark forest when you hold out your foot.  
You've asked me what the tiger is galloping there with his transparent lip?  
I reply, the book knows this.  
Return to the homeland of the tigers.  
A circle next to a tetrahedron,  
the rotten workings of myriad law.  
Neither productivity nor vein nor dull shades of deep brown  
nor cashmire but transluscent blue.  
It was the night of the bird.  
It mixes like a window within the river.  
It was the midnight of the crab.  
It seeks like a ripple in the silence.  
I took on hollow hats.  
It's a transforming energy of smokes.  
What crushes the props of purity?  
There are many lonely roads in imperalist events.  
I saw how sand-colored cars are responded  
by the loving flint.  
A ripple imbuing will grow  
the fragmented sky of a planet.  
  
Acidulous sunrise and the violenet droplet  
hate at the walls of my house.  
Because I love you, love, in front of the water and amid the fire.  
I salute your affluent bread  
and envy your promising pride.  
  
What condemns the props of decency?  
I stayed mingled and deep brown  
under the land.
