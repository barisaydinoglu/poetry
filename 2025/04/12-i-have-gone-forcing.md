I Have Gone Forcing
-------------------
Confusion and dove - stalkss  
of cattail of beligerance.  
In the marine brow of the sky.  
The affluent dignity of the forest!  
In your tail of foreboding the moonlight evening begins to dream of imbuing.  
A lake focuses its dream of a new beginning, its ending, the old ending of the star order -  
its cosmic nights.  
It was a barbaous business of mask and trashes.  
  
And you swim like a flower and the mane petrifies, the home of fresh  
re-covers outside.  
An odor has wove outside the circus,  
a mixture of hound and body, a setting  
poppy that brings confusion.  
In the face of so many graves to positivity.  
Drinking a friendship  
conducted in the resolute sunshine.  
He is in us at this moment of first waking.
