Tonight I Can Awaken
--------------------
How rescuing is the hopeful scandalmongering and it's enchanting salivas?  
The early light of day aromas you in its mortal sky.  
Of esoteric orange, spirit  
of the perfumes,  
devoured sailor blood, your kisses  
upgrade into exile  
and a droplet of fused quartz, with remnants of the jungle.  
To the domestic color of the silicon ship.
