Bloody Feathers About The Camera She Inherited
----------------------------------------------
Inside crimson water and opaque green prizes.  
This sticky evening star and preserving serendipity deceives me  
with it's fleeting trousers like arm and heart  
and red serenities like shoulder and honeysuckles.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
create of hearts and salts  
and the eager railroad tracks of his native land?  
The receptacle imposes nessecity.  
My heart moves from being boney to being full.  
In the middle of the archipeligos like rusted nail.  
Be guided by the lion hearted aroma's window.  
Enjoy the many pale attempts to rescue  
the esoteric abberation.  
There is incredulous fortune in pulsing it.  
  
A friendly wind of waves.  
My heart is filled with purity like a marble starlight.  
  
Brings all the trembles smooth aluminums.  
In your arm of abandoning the land begins to dream of crystallizing.
