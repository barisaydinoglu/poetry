From What Are Splendors Built
-----------------------------
I saw how spheres are rejoiced  
by the great leaf.  
But the smooth stone blushed the memory.  
Clear, glass banner!  
I rise as if in a lethargic nail.  
On what worn-out masks travelled with clay?  
A chorus of pheasants at midnight un lighted un deprived  
comes to a halt before a dove.  
There ought to be a sun of a boundless friendship continuing in a field.  
Neither star nor garden nor dull shades of blue  
nor transparent but crimson.  
There are no rectums but browbeaten cycles of stalks of cattail and burnt umber  
fellowships of absorbant clotting metal.  
Delicate empire. The square functions to perch a system  
to its environment.
