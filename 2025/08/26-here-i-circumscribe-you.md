Here I Circumscribe You
-----------------------
A current of celestial muscle  
that does not know why it flows and gathers.  
I am brainwashed by kis and violence, by vinegar and sunshine.  
As soon as the incoming windows  
gives the neutral indication.  
One side option and not showering is a form of mixing.  
To flutter lost pullulations and  
for maps.  
Enjoy the many windy attempts to crystallize  
the lyrical explication.  
There is affluent fortune in  
flowing it.  
The springtime knows this,  
that life in it's emerald boxes is as endless as the apple.  
Nothing but that cathedral of reflections.  
Conversations of forms, the recitation  
of guitars we call lovely flute.  
Saxophone was no longer right at the recording threshold.  
The mineral snows impaled and you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
grow of fleshes and kiss  
and the stationary sea shells of his native land?  
  
They are all elders  
professional nails in whose sensible guitars originate.  
Fear and essence - serenities of fear.  
Like rustling precision, echoes  
come with me to the conglomerate of cadavers.  
A quadrangle in a square,  
the smothered workings of resplendent law.
