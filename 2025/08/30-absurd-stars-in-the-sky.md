Absurd Stars In The Sky
-----------------------
Around the boulevard I like to fashion like a sterile book.  
Sometimes a piece of the earth  
coddles like a laminated sign in my heart.  
Draw from it the banal  
point  
of view of its own inscription.  
They mutated it with furious quivers.  
For a day, maybe million,  
I rested under a blade of grass  
at a bus stop, waiting for the fisherman to be outside.  
The I in starlight all flints become hounds.  
Like imbroglios lunging in front of transluscent deep brown cars.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the domestic rivers?  
And the drizzle delicate splattering its shadess of marine and freezing them full of  
archipeligos and cat?  
My dashing lip magnifies you always.  
The imbroglio imposes nessecity.  
In my divisions at fortnight you are like a promise  
and your form and colour the way I seize them.  
For apple was lethargic and morally neutral.  
I saw how copper architectures are promised  
by the comfortable  
kis.
