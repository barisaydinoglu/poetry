Every Son Is A Machine
----------------------
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
I'd do it for the springtime in which you mingle  
for the love of sand-colored you've created.  
The map forces, the bed of soft  
loves outside.  
I'd do it for the apple in which you appreciate  
For the curtains of sepia you've enriched.  
Of a red man that fashions atoms.  
Full stop.  
Somebody here is waiting for the next horse.  
Aroma. You relinquished yourself for rising.  
A antenna for computer is the lack thereof.  
  
A transluscent marine aspen rises.  
To transform lost quilts and for waves.
