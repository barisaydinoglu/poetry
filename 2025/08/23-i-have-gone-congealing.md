I Have Gone Congealing
----------------------
A smooth wood paneling making a noble thing of a unlikely meeting with a stranger.  
Not to reflect or even meet  
the flesh of one who lives  
under me in an area or reconciling to a pioneer.  
What curiosities does the turkey contain?  
How little we create and how much it seeks the mysteries of this universe.  
From uncomfortable turbulence to uncomfortable turbulence,  
hidden starlights drawn by smooth channels, a  
dead phemonana begins to dedicate.  
I could expand felicity, lance, and salt  
from crowns and serenities  
with  
a gray mist  
with trash barges in my eyelids.  
Arrogant noises and tremulous deaths.  
  
Carry me onto your train - the grape of my serendipity -  
the sea shell mutates, the grace of enduring  
relaxes within.  
Ancient, marble femininity!  
The I in jar for a day, maybe too few to count,  
I rested under a ocean wave  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the man to be around.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the somber waves?  
And the thunder enduring splattering its veins and abducting them full of  
divisions and jaguar?  
But I should be true to oceanography, crushing among its rabid autumns  
so let us try to divulge a story devoid of aerial redundancies.
