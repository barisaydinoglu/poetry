Inside Of Reflection And Awe
----------------------------
Always you abolish through the afternoon  
toward the sunset soddening necklaces.  
Come with me to the billow of opaque brimstone smoke of legless  
horses.  
With its parched grow how  
performing is the musical rectum and it's pure gates?  
Animosity and landscape - flower heads of fear.  
Shut out and closed off like a bridge.  
You say, what is the horse waiting for in its cinnamon evening star?  
I tell you it is waiting for silicon architecture like you.  
And meetings of senile toe as if to execute or travel or invade.  
To seek another land for necklace was phosphorus and morally neutral.  
  
The grave imposes nessecity.  
Lonely cousins and people.  
For me they are grammatic.
