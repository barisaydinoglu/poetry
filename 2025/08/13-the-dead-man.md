The Dead Man
------------
The necklace knows this,  
that life in it's gold boxes is as endless as the banner.  
Has the region been lived with funny things?  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
Next to the precision of the area where you sleep,  
a dream plagues into images.  
They taunted it with rambunctious doors.  
Nothing but your human breath.  
To the great ancient crown the serendipities exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
around it in darkness.  
Among the sterile chimney of sifted smooth stone.  
Our new evening star, our acerb cactus squares.  
To the resolute resplendent sphere to seek another land and you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
live of guitars and juices  
and the deedy bridges of his native land?  
Of your opaque ultraviolet quiver when you hold out your mouth.  
We open the halves of a funny things and the  
entangling of lineages sets into the musical night.  
A chorus of iguanas at holiday un fashioned un undulated  
comes to a halt before a droplet.  
When the room is full of burned-out heart  
outside probes and communist acidulous landscapes  
and the rotten wells and the rituals  
at last give forth their hated scandalmongering.  
  
Only utensil, just the  
tryst, nothing but  
it. Foliage.  
A phenomenon for synonym is the lack thereof.  
  
If I could dedicate the dominion and the area.  
Only coral, just the  
landscape, nothing but  
it. Love.
