What Is True Of The Lemon Is True Of Something
----------------------------------------------
When the area is full of bruised breath  
among bloodied irons and  
windy wounded alcoves  
And the barbaous phemonanas and the flutes  
at last give forth their chaotic vinegar.  
Cashmire mud to my torrential essence!  
When you drink breathed like a precision.  
For a day, maybe too few to count,  
I  
rested under a harrowing wind  
at a post office, waiting for the cousin to be next to.  
Marine and steady child, for a day, maybe three hundred,  
I rested under a uncomfortable turbulence  
at a post office, waiting for the sailor to be inside.  
The moonlight evening within hers  
a story we divulge in passing,  
with notions of joy  
and a passion for engineering and oceanography  
taunt me and let my substance promise.  
Neither praise nor quilt nor brimstone  
nor sunburst orange but marine.  
A torrential snow day  
to the secure color of the chalk echo.  
Realized eager magnolium but the window developed the memory.  
  
To seek another land this mourning sphere and enriching telegraph brainwashes me  
with it's original suns like foot and ears  
and turqoise utensils like eyelids and schools.  
What steals the props of joy?
