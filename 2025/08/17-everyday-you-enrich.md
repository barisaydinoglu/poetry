Everyday You Enrich
-------------------
Which is a fluidic precision of directions  
three hundred or twenty-seven, perfumed  
on a crown or in the slender door  
directions of the breath, a calculation in your shoulders.  
My heart is filled with tiredness like a paper-mache salt.  
Chirping the hat of her heart full of joy.  
Hushed belts and dry graves.  
My heart moves from being spoiled to being great.  
The disintered bridge that attracts in your wave.  
Deep brown sky to my dilute goblet!
