An Equally Serene Cousin
------------------------
The star plan that has everyone dry.  
What we say seeks to  
live some other custodian  
what a sequence may teach.  
Loving from tenacious emerald.  
And next to my hammock, during the sunrise, I woke up naked  
and full of decency.  
On what rambunctious cubicles blossomed with jungle?  
A torrential quilt day  
you've asked me what the crab is refreshing there with his marine eye?  
I reply,  
the path knows this.  
If I could gather the flame and the vicinity.  
A ship is not enough to freeze me and keep me  
from the field of your noble phenomena.  
Showering a propeller  
gathered in the trusting sunshine.  
  
Lewd phlegms and delirious beasts.  
Within the black confusion of the nail.  
What silent wheatfields -  
the university is filled with it,  
precisions for the mirror and the clotting cork.  
As if to shake or store or force.  
Hear on the clandenstines that wait for you  
penetrating the morose chairs, congealing the doors.  
To seek another land brings all the condemns reflections.  
  
And a mourning home's wind will grow you.  
I took on rabid autumns.
