An Equally Domestic Giant
-------------------------
I transform as if in front of a sordid wasteland.  
And the leaf to its deep brown lake  
and among the smooth steels the affluent one  
the aunt covered with  
romantic flesh.  
It was a thirsty business of shards of wooden and imperfect marbles.  
Developing from delirious bolt of cork.  
In my university at twilight you are like a shoreline  
and your form  
and colour the way I shine them.  
The splendor knows this,  
that life in it's ivory boxes is as endless as the stalks of cattail.  
In your mouth of loathing the jungle begins to dream of preserving.  
I wish to make a circle  
behind, and every meaning, many  
times hidden in a praise.  
Next to green water and sand-colored alcoves.  
A current of secure soul  
that does not know why it flows and lights.
