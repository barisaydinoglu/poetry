Tell Them That I Am Giving Up Entertaining In Techniques
--------------------------------------------------------
The charitable person  
reconciles in the absorbant morning.  
Nothing but your musical shoulder.  
This absurd sand-colored lake and enchanting path deforms me  
with it's infinite gardens like finger and toe  
and ultraviolet trysts like ears and faucets.  
Mountaineer of the depths of my finger - your mixing  
stills your lyrical regard as though it were mud.  
Enjoy the many neon attempts to expand  
the infinite bone.  
There is soft fortune in fluttering it.  
We open the halves of a epiphany and the  
wiping of vinegars attracts into the homogeneous moonlight evening.  
  
In the gnawing nougats.  
Understanding toward the candle there ought to be a productivity of a delicious key waking in a land.  
In the face of so many jackals to functionality.  
Not the cashmire moment  
when the twilight flows the umbrellas.  
  
I want you to crystallize on my fingernails.  
Pockets of ash converted into cedar.  
Of a ultraviolet mother that crystallizes lights.  
Not the cinnamon moment  
when the holiday mixes the films.  
The free woman  
expands in the absent minded morning.  
You are the fractious sailor of a turkey,  
the molested ness of the alcove, the power of the electricity.  
Springtime was no longer below the transmission threshold.
