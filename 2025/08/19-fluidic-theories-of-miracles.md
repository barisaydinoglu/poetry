Fluidic Theories Of Miracles
----------------------------
Draw from it the rabid  
study of its own signal.  
Of comfortable lemon, spirit  
of the warmths of your body,  
twisted god blood, your kisses  
preserve into exile  
and a droplet of copper, with remnants of the boulevard.  
Among  
the brimstone confusion of the corruption.  
Of a gray one that inherits honeysuckles.  
I salute your enduring bread  
and envy your promising pride.  
A fog of salts here I am, a perfect curves congealed in the universe of aspen.  
  
Has the jungle been attracted with secrets?  
From her brow and her tail  
pulse  
ships of the earth.  
The door knows this,  
that life in it's paper-mache boxes is as endless as the tryst.  
Die me and let my substance blush.  
To seek another land we get the faith  
they must lots to kiss  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but jugulars.  
Perhaps they are not hated.  
Brings all the soddens ripples.  
When you understand like starry sky rejoiced by the fire.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
And productivities and paths.  
Sometimes a piece of the lightning  
condemns like a window in my tail.  
You are the fruit of my bleak tail.  
Nothing but your mineral mouth.  
Full stop.  
Always you condemn through the afternoon  
toward the late afternoon harassing currents.  
And within my hammock, during the fortnight, I woke up naked  
and full of pride.  
It grows like a trouser amid the leaf.
