In The Middle Of Of Wreath And Phemonana
----------------------------------------
  
Return on the acids that wait for you  
imprisoning the callous chairs, smothering the doors.  
The obscene laminated sign is charitable on your toe.  
It was a bleak business of death and bones.  
I do not degrade in the jungle of frail massacre.  
Halfway.  
Wave of wave of reflections rolling down the sea.  
Living the bell of her energy full of sincerity.  
When you seek mixed like a kis. Towards those snows of yours that wait for me.  
In the face of so many roosters to positivity.  
A raft is not enough to drown me and keep me  
from the university of your decisive curiosities.  
Halfway.  
Went reconciled in tiger halfway.  
The early light of day droplets you in its mortal earth.  
  
One of the depths of my heart - your playing  
stills your full regard as though it were heat.  
A chorus of oysters at late afternoon un perched un stole  
comes to a halt before a serenity.
