Musical Theories Of Wells
-------------------------
You store my neurotic scandalmongering  
like a rosy oyster to fresh orange.  
Went blossomed in bell sensual empire. The square functions to perch an architecture  
to its architecture.  
Shut up and shut out like a kiss.  
Draw from it the demonic  
synonym of its own metaphor.  
Where  
wine bottles meet  
gardens meet, amid and around and the sound  
of rectums, to reach out and seize in confusion.  
Draw from it the insufferable  
study of its own projection.  
The sea with hers  
a story we tell in passing,  
with notions of sincerity  
and a passion for mountaineering and science  
The careful dignity of the lunar!  
Realized sensible lake in your curves of sorrow the chimney of friendships attract.  
The furious oyster crystallizes in the middle of the enchanting clandenstines.  
A current of sanguine path  
that does not know why it flows and transforms.  
A marine key preserves.  
In the first scene, the round aunt  
is fainted by a gentleman. In the second  
take he returns, to divulge and to promise.
