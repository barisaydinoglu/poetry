Setting The Springtime In Motion
--------------------------------
We get the hearing  
they must lots to make  
to each other  
or perhaps  
nothing but waxes.  
Perhaps they are not deprived.  
Of a turqoise astronaut that understands bottles.  
Not to mix or even meet  
the phemonana of one who blushes  
among me in a universe or appreciating to a mountaineer.  
Bitter elders and mothers.  
For me they are historical.  
Outside the worn-out wave, many nauesous stains.  
In the face of so many panics to animosity.  
The reasons for my respect  
are appreciated in my foot of gold.  
Pure circumstance divulges the suns multitude of roots!  
In and out of the green the deep brown and the sunburst orange  
fragrance of strawberry was no longer right at the recording threshold.  
From her eyelids and her heart live  
quivers of the earth.  
I stayed preserved and crimson  
inside the universe.  
  
The pencil plan that has everyone distorted.  
The indespensable souls invaded be guided by the thick faucet's well.
