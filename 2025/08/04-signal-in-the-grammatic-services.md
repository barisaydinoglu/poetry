Signal In The Grammatic Services
--------------------------------
A current of hidden lunar  
that does not know why it flows and responds.  
Some fashion but I recover your steel like forest.  
Full stop.  
Nothing but your blazing ears.  
A chorus of birds at afternoon un pulsed un struck  
comes to a halt before a dew.  
Sometimes a piece  
of the earth  
abducts like a river bank in my brain.  
From her mouth and her nose mix  
fellowships of the earth.  
And the river to its mosaic  
and among the mirrors the warm one  
the stranger covered with absent minded garden.  
  
The salt knows this,  
that life in it's ceramic boxes is as endless as the sun.  
You are the chaotic gentleman of a crab,  
the barbaous ness of the ribbon, the power of the heat.  
To seek another land fewer and  
fewer  
bury about another mode of happiness.  
The I in momentum like lards changing behind utensils.  
  
Of a turqoise child that begins affections.  
The twilight forests you in its mortal lava.
