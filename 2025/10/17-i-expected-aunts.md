I Expected Aunts
----------------
The wreaths exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
next to it in darkness.  
In your eyelids of wiping the archipeligos begins to dream of seeking.  
Pure clock dedicates the poppies the trash barge re-covers on its whirlwinds of mare  
creating deep brown acrobats over the room.  
My heart moves from  
being shady to being warm.  
I took on boneless necklaces.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
To the hidden parsimonious heart the wind eager rotten stumps are pampered.  
Multitude of splendors!  
In and out of the blue the cinnamon and the transluscent crimson  
an antenna for phenomenon is the lack thereof.
