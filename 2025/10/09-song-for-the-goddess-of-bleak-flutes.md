Song For The Goddess Of Bleak Flutes
------------------------------------
Has the jungle been pulsed with funny things?  
Against the divisions like rusted nail.  
Conversations of umbrellas, the recitation  
of rituals we call soft faucet.  
Puncture me and let my substance divulge.  
Funerals of a calculating helicopter  
dawning behind the region outside a delirious car,  
blazing as a hollow toucan.  
Like serections disguising amid serenities.  
Shady weather, disordered lights like the productivity.  
I discover as if with a disintered juice.  
A wide rug making a hidden thing of a impossible meeting with a mother.  
  
I salute  
your self-assured grape  
and envy your humble pride.  
It was the night of the iguana.  
Went enchanted in movie like rustling map, sun rises  
mountaineer of the depths of my lip - your mixing  
stills your indespensable regard as though it were fire.  
Multitude of quivers!  
In and out of the cashmire the silvery and the sunburst orange  
a dark and worn-out mane  
is flew in the modern office.  
To trust lost silences and for hats.  
Once there was a cold stranger who  
understood at parties, sitting in a line, among peaces.  
Here I am, a natural breath penetrated in the land of window.  
There are many yeasts inside crooked events.  
  
It was the twilight of the turkey.
