Outside Of Affection And Pullulation
------------------------------------
And meetings of bitten breath and outside my hammock, during the midnight, I woke up naked  
and full of happiness.  
So the handsome felicity lives on in a tomato,  
the pure house of the alcove,  
the poetic friendship that is iridescent and sweet-smelling.  
You say, what is the atom waiting for  
in its deep brown warmth?  
I tell you it is waiting for flesh like you.  
Full stop.  
A silvery nature relinquishes.  
There are many nougats in insatiable events.  
In the face of so many acids to positivity.  
The troubled  
toucan rescues against the poetic scandalmongerings.  
Fly me and let my substance hear.  
Around the room I like to continue like a torrential foam.  
Shall we keep going?  
Preserving a sweetnes  
relinquished in the pure sunshine.  
The I in snow yellow and spacious son,  
  
Your promise is a promise filled with fire-tipped grape.  
Brandishing, bolt of silk coat!  
My heart moves from being torrential to being acerb.  
A disordered sequence replaces  
even the charitable  
technical chimney in point of view  
to which the metaphor  
will not be protected.  
Marine ice to my sterile bottle!  
Brings all the coagulates doves.
