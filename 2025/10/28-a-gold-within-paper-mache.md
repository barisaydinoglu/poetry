A Gold Within Paper-mache
-------------------------
Noone here is waiting for the next femininity.  
Kiss. You crystallized yourself for building.  
Of vertical wine, spirit  
of the schools,  
prosecuted goddess blood, your kisses  
gather into exile  
and a droplet of bolt  
of diamond, with remnants of the divisions.  
Shut up and shut up like a land.  
In the first take, the sensible fisherman  
is dropped by a sailor.  
In the second  
reel he returns, to enrich and to awaken.  
If I could form the beast and the room.  
Sometimes a piece of the sky  
wipes like a flute in my arm.  
Not chirping is  
a form of imbuing.  
Cold fires of a boney ship  
living in front of the thicket outside a harsh boat,  
poetic as a silent jaguar.  
The boulevard amid hers  
a tale we tell in passing,  
with notions of purity  
and a passion for computer science and mountaineering
