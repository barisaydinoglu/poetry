Public Antennae Are All Within Us
---------------------------------
As if to abhor or reflect or impale.  
Expanded and then lighted in the sea.  
Rejoicing from wounded cedar.  
Wave of wave of phemonanas rolling down the sea.  
With the mane of the chimney where you sleep,  
a dream cracks into signals.  
Wave of wave of cathedrals rolling down the sea.  
You connect headlong into a university to appreciate your business.
