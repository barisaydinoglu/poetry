The Anger Of The Individual Narrative
-------------------------------------
  
Build on the nails that wait for you  
dying the melancholy chairs, plaguing the doors.  
On what furious eternities lighted with wind?  
What curiosities does the tiger contain?  
How little we imbue and how much it fashions the epiphany of this universe.  
I'm the daughter to the elixir of immediate autumn.  
And you gnawn in the panic and carried a deforming coffin.  
You are the hushed elder of a squirrel,  
the neurotic ness of the thread, the power of the earth.  
The laminated sign connects in waking your fingernails.  
Here I am,  
a slender lip deceived in the land of momentum.  
In the face of so many pins to animosity.  
An odor has fluttered behind the perfume,  
a mixture of polyp and body, a dawning  
starry sky that brings fear.
