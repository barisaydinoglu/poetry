Gentlemen Of A Fragmented Country
---------------------------------
I salute your original  
apple  
and envy your aromatic pride.  
I re-cover as if with a rustling extinction.  
In my archipeligos at twilight you are like a lemon  
and your form and colour the way I begin them.  
The fortnight  
acrobats you in its mortal clay.  
And a whirlwinds of starlight's heat will make you.  
In the first take, the steady pioneer  
is faltered by a bride. In the second  
scene he returns, to form and to store.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
blush of propellers and necklaces  
and the pure keys of his native land?  
I was without doubt the aunt iguana  
there in the phosphorus sea.  
When it looked me with its arcane peace eyes  
it had neither brain nor heart  
but diamond energies on its sides.  
  
In your breath of agony the universe of femininities gather.  
Because I love you, love, around the earth and within the lava.  
The lightning  
musical  
oxides are attacked.  
It re-covers like a miracle inside the atom.
