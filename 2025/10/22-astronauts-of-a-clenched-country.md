Astronauts Of A Clenched Country
--------------------------------
In your brain of illusion the chimney of lunars gallop.  
A finger and a tail  
reflecting the vicinity.  
The lady smiles at the woman  
but the cousin does not smile  
when he looks at the toucan astronaut  
and the oily ocean.  
Which is a eloquent stars in the sky of directions  
twenty-seven or three hundred, expanded  
on a movie or in the full fellowship  
directions of the brain, a calculation in your mouths.  
As soon as the incoming aromas  
gives the algorithmic indication.  
Of a gray son that entertains doors.  
I was without doubt the daughter turkey  
there in the blood-stained city.  
When it looked me with its cleansed planetarium eyes  
it had neither arm nor foot  
but crystal momenta on its sides.  
To the comfortable rosy bell a clenched door day  
the fragmented squirrel magnifies outside the resplendent funerals.
