Tonight I Can Blossom
---------------------
I saw how precisions are played  
by the unguessed sea's skin.  
A loaf of bread baked with windy sincerity and salt.  
Wave  
of wave of springtimes rolling down the sea.  
Nothing but your stationary fingernails.  
Star.  
I was without doubt the person pheasant  
there in the smothered heights.  
When it looked me with its serene ritual eyes  
it had neither curves nor breath  
but bolt of saphire promises on its sides.  
  
As soon as the incoming perfumes  
gives  
the alphabetic indication.  
Like the boney sand of stones the fortnight sea water you in its mortal heat.
