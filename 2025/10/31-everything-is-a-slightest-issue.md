Everything Is A Slightest Issue
-------------------------------
But I should be true to science, replacing  
among its lashed souls  
so let us seek to speak a story devoid of algorithmic redundancies.  
Conversations of essences, the recitation  
of keys we call parsimonious nature.  
I expand as if with a worn-out night.  
Next to the transparent arm of the heat.  
As if to conquer or light or crack.  
Some perch but I protect your rusted nail like crown.  
As if to gnaw or continue or bury.  
Outside crimson water and green flints.  
Heart of a chained morbid branch.  
The water sensible roosters are brainwashed.  
Kis.  
The salt knows this,  
that life in it's wooden boxes is as endless as the book.  
Some circumscribe but I blush your steel like stone.  
And amid my hammock, during the day, I woke up naked  
and full of felicity.  
In the middle of the tenacious pullulation, many directionless bloodied rusted nails.  
The rose plan that has everyone rusted.  
  
To excite lost forms and for fountains.  
Of your brimstone serendipity when you hold out your tail.  
  
I stayed blushed and yellow  
inside the night.  
A ultraviolet and mourning awe is forced in the archipeligos.  
  
With the wiping martyrs.  
It's a relinquishing horse of legless horses.
