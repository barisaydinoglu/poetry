Every Sailor Is A Study

Which is a resolute awe of directions  
three hundred or thousand, performed  
on a quiver or in the angellic stars in the sky  
directions of the fingernails, a calculation in your shoulders. My resolute tail magnifies you always.  
Our new book, our slender  
breakfast quadrangles.  
Pockets of clay converted into gem.  
It was the lunchtime of the squirrel.  
You are the apple of my lonely eyelids.

And the shoreline to its stone  
and among the friendships the profound one  
the child covered with resolute lighthouse.  
The I in coral the afternoon stones you in  
its mortal clay.  
And outside my hammock, during the midnight, I woke up naked  
and full of respect.  
Nothing but that warmth of your body of planetariums.  
  
The cadaver flies on its decadent mare  
forming cashmire paths over the jungle.  
Behind the throttling salivas.  
  
It was the morning of the crab.  
My heart moves from being crooked to being starry.  
But the tiger pulsed the memory.  
And threads and marine cars.  
Honeysuckle of a overflowed sordid saxophone.  
Transluscent sand-colored and delicious son,
