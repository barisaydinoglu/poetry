I Have Gone Attracting
----------------------
Frail  
midnight and the clenched phemonana  
coagulate at the walls of my house.  
Someone here is waiting for the next current.  
Railroad track. You shone yourself for developing.  
The pure times froze neither  
bird feather nor heart nor turqoise  
nor green but marine.  
Great, ceramic well!  
Sometimes a piece of the clay  
executes like a perfume in my leg.  
An odor has refreshed against the curtain,  
a mixture of massacre and body, a drinking  
warmth that brings anger.  
As if to coagulate or build or condemn.  
I could recover heart, wounded soldier, and lightning  
from laminated signs and threads  
with a brimstone well  
with cubicles in my arm.  
  
All sweetness become pamphlets.  
Full stop.  
  
You are going  
to ask where are the fill?  
And the serendipidous knaves?  
And the sun thick splattering its gardens and throttling them full of  
university and tiger?  
Outside the boulevard like iron.
