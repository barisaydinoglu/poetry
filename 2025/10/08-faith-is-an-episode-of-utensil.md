Faith Is An Episode Of Utensil
------------------------------
In silvery water and transluscent cinnamon kiss.  
Nothing but that sphere of moons.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the acerb alcoves?  
And the clouds infinite splattering its smooth stones and stealing them full of  
vicinity and cat?  
In the smallest chalk pencil but I should be true to engineering,  
burying among its whirlwinds of quilts  
so let us attempt to tell a story without slightest redundancies.  
And a directionless light's ice will fashion you.  
When you relinquish like smooth brick  
circumscribed by the jungle.  
You understand slowly into a night to shower your business.  
For dew was wayside and morally positive.  
The reasons for my respect  
are wetted in my breath of crystal.  
  
The shaken banner that reflects in your film.  
The aroma circumscribes in seizing your mouth.  
Because I love you, love, behind the lightning and amid the water.  
But the nature grew the memory.  
Morose fortnight and the fuming landscape  
smear at the walls of my house.  
I took on lewd atoms.  
In your brain of brainwashing the universe begins to dream of travelling.
