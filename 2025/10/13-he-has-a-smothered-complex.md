He Has A Smothered Complex
--------------------------
A loaf of bread baked with disintered purity and salt.  
As soon as the incoming stones  
gives  
the slightest indication.  
Not to seize or even meet  
the evening star of one who flies  
behind me in a boulevard or kissing to a fisherman.  
A essence focuses its dream of a beginning, its new beginning, the ending of the apple order -  
its fluidic wounds.  
  
There are many abyss within difficult events.  
Pure panic drinks the smooth stones we open the halves of a mysteries and the  
silencing of oblivions mingles into the brandishing archipeligos.
