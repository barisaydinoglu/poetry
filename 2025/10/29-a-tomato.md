A Tomato
--------
A chorus of iguanas at morning un enriched un filtered  
comes to a halt before a lunar.  
A ears and a hips  
rescuing the area.  
With its oily form the sticky propeller that continues in your cactus.  
She is inside us at this moment of first recovering.  
A serenity focuses its dream of a old ending, its new ending, the beginning of the tree order -  
its sensual invasions.  
Nothing but that jar of horses.  
  
I'd do it for the breakfast in which you begin  
for the eddies of marine you've enriched.  
Nobody here is waiting for the next rose.  
Droplet. You drank yourself for transforming.
