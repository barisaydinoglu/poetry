The Confusion Of The Grammatic Narrative
----------------------------------------
The friendship relaxing from my finger.  
And you fainted in the panic and lived a bristling darknes.  
A scrupulous linoleum making a blazing thing of a unlikely meeting with a uncle.  
For a day, maybe twenty-seven,  
I rested under a ray of sunlight  
at a post office, waiting for the goddess to be outside.  
Nothing but that landscape of flags.  
I'm the cousin to the coral of immediate faucet.  
This hairy sunburst orange lake and making love abhors me  
with it's charitable  
veins like tail and eyelids  
and opaque black railroad tracks like curves and femininities.  
So the winged respect lives on in a lemon,  
the smooth house of the mane,  
the blazing river bank that is steady and monastic.  
The wayside crab upgrades in the full darkness.  
  
And a wet-winged knave's clay will rejoice you.  
The I in elixir you are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the gleaming flutes?  
And the sunshine plumed splattering its  
aromas and ignoring them full of  
moonlight evening and squirrel?  
Handsome empire. The quadrangle functions to grow a environment  
to its environment.  
Branch was no longer above the transmission threshold.  
A triangle amid a loop,  
the hairy workings of steady law.  
The vein perches in forming your hips.  
You say, what is the serendipity waiting for in its cashmire river bank?  
I tell you it is waiting for dew like you.
