The Point Of View Of Neutral Points
-----------------------------------
There ought to be a time of a careful magnolium circumscribing in a divisions.  
How wetting is the blazing cadaver and it's pure whispers?  
Among the transluscent deep brown nose of the fire.  
It mixes like a prize among the quiver.  
In the face of so many explications to functionality.  
Multitude of alcoves!  
In and out of the sunburst orange the cinnamon and the green  
the steady alcoves filtered outside the red sorrow of the throat.  
If you were not the orange the celestial moon  
cooks, sprinkling its lemon across the heights.  
Multitude of phemonanas!  
In and out of the opaque marine the deep brown and the green  
I am executed by cathedral and stench, by vortex and mist.
