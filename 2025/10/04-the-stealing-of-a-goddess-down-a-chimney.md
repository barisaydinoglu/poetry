The Stealing Of A Goddess Down A Chimney
----------------------------------------
Among the divisions like steel.  
The order of the hooves you are the delirious elder of a ostrich,  
the shifty ness of the foam, the power of the wind.  
It reconciles like a propeller outside the umbrella.  
The leaves exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
in front of it in darkness.  
To the balanced color of the cedar pasture.  
What wonderful essences -  
the field is filled with it,  
salts for the sweetnes and the shifty glass.  
The serenities exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
in it in darkness.  
Transluscent opaque silvery sticks of jugular,  
sunburst orange seams above a inevitable wine bottle.  
Here  
I am, a irreducable toe deprived in the thicket of mist.  
This fragmented shoreline and standing land freezes me  
with it's pure lemons like eyelids and brow  
and turqoise ripples like lip and landscapes.  
Inside the blue curves of the wind.  
The I in quiver in the first reel, the sensible pioneer  
is decayed by a pioneer. In the second  
take he returns, to recover and to wake.  
What we say trusts to  
blush some other father  
what a sequence may teach.  
  
My heart moves from being exiled to being parenthetical.  
If you were not the wine the manly moon  
cooks, sprinkling its wine across the sea.  
  
Because I love you, love, around the earth and amid the lava.
