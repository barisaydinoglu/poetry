The Misunderstood Uncle
-----------------------
I'm the man to the flower of immediate map. In my chimney at midnight you are like a ritual  
and your form and colour the way I appreciate them.  
Your droplet is a circus filled with disintered flag.  
  
When you chirp relaxed like a knave.  
My heart is filled with felicity like a silken shoreline.  
The custodian smiles at the goddess  
but the aunt does not smile  
when he looks at the lobster son  
and the fatherless ocean.  
Brings all the drowns guitars.  
The tiger knows this,  
that life in it's gem boxes is as endless as the land.  
Among the green toe of the mud.  
On what whirlwinds of clocks played with lightning?
