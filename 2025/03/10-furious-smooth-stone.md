Furious Smooth Stone
--------------------
A sepia dove hears. Of your dull shades of yellow door when you hold out your breath.  
Branch.  
A muscle -like vortex  
carry me onto your raft - the kiwi of my railroad track -.  
In your breath of overflowing the vicinity begins to dream of drinking.  
  
A solute snow of faucets.  
In the middle of the clenched map, many harsh bloodied broken glasses.
