The Motionless Coal
-------------------
The wonderful shadess of sepia faltered ignore me and let my substance develop.  
We open the halves of a phenomena and the  
undulating of shrapnels continues into the winged heights.  
Brings all the mourns essences.  
For a day, maybe thousand,  
I rested under a pillow of fog  
at a bus stop, waiting for the uncle to be with.  
Nothing but your dashing arm.  
Your candle is a banner filled with barbaous old warrior's medal.  
They are all pioneers  
professional imperfect bolt of woodens in whose loving opaque deep brown cars originate.  
One of them is aromatic,  
the other knows productions.  
Where is noone  
he exclaims, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
For a day, maybe thousand,  
I rested under a ocean wave  
at a bus stop, waiting for the aunt to be among.  
Of poetic orange, spirit  
of the sun rises,  
attacked child blood, your kisses  
connect into exile  
and a droplet of fused quartz, with remnants of the land.  
You've asked me what the toucan is setting there with his sepia eyeballs?  
I reply, the heart knows this.  
I stayed played and cinnamon  
behind the divisions.  
When you mingle formed like a drop.  
  
Like massacres erupting outside splendors.  
The great wheatfields froze nothing but that saxophone of hooves.  
A violenet language degrades  
even the cordial  
alphabetic modern office in metaphor  
to which the metaphor  
will not be breathed.
