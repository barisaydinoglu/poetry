Since The End Of Dropping
-------------------------
  
Preserve on the nougats that wait for you  
changing the crooked chairs, ignoring the doors. Winged, silk jar!  
Shut out and pulled out like a path.  
When you rise enchanted like a tree.  
So the full wonder lives on in a cherry,  
the hopeful house of the law,  
the angellic laminated sign that is eloquent and changeless.  
Full stop.  
Went returned in necklace a sequence refreshes,  
cracks - it does not return.  
You see foot as poetic as the fog.  
  
Not rustling is a form of returning.  
It was the early light of day of the jaguar.  
A muzzled study  
invades  
even the arcane  
grammatic land in metaphor  
to which the metaphor  
will not be swam.  
In the springtime of the city where you sleep,  
a dream wets into calculations.  
  
It was the late afternoon of the turkey.  
Outside deep brown water and sepia old warrior's medals.  
Planetarium of a erupted nauesous flute.  
Some rejoice but I continue your clay like wheatfield.  
In your tail of animosity the land of evening stars relinquish.  
Pockets of sand converted into crystal.  
A square  
behind a tetrahedron,  
the neurotic workings of serendipidous law.  
  
I enrich  
as if outside a sifted cubicle.  
Not to blush or even meet  
the flint of one who re-covers  
against me in a university or rustling to a child.
