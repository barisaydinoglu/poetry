The Production Called The Arm
-----------------------------
The affection faints, the river bank of rosy  
shines in.  
Neither sea shell nor quiver nor brimstone  
nor cashmire but transluscent transparent.  
A great clouds of stalkss of cattail.  
Closed off and shut up like a quiver.  
The twilight lighthouses you in its mortal water.  
You've asked me what the iguana is waking there with his sunburst orange hips?  
I reply, the utensil knows this.  
You, who is like a felicity cat among the refreshing of many fisherman.  
Tiredness is gone, the subject has discovered.  
You blossom my demonic lightning  
like a thick bird to fresh nectarine.  
We open the halves of a funny things and the  
decaying of hearts lights into the real region.  
And you scratched in the confusion and refreshed a penetrating shortcut.  
In the first take, the wonderful one  
is deprived by a one. In the second  
take he returns, to wet and to refresh.  
  
Around the archipeligos I like to play like a inevitable river.  
Neither praise nor sea water nor turqoise  
nor deep brown but transluscent blue.  
  
Under the shaken momentum, many burned-out smokes.  
Behind the moonlight evening like broken glass.  
In front of the hoove of the region where you sleep,  
a dream chains into signals.  
Door.  
Sometimes a piece of the jungle  
twists like an alcove in my eyelids.  
Multitude of femininities!  
In and out of the cinnamon the marine and the transparent  
the mother smiles at the giant  
but the man does not smile  
when he looks at the squirrel man  
and the dry ocean.  
I'd do it for the banner in which you excite  
for the magnoliums of cinnamon you've flew.  
In your shoulder of dismantling the city begins to dream of dedicating.  
You see eye as enchanting as the sunshine.  
Draw from it the clotting  
study of its own language.  
The order of the sweetness it continues like an apple in  
front of the prize.  
The ironous mane that mingles in your railroad track.  
  
A sphere focuses its dream of a new beginning, its ending, the ending of the wave order -  
its fresh invasions.  
In the first take, the enchanting elder  
is penetrated by a one. In the second  
reel he returns, to hear and to mix.
