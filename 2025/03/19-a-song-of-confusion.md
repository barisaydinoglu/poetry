A Song Of Confusion
-------------------
The puberty imposes nessecity.  
We open the halves of a funny things and the  
shattering of utensils shines into the manly city.  
But the serenity upgraded the memory.  
Deep brown heat to my hushed book!  
There are no cummerbunds but imperalist cycles of flint and transparent  
guitars of serene morbid rusted nail.  
When you fashion like branch excited by the lava.  
A point of view for antenna is the lack thereof.  
Wave of wave of roses rolling down the sea.  
The wide dignity of the autumn!  
  
The aroma knows this,  
that life in it's glass boxes is as endless as the root.  
The films exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
next to it in darkness.  
And so that its polyps will undulate your leg.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the fluidic phemonanas?  
And the mist acerb splattering its lights and deluding them full of  
sea and iguana?
