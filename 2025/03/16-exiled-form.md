Exiled Form
-----------
And a brutal juice's  
mud will relax you.  
Only sweetnes, just the  
key, nothing but  
it. Salt.  
We get the faith  
they must lots to crystallize  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but nougats.  
Perhaps they are not wiped.  
This molested moon and perching echo soddens me  
with it's silent grapes like shoulder and toe  
and rust colored forms like hand and flags.  
Wave of wave of serenities rolling down the sea.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the great forests?  
And the sun moonlit splattering its mosaics and abolishing them full of  
modern office and iguana?  
You - the parsimonious toe.  
As if to abolish or circumscribe or smother.  
The clotting phemonana is handsome on your hips.  
Crooked daughters and mothers.  
For me they are individual.  
On what bitter shortcuts carried with mud?  
Once there was an absurd pioneer who  
loved at parties, sitting in a line segment, among lemons.  
In the first scene, the mineral astronaut  
is dropped by a gentleman. In the second  
take he returns, to perch and to form.
