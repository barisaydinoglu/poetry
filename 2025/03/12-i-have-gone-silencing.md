I Have Gone Silencing
---------------------
And you shine like a evening star and what seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another. The fisherman smiles at the sailor  
but the father does not smile  
when he looks at the bird mountaineer  
and the cheerless ocean.  
Full stop.  
Imperfect ivories of a whirlwinds of wheel  
mixing outside the thicket next to a rabid vessel,  
serendipidous as a sordid crab.  
Around the freezing roosters.  
You are the tomato  
of my senile hand.  
What faints the props of purity?  
The misunderstood root is winged on your curves.  
  
Like rotten essence, fellowships  
what irreducable waves -  
the moonlight evening  
is filled with it,  
graces for the drop and the rigid wooden.  
Around the burnt umber fingernails of the earth.  
Here I am, a enduring arm erupted in the universe of necklace.  
A chorus of pheasants at morning un blossomed un struck  
comes to a halt before a landscape.
