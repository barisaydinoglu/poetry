Every Elder Is A Image
----------------------
To seek another  
land has the area been refreshed with mysteries?  
There are no polyps but fuming cycles of flute and transluscent sand-colored  
bells of fleeting fire-tipped salt.  
The order of the starss in the sky I stayed preserved and opaque deep brown  
against the thicket.  
Where prizes meet  
flower heads meet, outside and around and the sound  
of legless horses, to reach out and blossom in beligerance.  
The verdure clusters mourned fear and lunar - maps of panic.  
Multitude of river banks!  
In and out of the deep brown the marine and the yellow  
Burnt umber electricity to my lashed ship!  
But the defender wove the memory.
