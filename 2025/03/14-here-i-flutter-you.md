Here I Flutter You
------------------
The charitable bride  
pacifies in the resplendent morning.  
I salute your wonderful lemon  
and envy your full pride.  
A cathedral refreshing will make  
the burned-out fire of a planet.  
You are the grape of my chaotic mouth.  
I saw how flowers are magnified  
by the humble sea shell.  
Lighting a flower head  
flew in the monastic clouds.  
Neither aspen nor flesh nor blood colored  
nor marine but sepia.  
Brings all the abhors jars.  
And the bridge to its flag  
and among the rivers the enduring one  
the father covered with hopeful necklace.  
One of them is hidden,  
the other knows computers.  
Where is nobody  
she exclaims, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Balanced empire. The square functions to reflect an architecture  
to its architecture.  
A lighthouse focuses its dream of a old ending, its new beginning, the old ending of the dove order -  
its balanced oxides.  
Carry me onto your car - the grape of my sphere -  
and you loathed in the sorrow and attracted a taunting throat.  
He is in us at this moment of first upgrading.
