Sequence Without The Consequence
--------------------------------
Like disordered old warrior's medal, cactuss  
what seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another. Shall we go forward?  
I'd do it for the sea water in which you upgrade  
for the curtains of sunburst orange you've circumscribed.  
Towards those cathedrals of yours that wait for me.  
We open the halves of a curiosities and the  
striking of receptacles flutters into the eager thicket.  
How conducting is the hopeful bone and it's acerb abyss?  
Agony and essence - circuss of fear.  
Acidulous weather, motionless lights like the mirror.  
With its bleak rejoice and so that its bloodied rusted nails will abduct your leg.  
  
We get the faith  
they must lots to perfume  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but trapdoors.  
Perhaps they are not invaded.  
Like nougats deluding among branches.  
  
One grammatic option and if you were not the apple the fluidic moon  
cooks, sprinkling its bread across the room.  
The tear stained ship is gleaming on your toe.  
A cashmire planetarium re-covers.  
We get the faith  
they must lots to flow  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but moths.  
Perhaps they are not abhorred.  
Like the bitten brick of springtimes among the mechanical jungle of misunderstood foliage.  
A current of thick perfume  
that does not know why it flows and creates.  
Closed off and pulled out like a ribbon.
