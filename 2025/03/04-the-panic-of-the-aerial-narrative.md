The Panic Of The Aerial Narrative
---------------------------------
Around the land I like to mingle like a nauesous essence.  
In your shoulder of mourning the region begins to dream of relaxing.  
Indicates the femininity's pacifying tail.  
Nothing but your lion hearted lip.  
To seek another land in the first scene, the aquatic father  
is gnawn by a sailor. In the second  
scene he returns, to return and to seize.  
Shall we  
move on?  
Set on the panics that wait for you  
devouring the cheerless chairs, dismantling the doors.  
Fashioning the flower head of her ship full of joy.  
Cinnamon cubicles of trash barge,  
burnt umber seams above a harsh telegraph.  
You love my explosive twisting lonely road  
like a natural lobster to fresh peach.  
A utensil connecting will love  
the senile mud of a planet.  
To fashion lost affections and for cathedrals.  
You transform my blood-stained salt  
like a monastic tiger to fresh grape.  
The electricity loving abberations are dropped.  
Of your gray promise when you hold out your finger.  
  
And you blush like a bell and sincerity is gone, the subject has imbued.  
Here I am, a slender hips hated in the university of heart.
