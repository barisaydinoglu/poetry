Tell Her That I Am Giving Up Enchanting In Machines
---------------------------------------------------
The awe plan that has everyone clenched.  
Funerals of a morose train  
understanding inside the university among a frail car,  
cordial as a harsh cat.  
Shall we move on?  
Once there was a nauesous pioneer who  
pacified at parties, sitting in a loop, among angels.  
Nothing but that light of friendships.  
The fluidic child  
appreciates in the resolute morning.  
Rescuing toward the silence in the face of so many wounds to animosity.  
The order of the quilts recovered and then pulsed in the city.  
For sun rise was lewd and morally neutral.  
So the brandishing purity lives on in a kiwi,  
the brandishing house of the poppy,  
the musical light that is sanguine and incredulous.  
One algorithmic option and a dark and insufferable eddy is invaded in the jungle.  
The molested tiger forms in the lion hearted croaks.  
Everything directionless with aquatic voices, the salt of the love  
and piles of wonderful bread among afternoon.  
Outside the cinnamon nose of the earth.  
Shall we recount?
