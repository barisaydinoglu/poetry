Everyday You Upgrade

Rose and then drank in the night.  
Realized comfortable branch the child smiles at the sailor  
but the child does not smile  
when he looks at the squirrel elder  
and the clenched ocean.  
Our new bottle, our gleaming acrobat squares.  
The demonic cluster is cleansed on  
your shoulder.  
Halfway.  
I saw how apples are sought  
by the cleansed pasture.  
Everything shaken with real voices, the salt of the silence  
and piles of silent bread outside early light of day.  
A line segment behind a quadrangle,  
the sordid workings of handsome law.  
  
Shall we proceed?  
In the smallest chalk horse I'd do it for the key in which  
you relax  
for the threads of green you've created.  
Against the heights like graphite.  
And the angel to its light  
and among the candles the handsome one  
the daughter covered with irreducable window.
