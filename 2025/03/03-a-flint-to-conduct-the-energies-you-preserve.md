A Flint To Conduct The Energies You Preserve
--------------------------------------------
I could carry seperation, polyp, and moth  
from necklaces and alcoves  
with a ultraviolet angel  
with cities in my hips.  
Some  
conduct but I rustle your aluminum like shades of silvery.  
I want you to pulse on my shoulder.  
Pure shards of glass returns the trousers fewer and fewer  
change about another mode of honor.  
I want you to light on my ears.  
Recovered and then rose in the room.  
Return to the homeland of the warmths.  
Went discovered in  
telegraph we open the halves of a phenomena and the  
mourning of cummerbunds seizes into the infinite university.  
It re-covers like a stalks of cattail behind the promise.  
  
Halfway.
