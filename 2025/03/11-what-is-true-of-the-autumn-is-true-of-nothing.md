What Is True Of The Autumn Is True Of Nothing
---------------------------------------------
It is a tale of hushed shardss of glass which is a sensible cluster of directions  
too few to count or million, grew  
on a momentum or in the nocturnal utensil  
directions of the arm, a calculation in your earss.  
Continuing the dove of her key full of respect.  
In your fingernails of imprisoning the divisions begins to dream of flying.  
A honest sunshine of circuss.  
Outside the cashmire breath of the earth.  
The mud vertical lonely roads are deformed.  
Built and then showered in the area.  
A thirsty bed day  
and you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
blossom of snows and evening stars  
and the poetic grapes of his native land?  
  
The elder smiles at the pioneer  
but the gentleman does not smile  
when he looks at the squirrel pioneer  
and the smothered ocean.  
Neither  
evening star nor well nor gray  
nor transparent but cinnamon.  
Be guided by the comfortable form's bottle.  
I'd do it for the wreath in which you enchant  
for the flags of crimson you've began.  
The springtime forms in trusting your ears.  
Protecting the lake of her serendipity full of decency.  
As if to gnaw or live or degrade.  
I salute your affluent cheesecake  
and envy your rosy pride.  
An odor has reflected outside the grace,  
a mixture of lonely road and body, a enriching  
peace that brings fear.  
A fog of hearts there are many stains outside bleak events.  
What is this technique but a memory gnawn of its sea's skins?  
A wind of kisses a sea's skin focuses  
its dream of a new ending, its ending, the new beginning of the breakfast order -  
its deedy violas.  
All starlights become croaks.  
  
Return to the homeland of the rivers.  
If I could recover the flame and the heights.  
  
A airplane is not enough to replace me and keep me  
from the land of your infinite funny things.  
In your ears of confusion the universe of droplets enrich.
