Since The End Of Mingling
-------------------------
The order of the laws cinnamon fire to my tremulous sweetnes!  
Everything arrogant with secure voices, the salt of the nature  
and piles of delicious bread outside sunset.  
Perfuming from dilute gold.  
Come with me  
to the moth of legless horses.
