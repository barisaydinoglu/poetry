It Lived With Pullulations
--------------------------
Only apple, just the  
dove, nothing but  
it. Alcove.  
The order of the corals towards those flowers of yours that wait for me.  
Wet on the lineages that wait for you  
entangling the chaotic chairs, degrading the doors.  
A loaf  
of bread baked with nauesous sincerity and salt.  
Lion hearted empire. The line segment functions to wet an architecture  
to its system.  
In the smallest silicon river like the forceful brick of fellowships it's a playing root of salivas.  
  
The lamprey trusts on its hushed mare  
setting transparent bird feathers over the thicket.  
Enjoy the many calculating attempts to carry  
the lyrical extinction.  
There is full fortune in enriching it.  
Hidden empire. The line functions to excite an architecture  
to its environment.  
All ribbons become shortcuts.  
Force me and let my substance perch.  
And a fractious lake's electricity will re-cover you.  
  
I salute your ancient cheesecake  
and envy your pure pride.
