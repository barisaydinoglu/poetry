Towards those poppies of yours that wait for me.  
Like coffins entangling next to trysts.  
In the face of so many clefts to animosity.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
mingle of sea shells and crowns  
and the naked necklaces of his native land?  
Like the boney iron of crowns pure rooster re-covers the doors when the city is full of bitten leg  
around throats and  
furious absurd pullulations  
and the listless flower heads and the movies  
at last give forth their negligent probe.  
You rustle my ironous probe  
like a great crab to fresh nectarine.  
  
What is this point of view but a memory undulated of its jars?  
Conversations of silences, the recitation  
of trysts we call aromatic stars in the sky.  
Be guided by the noble grace's echo.  
Shut out and shut up like a propeller.  
I wish to make a line  
next to, and every meaning, many  
times hidden in a sweetnes.  
Some conduct but I weave your steel like eddy.  
Prosecute me and let my substance awaken.
