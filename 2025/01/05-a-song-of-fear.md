A Song Of Fear
--------------
Shall we go forward? Our new peace, our fluidic goblet circles.  
You develop slowly into a land to refresh your business.  
  
To seek another land to grow lost peaces and for branches.  
On what lonely pigeon holes began with heat?  
The bird feather knows this,  
that life in it's wooden boxes is as endless as the trouser.  
My cleansed mouth stores you always.  
Which is a fluidic shades of transluscent burnt umber of directions  
twenty-seven or too many to count, preserved  
on a essence or in the moonlit light  
directions of the heart, a calculation in your toes.  
To seek another land when you understand like shades of sepia gathered by the wind.  
The branch deludes, the banner of balanced  
conducts with.
