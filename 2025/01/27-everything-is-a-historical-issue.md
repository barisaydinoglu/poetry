Everything Is A Historical Issue
--------------------------------
Your silence is a splendor filled with cheerless praise. With its worn-out upgrade be guided by the electric mosaic's planetarium.  
All lakes become salts.  
When you crystallize like lake magnified by the ice.  
You are the apple of my barbaous eyeballs.  
  
I salute your verdure lemon  
and envy your indespensable pride.  
There are no lonely roads but browbeaten cycles of sea shell and sepia  
muscles of parsimonious frightened clay.  
For a day, maybe three hundred,  
I rested under a ray of sunlight  
at a bus stop, waiting for the pioneer to be in front of.  
Like trashes pampering inside serenities.  
When you return like river bank sought by the heat.  
It's a reflecting warmth of cubicles.  
Within the gray illusion of the juice.  
Tremulous roosters and worn-out utensils.  
  
A circus focuses its dream of a beginning, its new ending, the ending of the circus order -  
its incredulous corruptions.  
I am plagued by cactus and wasteland, by dung and mist.
