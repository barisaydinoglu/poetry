I Have Gone Taunting
--------------------
Outside the blood colored embarassement of the croak.  
Flowing a forest  
trod in the sanguine thunder.  
Whirlwinds of day and the harsh wave  
abduct at the walls of my house.  
Of infinite wine, spirit  
of the reflections,  
deluded sailor blood, your kisses  
form into exile  
and a droplet of fused quartz, with remnants of the room.  
  
From tornado to pillow of fog,  
hidden utensils drawn by velvety channels, a  
dead serendipity begins to seek.  
Pure trash barge relinquishes the aromas it relinquishes like a serenity next to the propeller.
