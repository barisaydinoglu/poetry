Here I Promise You
------------------
Everything frail with serene voices, the salt of the candle  
and piles of eloquent bread amid late afternoon.  
In your lip of illusion the region of suns weave.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the free  
perfumes?  
And the drizzle manly splattering its wreaths and mutating them full of  
thicket and jaguar?  
The reasons for my respect  
are played in my toe of silicon.  
Not shining is a form of hearing.
