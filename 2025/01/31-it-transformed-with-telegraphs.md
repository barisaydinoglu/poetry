It Transformed With Telegraphs
------------------------------
You are the whirlwinds of fisherman of a crab,  
the weak ness of the wreath, the power of the jungle.  
On what morose vinegars mixed with lightning?  
Enchanting empire. The square functions to re-cover a system  
to its system.  
You play in the vicinity as in a manly chimney.  
You inherit my frail stain  
like an aquatic squirrel to fresh bread.  
I salute your gleaming bread  
and  
envy your lyrical pride.  
Against the archipeligos like metal.  
Within the compounding wounds.  
In the first reel, the hopeful daughter  
is ignored by a pioneer. In the second  
reel he returns, to love and to live.  
I saw how moons are recovered  
by the poetic flower head.  
Neither stars  
in the sky nor quiver nor opaque  
gray  
nor crimson but transparent.
