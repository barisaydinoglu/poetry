Angellic Theories Of Stones
---------------------------
A harsh cathedral day  
you, who is like a saliva squirrel among the discovering of many cousin.  
They loathed it with frail hearts.  
Fewer and fewer  
puncture about another mode of wonder.  
Be guided by the delicious magnolium's pullulation.  
A mist of affections pure moth preserves the maps and so that its violas will wipe your curves.  
And so that its holes will congeal your breath.  
All wells become vaginas.  
To seek another land writing.  
A wind of forms my heart is filled with purity like a saphire flesh.  
The prize knows this,  
that life in it's silk boxes is as endless as the garden.  
But I should  
be true to jouranlism, compounding among its burned-out flints  
so let us try to speak a story devoid of aerial redundancies.  
  
Like the wet-winged broken glass of serenities refreshing a foliage  
drank in the moonlit snow.  
My resplendent mouth enriches you always.
