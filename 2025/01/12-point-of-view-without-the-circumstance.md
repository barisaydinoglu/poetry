Point Of View Without The Circumstance
--------------------------------------
To store lost stars and for aromas.  
And meetings of distorted nose like polyps  
abolishing inside graces.  
Like noises disguising in sepia cars.  
Neither elixir nor soul nor turqoise  
nor blue but cashmire.  
  
Return to the homeland of the serenities.  
On what frail errors wove with jungle?  
Like the fragmented salt of doors the receptacle imposes nessecity.  
Like juices smearing around  
flowers.
