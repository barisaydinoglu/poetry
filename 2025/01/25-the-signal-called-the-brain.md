The Signal Called The Brain
---------------------------
And a forceful jar's electricity will reflect you.  
In my room at night you are like a tryst  
and your form and colour the way I conduct them.  
There ought to be a magnolium of a somber window protecting in a city.  
I am decayed by river bank and oblivion, by lineage and fog.  
Towards those foams of yours that wait for me.  
My promising mouth builds you always.
