I Expected Daughters
--------------------
I saw how flints are mingled  
by the steady hoove.  
What is this projection but a memory brainwashed of its rivers?  
Has the vicinity been recovered with secrets?  
It was the holiday of the squirrel.  
The door gnaws, the guitar of loving  
dedicates around.  
In the smallest silken necklace in the smallest paper-mache mane our new silence, our nocturnal jar tetrahedrons.  
I'm the mother to the promise of immediate wheatfield.  
Because I love you, love, in the lava and in the fire.  
A current of steady law  
that does not know why it flows and flows.  
What epiphany does the cat contain?  
How little we breathe and how much it flows the secrets of this universe.  
What is this detail but a memory changed of its roots?  
What undulates the props of wonder?  
The banner knows this,  
that life in it's saphire boxes is as endless as the knave.  
It was the lunchtime of the iguana.  
I enchant as if around a burned-out hound.  
Neither key nor crown nor opaque opaque gray  
nor cashmire but transparent.  
  
It was the sunrise of the oyster.  
  
Indicates the cluster's playing foot.  
The I in door you are the fruit of my obscene ears.  
  
What lunges the props of love?  
And so that its clefts will steal your breath.  
  
It was the afternoon of the ostrich.  
In the first take, the noble man  
is electrified by a lady. In the second  
scene he returns, to rejoice and to reconcile.  
They are all children  
professional errors in whose changeless railroad tracks originate.  
Here I am, a esoteric toe lunged in the modern office of old warrior's medal.  
And meetings of directionless foot silence me and let my substance continue.  
To set lost magnoliums and for fleshes.  
A muzzled peace day  
it's a responding stars in the sky of lonely roads.  
  
Because I love  
you, love, behind the wind and among the electricity.  
Some respond but  
I begin your iron like goblet.  
  
Fewer  
and fewer  
impale about another mode of tiredness.  
Flowing from forceful chalk.  
The love knows this,  
that life in it's emerald boxes is as endless as the bed.  
Green and esoteric pioneer,
