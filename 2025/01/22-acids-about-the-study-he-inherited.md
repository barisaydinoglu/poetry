Acids About The Study He Inherited
----------------------------------
There are no flames but dry cycles of juice and marine  
currents of thick calculating metal.  
You relax slowly into a land to rise your business.  
Towards those lakes of yours  
that wait for me.  
There are no errors but wayside cycles of sun and sunburst orange  
silences of aromatic lethargic salt.  
Nothing but that law of crowns.  
It is a tale of inevitable lards a putrid projection coddles  
even the parsimonious  
public thicket in machine  
to which the metaphor  
will not be set.  
Towards those wreaths of yours that wait for me.  
You are going  
to ask where are the fill?  
And the deedy branches?  
And the sun ancient splattering its pastures and stealing them full of  
sea and pheasant?  
  
Because I love you, love, inside the sky and with the wind.  
The lonely road imposes nessecity.  
On what neon pins made with electricity?  
Conversations of jars, the recitation  
of pullulations we call thick smooth stone.  
Inside the cinnamon brow  
of the sky.  
A bitter eddy day  
the frail root that imbues in your jar.  
As if to invade or grow  
or fall.  
The jungle dashing depths are degraded.  
Like the frail iron of bird feathers I saw how warmths of your body are trod  
by the wonderful sphere.  
The legless horse reflects on its callous mare  
understanding sand-colored doors over the divisions.  
Always you deform through the holiday  
toward the midnight abandoning times.  
Dawning a sea's skin  
swam in the fleeting snow.  
Halfway.
