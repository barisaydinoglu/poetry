The Howl Fallen Into The Sea
----------------------------
Towards those bridges of yours that wait for me.  
Some swim but I flow your graphite like serendipity.  
Our new farm, our naked book triangles.  
There are many wounds next to harsh events.  
I wish to make a circle  
around, and every feeling, many  
times hidden in a faucet.  
Sphere.  
Pure bloodied clay transforms the fellowships it is a tale of mechanical complaints I was without doubt the gentleman lobster  
there in the phosphorus modern office.  
When it looked me with its sanguine time eyes  
it had neither eyeballs nor leg  
but diamond farms on its sides.  
Like violences burying in planetariums.
