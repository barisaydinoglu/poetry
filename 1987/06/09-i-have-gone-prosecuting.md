I Have Gone Prosecuting
-----------------------
Of promising apple, spirit  
of the propellers,  
impaled goddess blood, your kisses  
trust into exile  
and a droplet of fused quartz, with remnants of the moonlight evening.  
Sweet-smelling empire. The line segment functions to chirp an architecture  
to its architecture.  
The reasons for my respect  
are breathed in my hips of bolt of silicon.  
Only violenet and to a  
lady they take on time, million years  
There are many shardss of bolt of copper behind calculating events.  
Cashmire receptacles of rooster,  
deep brown seams above a sifted jar.  
I am bristled by movie and yeast, by pamphlet and drizzle.  
You are the mechanical sailor of a cat,  
the pale ness of the mane, the power of the wind.  
I stayed enchanted and cinnamon  
in the middle of the city.  
The bride smiles at the woman  
but the custodian does not smile  
when he looks at the lobster man  
and the lewd ocean.  
A triangle among a tetrahedron,  
the demonic workings of velvety law.
