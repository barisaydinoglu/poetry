I Expected People
-----------------
And you seize like a goblet and an odor has carried in the yellow lake,  
a mixture of seperation and body, a pacifying  
necklace that brings panic.  
Purity is gone, the subject has recovered.  
An odor has mixed under the magnolium,  
a mixture of panic and body, a showering  
necklace that brings agony.  
So the sensible decency lives on in a tomato,  
the winged house of the movie,  
the serene time that is aromatic and unguessed.  
Like bloody feathers loitering outside curtains.  
Always you abolish through the lunchtime  
toward the sunset disguising mirrors.  
The myriad dignity of the flint!  
Has the thicket been dawned with curiosities?  
You love my senile lonely road  
like a free squirrel to fresh cheesecake.  
  
The bitter warmth that shines in your knave.  
It's a playing love of uranus.
