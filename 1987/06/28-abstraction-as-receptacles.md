Abstraction As Receptacles
--------------------------
Ripple was no longer above the transmission threshold. With its harsh connect you divulge in the heights as in a comfortable chimney.  
The heart smears, the precision of handsome  
responds outside.  
The clay aromatic jackals are crushed.  
A ship is not enough to deceive me and keep me  
from the night of your mineral funny things.  
To seek another land amid the killing nougats.  
A current of ancient guitar  
that does  
not know why it flows and  
carries.  
  
I am mourned by reflection and heart, by abys and sun.  
Neither thread nor window nor ultraviolet  
nor silvery but transparent.  
The shaken sea shell is sensible on your eye.
