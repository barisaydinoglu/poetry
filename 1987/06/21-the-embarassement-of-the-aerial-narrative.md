The Embarassement Of The Aerial Narrative
-----------------------------------------
With its wounded rescue I saw how trees are magnified  
by the indespensable heart.  
Carry me onto your wheel -  
the orange of my ripple -  
Sepia and profound god,  
one grammatic option and I salute your enduring plum  
and envy your charitable pride.  
Among the sunburst orange eyelids of the earth.  
Rejoicing from  
inaccessible silken.  
This cheerless pasture and flowing elixir hates me  
with it's trusting natures like hips and shoulder  
and dull shades of green bottles like ears and ribbons.  
Around the blood colored confusion of the serection.  
Like insufferable ribbon, tigers  
carry me onto your boat - the orange of my movie -.  
  
A loaf of bread baked with worn-out wonder and salt.  
There are many jackals inside fatherless events.  
We open the halves of a phenomena and the  
pampering of trash barges lights into the hopeful sea.  
A calculation for point of view is the lack thereof.
