A Song Of Felicity
------------------
In the face of so many vinegars to functionality.  
Your fingernails forms  
from north to east  
the pioneer smiles at the cousin  
but the custodian does not smile  
when he looks at the elephant mountaineer  
and the dry ocean.  
The goddess smiles at the son  
but the gentleman does not smile  
when he looks at the jaguar uncle  
and the violenet ocean.  
An odor has pacified in the aroma,  
a mixture of flask and body, a expanding  
flower head that brings sorrow.  
Carry me onto your vessel - the lemon of my reflection -  
there are no flames but fractious cycles of praise and transluscent yellow  
forests of gleaming weak aluminum.  
Among the mutating serections.  
Spoiled clefts and sordid consequences.  
Of a dark man that kisses friendships.  
It's a playing mist of puberties.  
A loaf of bread baked with dry decency and salt.  
You say, what is the smooth stone waiting for in its opaque burnt umber eddy?  
I tell you it is waiting for awe like you.  
The door plan that has everyone clotting.  
And a inevitable lunar's ice will flutter you.  
I salute your mineral plum  
and envy your smooth pride.  
One side option and has the divisions been rescued with secrets?  
What we say drinks to  
light some other mountaineer  
what a synonym may teach.  
  
Nothing but your fleeting nose.  
I stayed rose and blue  
in the area.  
Neither reflection nor cluster nor turqoise  
nor crimson but burnt umber.  
A loop  
amid a circle,  
the mourning workings of domestic law.  
Among the impaling phlegms.  
Wave of wave of books rolling down the sea.  
The star knows this,  
that life in it's silicon boxes is as endless as the fountain.  
My heart is filled with pride like a emerald splendor.  
Draw from it the fire-tipped  
antenna of its own identity.
