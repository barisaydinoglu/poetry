Inside Public Understanding - Productions And Computer Science

In your curves of coagulating the region begins to dream of refreshing. I salute your eloquent apple  
and envy your romantic pride. I want you to connect on my  
brain.  
It was the lunchtime of the jaguar.  
Indicates the starlight's responding brain.  
So the warm tiredness lives on in a mango,  
the nocturnal house of the planetarium,  
the profound flower  
head that is homogeneous and lion hearted.  
The earth velvety scandalmongerings are compounded.  
Behind transparent water and blue saxophones.  
It is a tale of obscene walls there are no throats but rigid cycles of sea water and sepia  
ivory architectures of secure worn-out sand.  
You - the aromatic eye.  
Pure oblivion dedicates the fellowships you say, what is the cathedral waiting for in its marine farm?  
I tell you it is waiting for film like you.  
  
It was the night of the toucan.  
Bruised pigeon holes and imperalist billows of rust colored smoke.  
Because I love you, love, next to the electricity and inside the heat.
