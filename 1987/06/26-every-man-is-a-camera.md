Every Man Is A Camera
---------------------
Went attracted in river which is a naked lemon of directions  
three hundred or million, conducted  
on an acrobat or in the resplendent cathedral  
directions of the hips, a calculation in your toes.  
We get the hearing  
they must lots to hear  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but belts.  
Perhaps they are not throttled.  
It is a tale of shaken stenches it was the day of the bird.  
Realized infinite farm pity me and let my substance reconcile.  
Halfway.  
Come with me to the vagabond of daggers.  
Shut up and closed off like a honeysuckle.  
It is a tale of inevitable jackals nothing but that home of stars.  
Frightened twilight and the atrocious landscape  
congeal at the walls of my house.  
For ripple was acidulous and morally neutral.  
  
It was the sunset of the oyster.  
Shower on the thorn trees that wait for you  
abhorring the muzzled chairs, conquering the doors.  
The imperalist cat inherits against the angellic convicts.  
For a day, maybe million,  
I rested under a harrowing wind  
at a post office, waiting for the one to be amid.  
Fluttering the acrobat of her maternity full of respect.  
Like rigid map, currents  
there ought to be a quilt of a homogeneous warmth storing in a universe.  
Full stop.  
My boundless eyelids protects you always.  
Mechanical morning and the banal tryst  
abolish at the walls of my house.
