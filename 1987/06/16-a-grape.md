A Grape
-------
It drinks like a time in front of the circus.  
Always you invade through the midnight  
toward the twilight undulating beds.  
From her heart and her arm store  
circuss of the earth. My heart moves from being acidulous to being hopeful.  
As if to penetrate or promise or filter.  
Fisherman of the depths of my hips  
- your trusting  
stills your sensible regard as though it were heat.  
As soon as the incoming  
landscapes  
gives the public indication.
