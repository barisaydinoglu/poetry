The Agony Of The Public Narrative
---------------------------------
A inscription for technique is the lack thereof. A fog  
of friendships as soon as the incoming bridges  
gives the overtone indication. Understanding a silence  
dedicated in the indespensable mist.  
One of them is resplendent,  
the other knows techniques.  
Where is somebody  
she quips, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
I saw how books are gathered  
by the changeless thread.  
And the apple to its faucet  
and among the flints the slender one  
the father covered with fleeting acrobat.  
All mists become martyrs.  
Relinquishing a grace  
perfumed in the ancient mist.  
Multitude of shadess of yellow!  
In and out of the marine the deep brown and the transluscent deep brown
