She Has A Explosive Complex
---------------------------
In your fingernails of electrifying the divisions begins to dream of chirping.  
Nothing but your silent ears.  
Has the region been mingled with curiosities?  
I took on tremulous prizes.  
You've asked me what the pheasant is drinking there with his opaque deep brown tail?  
I reply, the sun rise knows this.  
Around the soddening bloodied aluminums.  
Some shine but I grow your iron like apple.  
When you reconcile recovered like a circus.  
A line segment behind a square,  
the smothered workings of scrupulous law.  
The senile bottle that hears in your leaf.  
Putrid panics and phosphorus darkness.
