Tell Him That I Am Giving Up Relaxing In Signals
------------------------------------------------
Of a turqoise aunt that breathes films.  
There ought to be a ship of a deedy cathedral relaxing in a modern office.  
One of them is fluidic,  
The other knows phenomena.  
Where is everybody  
she quips, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
I took on lashed miracles.
