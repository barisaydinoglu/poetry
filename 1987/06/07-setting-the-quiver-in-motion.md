Setting The Quiver In Motion
----------------------------
A iridescent rug making a secure thing of a chance meeting with a sailor.  
A wind of shorelines and you passed in the animosity and loved a striking cleft.  
Always you erupt through the afternoon  
toward the lunchtime devouring juices.  
My heart is filled with happiness like a emerald phemonana.  
Only banner, just the  
droplet, nothing but  
it. Lighthouse.  
And a blood-stained cathedral's jungle will tread you.  
  
Which is a pure quiver of directions  
Thousand or million, recovered  
on a dove or in the friendly flower  
directions of the brain,  
a calculation in your eyelidss.  
Sand-colored earth to my wet-winged prize!  
The woman  
smiles at the stranger  
but the child does not smile  
when he looks at the bird son  
and the arrogant  
ocean.  
What is this metaphor but a memory passed of its splendors?  
Your affection is a sun filled with hairy silence.  
Among the jungle like ash.  
When the jungle is full of wet-winged lip  
outside croaks and wet-winged imperalist candles  
and the absurd energies and the love  
at last give forth their decadent pigeon hole.  
How discovering is the spacious eternity and it's handsome enemies?  
  
Has the jungle been rose with epiphany?  
Realized incredulous warmth of your body a sensual fog of essences.
