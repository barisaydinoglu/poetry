Meeting Your Night
------------------
To seek another land and you undulated in the beligerance and began an attacking city. The faucet knows this,  
that life in it's saphire boxes is as endless as the poppy.  
A dark and rabid crown is shook in the region.  
Someone here is waiting for the next guitar.  
Trouser. You blushed yourself for blushing.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
As soon as the incoming shorelines  
gives the technical indication.  
A obscene signal shatters  
even the essential  
slightest vicinity in antenna  
to which the metaphor  
will not be woke.  
Towards those  
writings of yours that wait for me.  
It's a imbuing land of eternities.  
A fluidic clouds of spheres.  
Faint me and let my substance hear.  
The reasons for my respect  
are pulsed in my arm of chalk.  
For angel was dead and  
morally neutral.  
Brings all the dismantles lemons.  
As if to imprison  
or understand or degrade.
