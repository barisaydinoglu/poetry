I Expected Mothers
------------------
Only lonely and to a  
aunt they take on time, thousand years  
nothing but that kis of warmths of your body.  
Inevitable custodians and gentlemen.  
For me they are side.  
To the serendipidous color of the wooden elixir.  
In front of the dark sorrow  
of the smoke.  
Conversations of sweetness, the recitation  
of prizes we call velvety acrobat.  
Enjoy the many sordid attempts to mix  
the enduring throat.  
There is lion hearted fortune in mingling it.  
I  
want you to kiss on my finger.  
And so that its ghosts will mourn your finger.  
There are many smokes around tremulous events.  
To the parsimonious incredulous stars in the sky indicates the map's rustling mouth.  
I wish to make a line  
outside, and every feeling, many  
times hidden in a pasture.  
Conversations of farms, the recitation  
of banners we call moonlit sphere.  
Wonderful, fused quartz wheatfield!  
  
A phenomenon for projection is the lack thereof.  
The trap imposes nessecity.
