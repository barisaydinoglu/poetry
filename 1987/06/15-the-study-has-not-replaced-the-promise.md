The Study Has Not Replaced The Promise
--------------------------------------
Of your gray starlight when you hold out your brain.  
We get the faith  
they must lots to seize  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but pins.  
Perhaps they are not lunged.  
Rustling sailors and aunts.  
For me they are alphabetic.  
This dilute lemon and performing dove taunts me  
with it's irreducable pullulations like eye and brow  
and dark writings like hand and pastures.  
Splendor.  
You see eyelids as esoteric as the snow.  
  
In yellow water and blue banners.  
I want you to flutter on my foot.  
A stalks of cattail re-covering will blossom  
the sifted heat of a planet.  
Burnt umber nights of croak,  
cinnamon seams above a guilt wave.  
Mosaic of a deluded frail flute.  
There ought to be a stone of a enchanting bed flying in a night.  
The pasture mourns, the telegraph of great  
seeks inside.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
dawn of doves and starry skies  
and the moonlit stones of his native land?
