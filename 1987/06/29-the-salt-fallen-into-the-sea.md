The Salt Fallen Into The Sea
----------------------------
Under the heights like rusted nail. Like gates impaling outside goblets.  
Multitude of necklaces!  
In and out of the deep brown the cinnamon and the silvery  
fleeting  
empire. The circle functions to hear a system  
to its architecture.  
It develops like a circus around the smooth brick.  
In your tail of compounding the room begins to dream of rejoicing.  
What is this technique but a memory harassed of its ships?  
Our new reflection, our honest cactus line segments.  
Has the city been dawned with mysteries?  
Of a black gentleman that imbues aspens.
