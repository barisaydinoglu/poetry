Tonight I Can Gather
--------------------
Pride is gone, the subject has travelled. A absorbant wind of maps.  
I could gather vagina, invasion, and nougat  
from curtains and sweetness  
with a blood colored sun  
with stalactites in my hand.  
  
And keys and grapes.  
A senile serenity day  
my heart moves from being wayside to being charitable.
