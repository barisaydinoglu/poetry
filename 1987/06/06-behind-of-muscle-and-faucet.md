Behind Of Muscle And Faucet
---------------------------
In your leg of illusion the room of paths perch.  
Neither evening star nor cluster nor gray  
nor green but crimson.  
Opaque yellow and pure uncle,  
Around the transparent shoulder of the water.  
To seek another land opaque marine wind to my forceful umbrella!  
For cluster was bruised and morally positive.  
  
Our new pasture, our parenthetical lake circles.  
He is behind us at this moment of first forming.
