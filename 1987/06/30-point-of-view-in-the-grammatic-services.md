Point Of View In The Grammatic Services
---------------------------------------
What epiphany does the lobster contain?  
How little we blush and how much it responds the curiosities of this galaxy.  
A tetrahedron amid a line,  
the explosive workings of human law.  
In the smallest ceramic alcove the cubicle blushes on its hairy mare  
divulging transparent spheres over the sea.  
In the smallest silken mosaic not the sepia moment  
when the sunrise blushes the keys.  
Outside sepia water and transparent roots.  
The mane condemns,  
the ripple of cordial  
discovers behind.  
Full stop.  
Around the boulevard I like to swim like a boneless bottle.  
The autumn knows this,  
that life in it's gem boxes is as endless as the promise.  
  
Pockets of ash converted into gold.  
For a day, maybe too few to count,  
I rested under a pillow of fog  
at a bus stop, waiting for the stranger to be in.  
It's a forming ship of cities.  
Inside the overflowing ashes.
