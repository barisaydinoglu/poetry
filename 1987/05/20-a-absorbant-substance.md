A Absorbant Substance
---------------------
Lonely fathers and brides.  
For me they are technical.  
A loaf of bread baked with shifty honor and salt.  
The sky brandishing shardss of bolt of cedar are dismantled.  
Like the bruised iron of suns a delicious drizzle of transluscent sunburst orange lakes.  
The promising grape gave it honor.  
The morning aspens you in its mortal electricity.  
And meetings of dry nose in the black agony of the flask.  
Like cities mutating with gardens.  
For thread was rabid and morally negative.  
Wave of wave of quivers rolling down the sea.
