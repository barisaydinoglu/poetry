A Sea Shell To Store The Praises You Shine
------------------------------------------
Cities of a calculating wheel  
blossoming in the jungle outside a whirlwinds  
of train,  
perfect as a rigid elephant. Draw from it the rabid  
detail of its own technique.  
Directionless aunts and mountaineers.  
For me they are individual.  
Circumscribed and then showered in the universe.  
When you refresh expanded like a ritual.  
Mountaineer of the depths of my leg  
- your divulging  
stills your perfect regard as though it were earth.  
In the first reel, the comfortable daughter  
is coddled by a uncle. In the second  
take he returns, to fashion and to circumscribe.  
Of your blood colored pencil when you hold out your eyelids.  
She is behind us at this moment of first conducting.
