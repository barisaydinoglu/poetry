What Is True Of The Fellowship Is True Of Everything
----------------------------------------------------
To the pure color of the marble smooth ash.  
The thorn tree excites on its lonely mare  
perfuming green starss in the sky over the city.  
Like fuming necklace, currents  
the starry dignity of the stalks of cattail!  
To seek another land I could rise flask, throat, and jugular  
from phemonanas and wheatfields  
with a opaque red starlight  
with yeasts in my arm.  
In front of crimson water and opaque marine ribbons.  
Draw from it the muzzled  
computer of its own inscription.  
  
You say, what is the curtain waiting for in its deep brown door?  
I tell you it is waiting for snow like you.  
Like consequences flying within trees.  
Inside the region like iron.  
The sterile starlight is essential on your finger.  
It was the early light of day of the turkey.  
It weaves like a precision amid the garden.  
My balanced eyeballs  
dedicates you always.  
  
It was the sunrise of the oyster.  
The womb imposes nessecity.  
The salt imposes nessecity.  
Pockets of rusted nail converted into gold.  
The grace knows this,  
That life in it's silk boxes is as endless as the shades of blue.  
  
Callous strangers and mothers.  
For me they are algorithmic.  
Multitude of lemons!  
In and out of the sepia the yellow and the deep brown  
wave of wave of river banks rolling down the sea.  
With the pampering bloodied aluminums.  
They passed it with rotten suns.  
A calculating mist day  
it was a demonic business of bramble and gates.  
The I in landscape it was the fortnight of the bird.  
Only insatiable and to a  
person they take on time, thousand years  
and you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
attract of pastures and lemons  
and the domestic fellowships of his native land?  
I'm the person to the starlight of immediate defender.  
Neither river bank nor flint nor ultraviolet  
nor yellow but deep brown.  
Against the explosive mane, many guilt cities.  
In the first reel, the serene father  
is fainted by a child. In the second  
take he returns, to re-cover and to blossom.  
It was the sunrise  
of the jaguar.  
A thick wood paneling making a cordial thing of a unlikely meeting with a mother.  
Because I love you, love, behind the jungle and in front of the fire.  
In the face of so many phlegms to animosity.  
It hears like a precision in front of the peace.  
  
It was the early light of day of the cat.  
  
It was the holiday of the toucan.
