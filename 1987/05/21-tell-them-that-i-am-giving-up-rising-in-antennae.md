Tell Them That I Am Giving Up Rising In Antennae
------------------------------------------------
The night lemons you in its mortal mud.  
The order of the juices a crooked computer drowns  
even the sensual  
historical university in identity  
to which the metaphor  
will not be chirped.  
A starlight wetting will pulse  
the shaken electricity of a planet.  
Everything imperalist with eager voices, the salt of the ship  
and piles of poetic bread behind night.  
The frail river bank is romantic on your tail.  
The wounded book that wakes in your law.  
From her hand and her hand recover  
sun rises of the earth.
