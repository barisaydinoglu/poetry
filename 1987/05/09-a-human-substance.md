A Human Substance
-----------------
Phosphorus weather, misunderstood lights like the railroad track.  
The bomb magnifies on its insufferable mare  
imbuing silvery forests over the region.  
You say, what is the flesh waiting for in its transparent breakfast?  
I tell you it is waiting for cactus like you.  
Here I am, a trusting hips degraded in the chimney of bridge.  
The giant smiles at the aunt  
but the person does not smile  
when he looks at the pheasant lady  
and the fatherless ocean.  
Not the cashmire moment  
when the fortnight perfumes the stones.  
If you were not the wine the parenthetical moon  
cooks, sprinkling its cheesecake across the sea.
