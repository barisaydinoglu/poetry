A Song Of Happiness
-------------------
And you flutter like a old warrior's medal and the leaves exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
in front of it in darkness.  
What charitable warmths of your body -  
the sea is filled with it,  
tigers for the sand-colored lake and the inaccessible silk.  
Lighting the ribbon of her silence full of sincerity.  
The reasons for my respect  
are lighted in my arm of cedar.
