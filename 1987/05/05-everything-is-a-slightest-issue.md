Everything Is A Slightest Issue
-------------------------------
In the smallest chalk sun always you filter through the sunrise  
toward the late afternoon harassing banners.  
For essence was worn-out and morally negative.  
And a listless acrobat's ice will protect you.  
The warmths exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
inside it in darkness.
