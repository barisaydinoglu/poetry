From What Are Waves Wetted
--------------------------
Like holes loathing next to momenta. A chorus of pheasants at sunset un relinquished un smeared  
comes to a halt before a coat.  
A chaotic serenity  
day  
and so that its nails will smother your toe.  
You enchant in the city as in a perfect universe.  
It was the early light of day of the toucan.  
Enjoy the many rambunctious attempts to form  
the thick oblivion.  
There is rosy fortune in inheriting it.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
The elder smiles at the bride  
but the daughter does not smile  
when he looks at the oyster daughter  
and  
the hollow ocean.  
Nothing but that form of sea shells.  
A current of delicate bottle  
that does not know why it flows and perches.  
It is a tale of shifty felicities around the archipeligos I like to entertain like an absurd thread.  
When you rise dedicated like a propeller.  
  
It was the sunrise of the cat.  
Fluttered and then began in the heights.  
Your root is a book filled with dead guitar.  
  
Enchanting, paper-mache soul!  
You connect in the room as in a mineral modern office.  
  
Burnt umber earth  
to my phosphorus garden!  
It was the twilight of the elephant.  
But the autumn circumscribed the memory.  
Thirsty day and the spoiled momentum  
congeal at the walls  
of my house.  
  
It was  
the early light of day of the crab.  
Among the jungle like steel.  
From unrelenting rain to unrelenting rain,  
hidden circuss drawn by human channels, a  
frightened smooth metal begins to transform.  
All souls become howls.  
A jar awakening will weave  
the careless sky of a planet.  
  
Pigeon holes of a oily vessel  
hearing outside the divisions in a inevitable helicopter,  
Careful as a hushed jaguar.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
understand of productivities and pullulations  
and the charitable evening stars of his native land?
