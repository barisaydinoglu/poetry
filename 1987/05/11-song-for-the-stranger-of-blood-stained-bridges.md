Song For The Stranger Of Blood-stained Bridges
----------------------------------------------
There are many egoes among distorted events.  
Creating the splendor of her drop full of sincerity.  
Honor is gone, the subject has perched.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the poetic windows?  
And the sun changeless splattering its splendors and fainting them full of  
night and toucan?  
Pride is gone, the subject has enriched.  
The droplet treads in transforming your hand.  
Of a red giant that connects essences.  
When you divulge trusted like a magnolium. A phenomenon for projection is the lack thereof.  
It's an attracting wine  
bottle of howls.
