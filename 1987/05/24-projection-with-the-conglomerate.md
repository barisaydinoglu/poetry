Projection With The Conglomerate
--------------------------------
Indicates the grape's beginning mouth.  
A chorus of birds at morning un heard un died  
comes to a halt before a soul.  
Because I love you, love, among the jungle and inside the wind.  
On what bitten jugulars flew with sky?  
Fewer and fewer  
kill about another mode of tiredness.  
Neither wreath nor bird feather nor dull shades of blue  
nor sunburst orange but cinnamon.  
One neutral option and fellowship.  
And you return like a ship and if you were not the peach the human moon  
cooks,  
sprinkling its peach across the vicinity.  
Where telegraphs meet  
knaves meet, next to and outside and the sound  
of jugulars, to reach out and circumscribe in illusion.  
Halfway.  
It was a shady business of shards of paper-mache and conglomerates.  
  
We get the hearing  
they must lots to travel  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but conspirators.  
Perhaps they are not abolished.  
Halfway.
