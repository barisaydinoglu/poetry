Abstraction Is An Episode Of Explication
----------------------------------------
From ray of sunlight to blade of grass,  
hidden flints drawn by free channels, a  
barbaous landscape begins to store.  
Because I love you, love, behind the sky and in front of the lightning.  
The flesh plan that has everyone sterile.  
Nails of a pale airplane  
breathing in the region around a ghostly boat,  
free as a thirsty toucan.  
Shall we keep going?  
The violence imposes nessecity.  
  
And you flutter like a echo and grew and then responded in the vicinity.  
The goddess smiles at the fisherman  
but the woman does not smile  
when he looks at the oyster gentleman  
and the communist ocean.  
For a day, maybe thousand,  
I rested under a pillow of fog  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the man to be  
in.  
The essence drinks in enchanting your toe.  
  
What musical farms -  
the thicket is filled with it,  
juices for the grace and the cold ivory.  
It is a tale of clenched circumstances I stayed wetted and burnt umber  
under the moonlight evening.  
A chorus of pheasants at twilight un pulsed un died  
comes to a halt before a kis.  
A projection for detail is the lack thereof.  
To the clear domestic stars in the sky it was a shady business of bomb and errors.  
Closed off and pulled out like a peace.  
The clay monastic waxes are cracked.  
The order of the horses a square outside a square,  
the dead workings of musical law.  
To the aquatic color of the silken quilt.  
Brings all the erupts essences.  
Pockets of steel converted into glass.  
  
Not to live or even meet  
the autumn of one who responds  
among me in a night or fluttering to a cousin.  
Halfway.
