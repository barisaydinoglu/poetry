The Morbid Complaint
--------------------
Realized lyrical moon it stores like a eddy inside the splendor. As if to deprive or weave or falter.  
Dead torrents and spoiled cubicles.  
You flow slowly into a vicinity to respond your business.  
I am soddened by autumn and beast, by oxide and clouds.  
It's a rescuing flower head of trashes.  
Outside the atom of the chimney where you sleep,  
a dream twists into studies.
