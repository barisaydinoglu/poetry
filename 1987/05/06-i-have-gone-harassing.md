I Have Gone Harassing
---------------------
Come with me to the bloodied sand of consequences.  
In the smallest saphire door realized brandishing flint you shower headlong into a night to rise your business.  
The early light of day breakfasts you in its mortal ice.  
Where echoes meet  
fellowships meet, among and in front of and the sound  
of conglomerates, to reach out and build in confusion.
