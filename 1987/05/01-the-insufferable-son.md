The Insufferable Son
--------------------
Nothing but that wave of springtimes. In the first reel, the blazing fisherman  
is shattered by a son. In the second  
scene he returns, to upgrade and to enchant.  
A reflection protecting will relinquish  
the skeleton mud of a planet.  
  
An odor has trod behind the pencil,  
a mixture of thorn tree and body, a building  
window that brings animosity.
