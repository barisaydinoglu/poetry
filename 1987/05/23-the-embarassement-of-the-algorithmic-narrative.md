The Embarassement Of The Algorithmic Narrative
----------------------------------------------
Fewer and fewer  
invade about another mode of pride.  
Once there was a harsh son who  
rejoiced at parties, sitting in a quadrangle, among juices.  
The lightning warm beasts are hated.  
Not connecting is a form of fluttering.  
Be guided by the resolute sea water's fellowship.  
Stranger of the depths of my leg - your swimming  
stills your plumed regard as though it were lightning.  
  
One algorithmic option and the sun rise knows this,  
that life in it's chalk boxes is as endless as the magnolium.
