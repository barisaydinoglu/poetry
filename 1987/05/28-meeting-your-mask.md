Meeting Your Mask
-----------------
Crush me and let my substance swim.  
There are no vortices but directionless cycles of saxophone and sand-colored  
keys of friendly hollow brick.  
Nothing but  
that bird feather of rituals.  
It's a connecting sepia car of throats.  
Nothing but your lovely mouth.  
Has  
the area been preserved with funny things?  
Inside burnt umber water and transluscent opaque transluscent silvery goblets.  
Fewer and fewer  
electrify about another mode of decency.  
A study reconciles,  
penetrates - it does not return.  
I am decayed by thread  
and trash barge, by invasion and drizzle.
