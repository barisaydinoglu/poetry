Inscription With The Jugular
----------------------------
I grow as if in a bleak rotten stump.  
The drop knows this,  
that life in it's crystal boxes is as endless as the railroad track.  
Of your brimstone map when you hold out your finger.  
Everything inevitable with plumed voices, the salt of the sea water  
and piles of homogeneous bread behind twilight.
