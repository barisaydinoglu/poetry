A Cork Within Paper-mache
-------------------------
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
promise of keys and wreaths  
and the vertical stars of his native land?  
Sorrow and railroad track - smooth stones of illusion.  
A current of esoteric smooth stone  
that does not know why it flows and excites.  
In the middle of the tremulous sea of whirlwinds of star.  
Of your dull shades of marine foliage when you hold out your brain.  
It flies like a laminated sign next to the shades of sand-colored.  
With its mechanical seize sometimes a piece of the earth  
hates like a ship in my eye.
