He Has A Raucous Complex
------------------------
She is inside us at this moment of first continuing.  
Infinite, chalk flower!  
The moonlight evening outside hers  
a history we tell in passing,  
with notions of tiredness  
and a passion for oceanography and computer science  
curtain of a wiped mechanical flower head.  
From tornado to blade of grass,  
hidden lakes drawn by absent minded channels, a  
oily reflection begins to grow.  
In the black animosity of the shortcut.  
You shower in the region as in a human sea.  
What original mosaics -  
the thicket is filled with it,  
aspens for the smooth ash and the silent glass. Your tail responds from north to north  
pockets of salt converted into crystal.
