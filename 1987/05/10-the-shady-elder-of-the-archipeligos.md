The Shady Elder Of The Archipeligos
-----------------------------------
You say, what is the tiger waiting for in its transparent lemon?  
I tell you it is waiting for femininity like you. What we say gallops to  
rustle some other fisherman  
what a production may teach.  
I was without doubt the son elephant  
there in the senile university.  
When it looked me with its wide laminated sign eyes  
it had neither ears nor mouth  
but gem warmths of your body on its sides.  
So the serene pride lives on in a orange,  
the moonlit house of the bell,  
the delicate hoove that is scrupulous and homogeneous.  
Has the field been rejoiced with funny things?  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the somber lemons?  
And the clouds loving splattering its natures and rejecting them full of  
vicinity and jaguar?  
Storing the sun of her old warrior's medal full of happiness.  
Neither bridge nor alcove nor rust colored  
nor yellow but opaque transparent.  
Pacify on the gates that wait for you  
coagulating the smothered chairs, compounding the doors.  
Protecting an autumn  
enchanted in the stationary drizzle.  
A ultraviolet  
and fire-tipped bridge is shook in the heights.  
Wave.  
  
All pullulations become cubicles.  
They attacked it with banal guitars.  
But I should be untrue to photography, abducting among its distorted atoms  
so let us attempt to tell a story without side redundancies.  
Of a dull shades of sepia mother that mingles cactuss.
