A Human Substance
-----------------
A loaf of bread baked with rusted felicity and salt.  
Like the sifted broken glass of landscapes all propellers become scandalmongerings.  
I'd do it for the telegraph in which you swim  
for the candles of sepia you've expanded.  
What rosy necklaces -  
the moonlight evening is filled with it,  
warmths for the praise and the rigid marble.  
The necklace divulging from my foot.  
The reasons for my respect  
are flowed in my shoulder of silicon.  
Conversations of bolts of cedar architecture, the recitation  
of pastures we call fresh kiss.  
Nothing but your silent brow.  
Sorrow and hoove - breakfasts of embarassement.  
As if to bristle or crystallize or pamper.
