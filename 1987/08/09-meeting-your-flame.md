Meeting Your Flame
------------------
In my room at night you are like a ripple  
and your form and colour the way I understand them.  
The dominion rustles on its weak mare  
connecting transluscent green aromas over the sea.  
Everything motionless with silent voices, the salt of the fragrance of strawberry  
and piles of domestic bread in afternoon.  
What we say rescues to  
relinquish some other child  
what a camera may teach.  
  
Not the silvery moment  
when the twilight rejoices the waves.
