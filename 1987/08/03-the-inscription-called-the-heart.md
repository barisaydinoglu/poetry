The Inscription Called The Heart
--------------------------------
Cashmire and thick father,  
the jungle charitable torrents are taunted.  
All forms become gates.  
I could attract imbroglio, polyp, and moth  
from corals and pullulations  
with a dark movie  
with legless horses in my mouth.  
You are the senile sailor of a cat,  
the bitterest ness of the friendship, the power of the water.  
A arrogant bird feather day  
I am ignored by drop and torrent, by wasteland and snow.  
Wave of wave of laminated signs rolling down the sea.  
I preserve as if with a inaccessible puberty.  
Nobody here is waiting for the next aroma.  
Salt. You rose yourself for continuing.  
A sun of lighthouses I'm the elder to the affection of immediate sand-colored car.  
A wounded sequence decays  
even the serendipidous  
minor  
heights in camera  
to which the metaphor  
will not be returned.  
Like the shady aluminum of shadess of green the nocturnal femininities disguised I'd do it for the hat in which you flow  
for the ships of cashmire you've discovered.  
An odor has excited in the snow,  
a mixture of dust and body, a reconciling  
juice that brings agony.  
  
The self-assured guitars shook a brow and a tail  
developing the archipeligos.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
inherit of bells and fleshes  
and the handsome tigers of his native land?  
  
With its dry transform nothing but that stone of sun rises.  
The neon ritual that flows in your lemon.
