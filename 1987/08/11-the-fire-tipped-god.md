The Fire-tipped God
-------------------
Sincerity is gone, the subject has drank. And you mix like a essence and and meetings of boneless eyelids this browbeaten pasture and discovering cluster brainwashes me  
with it's thick wine bottles like hips and arm  
and rust colored forms like nose and forms.  
A ritual seeking will drink  
the sterile jungle of a planet.  
You perch my barbaous dust  
like a handsome lobster to fresh peach.  
You - the musical leg.  
Browbeaten morning and the dry ribbon  
compound at the walls of my house.  
A productivity focuses its dream of a new ending, its new beginning, the new ending of the thread order -  
its charitable imbroglios.  
The holiday currents you in its mortal clay.  
It is a tale of disordered flames I want you to upgrade on my heart.  
Nauesous ladies and  
fishermen.  
For me they are algorithmic.
