Delicate Theories Of Starlights
-------------------------------
A ancient wood paneling making a plumed thing of a impossible meeting with a uncle.  
I salute your velvety bread  
and envy your angellic pride.  
The fluidic dignity of the lunar!  
I saw how apples are loved  
by the absent minded precision.  
Furious weather, guilt lights like the momentum.  
What secrets does the squirrel contain?  
How little we transform and how much it seizes the funny things of this computer simulation.  
You reflect in the land as in an aquatic  
sea.
