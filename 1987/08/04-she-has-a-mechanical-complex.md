She Has A Mechanical Complex
----------------------------
One of them is iridescent,  
the other knows images.  
Where is noone  
she says, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Enjoy the many disintered attempts to live  
the self-assured lard.  
There is domestic fortune in drinking it.  
Only barbaous and to a  
cousin they take on time, too few to count years  
This careless foliage and preserving laminated sign replaces me  
with it's cosmic peaces like tail and brain  
and ultraviolet apples like eyeballs and productivities.  
Always you loiter through the fortnight  
toward the day changing droplets.
