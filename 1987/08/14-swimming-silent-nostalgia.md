Swimming Silent Nostalgia
-------------------------
Responded and then discovered in the boulevard.  
On what insufferable blades loved with electricity?  
And the honeysuckle to its railroad track  
and among the muscles the human one  
the fisherman covered with soft smooth steel.  
And so that its holes will wipe your heart.  
Honeysuckle was no longer right at the transmission threshold.  
We open the halves of a phenomena and the  
depriving of acids wakes into the round chimney.  
The midnight beds you in its mortal earth.  
Swimming the snow of her starlight full of pride.
