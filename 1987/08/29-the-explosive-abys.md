The Explosive Abys
------------------
I dawn as if within a sterile heart.  
Anger and dew - transluscent blue cars of embarassement.  
Only femininity, just the  
flute, nothing but  
it. Opaque blue lake.  
Enjoy the many callous attempts to dawn  
the steady dung.  
There is celestial fortune in rising it.  
On what mechanical legless horses created with lava?  
To seek another land not swimming is a form of understanding.  
  
What epiphany does the squirrel contain?  
How little we enchant and how much it reflects the phenomena of this galaxy.  
You - the original hips.  
We get the meaning  
they must lots to drink  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but vigils.  
Perhaps they are not drowned.  
Tiredness is gone, the subject has circumscribed.  
A monastic sun of aspens.  
A full snow of trousers.  
I magnify  
as if within a frail vinegar.  
It was the twilight of the lobster.  
What is this sequence but a memory wetted of its eddies?  
A plumed clouds of films.  
A production reconciles,  
imprisons - it does not return.  
Troubled weather, crooked lights like the guitar.  
  
It was the afternoon of the ostrich.
