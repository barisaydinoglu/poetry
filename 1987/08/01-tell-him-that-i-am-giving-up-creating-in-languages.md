Tell Him That I Am Giving Up Creating In Languages
--------------------------------------------------
Once there was a inevitable pioneer who  
drank at parties, sitting in a line, among wreaths.  
Sometimes a piece of the ice  
drops like an affection in my heart.  
A ultraviolet and insufferable cork architecture is foreboded in the room.  
From her eyeballs and her hand wake  
wine bottles of the earth.  
  
To excite lost ripples and for mirrors.  
Blue ashes of night,  
deep brown seams above a distorted time.  
In your brain of shattering the field begins to dream of dawning.  
Hidden empire. The circle functions to respond a environment  
to its environment.
