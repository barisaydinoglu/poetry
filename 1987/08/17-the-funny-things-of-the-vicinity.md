The Funny Things Of The Vicinity
--------------------------------
There are no bloods but distorted cycles of form and burnt umber  
fellowships of free shady rusted nail.  
With the black confusion of the wound.  
Realized naked cathedral multitude of roses!  
In and out of the sand-colored the blue and the cashmire  
clotting early light of day and the troubled dew  
silence at the walls of my  
house.  
The manly paths forced sometimes a piece of the lightning  
drowns like a hat in my heart.  
With the dying ghosts.
