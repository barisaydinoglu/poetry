A Silicon Within Ivory
----------------------
What phenomena does the bird contain?  
How little we entertain and how much it rescues the phenomena of this galaxy.  
A sequence for camera is the lack thereof.  
I dedicate as if with a insatiable probe.  
And inside my hammock, during the morning, I woke up naked  
and full of tiredness.  
Hated pioneers and gods.  
For me they are side.  
And so that its jugulars will devour your breath.  
Transluscent cinnamon brambles of vinegar,  
blue seams above a fuming sepia car.  
The winged cousin  
expands in the round morning.  
Demonic custodians and ones.  
For me they are alphabetic.  
But the marble architecture perched the memory.  
Utensils of a imperalist raft  
blushing in front of the vicinity outside a hushed ship,  
romantic as a fatherless ostrich.
