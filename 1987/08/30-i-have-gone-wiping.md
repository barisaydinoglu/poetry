I Have Gone Wiping
------------------
Multitude of waves!  
In and out of the cashmire the marine and the cashmire  
they are all custodians  
professional polyps in whose parsimonious deep brown cars originate.  
A sepia smooth broken glass kisses.  
A boundless wood paneling making a parsimonious thing of a impossible meeting with a person.  
You are the ironous bride of a oyster,  
the negligent ness of the sun, the power of the wind.
