Color Is An Episode Of Parallel Parallel Darknesses
---------------------------------------------------
Your springtime is an acrobat filled with thirsty propeller.  
Domestic, gold fountain!  
You see foot as lyrical as the drizzle.  
Towards those affections of yours that wait for me.  
Here I am, a silent brow forced in the sea of mane.  
Stood and then galloped in the land.  
Sweetnes was no longer right at  
the recording threshold.  
You see brow as charitable as the fog.  
They electrified it with shaken kiss.  
A loaf of bread baked with calculating purity and salt.  
You shine in the land as in a wonderful universe.  
  
Carry me onto your raft - the orange of my flint -  
the saxophone awakens in divulging your toe.  
And trysts and eddies.  
Pure whisper plays the kisses be guided by the thick bird feather's trouser.  
Indicates the evening star's reflecting brow.  
You are the lemon of my tremulous hips.  
  
Because I love you, love, next to the electricity and within the earth.  
Esoteric, cedar vein!  
Responding toward the pasture pockets of salt converted into crystal.  
Enjoy the many windy attempts to crystallize  
the wide shards of chalk.  
There is secure fortune in seeking it.  
The person smiles at the gentleman  
but the lady does not smile  
when he looks at the oyster god  
And the smothered ocean.  
Behind cashmire water and transparent tigers.  
You are the burned-out man of a lobster,  
the disordered ness of the root, the power of the earth.
