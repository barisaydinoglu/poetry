The Moth Fallen Into The Sea
----------------------------
If you were not the lemon the serendipidous moon  
cooks, sprinkling its orange across the modern office.  
Deep brown ice to my bitten love!  
A perfect drizzle of kiss.  
Promising the serendipity of her thread full of decency.  
Where leaves meet  
beds meet, within and next to and the sound  
of depths, to reach out and enrich in agony.  
Poppy of a lunged distorted fountain.  
You conduct my hollow stain  
like a boundless jaguar to fresh plum.
