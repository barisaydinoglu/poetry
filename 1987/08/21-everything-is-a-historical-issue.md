Everything Is A Historical Issue
--------------------------------
It's a perching writing of wastelands. Your lip wets from south to west  
they plagued it with inaccessible sea shells.  
A serendipidous linoleum making a dashing thing of a impossible meeting with a goddess.  
Only necklace, just the  
landscape, nothing but  
it. Wreath.  
Come with me to the vigil of wounded soldiers.  
Be guided by the naked forest's apple.  
Yellow thorn trees of viola,  
opaque transluscent sepia seams above a rabid planetarium.  
  
The productivities exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
among it in darkness.
