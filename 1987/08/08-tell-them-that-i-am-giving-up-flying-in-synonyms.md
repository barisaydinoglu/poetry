Tell Them That I Am Giving Up Flying In Synonyms
------------------------------------------------
I'd do it for the foam in which you play  
for the roots of silvery you've  
perched.  
What funny things does the bird contain?  
How little we mix and how much it plays the epiphany of this galaxy.  
There are many stenches behind bitterest events.  
I stayed perched and transluscent transluscent crimson  
among the night.  
It is a tale of insufferable wombs only cold and to a  
custodian they take on time, twenty-seven years  
Conduct on the granules that wait for you  
forcing the tear stained chairs, bristling the doors.  
And a disintered quiver's electricity will awaken you.  
Serendipidous, cedar propeller!  
A worn-out phenomenon throttles  
even the absent minded  
overtone area in image  
to which the metaphor  
Will not be wove.
