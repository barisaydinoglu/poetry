A Gold Within Saphire
---------------------
Somebody here is waiting for the next breakfast.  
Reflection. You travelled yourself for chirping.  
Realized fleeting goblet among the frightened writing, many putrid coffins.  
One of them is equinoctial,  
the other knows projections.  
Where is everybody  
He exclaims, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
The fountain knows this,  
that life in it's ivory boxes is as endless as the leaf.  
A identity for production  
is the lack thereof.  
Pacify on the pins that wait for you  
loathing the distorted chairs, burying the doors.  
The reasons for my respect  
are rescued in my foot of bolt of ceramic.  
Abberations of a sticky airplane  
making within the boulevard outside a dead ship,  
scrupulous as a fuming pheasant. In your foot of animosity the vicinity of burnt umber cars transform.
