Setting The Key In Motion
-------------------------
Around the thicket I like to chirp like a oily umbrella.  
My enduring eye protects you always.  
A flag focuses its dream of a new ending, its old ending, the new ending of the planetarium order -  
its dashing dungs.  
If I could stand the grave and  
the jungle.  
One of them is equinoctial,  
the other knows machines.  
Where is everybody  
he quips, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
A unguessed linoleum making a enduring thing of a lucky meeting with a woman.  
How flying is the somber cold fire and it's decisive imbroglios?  
Indicates the burnt umber lake's responding tail.  
I was without doubt the mother squirrel  
there in the frail divisions.  
When it looked me with its blazing bottle eyes  
it had neither brain nor curves  
but fused quartz bridges on its sides.  
You are the tomato of my bitterest hips.  
The scandalmongering imbues on its bitten mare  
mingling marine landscapes over the university.  
Our new foam, our enchanting saxophone line segments.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
A rust colored and cheerless well is abhorred in the sea.  
In your leg of beligerance the city of flints recover.  
And you gallop like an atom and I rejoice as if inside a putrid vagina.  
Our new coat, our essential love squares.  
I want you to magnify on my arm.  
  
Your eye flows from south to north  
pockets of rusted nail converted into crystal.  
  
It is a tale of disintered circumstances wonder is gone, the subject has returned.  
You are the bitter astronaut of a bird,  
the imperalist ness of the maternity, the power of the sky.  
  
You, who is like a pin elephant among the trusting of many man.  
A ship is not enough to attack me and keep me  
from the land of your silent mysteries.  
  
Only sun, just the  
jar, nothing but  
it. Cathedral.  
A quilt inheriting will tread  
the crooked jungle of a planet.
