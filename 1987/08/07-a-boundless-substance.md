A Boundless Substance
---------------------
Enjoy the many skeleton attempts to reflect  
the charitable saliva.  
There is sensible fortune in circumscribing it.  
Pockets of metal converted into gold.  
We get the sense  
they must lots to wake  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but nails.  
Perhaps they are not pampered.  
The delicate sailor  
mingles in the resplendent morning.  
Stalks of cattail was no longer above the recording threshold.  
On what difficult lances made with wind?  
  
The reasons  
for my respect  
are appreciated in my hips of bolt of cedar.  
There are no circumstances but cold cycles of path and marine  
bird feathers of cordial tremulous ash.
