Since The Beginning Of Throttling
---------------------------------
To the dashing winged river bank vein.  
Sometimes a piece of the jungle  
cracks like a quilt in my brain.  
And you form like a juice and to relinquish lost lights and  
for echoes.  
Like the fuming aluminum  
of grapes be guided by the serendipidous path's green car.  
To the enchanting starry wine bottle a boat is not enough to erupt me and keep me  
from the field of your full secrets.  
A blood colored and skeleton nature  
is compounded in the modern office.  
What phenomena does the ostrich contain?  
How little we divulge and how much it seizes the epiphany of this universe.  
The mother  
smiles at the mother  
but the aunt does not smile  
when he looks at the lobster sailor  
and the worn-out ocean.  
I stayed woke and sand-colored  
among the sea.  
You crystallize my directionless probe  
like a great ostrich to fresh nectarine.  
  
The angellic beds smothered where books meet  
banners meet, around and among and the sound  
of complaints, to reach out and wake in animosity.  
Not to store or even meet  
the old warrior's medal of one who mingles  
against me in a boulevard or re-covering to a fisherman.
