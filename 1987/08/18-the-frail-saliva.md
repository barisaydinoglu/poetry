The Frail Saliva
----------------
Tremulous night and the bitter knave  
silence at the walls of my house.  
To divulge lost gardens and for flower heads.  
You perform my tremulous enemy  
like a real cat to fresh bread.  
The hole protects on its barbaous mare  
inheriting burnt umber farms over the university.  
  
Force me and let my substance attract.  
And keys and maternities.  
And meetings of mourning hips somebody here is waiting for the next window.  
Nature. You built yourself for awakening.  
Distorted weather, furious lights like the law.  
Silent early light of day and the imperalist poppy  
smother at the walls of my house.  
But the sun chirped the memory.  
A technique for study is the lack thereof.
