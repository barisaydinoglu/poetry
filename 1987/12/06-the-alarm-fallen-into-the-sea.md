The Alarm Fallen Into The Sea
-----------------------------
Here I am, a noble eyelids bristled in the area of magnolium.  
Seizing a sun  
responded in the manly fog.  
The lighthouses exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
with it in darkness.  
Shall we go forward?  
A sand-colored salt blossoms.
