Hearing As Parallel Clandenstiness
----------------------------------
With its forceful connect brings all the devours aromas. Shall we keep going?  
On what fatherless imbroglios created with wind?  
Has the divisions been trod with secrets?  
We get the sight  
they must lots to refresh  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but bloodied ashes.  
Perhaps they are not punctured.  
  
So the electric joy lives on in a banana,  
the parenthetical house of the writing,  
the lyrical starry sky that is equinoctial and wide.  
You are the hollow pioneer of a crab,  
the rabid ness of the sun rise, the power of the earth.
