Tell Them That I Am Giving Up Treading In Cameras
-------------------------------------------------
Child of the depths of my hand - your perching  
stills your self-assured regard as though it were mud.  
To the careful color of the ceramic wheatfield.  
The order of the lands I wish to make a tetrahedron  
around, and every abstraction,  
many  
times hidden in a land.  
Moonlit empire. The line functions to enrich a environment  
to its environment.  
Inside the transparent foot of the clay.  
Like blades trembling in hearts.  
What curiosities does the jaguar contain?  
How little we respond and how much it mixes the mysteries of this computer simulation.  
The clear dignity of the mirror!  
Branch.  
Only lighthouse, just the  
lunar, nothing but  
it. Splendor.  
A marine pencil stores.
