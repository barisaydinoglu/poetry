What Is True Of The Prize Is True Of Nothing
--------------------------------------------
A point of view pulses,  
abducts - it does not return.  
When you love upgraded like a prize.  
Come with me to the nougat of noises.  
Your splendor is a grace filled with cold light.  
A ship is not enough to dismantle me and keep me  
from the modern office of your cosmic curiosities.
