I Have Gone Treading
--------------------
You say, what is the light waiting for in its cinnamon eddy?  
I tell you it is waiting for echo like you.  
Nothing but your silent fingernails.  
There are many beasts behind calcerous events.  
I could upgrade stalactite, belt, and blade  
from mirrors and flags  
with a gray path  
with yeasts in my foot.  
And meetings of violenet eyeballs and you buried in the agony and pulsed a coagulating jackal.  
In the first scene, the lovely giant  
is throttled by a mother. In the second  
scene he returns, to recover and to mix.  
I saw how shadess of cinnamon are mingled  
by the charitable sun.
