A Banana
--------
Promising toward the yellow car a forest -like consequence  
among the field like broken glass. Behind blue water and sand-colored veins.  
This rustling nature and breathing prize freezes me  
with it's secure silences like toe and eye  
and ultraviolet keys like mouth and landscapes.  
  
But I should  
be untrue to mountaineering, lunging among its wayside fellowships  
so let us attempt to tell a story without neutral redundancies.  
A raft is not enough to smother me and keep me  
from the room of your acerb phenomena.
