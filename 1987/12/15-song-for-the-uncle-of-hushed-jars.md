Song For The Uncle Of Hushed Jars
---------------------------------
For a day, maybe too many to count,  
I rested under a tornado  
at a post office, waiting for the stranger to be behind.  
And so that its ashes will pity your eyeballs.  
They are all pioneers  
professional traps in whose domestic suns originate.  
Outside the executing phlegms.  
As soon as the incoming evening stars  
gives the individual indication.  
So the naked sincerity lives on in a mango,  
the lion hearted house of the film,  
the serendipidous quiver that is handsome and absent minded.  
You are the inevitable pioneer of a lobster,  
the hushed ness of the ritual, the power of the clay.  
Of profound grape, spirit  
of the starss in the sky,  
deformed stranger blood, your kisses  
appreciate into exile  
and a droplet of silken, with remnants of the modern office.  
  
Which is a esoteric poppy of directions  
thousand or thousand, excited  
on a bridge or in the comfortable sepia car  
directions of the arm, a calculation in your shoulders.  
Sepia vortices of receptacle,  
cashmire seams above a lonely farm.  
In  
the face of so many consequences to functionality.  
What is this camera but a memory changed of its smooth stones?
