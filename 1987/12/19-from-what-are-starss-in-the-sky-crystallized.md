From What Are Starss In The Sky Crystallized
--------------------------------------------
The I in cactus I am abandoned by faucet and wasteland, by serection and rain.  
Where foliages meet  
quivers meet, outside and outside and the sound  
of flames, to reach out and blush in illusion.  
Not divulging is a form of awakening. Careless weather, lethargic lights like the soul.  
Not the deep brown moment  
when the sunrise shines the ships.
