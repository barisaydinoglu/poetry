Your Heart Is Enough
--------------------
The weak snow is soft on your foot.  
Went blossomed in thread like lewd splendor, planetariums  
the echo abducts, the elixir of homogeneous  
mingles amid.  
A current  
of fleeting tree  
that does not know why it flows and imbues.  
In the face of so many bones to animosity.  
Not the silvery moment  
when the early light of day carries the snows.  
Fewer and fewer  
crack about another mode of felicity.  
The consequence re-covers on its fractious mare  
gathering yellow suns over the heights.  
In the face of so many self-productions to positivity.  
Your sea's skin is a fragrance of strawberry filled with violenet home.  
You are the barbaous man of a cat,  
the motionless ness of the goblet, the power of the lava.  
From uncomfortable turbulence to harrowing wind,  
hidden friendships drawn by parsimonious channels, a  
rabid  
momentum begins to preserve.  
In my jungle at lunchtime you are like a femininity  
and your form and colour the way I dedicate them.  
  
A propeller exciting will circumscribe  
The morbid wind of a planet.  
Multitude of serenities!  
In and out of the green the cashmire and the sunburst orange  
  
On what forceful billows of black smoke appreciated with electricity?  
Fewer and fewer  
congeal about another mode of tiredness.
