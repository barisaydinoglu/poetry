A Song Of Joy
-------------
A current of fleeting muscle  
that does not know why it flows and fashions.  
She is among us at this moment of first reflecting.  
Among the dark anger of the trap.  
Multitude of maternities!  
In and out of the sepia the burnt umber and the burnt umber  
The person smiles at the elder  
but the woman does not smile  
when he looks at the jaguar custodian  
and the directionless ocean.  
There are no jackals but nauesous cycles of green lake and yellow  
awes of unguessed thirsty steel.  
  
I stayed discovered and blue  
in the middle of the region.
