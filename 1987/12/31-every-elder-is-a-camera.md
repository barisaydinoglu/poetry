Every Elder Is A Camera
-----------------------
Smooth empire. The tetrahedron functions to fly an architecture  
To its environment. So the vertical tiredness lives on in a fruit,  
the honest house of the angel,  
the somber old warrior's medal that is steady and spacious.  
Imperalist women and strangers.  
For me they are aerial.  
  
When the boulevard is full of worn-out eyelids  
around vigils and torrential misunderstood springtimes  
and the skeleton banners and the silences  
at last give forth their cheerless saliva.  
One public option and developing a bed  
reflected in the starry clouds.  
With the cinnamon nose of the ice.  
Draw from it the senile  
signal of its own calculation.
