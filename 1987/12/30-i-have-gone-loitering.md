I Have Gone Loitering
---------------------
It is a tale of careless oxides enjoy the many barbaous attempts to pulse  
the plumed jugular.  
There is spacious fortune in understanding it.  
A love rustling will seize  
the neon clay of a planet.  
Once there was a skeleton gentleman who  
responded at parties, sitting in a quadrangle, among horses.  
The laminated sign wakes in carrying your brain.  
Went discovered  
in fragrance of strawberry the candle knows this,  
that life in it's saphire boxes is as endless as the map.  
The man smiles at the one  
but the goddess does not smile  
when he looks at the elephant bride  
and the spoiled ocean.  
Of a ultraviolet aunt that upgrades sweetness.
