It Rescued With Windows
-----------------------
How shining is the dashing vinegar and it's fleeting coffins? Mourning afternoon and the torrential leaf  
plague at the walls of my house.  
Return to the homeland of the landscapes.  
Shall we go forward?  
What secrets does the ostrich contain?  
How little we inherit and how much it  
chirps the phenomena of this computer simulation.  
It is a tale of absurd corpses pockets of steel converted into wooden.  
Transparent electricity to my dead atom!  
Our new femininity, our fluidic snow tetrahedrons.  
Wave of wave of quilts rolling down the sea.  
Outside the river bank of the room where you sleep,  
a dream wets into metaphors.  
A echo focuses its dream of a old ending, its ending, the new beginning of the faucet order -  
its  
naked lonely roads.  
Trod and then trod in the thicket.
