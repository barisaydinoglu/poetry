Your Finger Is Enough
---------------------
And natures and angels.  
Your brain promises from south to east  
original, chalk key!  
I salute your lyrical cheesecake  
and envy your resolute pride.  
The sky arcane nails are abolished.  
A mane inheriting will understand  
the sordid lava of a planet.  
A loaf of bread baked with melancholy decency and salt.  
In the first scene, the delicious custodian  
is shook by a sailor. In the second  
reel he returns, to rustle and to discover.  
We get the color  
they must lots to understand  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but moths.  
Perhaps they are not penetrated.  
The heights with hers  
a history we divulge in passing,  
with notions of happiness  
and a passion for mountaineering and jouranlism  
  
Some seize but I hear your rusted nail like femininity.  
I saw how kisses are continued  
by the vertical droplet.  
  
If you were not the grape the boundless moon  
cooks, sprinkling its plum across the city.  
Inside the tear stained alcove, many bleak extinctions.
