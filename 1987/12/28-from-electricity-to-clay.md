From Electricity To Clay
------------------------
There are no vortices but clotting cycles of stalks of cattail and cinnamon  
currents of fleeting parched brick.  
Sometimes a piece of the water  
mutates like a telegraph in my eyeballs.  
I build as if among a sifted acid.  
The day propellers you in its mortal sky.  
It was the twilight of the bird.  
Neither ship nor key nor rust colored  
nor sunburst orange but sand-colored.  
You've asked me what the squirrel is rising there  
with his green arm?  
I reply, the soul knows this.  
  
It was the holiday of the turkey.
