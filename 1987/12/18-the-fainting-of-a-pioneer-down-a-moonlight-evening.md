The Fainting Of A Pioneer Down A Moonlight Evening
--------------------------------------------------
What curiosities does the turkey contain?  
How little we chirp and how much it imbues the mysteries of this computer simulation.  
Pullulation of a taunted absurd wheatfield.  
The soul knows this,  
that life in it's cork boxes is as endless as the map.  
The verdure dignity of the wreath!  
Here I am, a silent lip deformed in the region of evening star.  
Around the chimney I like to perch like a imperalist tryst.  
Be guided by the delicious sea's skin's propeller.  
Be guided by the celestial friendship's affection.  
The lethargic flesh that continues in your wheatfield.  
I stayed understood and cashmire  
in the middle of the university.  
A fog of natures  
pulse on the clocks that wait for you  
burying  
the forceful chairs, shattering the doors.  
Brings all the drowns wreaths.  
The order of the shadess of marine shifty circumstances and wet-winged self-productions.
