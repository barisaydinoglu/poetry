Mothers Must Always Prove Their Utensils

A delicate drizzle of smooth stones. Against the crooked pasture, many lashed coals.  
In your brow of panic the city of breakfasts enchant.  
Shaken billows of gray smoke and wounded wounds.  
What is this detail but a memory struck of its angels?  
And so that its cadavers will ignore your nose.  
A silvery wheatfield understands.
