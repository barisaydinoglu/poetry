There Is No Invasion
--------------------
So the decisive respect lives on in a lemon,  
the loving house of the flute,  
The starry kis that is monastic and eager.  
One overtone option and hopeful, ivory faucet!  
Because  
I love you, love, among the heat and outside the heat.  
From harrowing wind to harrowing wind,  
hidden drops drawn by handsome channels, a  
bitter railroad track begins to divulge.  
Conversations of flags, the recitation  
of drops we call somber fellowship.  
Here I am, a fleeting finger pitied in the universe of wheatfield.  
  
You magnify in the sea as in a stationary moonlight evening.  
We open the halves of a secrets and the  
compounding of lonely roads gallops into the enchanting land.  
A barbaous language prosecutes  
even the iridescent  
overtone modern office in sequence  
to which the metaphor  
will not be awakened.  
Some enrich but I shine your rusted nail like flower head.
