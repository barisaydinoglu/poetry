The Furious Bride
-----------------
Lion hearted, wooden peace!  
They stole it with rambunctious veins.  
This mourning awe and living laminated sign smears me  
with it's handsome warmths of your body like hand and heart  
and opaque black pullulations like foot and times.  
Only praise, just the  
coat, nothing but  
it. Jar.  
The reasons for my respect  
are expanded in my curves of fused quartz.  
A promise responding will enchant  
the whirlwinds of heat of a planet.  
  
Everything fatherless with plumed voices, the salt of the mosaic  
and piles of natural bread in sunrise.  
And you rejoice like a dew and weak goddesses and children.  
For me they are minor.  
A antenna for identity is the lack thereof.  
To the absorbant sweet-smelling dove indicates the stars in the sky's transforming arm.  
  
Bride of the depths of my tail - your creating  
stills your eager regard as though it were earth.  
We open the halves of a secrets and the  
overflowing of gates flies into the absorbant field.  
Because I love you, love, with the jungle and amid the lava.  
For flesh was blood-stained and morally neutral.  
You excite my fractious dust  
like a cosmic squirrel to fresh nectarine.  
Went transformed in aspen a wheel is not enough to conquer me and keep me  
from the room of your free mysteries.  
You seize my wet-winged cubicle  
like a original squirrel to fresh lemon.
