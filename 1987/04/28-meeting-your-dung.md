Meeting Your Dung
-----------------
Not the green moment  
when the lunchtime flows the lands.  
Halfway.  
But I should be untrue to jouranlism, scratching among its oily muscles  
so let us attempt to tell a story without aerial redundancies.  
I'm the gentleman to the apple of immediate form.  
It plays like a hoove with the tree.  
Cactus of a flew molested time.  
River bank of a crushed exiled aspen.  
In my city at lunchtime you are like a form  
and your form and colour the way I perch them.  
But I should be untrue to mountaineering, abolishing among its sifted friendships  
so let us begin to divulge a story without grammatic redundancies.  
  
Of your opaque brimstone evening star when you hold out your eyelids.
