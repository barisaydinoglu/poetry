Custodians Of A Fatherless Country
----------------------------------
Pockets of sand converted into diamond.  
Behind the marine arm of the mud.  
Indicates the jar's promising tail.  
You've asked me what the iguana is reconciling there with his marine eyeballs?  
I reply, the branch knows this.  
To the winged color of the ceramic honeysuckle.  
The tryst plan that has everyone callous.  
Perfume of a soddened bleak magnolium.  
Yellow and friendly one,
