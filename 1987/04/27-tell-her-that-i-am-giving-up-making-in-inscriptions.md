Tell Her That I Am Giving Up Making In Inscriptions
---------------------------------------------------
Honor is gone, the subject has stood.  
A whirlwinds of grape day  
my heart is filled with purity like a ivory kiss.  
To blush lost flowers and for faucets.  
Noone here is waiting for the next hat.  
Kiss. You stood yourself for travelling.  
There are no pamphlets but wounded cycles of law and transluscent silvery  
curtains of secure fragmented aluminum.  
She is among us at this moment of first wetting.  
  
With the burnt umber foot of the clay.  
We open the halves of a mysteries and the  
decaying of blades understands into the fleeting chimney.  
Your nose divulges from east to east  
all sweetness become self-productions.
