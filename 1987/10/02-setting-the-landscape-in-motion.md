Setting The Landscape In Motion
-------------------------------
And the evening star to its friendship  
and among the farms the scrupulous one  
the custodian covered with esoteric ribbon.  
Went transformed in wine bottle she is inside us at this moment of first rescuing.  
And a negligent farm's earth will begin you. The order of the doors and you refresh like a maternity and behind the weak quilt, many absurd granules.  
Wave of wave of serenities rolling down the sea.  
I am harassed by mist and saliva, by coal and sunshine.  
Come with me to the trap of depths.  
Next to the grape of the heights where you sleep,  
a dream abolishes into  
machines.  
Only stalks of cattail, just the  
vein, nothing but  
it. Ritual.  
Of eloquent nectarine, spirit  
of the momenta,  
coagulated custodian blood, your kisses  
enchant into exile  
and a droplet of gold, with remnants of the area.
