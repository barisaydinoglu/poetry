Meeting Your Lance
------------------
So the handsome respect lives on in a lemon,  
the sensual house of the splendor,  
the aquatic flower head that is essential and sanguine.  
For time was sordid and morally negative.  
A loaf of bread baked with negligent wonder and salt.  
But I should be untrue to photography, fainting among its tremulous lunars  
so let us seek to divulge a story without aerial redundancies.  
And old warrior's medals and reflections.  
What conquers the props of joy?  
Path of a throttled weak wheatfield.
