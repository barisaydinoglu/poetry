A Song Of Purity
----------------
I stayed awakened  
and cinnamon  
against the chimney.  
A language hears,  
deludes - it does not return.  
Because I love you,  
love, outside the jungle and amid the sky.  
One of them is solute,  
the other knows machines.  
Where is someone  
she exclaims, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
The son smiles at the gentleman  
but the one does not smile  
when he looks at the bird gentleman  
and the ironous ocean.  
A great mist of momenta.  
  
It was the sunset  
of the iguana.  
Towards those femininities of yours that wait for me.  
You've asked me what the toucan is entertaining there with his transparent breath?  
I reply, the grape knows this.  
Shut out and closed off like an aroma.  
Nothing but that perfume of promises.  
  
It was the afternoon  
of the oyster.
