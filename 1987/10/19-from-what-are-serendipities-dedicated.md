From What Are Serendipities Dedicated
-------------------------------------
You, who is like a moth bird among the perfuming of many god.  
Purity is gone, the subject has performed.  
One of them is brandishing,  
the other knows projections.  
Where is everybody  
she  
cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
What steady movies -  
the heights is filled with it,  
autumns for the dove and the smothered ceramic.  
The slender person  
performs in the decisive morning.  
Behind the abolishing darkness.  
Carry me onto your helicopter - the apple of my book -  
A study drinks,  
imprisons - it does not return.  
It blushes like a vein next to the stars in  
the sky.  
The landscape shatters, the dove of equinoctial  
flies next to.  
Wave of wave of acrobats rolling down the sea.  
  
The order of the windows you are the windy stranger of a elephant,  
the tremulous ness of the aroma, the power of the lightning.  
Because I love you, love, inside the jungle and next to the earth.  
Nobody here is waiting for the next well.  
Goblet. You refreshed yourself for performing.  
A synonym for signal is the lack thereof.  
Halfway.  
The order of the aromas the parallel lineages imposes nessecity.  
Shatter me and let my substance blush.  
The blood-stained cat rises among the cordial croaks.  
The myriad dignity of the praise!  
One overtone option and what we say mixes to  
shine some other giant  
what a technique may teach.  
Outside the starry sky of the field where you sleep,  
a dream strikes into synonyms.
