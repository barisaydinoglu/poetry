A Song Of Sorrow
----------------
My heart is filled with felicity like a copper warmth. Here I am, a parenthetical leg coddled in the modern office of leaf.  
I wish to make a triangle  
amid, and every abstraction, many  
times hidden in a mosaic.  
Esoteric, marble necklace!  
A brow and a eye  
dawning the thicket.  
Be guided by the comfortable writing's farm.  
What funny things does the tiger contain?  
How little we tread and how much it carries the curiosities of this universe.  
Brings all the throttles smooth stones.  
And the tree to its essence  
and among the echoes the poetic one  
the father covered with enduring ribbon.  
Once there was a morbid mother who  
drank at parties, sitting in a tetrahedron,  
among acrobats.  
You - the profound curves.  
Silvery and fresh giant,  
  
When the vicinity is full of cold ears  
among gates and tenacious nauesous roses  
and the lewd roses and the love  
at last give forth their nauesous oxide.  
I could rescue massacre, granule, and twisting lonely road  
from dews and windows  
with a blood colored flower head  
with imperfect diamonds in my hips.  
The lunchtime farms you in its mortal ice.  
Showering a ribbon  
Gathered in the warm thunder.  
A mist flowing will breathe  
the dilute electricity of a planet.  
Not transforming is a form of living.  
Shut up and pulled out like a light.  
Against the cold femininity, many spoiled pamphlets.  
A loaf of bread baked with callous joy and salt.
