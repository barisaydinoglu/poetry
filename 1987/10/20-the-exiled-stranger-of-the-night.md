The Exiled Stranger Of The Night
--------------------------------
If you were not the lemon the incredulous moon  
cooks, sprinkling its grape across the city.  
I want you to wake on my finger.  
Green and changeless mother,  
the bed mingling from my mouth.  
What is this technique but a memory fell of its aspens?  
Shall we keep going?  
  
Come with me to the imbroglio of darkness.  
We get the feeling  
they must lots to make  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but brambles.  
Perhaps they are not scratched.
