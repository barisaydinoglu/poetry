The Stealing Of A God Down A City
---------------------------------
And meetings of exiled hand I'd do it for the curtain in which you perform  
for the mirrors of green you've flowed.  
The salt protects in kissing your ears.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
grow of quivers and pullulations  
and the profound salts  
of his native land?  
A dilute ship day  
how divulging is the handsome pin and it's free flasks?  
Coral.  
A toe and a foot  
standing the boulevard.  
  
Only fragrance of strawberry, just the  
kiss, nothing but  
it. Magnolium.  
The earth great twisting lonely roads are flew.  
In the opaque opaque silvery shoulder of the water. Felicity is gone, the subject has conducted.  
And river banks and planetariums.  
Transluscent cashmire clay to my negligent ribbon!  
Fewer and fewer  
loiter about another mode of decency.  
The domestic tryst gave it respect.  
Outside the boulevard like graphite.  
Return to the homeland of the friendships.
