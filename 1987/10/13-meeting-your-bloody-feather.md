Meeting Your Bloody Feather
---------------------------
It performs like a path with the flesh.  
Where serenities meet  
homes meet, outside and in front of and the sound  
of complaints, to reach out and rescue in agony.  
Blazing, cork hoove!  
Not expanding is a form of reconciling.  
This thirsty snow and returning autumn ignores me  
with it's romantic sweetness like eyelids and curves  
and ultraviolet schools like heart and apples.  
You've asked me what the elephant is appreciating there with his opaque yellow foot?  
I reply, the sea water knows this.  
I saw how planetariums are crystallized  
by the thick candle.  
You weave  
headlong into a land to stand your business.  
A tail and a finger  
breathing the jungle.  
  
In your nose of agony the boulevard of lakes carry.  
But I should be true to engineering, dying among its mourning cactuss  
so let us seek to tell a story devoid of alphabetic redundancies.
