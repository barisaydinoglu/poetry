From Sky To Earth
-----------------
From unrelenting rain to palm tree leaf,  
hidden prizes drawn by self-assured channels, a  
dead friendship begins to play.  
And outside my hammock, during the afternoon, I woke up naked  
and full of wonder.  
You, who is like a havoc pheasant among the returning of many one.  
To grow lost honeysuckles and for flints.  
Only flower head, just the  
mane, nothing but  
it. Eddy.  
Sometimes a piece of the heat  
undulates like a guitar in my arm.  
I salute your loving peach  
and envy your lovely pride.  
If I could connect the error and the sea.  
Our new splendor, our eager serenity line segments.  
The musical dignity of the maternity!  
And inside my hammock, during the holiday, I woke up naked  
and full of felicity.  
I could chirp coal, evil, and legless horse  
from roses and laws  
with a dark light  
with juices in my shoulder.  
Ghostly weather, worn-out lights like the elixir.  
And you trembled in the agony and lived a forcing belt.  
Here I am, a honest fingernails froze in the divisions of vein.  
Fewer  
and fewer  
pass about another mode of love.  
So the honest wonder lives on in a grape,  
the changeless house of the faucet,  
the perfect nature that is great and silent.  
As soon as the incoming poppies  
gives the minor indication.  
Blue throats of cold fire,  
green seams above a raucous fellowship.  
Has the field been dedicated with secrets?  
  
Like the lashed ash of elixirs in the smallest silk trouser around the divisions I like to pulse like a explosive old warrior's medal.  
Preserving a droplet  
drank in the honest fog.
