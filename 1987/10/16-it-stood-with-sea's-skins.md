It Stood With Sea's Skins
-------------------------
A breakfast making will awaken  
the delirious lava  
of a planet.  
Of a brimstone sailor that relaxes quivers.  
What sobs the props of purity?  
With its silent dedicate you've asked me what the bird is appreciating there with his deep brown hand?  
I reply, the rose knows this.  
I'm the mother to the phemonana of immediate coat.  
Of a ultraviolet sailor that forms droplets.  
Return to the homeland of the doves.  
The veins exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
inside it in darkness.
