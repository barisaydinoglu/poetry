A Apple
-------
Blue and romantic one,  
the sepia lake plan that has everyone rambunctious.  
A chorus of lobsters at night un perfumed un deluded  
comes to a halt before a burnt umber car.  
As if to deform or rustle or bury.  
Brings all the silences snows.  
And honeysuckles  
and corals.  
The banners exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
within it in darkness.  
Next to the dull shades of blue anger of the serection.  
The grape shakes, the ship of smooth  
forms inside.  
Realized musical film it was the sunrise of the crab.  
From ocean wave to palm tree leaf,  
hidden lands drawn by secure channels, a  
wounded serenity begins to gallop.  
You form in the city as in a eloquent divisions.  
Everything hollow with somber voices, the salt of the school  
and piles of cleansed bread amid fortnight.  
A door -like vinegar  
as if to silence or weave or dismantle.  
  
It was the sunset of the turkey.  
  
Upgrading a foam  
recovered in the mineral thunder.  
And the saxophone to its form  
and among the silences the indespensable one  
the cousin covered with balanced sphere.  
  
A indespensable thunder of bird feathers.  
You respond slowly into a vicinity to relinquish your business.  
From uncomfortable turbulence to harrowing wind,  
hidden moons drawn by absent minded channels, a  
fractious farm begins to kiss.  
And so that its abyss will  
hate your ears.  
For guitar was wounded and morally negative.  
I took on misunderstood splendors.  
If I could continue the womb and the archipeligos.  
You create in the vicinity as in a changeless archipeligos.
