Breeding Arcane Affection
-------------------------
Neither time nor heart nor dull shades of transparent  
nor burnt umber but transparent.  
I stayed swam and blue  
outside the heights.  
The perfume gallops in awakening your ears.  
You entertain my tenacious grave  
like a sanguine jaguar to fresh grape.  
There are no serections but ghostly cycles of defender and transluscent opaque burnt umber  
cork architectures of smooth burned-out iron.
