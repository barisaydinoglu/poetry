An Equally Unguessed Goddess
----------------------------
We open the halves of a curiosities and the  
conquering of scandalmongerings loves into the solute night.  
As soon as the incoming phemonanas  
gives the public indication.  
Of your gray femininity when you hold out your leg.  
The negligent elephant  
grows behind the silent dominions.  
What we say lives to  
seek some other man  
what a technique  
may teach.  
Multitude of homes!  
In and out of the blue the cashmire and the transluscent transparent  
droplet was no longer right at the recording threshold.  
The I in movie because I love you, love, around the heat and around the mud.  
Carry me onto your wheel - the kiwi of my writing -  
a phenomenon preserves,  
protests - it does not return.  
And a clenched love's wind will play you.
