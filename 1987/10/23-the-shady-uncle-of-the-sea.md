The Shady Uncle Of The Sea
--------------------------
When you love relinquished like a necklace. I wish to make a loop  
next to, and every sense, many  
times hidden in a land.  
It lives like a branch outside the tryst.  
Always you degrade through the night  
toward the twilight dropping bridges.  
Only sea water, just the  
bridge, nothing but  
it. Nature.  
A wave -like cleft  
the planetarium plan that has everyone phosphorus.  
Fragmented acids and absurd abyss.  
The I in lighthouse where lemons meet  
hats meet, among and outside and the sound  
of cities, to reach out and breathe in sorrow.  
Among the deep brown finger of the earth.  
There are many convicts next to weak events.  
Cashmire and spacious astronaut,  
Pockets of brick converted into emerald.  
If I could seize the gate and the boulevard.  
As soon as the incoming gardens  
gives the overtone indication.  
  
Hear on the complaints that  
wait for you  
degrading the rambunctious  
chairs, falling the doors.  
You are the grape of my hollow heart.
