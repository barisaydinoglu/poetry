Here I Entertain You
--------------------
Like the burned-out iron of windows an absent minded wood paneling making a sensual thing of a likely meeting with a cousin.  
Wonder is gone, the subject has fluttered.  
Your kis is a precision filled with mourning ripple.  
As if to harass or breathe or  
wet.
