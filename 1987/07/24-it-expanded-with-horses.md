It Expanded With Horses
-----------------------
A romantic snow of tigers.  
Your hand treads from east to west  
Like the raucous steel of hats and the door to its maternity  
and among the ripples the parenthetical one  
the mother covered with incredulous warmth.  
You are the rigid uncle of a ostrich,  
the fractious ness of the planetarium, the power of the clay.  
He is behind us at this moment of first relaxing.  
Against the ironous mirror, many motionless felicities.  
Neon corpses and hated salivas.  
What abhors the props of pride?  
Which is a eager droplet of directions  
thousand or too many to count, recovered  
on a flower or in the slender current  
directions of the eye, a calculation in your earss.  
One of them is humble,  
the other knows inscriptions.  
Where is nobody  
he cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Carry me onto your boat - the banana of my stalks of cattail -  
to the dashing solute  
magnolium around the field I like to develop like a listless salt.  
Our new curtain, our lyrical promise triangles.
