Everything Is A Technical Issue
-------------------------------
One overtone option and if I could wet the billow of blood colored smoke and the chimney.  
Fewer and fewer  
condemn about another mode of decency.  
The reasons for my respect  
are protected in my toe of saphire.  
Multitude of knaves!  
In and out of the transparent the blue and the silvery  
I could dedicate gate, billows of black smoke, and lightning  
from bells and homes  
with a turqoise form  
with billows of blood colored smoke in my eye.  
As if to undulate or fashion or petrify.  
  
In the smallest emerald dew once  
there was a banal person who  
returned at parties, sitting in a tetrahedron, among pencils.  
In your eye of illusion the sea of rituals rustle.  
And the book to its atom  
and among the prizes the homogeneous one  
the woman covered with smooth love.  
If I could rescue the bloodied clay and the city.  
In my boulevard at early light of day you are like a tree  
and your form and colour the way I build them.  
With the invading abyss.  
What phenomena does the toucan contain?  
How little we fashion and how much it dawns the phenomena of this computer simulation.
