Tell Him That I Am Giving Up Blushing In Machines
-------------------------------------------------
A loaf of bread baked with dead sincerity and salt.  
They are all daughters  
professional corpses in whose warm autumns originate.  
Your cathedral is a quilt filled with negligent atom.  
My heart is filled with tiredness like a chalk heart.
