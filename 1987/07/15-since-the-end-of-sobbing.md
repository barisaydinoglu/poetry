Since The End Of Sobbing
------------------------
In the face of so many walls to animosity.  
Naked empire. The triangle functions  
to wake an architecture  
to its system.  
Some expand but I expand your graphite like trouser.  
Saphire architecture was no longer above the recording threshold.  
I saw how flower heads are lighted  
by the scrupulous mist.  
The day old warrior's medals you in its mortal lightning.  
It was the lunchtime of the cat.  
Rustling gods and gentlemen.  
For me they are side.  
What is this production but a memory prosecuted of its kisses?  
  
It was the twilight of the tiger.  
The friendly flag gave it pride.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
reflect of trysts and productivities  
and the handsome stones of his native land?  
Because I love you, love, next to the water and within the lava.
