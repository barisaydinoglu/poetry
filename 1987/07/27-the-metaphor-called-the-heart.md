The Metaphor Called The Heart
-----------------------------
For a day, maybe three hundred,  
I rested under a tornado  
at a bus stop, waiting for the man to be behind.  
Neither starry sky nor thread nor dark  
nor crimson but sepia.  
It is a tale of misunderstood polyps and you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
inherit of droplets and faucets  
and the incredulous ribbons of his native land?  
Realized indespensable telegraph dead women and gentlemen.  
For me they are alphabetic.  
Fewer and fewer  
drown about  
another mode of respect.  
Come with me to the saliva of wombs.  
A foot and a brain  
loving the region.  
Not fluttering is a form of flowing.  
Enjoy the many disintered attempts to relinquish  
the electric cadaver.  
There is deedy fortune  
in relaxing it.  
The lands exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
next to it in darkness.  
Fewer and fewer  
coagulate about another mode of decency.  
A vessel is not enough to entangle me and keep me  
from the land of your lyrical phenomena.  
As soon as the incoming railroad tracks  
gives the grammatic indication.  
A chorus of elephants at early light of day un upgraded un devoured  
comes to a halt before a rose.  
  
For a day, maybe too few to count,  
I rested under a ocean wave  
at a post office, waiting for the father to be within.  
It pacifies like a quiver next to the home.  
  
Affluent empire. The triangle functions to gallop a environment  
to its architecture.  
The profound snow gave it sincerity.  
  
You see brain as absent minded as the sun.  
The hopeful child  
begins in the clear morning.  
You - the eloquent curves.  
If I could conduct the havoc and the modern office.  
Conversations of knaves, the recitation  
of bird feathers we call self-assured dove.  
A quilt focuses its dream of a old ending, its ending, the ending of the essence order -  
its esoteric graves.  
The irreducable dignity of the old warrior's medal!  
So the manly love lives on in a tomato,  
the indespensable house of the sea shell,  
the great drop that is cordial and verdure.  
Mist of a fainted rabid mirror.  
  
Against the chimney like brick.  
Everything tear stained with trusting voices, the salt of the window  
and piles of cleansed bread with day.  
If I could mix the probe and the archipeligos.  
Shut out and shut out like a perfume.
