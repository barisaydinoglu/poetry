From What Are Flowers Grew
--------------------------
How fluttering is the serendipidous legume and it's celestial throats?  
Always you replace through the fortnight  
toward the midnight filtering branches.  
My heart moves from being fragmented to being domestic. Beligerance and smooth sand - starss in the sky of panic.
