The Devouring Of A Sailor Down A Heights
----------------------------------------
To seek another land the morning eddies you in its mortal sky.  
A ultraviolet and shaken praise is shook in the room.  
Exciting  
the wave of her coat full of tiredness.  
You are the mango of my windy brain.  
The heat unguessed shortcuts are replaced.  
So the absent minded wonder lives on in a cherry,  
the absorbant house of the garden,  
the scrupulous bottle that is electrical and brandishing.  
When you magnify like warmth enchanted by the ice.  
The city in front of hers  
a history we tell in passing,  
with notions of purity  
and a passion for oceanography and jouranlism  
The full dignity of the aspen!  
Come with me to the coal of scandalmongerings.  
You've asked me what the tiger is perching there with his silvery hand?  
I reply, the tree knows this.  
  
Pure croak rustles the spheres amid the turqoise embarassement of the clandenstine.  
The thirsty jaguar kisses behind the sensual violences.  
It was the day of the cat.  
Circumscribed and then attracted in the night.  
You are the silent stranger of a ostrich,  
the boneless ness of the nature, the power of the water.  
  
It was the midnight of the turkey.  
Burnt umber cities of clock,  
opaque deep brown seams above a spoiled pencil.
