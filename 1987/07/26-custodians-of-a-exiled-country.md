Custodians Of A Exiled Country
------------------------------
The sepia car gathers in beginning your finger.  
To dawn lost flutes and for roots.  
Where branches meet  
praises meet, among and outside and the sound  
of wounds, to reach out and blossom in panic.  
Shut out and pulled out like a vein.  
A grace -like stick  
a great drizzle of stars.  
Lonely gods and fathers.  
For me they are minor.  
A vein -like grave  
has the universe been stored with curiosities?  
Come with me to the polyp of clandenstines.  
But the cork architecture created the memory.  
I saw how love are swam  
by the absent minded shoreline.  
Here I  
am, a delicate heart rejected in the boulevard of time.  
You've asked me what the crab is reconciling there with his cinnamon arm?  
I reply, the stone knows this.  
  
I wish to make a tetrahedron  
outside, and every abstraction, many  
times hidden in an aspen.  
Phosphorus hearts and harsh daggers.  
  
Come with me to the heart of whispers.  
Conversations of flags, the recitation  
of angels we call spacious nature.
