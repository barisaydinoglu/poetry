An Equally Cordial Father
-------------------------
Nothing but your blazing curves.  
Shall we go forward?  
Around the green shoulder of the sky.  
Neither salt nor jar nor ultraviolet  
nor cashmire  
but sunburst orange.  
Sincerity is gone, the subject has attracted. The stain sets on its tremulous mare  
living deep brown circuss over the jungle.
