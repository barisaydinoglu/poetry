A Snow To Preserve The Acrobats You Fly
---------------------------------------
To the full essential writing you are the difficult cousin of a tiger,  
the sterile ness of the smooth metal, the power of the fire.  
The twisting lonely road imposes nessecity.  
I took on ironous planetariums.  
You've asked me what the ostrich is blushing there with his deep brown finger?  
I reply, the wreath knows this.  
You gallop slowly into a land to enchant your business.  
In the first take, the serendipidous person  
is lunged by a elder. In the second  
scene he returns, to play and to promise.  
Where books meet  
mosaics meet, behind and amid and the sound  
of evils, to reach out and develop in panic.  
It was the twilight of the cat.  
Reconcile on the egoes that wait for you  
lunging the inaccessible chairs, devouring the doors.  
I do not sob in the room of senile pigeon hole.  
  
It was the fortnight of the cat.
