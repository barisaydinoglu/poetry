Proof Of Nocturnal Sense
------------------------
Where lights meet  
hearts meet, in and amid and the sound  
of brambles, to reach out and drink in fear.  
It was  
a frightened  
business of moth and smokes.  
Drinking the farm of her starlight full of joy.  
It is a tale of listless granules I could refresh shrapnel, funeral, and legume  
from serendipities and faucets  
with a red crown  
with sticks in my brain.  
And the rose to its momentum  
and  
among the tigers the aquatic one  
the child covered with absent minded affection.  
The gleaming kiss gave it felicity.  
One of them is absorbant,  
the other knows productions.  
Where is everybody  
he says, and when can we see what  
is  
going to happen?
