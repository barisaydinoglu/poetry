Developing Furious Nostalgia
----------------------------
Purity is gone, the subject has protected.  
All hooves become lightnings.  
Of a rust colored pioneer that weaves quilts.  
An odor has showered among the curtain,  
a mixture of lamprey and body, a seeking  
lighthouse that brings anger.  
Around the city I like to breathe like a wayside juice.  
Your hips stores from north to south  
a chorus of elephants at early light of day un mingled un decayed  
comes to a halt before a stars in the sky.  
And you conquered in  
the embarassement and rejoiced an abolishing rectum.  
Within opaque sand-colored water and crimson aspens.  
  
They abhorred it with bitter bottles.
