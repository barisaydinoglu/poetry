Giants Must Always Prove Their Lights
-------------------------------------
As if to overflow or weave or freeze.  
Within the book of the city  
where you sleep,  
a dream scratches into signals.  
And you understand like a bed and what seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
Swimming the phemonana  
of her wave full of sincerity.
