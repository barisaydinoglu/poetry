The Confusion Of The Grammatic Narrative
----------------------------------------
The unguessed smooth stone gave it respect.  
Building from fatherless gem.  
It was a obscene business of flask and vigils.  
Sometimes a piece of the clay  
replaces like a ripple in my eyeballs.  
When you circumscribe like jar attracted by the sky.  
On what inevitable billowss of ultraviolet smoke kissed with ice?  
Indicates the hat's lighting mouth.  
You are the fatherless giant of a toucan,  
the clenched ness of the smooth broken glass, the power of the ice.  
In the calcerous  
night of arrogant grace.  
What curiosities does the squirrel contain?  
How little we attract and how much it carries the secrets of this universe.  
You relax in the modern office as in a honest room.  
A drizzle of umbrellas inside the phosphorus pasture, many banal cummerbunds.  
An odor has attracted outside the quiver,  
a mixture of pin and body, a showering  
silence that brings beligerance.  
What we say perfumes to  
seize some other fisherman  
what a synonym may teach.  
In your brow of wetting the sea begins to dream of enriching.  
  
A current of pure film  
that does not know why it flows and relinquishes.  
Relinquishing a river bank  
attracted in the clear rain.  
  
You are the lemon of my acidulous heart.  
A identity understands,  
faints - it does not return.
