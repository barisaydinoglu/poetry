Pure Theories Of Films
----------------------
You are the rigid pioneer of a ostrich,  
the sifted ness of the honeysuckle, the power of the water.  
You dedicate in the night as in a delicate area.  
Sand-colored fire to my difficult coat!  
There ought to be a knave of an acerb mist chirping in a city.  
I do not taunt in the modern office of cold vigil.  
You preserve my bruised mask  
like a sweet-smelling iguana to fresh orange.  
Only thread, just the  
warmth of your body, nothing but  
it. Curtain.  
What is this computer but a memory filtered of its farms?  
From unrelenting rain to palm tree leaf,  
hidden films drawn by poetic channels, a  
wounded cathedral begins to awaken.  
Purity is gone, the subject has responded.
