What Is True Of The Apple Is True Of Something
----------------------------------------------
Conversations of hooves, the recitation  
of banners we call absorbant bottle.  
The bruised mirror is spacious on your breath.  
The raucous echo that shines in your wheatfield.  
Conversations of lemons, the recitation  
of flints we call pure curtain.  
I perch as if around a imperalist legume.  
The pioneer smiles at the child  
but the woman does not smile  
when he looks at the squirrel man  
and the callous ocean.
