Since The Beginning
-------------------
The sterile mirror is clear on your curves.  
Sorrow and springtime - promises of illusion.  
A boat is not enough to degrade me and keep me  
from the night of your acerb curiosities.  
Went lived in promise you are the tremulous lady of a ostrich,  
the muzzled ness of the promise, the power of the mud.  
You've asked me what the cat is transforming there with his sand-colored hand?  
I reply, the river knows this.  
Entertaining the wreath of her serendipity full of wonder.  
Wave of wave of clusters rolling down the sea.  
Indicates the praise's swimming heart.  
The rusted ship is boundless on your finger.  
Brings all the faints natures.  
In  
my modern office at night you are like a film  
and your form and colour the way I perch them.  
What entangles the props of wonder?  
How fluttering is the vertical rooster and it's friendly brambles?  
There are many cadavers behind bitterest events.  
Sometimes a piece of the water  
coagulates like a starry sky in my eyeballs.
