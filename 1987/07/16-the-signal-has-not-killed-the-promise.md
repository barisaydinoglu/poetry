The Signal Has Not Killed The Promise
-------------------------------------
Pioneer of the depths of my curves - your entertaining  
stills your deedy regard as though it were water.  
Full stop.  
A signal rescues,  
falls - it does not return.  
Draw from it the pale  
identity of its own study.  
  
Somebody here is waiting for the next map.  
Door. You heard yourself for crystallizing.
