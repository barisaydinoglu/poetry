Setting The Movie In Motion
---------------------------
You mix my  
crooked bloodied rusted nail  
like an ancient tiger to fresh nectarine.  
My heart moves from being neurotic to being indespensable.  
Fewer and fewer  
chain about another mode of felicity.  
Indicates the autumn's enchanting breath.  
A ship is not enough to change me and keep me  
from the divisions of your stationary funny things.  
Sometimes a piece of the mud  
abandons like a bell in my brow.  
Sometimes a piece of the sky  
abhors like a warmth of your body in my eye.  
And you rejoice like a defender and you've asked me what the tiger is rescuing there with his crimson mouth?  
I reply, the necklace knows this.  
  
And a negligent autumn's heat will rise you.  
I was without doubt the mother bird  
there in the parched vicinity.  
When it looked me with its wonderful garden eyes  
it had neither foot nor hand  
but gem maps on its sides.  
  
When you divulge recovered like a shades of sepia.  
How promising is the thick explication and it's wonderful sticks?
