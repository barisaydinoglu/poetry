The Epiphany Of The Chimney
---------------------------
Under the university like ash.  
Full stop.  
The law awakens in playing your mouth.  
Some gallop but I love your brick like key.  
You dedicate my rusted viola  
like a enduring squirrel to fresh plum.  
One of them is essential,  
the other knows productions.  
Where is somebody  
she says, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Pockets of salt converted into gem.  
Full stop.  
Be guided by the electric nature's silvery car.  
To seek another land it was an arrogant business of uranu and throats.  
To entertain lost trysts and for eddies.
