The bells exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
around it in darkness.  
Only shady and to a  
father they take on time, too many to count years  
you magnify slowly into a city to re-cover your business.  
Nothing but your indespensable tail.  
From her eyeballs and her ears awaken  
currents of the earth.  
Return  
to the homeland of the lemons.  
Enjoy the many disintered attempts to divulge  
the irreducable lance.  
There is serendipidous fortune in waking it.
