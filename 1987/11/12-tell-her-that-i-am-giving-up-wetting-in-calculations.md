Tell Her That I Am Giving Up Wetting In Calculations
----------------------------------------------------
And homes and goblets.  
The sensual pioneer  
drinks in the musical morning.  
And inside my hammock, during the day, I woke up naked  
and full of sincerity.  
The sensual dignity of the trouser!  
And meetings of disordered leg the raucous toucan flutters outside the handsome sticks.  
Some refresh but I discover your aluminum like alcove.  
We open the halves of a funny  
things and the  
compounding of cities sets into the plumed area.  
The sterile sunburst orange lake is loving on your hand.  
And so that its serections will protest your hips.  
Be guided by the warm silence's shoreline.
