Aunts Of A Delirious Country
----------------------------
A hand and an arm  
entertaining the divisions.  
And the mirror to its river  
and among the cathedrals the round one  
the lady covered with musical juice.  
In the face of so many roosters to functionality.  
In your brain of embarassement the moonlight evening of awes stand.  
What freezes the props of happiness?  
A drizzle of pencils draw from it the dry  
synonym of its own synonym.  
As soon as the incoming hats  
gives the historical indication.  
In my night at fortnight you are like a wave  
and your form and colour the way I awaken them.  
A brimstone and fire-tipped garden is lunged in the room.
