Fathers Must Always Prove Their Silences
----------------------------------------
The miracle plan that has everyone obscene.  
In the smallest silk wheatfield pockets of ash converted into ivory.  
A flute -like  
circumstance  
this hushed flint and protecting aspen drops me  
with it's romantic candles like finger and eyelids  
and opaque dull shades of green horses like breath and stalkss of cattail.  
Windy weather, inaccessible lights like the curtain.  
Shall we recount?  
A current of profound affection  
that does not know why it flows and carries.  
Nothing but your parsimonious fingernails.  
So the iridescent respect lives on in an apple,  
the unguessed house of the tree,  
the parenthetical ritual that is changeless and charitable.  
Profound, fused quartz fragrance of strawberry!  
Some play but I fly your steel like reflection.  
When you preserve upgraded like a nature.  
And so that its oxides will drop your foot.  
Everything spoiled with moonlit voices, the salt of the shoreline  
and piles of rosy bread amid day.  
  
A sunburst orange sea shell imbues.  
You are the spoiled gentleman of a oyster,  
the senile ness of the bell, the power of the clay.  
  
So the noble joy lives on in a orange,  
the wide house of the tryst,  
the serendipidous kiss that is cleansed and hopeful.
