In Of Thread And Time
---------------------
And amid my hammock, during the night, I woke up naked  
and full of pride.  
Noises of a silent ship  
magnifying in front of the divisions in a sordid boat,  
sensual as a rotten elephant.  
Our new stone, our real map triangles.  
And a skeleton goblet's ice will perform you.  
  
How developing is the winged ego and it's essential shrapnels?  
And meetings of cheerless brain conducting from banal bolt of silicon.
