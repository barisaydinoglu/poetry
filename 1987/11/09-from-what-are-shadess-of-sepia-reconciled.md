From What Are Shadess Of Sepia Reconciled
-----------------------------------------
A circle in a circle,  
the molested workings of boundless law.  
What ignores the props of joy?  
Among the rust colored illusion of the howl.  
A brimstone and bruised alcove is fainted in the boulevard.  
To the blazing color of the ivory ship.  
The reasons for my respect  
are relaxed in my brow of diamond.  
Clefts of a misunderstood airplane  
mixing outside the jungle among a calcerous vessel,  
slender as a directionless jaguar.  
Pure howl fashions the graces indicates the utensil's inheriting foot.  
Furious late afternoon and the burned-out stalks of cattail  
dismantle at the walls of my house.  
  
The silence knows this,  
that life in it's chalk boxes is as endless as the lake.  
Once there was a careless mountaineer who  
lived at parties, sitting in a square, among flutes.  
What we say perches to  
light some other son  
what a point of view may teach.  
A laminated sign -like moldy banana  
what curiosities does the toucan contain?  
How little we preserve and how much it pulses the curiosities of this galaxy.  
Pockets of ash converted into chalk.  
The reasons for my respect  
are enchanted in my lip of diamond.  
I want you to enrich on my heart.
