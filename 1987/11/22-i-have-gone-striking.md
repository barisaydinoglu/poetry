I Have Gone Striking
--------------------
In my land at morning you are like a shoreline  
and your form and colour the way I love them.  
Sometimes a piece of the wind  
forces like a cluster in my ears.  
A chorus of jaguars at midnight un rescued un chained  
comes to a halt before a stalks of cattail.  
Crack me and let my substance divulge.  
Cashmire and cordial mountaineer,  
like vortices devouring outside natures.  
They executed it with bitterest maps.  
Realized ancient jar realized sanguine droplet condemn me and let my substance gather.  
Indicates the flag's treading brain.  
In the face of so many self-productions to animosity.  
The heights next to hers  
a tale we tell in passing,  
with notions of sincerity  
and a passion for oceanography and mountaineering  
  
In your eye of embarassement the sea of stars develop.  
The tryst mutates, the friendship of vertical  
chirps  
in.  
With transluscent sunburst orange water and opaque cashmire momenta.  
Fewer and fewer  
pity about another mode of tiredness.  
There ought to be a momentum of an affluent droplet fluttering in a chimney.  
It was the holiday of the turkey.  
I  
want you to reflect on my finger.  
What dies the props of pride?  
  
It was the sunrise of the pheasant.  
Amid the ultraviolet fear of the ego.
