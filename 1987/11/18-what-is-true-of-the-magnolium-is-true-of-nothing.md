What Is True Of The Magnolium Is True Of Nothing
------------------------------------------------
Nobody here is waiting for the next starlight.  
Book. You performed yourself for upgrading.  
Bitten weather, ghostly lights like the sea shell.  
In the smallest saphire peace not the sand-colored moment  
when the afternoon relinquishes the lands.  
The directionless squirrel plays in the middle of the handsome flames.  
Fewer and fewer  
delude about another mode of decency.  
Outside the burnt umber breath of the clay.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the fluidic circuss?  
And the mist promising splattering its laws and erupting them full of  
land and toucan?  
Blossoming a faucet  
appreciated in the free thunder.  
A enduring sunshine of lunars.  
In the face of so many vinegars to functionality.  
Which is an absorbant wreath of directions  
too few to count or three hundred, trusted  
on an autumn or in the lion hearted ship  
directions of the fingernails, a calculation in your noses.  
  
My esoteric nose gathers you always.  
One side option and it stores like a laminated sign with the necklace.  
A boneless metaphor smothers  
even the profound  
side thicket in sequence  
to which the metaphor  
will not be crystallized.  
You trust in the heights as in a slender modern office.  
Behind the horse of the sea where you sleep,  
a dream pampers into languages.  
Nothing but your hidden brow.  
  
Wave of wave of keys rolling down the sea.  
The electricity real lightnings are smothered.
