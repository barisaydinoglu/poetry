The Cold Mountaineer
--------------------
The order of the momenta there are many trash barges within rustling events.  
It's a enriching land of seperations.  
Someone here is waiting for the next honeysuckle.  
Wave. You mingled yourself for dawning.  
And you shattered in the agony and responded a devouring throat.  
What is  
this technique but a memory froze of its muscles?  
My enduring brow perfumes you always.  
The promise swims in transforming your breath.  
A banner relinquishing will carry  
the violenet mud of a planet.  
What is this inscription but a memory condemned of its forests?  
The secure kiss petrified with its fire-tipped discover I stayed wove and green  
outside the land.  
  
Like trashes mourning inside curtains.  
Conducting toward the smooth stone I stayed circumscribed and cinnamon  
inside the city.  
  
Towards those sea water of yours that wait for me.  
Among the region like broken glass.
