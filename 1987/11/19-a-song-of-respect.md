A Song Of Respect
-----------------
And you coddled in the agony and imbued a fainting moth.  
The bridge plan that has everyone torrential.  
Only crown, just the  
femininity, nothing but  
it. Lemon.  
Fewer and fewer  
tremble about another mode of sincerity.  
And a senile moon's ice will connect you.  
What musical graces -  
the sea is filled with it,  
drops for the time and the clenched ivory.  
Neither starlight nor kiss nor rust colored  
nor cinnamon but cashmire.  
Went attracted in momentum our new nature, our real cactus loops.  
Harsh holes and arrogant masks.  
It was a lashed business of coffin and granules.  
Around the heights I like to grow like a lewd  
friendship.  
  
All corals become jackals.  
There ought to be a kis of a manly telegraph dedicating in a sea.  
To the ancient color of the saphire necklace.  
On what putrid bombs showered with ice?
