Meeting Your Bloody Feather
---------------------------
A triangle behind a quadrangle,  
the dead workings of sensual law. You see tail as resplendent as the clouds.  
Everything bitterest with delicious voices, the salt of the flower head  
and piles of comfortable bread inside sunrise.  
  
And essences and graces.  
Outside the divisions like ash.
