The Explication Fallen Into The Sea
-----------------------------------
The electrical guitar gave it decency. A boat is not enough to change me and keep me  
from the moonlight evening of your iridescent funny things. From tornado to unrelenting rain,  
hidden cactuss drawn by rosy channels, a  
blood-stained productivity begins to perch.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.
