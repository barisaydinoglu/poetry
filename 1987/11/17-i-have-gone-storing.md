I Have Gone Storing
-------------------
Enjoy the many  
insatiable attempts to develop  
the changeless blood.  
There is trusting fortune in reconciling it.  
Inside the transluscent crimson leg of the sky.  
Pure bloody feather understands the doves inside the rust colored embarassement of the error.  
Breathing a door  
excited in the hopeful rain.  
What eloquent souls -  
the field is filled with it,  
natures for the miracle and the hushed silken.  
I saw how essences are transformed  
by the acerb curtain.  
You - the honest hand.  
The promises exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
inside it in darkness.  
Deep brown belts of trap,  
opaque marine seams above a hated tree.  
Once there was a misunderstood stranger who  
swam at parties, sitting in a circle, among prizes.  
You see breath as hopeful as the sunshine.
