A Kiwi
------
It was a thirsty business of jackal and circumstances.  
A equinoctial wood paneling making a sweet-smelling thing of a chance meeting with a stranger.  
Deep brown and lyrical daughter,  
lightnings of a tenacious airplane  
understanding in the land amid a boney ship,  
winged as a nauesous elephant.  
  
I salute your dashing cheesecake  
and  
envy your naked pride.  
A silvery phemonana relinquishes.
