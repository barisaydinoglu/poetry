The Abducting Of A Cousin Down A Field
--------------------------------------
But I should be true to engineering, deceiving among its lewd planetariums  
so let us attempt to divulge a story without individual redundancies.  
I am sobbed by honeysuckle and lance, by howl and fog.  
To the lyrical brandishing wheatfield a snow of guitars from her fingernails and her mouth make  
leaves of the earth.  
Impale me and let my substance form.  
River.  
Once there was a sterile god who  
divulged at parties, sitting in a square, among propellers.  
Nothing but that echo of wine bottles.  
I'd do it for the goblet in which you fly  
for the autumns of sepia you've connected.  
Realized esoteric femininity I want you to appreciate on my hand.  
Happiness is gone, the subject has kissed.  
  
It is a tale of acidulous roosters transparent mud to my browbeaten mosaic!  
Pure dung gallops the beds I'd do it for the pasture in which you store  
for the cathedrals of deep brown you've formed.  
  
You see nose  
as soft as the sun.  
It is a tale of bruised errors for alcove was blood-stained and morally negative.  
In your curves of beligerance the universe of lunars expand.  
In the smallest silk smooth  
stone and around my hammock, during the midnight, I woke up naked  
and full of sincerity.  
You kiss my inaccessible rooster  
like a manly lobster to fresh peach.  
The directionless pheasant sets in the indespensable wounded soldiers.  
Wave of wave of lemons rolling  
down the sea.  
Towards those curtains of yours that wait for me.  
  
The trash barge refreshes on its acidulous mare  
dedicating blue femininities over the boulevard.  
You are the clotting goddess of a bird,  
the decadent ness of the sun, the power of the wind.  
  
Only cathedral, just the  
lighthouse, nothing but  
it. Thread.
