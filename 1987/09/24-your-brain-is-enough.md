Your Brain Is Enough
--------------------
Draw from it the bleak  
detail of its own computer.  
As if to decay or inherit or steal.  
  
Live on the flasks that wait for you  
electrifying the worn-out chairs, burying the doors.  
It's a playing  
ripple of hearts.  
  
Outside the yellow lip of the wind.
