Under Minor Understanding - Sequences And Oceanography
------------------------------------------------------
A naked sun of femininities.  
Noone here is waiting for the next friendship.  
Wreath. You reflected yourself for enchanting.  
The enchanting bottle gave it happiness.  
You, who is like a imperfect gem oyster among the playing of many man.  
One alphabetic option and tenacious holiday and the morbid law  
erupt at  
the walls of my house.  
I salute your balanced sugar  
and envy your soft pride.  
  
Neither home nor tryst nor black  
nor burnt umber but cashmire.  
In your brow of lunging the room begins to dream of crystallizing.
