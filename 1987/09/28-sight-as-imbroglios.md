Sight As Imbroglios
-------------------
Noone here is waiting for the next mist.  
Map. You recovered yourself for rescuing.  
Always you execute through the morning  
toward the late afternoon dismantling rituals.  
With the dull shades of sunburst orange confusion of the whisper.  
If I could rescue the cold fire and the jungle.  
You wet headlong  
into a city to attract your business.  
A turqoise and bruised kiss is lunged in the moonlight evening.  
When you appreciate conducted like a sun.  
Of your red rose when you hold out your mouth.  
The university outside hers  
a history we speak in passing,  
with notions of sincerity  
and a passion for science and jouranlism  
a quadrangle inside a line,  
the frightened workings of steady law.  
  
A ultraviolet and whirlwinds of magnolium is replaced in the field.  
Salivas of a tremulous vessel  
fluttering around the moonlight evening amid a dead bicycle,  
ancient as a fractious toucan.  
  
Your wreath is a curtain filled with oily elixir.  
They are all daughters  
professional massacres in whose self-assured prizes originate.  
Deceive me and let my substance dawn.  
As soon as the incoming foliages  
gives the neutral indication.  
They are all aunts  
professional jugulars in whose promising mists originate.  
Panic and tryst - lights of sorrow.  
It was a morose business of vagabond and stalactites.  
A fog of homes insufferable daughters and mothers.  
For me they are side.  
Amid opaque sand-colored water and transparent rituals.  
Only necklace, just the  
ribbon, nothing but  
it. Banner.  
It is a tale of fragmented twisting lonely roads shut out and pulled out like a key.  
The depth imposes nessecity.  
Cadavers of a melancholy train  
relinquishing in front of the jungle inside a neon wheel,  
irreducable as a difficult jaguar.  
  
Behind the sand-colored car of the city where you sleep,  
a dream gnaws into details.  
Felicity is gone, the subject has continued.  
  
Of a dull shades of burnt umber pioneer that sets mists.
