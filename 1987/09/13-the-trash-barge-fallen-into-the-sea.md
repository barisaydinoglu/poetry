The Trash Barge Fallen Into The Sea
-----------------------------------
Noone here is waiting for the next autumn.  
Magnolium. You pulsed yourself for understanding.  
For a day, maybe too few to count,  
I rested  
under a unrelenting rain  
at a bus stop, waiting for the woman to be outside.  
It  
was a neurotic business of abys and egoes.  
  
You see nose as lovely as the fog.  
On what fatherless yeasts reconciled with lightning?  
The tremulous mirror that showers in your form.  
The branches exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
inside it in darkness.  
A hand and a eye  
conducting the moonlight evening.  
Yellow and moonlit father,  
your toe inherits from north to south  
  
Yellow wounds of oblivion,  
marine seams above an acidulous grape.  
In the face of so many clefts to animosity.  
  
Only apple, just the  
defender, nothing but  
it. Ribbon.  
I salute your promising lemon  
and envy your fleeting pride.
