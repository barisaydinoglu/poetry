What Is True Of The Cathedral Is True Of Something
--------------------------------------------------
Draw from it the communist  
image of its own language.  
Not to trust or even meet  
the smooth stone of one who swims  
under me in a moonlight evening or forming to a one.  
You are the banana of my callous lip.  
Self-assured empire. The line functions to recover an architecture  
to its system.  
Showered  
and then developed in the area.  
A ship is not enough to drown me and keep me  
from the jungle of your lion hearted funny things.  
Everything communist with trusting voices, the salt of the sea water  
and piles of slender bread around twilight.
