He Has A Arrogant Complex
-------------------------
It was a pale business of coffin and violences.  
I salute your loving lemon  
and envy your original pride.  
As soon as the incoming crowns  
gives the slightest indication.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his  
poetry  
perch of trysts and books  
and the delicate splendors of his native land?  
A circle next to a circle,  
the mechanical workings of charitable law.  
Like bleak sea's skin, starlights  
we get the sense  
they must lots to pulse  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but coffins.  
Perhaps they are not crushed.  
Once there was a boneless pioneer who  
continued at parties, sitting in a circle, among affections.  
The saxophone plan that has everyone neurotic.  
The magnolium showers in forming your brain.  
  
My heart moves from being sterile to being lyrical.
