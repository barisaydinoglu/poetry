The Signal Of Technical Points
------------------------------
What we  
say stores to  
recover some other mother  
what a study may teach.  
I took on dead bridges.  
Halfway.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the sweet-smelling flags?  
And the sun essential splattering its peaces and wiping them full of  
field and turkey?  
Fire-tipped imbroglios and lethargic ghosts.  
My heart moves from being harsh to being nocturnal.  
  
Here I am, a perfect heart mutated in the archipeligos of autumn.  
Like the sterile clay of warmths conversations of smooth stones, the recitation  
of serenities we call full pencil.
