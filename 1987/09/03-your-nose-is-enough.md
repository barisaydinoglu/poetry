Your Nose Is Enough
-------------------
If you were not the lemon the incredulous moon  
cooks, sprinkling its sugar across the jungle.  
I wish to make a tetrahedron  
in, and every sight, many  
times hidden in an apple.  
Among the loitering trash barges.  
Around the night I like to create like a violenet soul.  
We get the color  
they must lots to expand  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but martyrs.  
Perhaps they are not overflowed.  
A study for machine is the lack thereof.  
  
They entangled it with blood-stained smooth rusted nails.  
Because I love you, love, in the heat and with the jungle.  
Shall we keep going?  
I saw how movies are connected  
by the scrupulous fragrance of strawberry.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
fashion of clusters and reflections  
and the absorbant peaces of his native land?  
Halfway.  
  
I imbue as if within a rustling bomb.  
Our new smooth stone, our natural saxophone line segments.
