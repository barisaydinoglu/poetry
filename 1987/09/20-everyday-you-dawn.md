Everyday You Dawn
-----------------
Nothing but that map of currents.  
I was without doubt the uncle oyster  
there in the whirlwinds of night.  
When it looked me with its smooth root eyes  
it had neither fingernails nor hips  
but glass pencils on its sides.  
A eye and a curves  
loving the universe.  
You say, what is the river bank waiting for in its deep brown forest?  
I tell you it is waiting for  
goblet like you.
