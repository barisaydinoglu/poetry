Setting The Movie In Motion
---------------------------
Come with me to the wound of lightnings.  
Mineral empire. The triangle functions to understand an architecture  
to its architecture.  
A snow of goblets we open the halves of a funny things and the  
crushing of clocks kisses into the starry university.  
Outside crimson water and deep brown ripples.  
Browbeaten twisting lonely roads and lashed pigeon holes.  
A disordered image taunts  
even the lyrical  
public night in signal  
to which the metaphor  
will not be pulsed.  
  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the absent minded peaces?  
And the sun essential splattering its bottles and compounding them full of  
field and ostrich?  
Neither shades of silvery nor hat nor rust colored  
nor sand-colored but crimson.  
Nothing but that mosaic of sea water.  
My pure eyelids promises you always.  
The fire loving seperations are cracked.  
And the banner to its flower head  
and among the railroad tracks the electrical one  
the aunt covered with verdure pencil.  
To mix lost farms and for hearts.
