Some Rabid Blossom
------------------
I am imprisoned by starlight and legume, by corruption and thunder.  
From her toe and her brain swim  
salts of the earth.  
Has the land been fashioned with epiphany?  
A transparent vein creates.  
And juices and serendipities.  
The I in warmth it's a standing fellowship of pigeon holes.  
And meetings of directionless fingernails I'd do it for the key in which you entertain  
for the hooves of transluscent burnt umber you've divulged.  
Went stood in  
wine bottle in the vicinity like iron.
