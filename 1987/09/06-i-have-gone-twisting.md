I Have Gone Twisting
--------------------
The rigid landscape that awakens in your serendipity.  
I took on phosphorus prizes.  
And a furious peace's clay will recover you.  
If you were not the peach the lovely moon  
cooks, sprinkling its orange across  
the sea.  
What we say refreshes to  
expand some other father  
what a computer  
may teach.  
The morning kisses you in its mortal heat.
