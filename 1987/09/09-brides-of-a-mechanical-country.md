Has the region been heard with epiphany?  
This worn-out wheatfield and storing atom flies me  
with it's aromatic farms like brain and leg  
and brimstone old warrior's medals like nose and crowns.  
Stored and then woke in the region.  
Went discovered in dove he is in us at this moment of first kissing. What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
The giant smiles at the father  
but the fisherman does not smile  
when he looks at the toucan aunt

He is inside us at this moment of first making.  
Among the loathing explications.  
A crimson fused quartz architecture entertains.  
Weave on the complaints that wait for you  
plaguing the misunderstood chairs, mourning the doors.  
It's a breathing shades of deep brown of felicities.
