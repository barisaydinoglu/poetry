An Equally Real Pioneer
-----------------------
Arcane, diamond pasture!  
They loathed it with listless ribbons.  
The modern office inside hers  
a history we divulge in passing,  
with notions of felicity  
and a passion for jouranlism and science  
a tetrahedron with a loop,  
the clenched workings of changeless law.  
Here I am, a steady hips brainwashed in the room of droplet.
