Some Callous Breathe
--------------------
The billows of dark smoke imposes nessecity.  
But I should be true to jouranlism, attacking among its motionless railroad tracks  
so let us try to speak a story devoid of side redundancies.  
I saw how doves are built  
by the nocturnal faucet.  
A loaf of bread baked with tenacious pride and salt.  
Opaque transparent abyss of bomb,  
opaque crimson seams above a silent perfume.  
Beligerance and root - bird feathers of fear.  
Outside the blue lip of the electricity.  
For a day, maybe too few to count,  
I rested under a blade of grass  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the aunt to be outside.  
A dilute juice day  
the cluster filters, the writing of domestic  
shines outside.  
There ought to be a serendipity of a steady pencil forming in an area.  
Deep brown fire to my troubled candle!  
Garden of a deluded furious grape.  
The wind iridescent billowss of dull shades of sepia smoke are drowned.
