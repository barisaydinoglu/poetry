Point Of View With The Moldy Banana
-----------------------------------
They trembled it with morbid alcoves.  
The astronaut smiles at the astronaut  
but the daughter does not smile  
when he looks at the lobster pioneer  
and the dry ocean.  
Clenched receptacles and difficult belts.  
You've asked me what the toucan is wetting there with his crimson eye?  
I reply, the femininity knows this.  
You are the lemon of my spoiled hips.
