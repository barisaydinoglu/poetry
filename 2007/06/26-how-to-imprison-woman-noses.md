How To Imprison Woman Noses
---------------------------
Only guitar, just the  
dew, nothing but  
it. Femininity. Carrying a warmth  
inherited in the domestic rain.  
Outside the black embarassement of the martyr.  
A finger and an arm  
protecting the chimney.  
I do not fall in the vicinity of difficult bone.  
If I could kiss the martyr and the modern office.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
preserve of bird feathers and clusters  
and the full acrobats of his  
native land?  
Sometimes a piece of the fire  
buries  
like a echo in my hand.  
Of smooth peach, spirit  
of the sun rises,  
pitied child blood, your kisses  
shower into exile  
and a droplet of saphire, with remnants of the sea.
