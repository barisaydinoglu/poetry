The Decadent Daughter

And so that its acids will attack your lip. We get the color  
they must lots to breathe  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but wastelands.  
Perhaps they are not faltered.  
Carry me onto your train - the grape of my time -  
here I am, a indespensable brain gnawn in the modern office of wheatfield.  
Of your black lake when you hold out your ears.  
You - the secure brow.  
Upgrade on the parallel howlss that wait for you  
abducting the bitter chairs, replacing the doors.  
As if to shatter or circumscribe or wet.  
  
And the lemon to its root  
and among the dews the hidden one  
the bride covered with aromatic lighthouse.  
Under the troubled thicket of hushed tryst.  
Neither jar nor stars in the sky nor rust colored  
nor  
sepia but opaque marine.  
For mane was negligent and morally neutral.  
To upgrade lost apples and for ribbons.  
As if to deceive or form or compound.  
  
Distorted people and pioneers.  
For me they are historical.  
Delicate empire. The square functions to flow a environment  
to its system.
