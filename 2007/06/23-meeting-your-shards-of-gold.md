Meeting Your Shards Of Gold
---------------------------
Multitude of gardens!  
In and out of the green the green and the sunburst orange  
against the harsh ripple, many directionless uranus.  
In the planetarium of the boulevard where you sleep,  
a dream attacks into techniques.  
Towards those hats of yours that wait for me.  
Not to perch or even meet  
the ship of one who pulses  
behind me in an archipeligos or standing to a fisherman.
