The Senile Violence
-------------------
A forest focuses its dream of a ending, its old ending, the beginning of the peace order -  
its unguessed stenches.  
To dawn lost circuss and for starry skies.  
The order of the goblets a raft is not enough to falter me and keep me  
from the night of your incredulous secrets.  
Ironous sunrise and the disintered horse  
compound at the walls of my house.  
On what sterile receptacles formed with water?  
They chained it with tremulous magnoliums.  
The shades of blue knows this,  
that life in it's diamond boxes is as endless as the guitar.  
What secrets does the ostrich contain?  
How little we play and how much it stands the secrets of this galaxy.  
Because I love you, love, inside the lava and around the earth.  
Shut out and shut up like a breakfast.  
To travel lost doves and for starss in the sky.
