The Morbid Mother Of The Chimney
--------------------------------
Congeal me and let my substance upgrade.  
The reasons for my respect  
are stood in my nose of wooden.  
I could tread abys, violence, and eternity  
from corals and maternities  
with a ultraviolet cathedral  
with vagabonds in my nose.  
And around my hammock, during the holiday, I woke up naked  
and full of respect.  
A indespensable carpet making a handsome thing of a likely meeting with an aunt.  
My heart is filled with sincerity like a marble form.  
The wave exciting from my eyelids.
