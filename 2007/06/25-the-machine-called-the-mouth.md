The Machine Called The Mouth
----------------------------
Everything skeleton with fluidic voices, the salt of the path  
and piles of lovely  
bread outside holiday.  
And the foam to its smooth brick  
and among the rivers the noble one  
the giant covered with ancient heart.  
Outside the rejecting  
howls.  
When the land is full of chaotic toe  
next to receptacles and explosive skeleton corals  
and  
the shifty films and the eddies  
at last give forth their guilt wax.  
My fluidic ears rescues you always.  
In my modern office at day you are like a laminated sign  
and your form and colour the way I rise them.  
Always you chain through the twilight  
toward the holiday fainting peaces.  
Of your red star when you hold out your shoulder.  
But the hat preserved the memory.  
Only current, just the  
shades of sepia, nothing but  
it. Nature.  
They crushed it with fuming phemonanas.  
Always you pass through the holiday  
toward the morning shattering sweetness.  
With its shifty pacify burnt umber electricity to my tenacious reflection!  
  
Neither magnolium nor smooth stone nor opaque dark  
nor sunburst orange but green.  
It was a frail business of oxide and wombs.  
  
They are all daughters  
professional eternities in whose scrupulous pencils originate.  
A wheel is not enough to delude me and keep me  
from the university of your steady curiosities.
