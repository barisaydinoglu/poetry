Under Of Movie And Stone
------------------------
They soddened it with molested prizes.  
Fewer and fewer  
fly about another mode of tiredness.  
In the first scene, the perfect custodian  
is deceived by a pioneer. In the second  
take he returns, to promise and to awaken.  
They protested it with harsh maternities.  
Your ears transforms from west to north  
it was a insatiable business of salt and errors.  
Like the rambunctious sand of trysts green oblivions of lightning,  
green seams above a windy reflection.  
I salute your resplendent wine  
and envy your cordial pride.
