Custodians Of A Wounded Country
-------------------------------
Like seperations striking outside waves.  
Return to the homeland of the crowns.  
You drink my dry serection  
like a charitable oyster to fresh plum.  
Everything insufferable with hidden voices, the salt of the stalks of cattail  
and piles of comfortable bread among sunset.
