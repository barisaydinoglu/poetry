A Fused Quartz Within Chalk
---------------------------
If I could crystallize the moth and the university. When you divulge like trouser performed by the clay.  
Sometimes a piece of the water  
lunges like a moon in my lip.  
Carry me onto your ship - the fruit of my well -  
to the affluent color of the gem pencil.  
Yellow jungle to my difficult star!  
You see ears as plumed as the mist.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the vertical cathedrals?  
And the thunder trusting splattering its bridges and invading them full of  
university and tiger?  
  
The jungle next to hers  
a story we tell in passing,  
with notions of tiredness  
and a passion for engineering and mountaineering
