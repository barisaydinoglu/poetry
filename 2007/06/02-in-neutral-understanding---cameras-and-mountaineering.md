In Neutral Understanding - Cameras And Mountaineering
-----------------------------------------------------
I could develop coal, cold fire, and billows of rust colored smoke  
from smooth stones and starlights  
with a dull shades of deep brown bird feather  
with beasts in my ears. Our new current, our dashing wreath triangles.  
Pockets of graphite converted into marble.  
Of decisive plum, spirit  
of the fragrances of strawberry,  
decayed god blood, your kisses  
excite into exile  
and a droplet of saphire, with remnants of the archipeligos.  
When you fashion perfumed like a circus.  
  
Has the land been perfumed with phenomena?
