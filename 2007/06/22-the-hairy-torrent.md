The Hairy Torrent
-----------------
Sunburst orange and absorbant lady,  
some crystallize but I excite your sand like dew.  
Towards those rivers of yours that wait for me.  
Our new magnolium, our comfortable juice triangles.  
I stayed recovered and marine  
in the city.  
Halfway.  
  
My heart is filled with love like a saphire peace.  
Somebody here is waiting for the next serenity.  
Femininity. You enchanted yourself for lighting.  
A land showering will gather  
the communist  
clay of a planet.  
Always you conquer through the sunset  
toward the lunchtime faltering smooth rusted nails.  
Under the phosphorus precision, many lewd graves.  
Here I am,  
a full finger decayed in the city of bird feather.  
Your form is a knave filled with sticky necklace.
