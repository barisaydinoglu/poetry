Fragmented Angel
----------------
There are no shortcuts but weak cycles of time and green  
wheatfields of winged lewd broken glass.  
Conversations of telegraphs, the recitation  
of reflections we call winged promise.  
The sunrise foliages you in its mortal wind.  
Wave of wave of hats rolling down the sea.  
  
In your mouth of fear the room of graces promise.  
For a day, maybe three hundred,  
I rested under a blade of grass  
at a bus stop, waiting for the custodian to be in.
