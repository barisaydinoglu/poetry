He Has A Hated Complex
----------------------
And the foam to its utensil  
and among the roses the brandishing one  
the pioneer  
covered with electric warmth.  
Come with me to the throat of seperations.  
And with my hammock, during the twilight, I woke up naked  
and full of respect.  
In your hips of loitering the boulevard begins to dream of shining.  
Peace of a sobbed difficult angel.  
What epiphany does the toucan contain?  
How little  
we travel and how much it rises the mysteries of this computer simulation.  
Which is a friendly utensil of directions  
twenty-seven or too few to count, relinquished  
on an awe or in the incredulous bell  
directions of the heart, a calculation in your eyelidss.  
They buried it with directionless faucets.  
And you mutated in the embarassement and wove a hating imperfect chalk.  
Around the boulevard I like to chirp like a browbeaten rose.  
I imbue as if outside a rotten convict.  
  
I am crushed by wheatfield and noise, by flame and wind.  
Wave of wave of echoes rolling down the sea.  
In the face of so many lightnings to animosity.  
A chorus of jaguars at night un circumscribed un fainted  
comes to a halt before an angel.  
For a day, maybe thousand,  
I rested under a blade of grass  
at a post office, waiting for the mother to be inside.  
The gentleman smiles at the giant  
but  
the uncle does not smile  
when he looks at the iguana giant  
and the inaccessible ocean.  
Enjoy the many rambunctious attempts to awaken  
the secure moth.  
There is parenthetical fortune in exciting it.
