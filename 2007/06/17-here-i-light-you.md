Here I Light You
----------------
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the sweet-smelling laws?  
And the snow musical splattering its stones and compounding them full of  
field and squirrel?  
Not to crystallize or even meet  
the juice of one who flies  
outside me in a land or blushing to a cousin.  
But I should be true to jouranlism, changing among its rotten jars  
so let us seek to tell a story without aerial redundancies.  
Changeless empire. The quadrangle functions to recover an architecture  
to its system.  
And a harsh quilt's clay will enchant you.  
Realized vertical rose as if to puncture or rise or overflow.  
Enjoy the many bitten attempts to live  
the real billow of opaque opaque dark smoke.  
.  
There is angellic fortune in wetting it.  
A technique hears,  
hates - it does not return.  
Full stop.  
Tiredness is gone, the subject has rejoiced.  
Crimson lightnings of vigil,  
transparent seams above a directionless breakfast.  
  
It was a directionless business of salt and belts.  
Full stop.  
Tenacious sons and women.  
For me they are side.  
I  
connect as if in front of a barbaous rotten stump.  
A current of musical stone  
that does not know why it flows and enchants.  
The eternity sets on its directionless mare  
crystallizing sand-colored cactuss over the land.  
The windy telegraph is wide on your nose.
