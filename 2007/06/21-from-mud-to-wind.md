From Mud To Wind
----------------
But the mane circumscribed the memory. A light -like coffin  
you see ears as fresh as the fog.  
To drink lost sea water and for landscapes.  
Understanding toward the fragrance of strawberry behind the archipeligos like iron.  
Towards those snows of yours that wait for me.
