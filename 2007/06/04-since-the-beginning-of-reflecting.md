Since The Beginning Of Reflecting
---------------------------------
And the rose to its miracle  
and among the clusters the mineral one  
the god covered with fluidic eddy.  
Smokes of a morbid ship  
weaving in front of the moonlight evening inside a delirious boat,  
wonderful as a hairy elephant.
