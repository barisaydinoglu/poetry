From What Are Magnoliums Travelled
----------------------------------
Against the room like salt.  
It was the lunchtime of the jaguar.  
Like the exiled brick of bottles enjoy the many bleak attempts to promise  
the secure womb.  
There is cleansed fortune in standing it.  
A helicopter is not enough to erupt me and keep me  
from the thicket of your manly epiphany.  
When you rise upgraded like a energy.  
Of a black aunt that preserves perfumes.  
You weave in the chimney as in a musical night.  
You are the banana of my lonely leg.  
  
Has the moonlight evening been fashioned with epiphany?  
Somebody here is waiting for the next tiger.  
Fellowship. You stood yourself for blushing.  
  
It was the midnight of the ostrich.  
Our new mane, our humble defender tetrahedrons.  
  
For planetarium was morbid and morally positive.  
Like salts dropping inside serenities.  
The late afternoon bird feathers you in its mortal lightning.  
  
Outside the protesting juices.  
My electric shoulder inherits you always.
