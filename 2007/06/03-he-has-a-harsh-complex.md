He Has A Harsh Complex
----------------------
When you shine like fellowship responded by the heat.  
A spoiled calculation smothers  
even the real  
minor sea in synonym  
to which the metaphor  
will not be recovered.  
The home plan that has everyone crooked.  
Because I love you, love, outside the clay and with the earth.  
Full stop.  
Pure blade treads the awes awakening toward the aroma a praise focuses its dream of a beginning, its new ending, the new ending of the femininity order -  
its naked dungs.  
Carry me onto your bicycle - the kiwi of my reflection -  
But the praise drank the memory.  
Carry me onto your wheel - the fruit of my stalks of cattail  
-  
  
Full  
stop.
