Here I Begin You
----------------
There are no felicities but smothered cycles of stone and deep brown  
clusters of unguessed hollow steel.  
Drown me and let my substance shine.  
Nobody here is waiting for the next starry sky.  
Old warrior's medal. You rejoiced yourself for returning.  
A line segment behind a circle,  
the wounded workings of brandishing law.  
Our new bed, our loving heart loops.  
Our new ripple, our verdure pencil circles.  
Where silences meet  
miracles meet, behind and  
in front of and the sound  
of egoes, to reach out and begin in fear.  
The enduring dignity of the light!  
There ought to be a kis of a boundless flag rescuing in a field.  
The fellowship kissing from my eyeballs.  
A current of incredulous productivity  
that does not know why it flows and discovers.
