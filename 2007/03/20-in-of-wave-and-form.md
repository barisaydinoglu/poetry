In Of Wave And Form
-------------------
Realized delicate old warrior's medal in the face of so many legless  
horses to animosity. I wish to make a line  
among, and every meaning, many  
times hidden in a railroad track.  
Closed off and shut out like a stars in the sky.  
You say, what is the tryst waiting for in its crimson path?  
I tell you it is waiting for essence like you.  
Not breathing is a form of seeking.  
  
One of them is monastic,  
the other knows details.  
Where is somebody  
she exclaims, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Indicates the shoreline's reflecting curves.  
Because I love you, love, inside the clay and with the lightning.  
The warmth returning from my eyeballs.  
In the first take, the self-assured woman  
is executed by a mountaineer. In the second  
scene he returns, to enrich and to attract.  
Come with me to the vortex of stalactites.  
A domestic sun of guitars.
