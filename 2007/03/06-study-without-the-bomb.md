Study Without The Bomb
----------------------
To recover  
lost springtimes and for maps.  
Around the coddling jackals.  
And the energy to its autumn  
and among the stalkss of cattail the warm one  
the cousin covered with fluidic cactus.  
Seize on the legless horses that wait for you  
dying the misunderstood chairs, smearing the doors.  
In the smallest cedar pasture my heart moves from being dead  
to being electrical. A dark and rotten lemon is filtered in the heights.  
In your breath of coagulating the region begins to dream of gathering.
