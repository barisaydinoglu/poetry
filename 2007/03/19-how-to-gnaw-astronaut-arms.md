How To Gnaw Astronaut Arms
--------------------------
Relaxed and then lighted in the chimney.  
Pioneer of the depths of my foot - your living  
stills your careful regard as though it were fire.  
A sun of umbrellas enjoy the many brutal attempts to breathe  
the naked clock.  
There is starry fortune in recovering it.  
Appreciated and then dedicated in the area.  
Where lakes meet  
eddies meet, outside and behind and the sound  
of phlegms, to reach out and travel in panic.  
Closed off and shut out like a thread.  
A square around a circle,  
the calcerous workings of humble law.  
What is this point of view but a memory changed of its saxophones?  
What pure planetariums -  
the area is filled with it,  
saxophones for the aroma and the sterile silk.  
So the decisive honor lives on in a cherry,  
the hidden house of the knave,  
the hidden landscape that is resolute and pure.  
Shut out and pulled out like a ritual.
