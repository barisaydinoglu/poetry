Every Woman Is A Computer

But I should be true to oceanography, silencing among its bruised umbrellas  
so let us seek to tell a story devoid of neutral redundancies. Outside the yellow lip of the sky.  
There ought to be a light of a delicate bed forming in a university.  
Refreshing a transparent car  
relinquished in the delicious rain.  
Wave of wave of ships rolling down the sea.  
Only moon, just the  
shades of cashmire, nothing but  
it. Bottle.  
Acerb empire. The quadrangle functions to conduct a environment  
to its system.  
The molested bird perfumes against the delicate invasions.  
  
Absurd weather, harsh lights like the smooth ash.  
Among the delirious vicinity of burned-out goblet.
