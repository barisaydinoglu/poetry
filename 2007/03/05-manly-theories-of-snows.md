Manly Theories Of Snows
-----------------------
You see arm as delicious as the clouds. As if to sob or magnify or wet.  
When you chirp built like a bird feather.  
I pulse as if among a rabid utensil.  
In your hand of embarassement the city of precisions flutter.  
Bitten cousins and aunts.  
For me they are algorithmic.  
There are many wounded soldiers within neon events.  
The indespensable dews flew amid the blue curves of the lava.  
Which is a delicate landscape of directions  
twenty-seven or thousand, attracted  
on a old warrior's medal or in the ancient land  
directions of the hand, a calculation in your tails.
