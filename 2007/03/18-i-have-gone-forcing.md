I Have Gone Forcing
-------------------
The serendipidous mother  
showers in the sweet-smelling morning. What we say rescues to  
carry some other daughter  
what a sequence may teach.  
How waking is the human vortex and it's parenthetical serections?  
Deep brown bloody feathers of consequence,  
cashmire seams above a hairy apple.  
Wreath.
