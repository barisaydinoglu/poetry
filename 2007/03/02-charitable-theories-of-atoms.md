Charitable Theories Of Atoms
----------------------------
The promise knows this,  
that life in it's emerald boxes is as endless as the bird feather.  
Not the blue moment  
when the twilight dawns the tigers.  
I wish to make a triangle  
next to, and every color, many  
times hidden in a root.  
Halfway.  
It stands like a land amid the magnolium.  
The divisions outside hers  
a tale we  
divulge in passing,  
with notions  
of wonder  
and a passion for science and engineering
