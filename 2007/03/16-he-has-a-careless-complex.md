He Has A Careless Complex
-------------------------
Enjoy the many putrid attempts to enchant  
the warm abberation.  
There is ancient fortune in seeking it. I mingle as if amid a furious corpse.  
The mirror knows this,  
that life in it's paper-mache boxes is as endless as the pullulation.  
  
A current of domestic snow  
that does not know why it flows and wets.  
You are the orange of my rambunctious hand.
