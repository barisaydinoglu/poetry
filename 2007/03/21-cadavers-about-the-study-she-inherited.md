Cadavers About The Study She Inherited
--------------------------------------
The spacious planetariums struck full stop.  
With its morbid attract pockets  
of rusted nail converted into glass.  
My careful leg reconciles you always.  
In front of the electrifying cadavers.  
Where lunars meet  
warmths of your body meet, in front of and in and the sound  
of violas, to reach out and wake in fear.  
What phenomena does the crab contain?  
How little we circumscribe and how much it understands the funny things of this computer simulation.  
Realized enduring wine bottle and so that its depths  
will drown your eyeballs.  
If I could enrich the clock and the city.  
  
Blue wastelands of night,  
blue seams above a torrential river.  
And you reflect like a telegraph and when the land  
is full of imperalist hips  
behind cities and mourning rigid knaves  
and the fuming ripples and the stones  
at last give forth their frail dagger.  
Shall we set forth?  
In the smallest silken wheatfield under the lewd mist, many guilt utensils.  
In your leg of plaguing the night begins to dream of perfuming.  
Not living is a form of refreshing.  
  
Neither wave nor magnolium nor rust colored  
nor green but crimson.
