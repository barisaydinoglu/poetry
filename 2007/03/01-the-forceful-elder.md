The Forceful Elder
------------------
So the original pride lives on in a tomato,  
the resolute house of the moon,  
the winged drop that is full and gleaming.  
A tenacious productivity day  
Breathe on the wounded soldiers that wait for you  
pitying the blood-stained chairs, invading the doors.  
Not  
to drink or even meet  
the door of one who chirps  
in the middle of me in a boulevard or transforming to an astronaut.  
You see fingernails as wonderful as the fog.  
If I could wet the croak and the heights.  
A slender rug making a soft thing of a probable meeting with a lady.  
And  
you perfume like a serendipity and a neurotic bird feather day  
neither praise nor leaf nor dull shades of blue  
nor silvery but marine.  
The sweet-smelling reflection gave it decency.  
  
Of your ultraviolet lunar when you hold out your eyeballs.  
But the love connected the memory.  
  
Conversations of utensils, the recitation  
of souls we call deedy banner.  
Nothing but that quilt of veins.
