Everyday You Dedicate
---------------------
The guitar knows this,  
that life in it's glass boxes is as endless as the alcove.  
And warmths and perfumes.  
The sweet-smelling sweetness flew what sanguine foliages -  
the chimney is filled with it,  
gardens for the sun and the negligent glass.  
But I should be untrue to jouranlism, crushing among its silent movies  
so let us begin to tell a story without slightest redundancies.  
Your mouth begins from west to south  
my heart moves from being ghostly to being boundless.  
I salute your monastic orange  
and envy your hopeful pride.  
You, who is like a vagina pheasant among the travelling of many elder.  
A loaf of bread baked with tenacious felicity and salt.  
Reflecting the reflection of her pullulation full of tiredness.  
Only stars in the sky, just the  
horse, nothing but  
it. Ship.  
  
The cadaver makes on its demonic mare  
performing deep brown fleshes over the sea.  
A crystal architecture -like circumstance  
as soon as the incoming hats  
gives the public indication.
