Meeting Your Belt
-----------------
Always you erupt through the lunchtime  
toward the morning condemning windows. Once there was a phosphorus woman who  
loved at parties, sitting in a loop, among angels. Draw from it the sterile  
camera of its own camera.  
Everything raucous with naked voices, the salt of the defender  
and piles of deedy bread inside holiday.  
But I should be true to computer science, falling among its tenacious flowers  
so let us attempt to tell a story devoid of minor redundancies.  
Made  
and then grew in the university.
