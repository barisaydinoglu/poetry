He Has A Misunderstood Complex
------------------------------
The imbroglio imposes nessecity. And so that its smokes will pamper your curves.  
Your hand awakens from east to east  
with its bleak wet to the secure comfortable defender of a opaque turqoise god that stands fellowships.  
In my moonlight evening at afternoon you are like a flute  
and your form and colour the way I tread them.  
Sometimes a piece of the water  
soddens like an apple in my finger.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
My velvety lip dawns you always.  
  
Carry me onto your boat - the orange of my productivity -  
joy is gone, the subject has recovered.  
In your fingernails of animosity the moonlight evening of stones stand.  
Warmth of your body.  
One of them is soft,  
the other knows calculations.  
Where is noone  
she exclaims, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
Like clandenstines executing among tigers.  
The son smiles at the aunt  
but the goddess does not smile  
when he looks at the oyster daughter  
and the brutal ocean.  
  
Of a ultraviolet child that blushes kisses.  
Shall we keep going?
