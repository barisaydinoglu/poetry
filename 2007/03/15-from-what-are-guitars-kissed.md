From What Are Guitars Kissed
----------------------------
Not to shower or even meet  
the hat of one who gallops  
in the middle of me in a thicket or lighting to a man.  
Return to the homeland of the ribbons.  
When the universe is full of fire-tipped breath  
in jugulars and imperalist careless roses  
and the weak autumns and the veins  
at last give forth their cheerless city.  
In your eye of pampering the city begins to dream of creating.  
  
And a boney flower's ice will wet you.  
Time.  
Not to perform or even meet  
the mirror of one who dedicates  
in me in a room or promising to a woman.  
Serendipity of a shook explosive acrobat.  
Like the directionless brick of phemonanas you discover my absurd bloodied aluminum  
like a fluidic jaguar to fresh lemon.  
It's a rejoicing lake of cadavers.  
  
Not blushing is a form of flying.  
A clouds of praises our new stars in the sky, our mineral cactus circles.
