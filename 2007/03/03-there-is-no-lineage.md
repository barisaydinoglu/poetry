There Is No Lineage
-------------------
Like the rambunctious sand of forms with its muzzled preserve a morbid home day  
this communist landscape and standing lake mourns me  
with it's somber magnoliums like fingernails and mouth  
and gray precisions like eyelids and flutes.  
Your finger mixes from south to south  
wave of wave of forests rolling down the sea.  
Always you imprison through the afternoon  
toward the fortnight  
compounding sea shells.  
Outside the lunar of the vicinity where you sleep,  
a dream undulates into signals.  
It's a breathing curtain of alarms.  
Neither echo nor dew nor blood colored  
nor crimson but cashmire.  
The lava eloquent abberations are gnawn.  
  
What we say chirps to  
continue some other elder  
what a metaphor may teach.  
I want you to hear  
on my lip.  
You see ears as great as the clouds.  
It was a neurotic business of rooster and vaginas.  
  
Went transformed in forest the reasons for my respect  
are trod in my tail of cedar.  
Like the chaotic sand of lights for a day,  
maybe million,  
I rested under a palm tree leaf  
at a post office, waiting for the man to be in front of.
