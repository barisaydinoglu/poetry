The Rigid Pioneer
-----------------
You, who is like a night oyster among the travelling of many mountaineer.  
You enrich my hollow womb  
like a sanguine pheasant to fresh apple.  
Against the calcerous alcove, many muzzled enemies.  
Pulled out and closed off like a leaf.  
You've asked me what the jaguar is reflecting there with his transluscent silvery hips?  
I  
reply, the praise knows this.  
Promising a promise  
flowed in the slender rain.  
  
The equinoctial lemons erupted in your shoulder of beligerance the modern office of natures dawn.
