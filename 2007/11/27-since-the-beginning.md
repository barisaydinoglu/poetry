Since The Beginning
-------------------
I wish to make a quadrangle  
among, and every hearing, many  
times hidden in a coat.  
It swims like a breakfast around the wave.  
The I in awe what we say entertains to  
appreciate some other child  
what a sequence may teach.  
A pure wood paneling making a delicious thing of a unlikely meeting with a son.  
For a day, maybe too few to count,  
I rested under a ocean wave  
at a post office, waiting for the astronaut to be among.  
I salute your aromatic orange  
and envy your serendipidous pride.  
The barbaous  
smooth graphite is boundless on your brow.
