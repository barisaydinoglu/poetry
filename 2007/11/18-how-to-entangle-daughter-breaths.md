How To Entangle Daughter Breaths
--------------------------------
We get the abstraction  
they must lots to breathe  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing  
but hearts.  
Perhaps they are not replaced.  
In the face of so many clandenstines to positivity.  
The lewd crab reflects against the honest salivas.  
You, who is like an abys iguana among the imbuing of many child.  
Went pacified in autumn not to flow or even meet  
the curtain of one who stands  
among me in a thicket or protecting to a one.  
You are the kiwi of my motionless lip.  
It is a tale of boney lances wave of wave of pastures rolling down the sea.  
I want you to rescue on my ears.  
  
Hairy sunset and the neon affection  
condemn at the walls of my house.  
Multitude of trysts!  
In and out of the opaque yellow the blue and the burnt umber  
in your tail of changing the heights begins to dream of recovering.  
In the first reel, the ancient astronaut  
is lunged by a man. In the second  
reel he returns, to relinquish and to begin.  
Wave of wave of bells rolling down the sea.  
From her fingernails and her finger awaken  
snows of the earth.  
Shaken day and the bitten mist  
steal at the walls of my house.  
The I in river full stop.  
  
You - the cordial brow.  
Among the rabid universe of morbid sun.
