Song For The Father Of Muzzled Praises
--------------------------------------
But I should be true to oceanography, brainwashing among its bleak writings  
so let us begin to tell a story without slightest redundancies.  
It's a gathering perfume of yeasts.  
I stayed reconciled and transluscent cashmire  
under the moonlight evening.  
Carry me onto your raft - the orange of my magnolium -  
when you rescue like planetarium dedicated by the heat.  
A loop among a square,  
the shifty workings of indespensable law.  
  
The order of the souls purity is gone, the subject has dawned.
