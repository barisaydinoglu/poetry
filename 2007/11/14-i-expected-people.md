I Expected People
-----------------
Making from frightened gem.  
Parched weather, decadent lights like the sea's skin.  
I was without doubt the lady elephant  
there in the motionless divisions.  
When it looked me with its free prize eyes  
it had neither leg nor mouth  
but silken corals on its sides.  
Of your black love when you hold out your lip.  
With the black confusion of the belt.  
As soon as the incoming mists  
gives the side indication.  
Conducting from callous cedar.  
Halfway.  
The worn-out tiger grows in the lion hearted bombs.  
Halfway.  
Shall we recount?  
A juice focuses its dream of a new ending, its ending, the beginning of the jar order -  
its cordial imbroglios.  
You are the cherry of my skeleton breath.  
The reasons for my respect  
are breathed in my foot of silken.  
  
Nothing but that splendor of warmths of your body.  
A wind of times a bitterest writing day  
you've asked me what the iguana is living there with his green brow?  
I reply, the apple knows this.  
When the jungle is full of delirious fingernails  
within probes and burned-out calculating manes  
and the arrogant starry skies and the prizes  
at last give forth their negligent imperfect chalk.  
There ought to be a salt of a lion hearted splendor preserving in a modern office.
