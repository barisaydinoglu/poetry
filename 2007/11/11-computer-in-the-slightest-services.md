Only autumn, just the  
springtime, nothing but  
it. Stone.  
In your heart of executing the universe begins to dream of fluttering.  
I was without doubt the son turkey  
there in the difficult universe.  
When it looked me with its sweet-smelling grace eyes  
it had neither fingernails nor hips  
but cork forests on its sides.  
Beligerance and smooth stone - bottles of animosity.  
Transluscent transparent heat to my bitter apple!  
Sometimes a piece of the clay  
throttles like a school in my leg.  
The I  
in ripple in the first reel, the humble daughter  
is erupted by a stranger. In the second  
take he returns, to blossom and to dedicate.  
To the fleeting color of the chalk old warrior's medal.  
To the manly brandishing aspen a current of moonlit splendor  
that does not know why it flows and divulges.  
Neither starlight nor breakfast nor dull shades of cashmire  
nor silvery but silvery.  
The viola loves on its demonic mare  
galloping crimson doves over the boulevard.  
And inside my hammock, during the midnight, I woke up naked  
and full of wonder.  
A planetarium -like imperfect silk  
you - the acerb hips.
