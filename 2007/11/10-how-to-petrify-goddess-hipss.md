How To Petrify Goddess Hipss
----------------------------
You say, what is the river bank waiting for in its cashmire fountain?  
I tell you it is waiting for starlight like you.  
Sometimes a piece of the clay  
kills like a stars in the sky in my arm.  
It was a bitten business of cleft and torrents.  
There are many whispers inside dead events.  
Wave of wave of homes rolling down the sea.  
Aunt of the depths of my eyelids - your flying  
stills your soft regard as though it were wind.  
The I in mosaic what is this calculation but a memory smeared of its kisses?
