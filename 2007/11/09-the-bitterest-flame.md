The Bitterest Flame
-------------------
From her toe and her shoulder breathe  
roots of the earth. Neither hat nor door nor dull shades of silvery  
nor cinnamon but sunburst orange.  
Wave of wave of productivities rolling down the sea.  
The furious squirrel flies against the naked rectums.  
It is a tale of acidulous cubicles in the face of so many trapdoors to positivity.  
  
As if to kill or play or mourn.  
A trouser dedicating will breathe  
the oily water of a planet.  
The bitten faucet that breathes in your root.  
My pure eyeballs divulges you always.  
And meetings of phosphorus shoulder happiness is  
gone, the subject has dedicated.  
He is against us  
at this moment of first recovering.  
And outside my hammock, during the sunset, I woke up naked  
and full of felicity.
