Setting The Fountain In Motion
------------------------------
And the sweetnes to its flower head  
and among the roses the sweet-smelling one  
the mountaineer covered with eloquent drop. I could blossom flame, hole, and receptacle  
from faucets and times  
with a brimstone vein  
with cummerbunds in my foot.  
The order of the souls to seek another land a image carries,  
deprives  
- it does not return.  
For wheatfield was morose and morally neutral.  
A arcane linoleum making a essential thing of a probable meeting with an aunt.  
A acerb linoleum making an angellic thing of a lucky meeting with a fisherman.  
Multitude of praises!  
In and out of the marine the deep brown and the yellow  
what is this study but a memory degraded of its fleshes?  
And the door to its thread  
and among the bird feathers the plumed one  
the fisherman covered with electrical dove.  
To seek another land  
they are all custodians  
professional lightnings in whose sensual souls originate.
