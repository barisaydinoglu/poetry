Tell Them That I Am Giving Up Playing In Synonyms
-------------------------------------------------
I saw how books are entertained  
by the human poppy.  
The noble one  
treads in the myriad morning.  
And so that its rotten stumps will replace your eyelids.  
The heart knows this,  
that life in it's bolt of saphire boxes is as endless as the starry sky.  
A transluscent sand-colored starlight mingles.  
The water great felicities are gnawn.  
Conversations of mirrors, the recitation  
of essences we call lovely flag.  
Of poetic wine, spirit  
of the starlights,  
lunged uncle blood, your kisses  
dedicate into exile  
and a droplet of ceramic, with remnants of the field.  
The parallel parallel darknesses hears on its smothered mare  
swimming burnt umber planetariums over the vicinity.  
The aromas exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
next to it in darkness.
