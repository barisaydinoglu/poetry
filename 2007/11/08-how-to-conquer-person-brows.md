How To Conquer Person Brows
---------------------------
Conversations of bells, the recitation  
of foliages we call lovely warmth.  
Not developing is a form of setting.  
It is a tale of burned-out thorn trees like distorted stalks of cattail, schools  
when you upgrade like dew enchanted by the lava.  
Of your dull shades of green movie when you hold out your eyelids.  
Outside the rust colored sorrow of the utensil.  
The velvety lady  
grows in the balanced morning.  
Be guided by the self-assured current's sweetnes.
