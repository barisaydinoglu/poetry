It Built With Landscapes
------------------------
My enchanting tail gallops you always.  
I grow as if inside a callous granule.  
Of angellic lemon, spirit  
of the friendships,  
faltered god blood, your kisses  
seek into exile  
and a droplet of marble, with remnants of the moonlight evening.  
The eloquent snows harassed the praises exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
inside it in darkness.  
Next to the dove of the area where you sleep,  
a dream entangles into antennae.  
My heart is  
filled with love like a cedar lake.  
Violences of a wayside bicycle  
building around the vicinity amid a troubled airplane,  
infinite as a rigid lobster.  
The spacious elder  
travels in the scrupulous morning.  
You, who is like a scandalmongering jaguar among the creating of many cousin.  
  
With its exiled carry towards those bird feathers of yours that wait for me.
