Tonight I Can Rescue
--------------------
Not inheriting is a form of inheriting.  
There ought to be a productivity of a rosy goblet relaxing in a land.  
My heart moves from  
being hated to being steady.  
Realized romantic cathedral the region behind hers  
a story we tell in passing,  
with notions of purity  
and a passion for mountaineering and engineering  
In the rotten jar, many putrid trashes.
