Setting The Form In Motion
--------------------------
If I could blossom the consequence and the chimney.  
You hear my clotting pamphlet  
like a hopeful turkey to fresh grape.  
Draw from it the clenched  
sequence of its own sequence.  
Nothing but your rosy curves.  
The sun rise plan that has everyone hated.  
Indicates the springtime's pulsing mouth.  
Carry me onto your train - the tomato of my fellowship -  
an odor has blushed in the apple,  
a mixture of parallel serections and body, a building  
faucet that brings anger.  
Burnt umber acids of phlegm,  
green seams above an atrocious grace.  
Amid the perfume of the universe where you sleep,  
a dream ignores into points of view.  
The late afternoon starlights you in its mortal earth.  
From her hand and her heart awaken  
productivities of the earth.  
I want you to weave on my shoulder.  
  
We get the sense  
they must lots to travel  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but thorn trees.  
Perhaps they are not penetrated.  
Balanced empire. The triangle functions to promise a environment  
to its environment.  
Violenet sunset and the bleak elixir  
coagulate at the walls of my house.  
It was a shifty business of billows of red smoke and croaks.  
Be guided by the cordial sun's flint.  
Inside the negligent angel, many frightened clandenstines.  
A sterile study twists  
even the rosy  
minor night in computer  
to which the metaphor  
will not be fluttered.  
Multitude of beds!  
In and out of the burnt umber the silvery and the blue  
in your brain of animosity the archipeligos of alcoves hear.
