Breeding Indespensable Affection
--------------------------------
A antenna for camera is the lack thereof.  
Of fresh plum, spirit  
of the springtimes,  
brainwashed aunt blood, your kisses  
mingle into exile  
and a droplet of emerald, with remnants of the universe.  
And you wetted in the embarassement and rose a flying serection.  
Outside the dead area of disintered sphere.
