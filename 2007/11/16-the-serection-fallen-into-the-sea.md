The Serection Fallen Into The Sea
---------------------------------
A boat is not enough to filter me and keep me  
from the universe of your incredulous secrets.  
Atrocious graves and crooked legumes.  
A bitterest point of view impales  
even the sweet-smelling  
grammatic divisions in metaphor  
to which the metaphor  
will not be promised.  
And you forced in the beligerance and flowed  
a scratching nail.  
Iridescent, crystal movie!  
In the first take, the secure daughter  
is brainwashed by a child. In the second  
scene he returns, to respond and to pacify.  
I'd do it for the sea water in which you shine  
for the schools of cashmire you've formed.  
A quadrangle around a triangle,  
the melancholy workings of electrical law.  
It was the sunset of the jaguar.  
Boneless weather, difficult lights like the moon.  
It was the night of the squirrel.  
  
Not to continue or even meet  
The land of one who stores  
outside me in a chimney or gathering to a one.  
Of your brimstone fragrance of strawberry when you hold out your brow.  
Pockets of brick converted into wooden.  
The dry flint that pacifies in your prize.
