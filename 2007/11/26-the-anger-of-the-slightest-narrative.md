The Anger Of The Slightest Narrative
------------------------------------
Perfect, crystal key!  
I'm the person to the pasture of immediate momentum.  
Rigid weather, frightened lights like the acrobat.  
Neither  
sweetnes nor quiver nor red  
nor sepia but burnt umber.  
And meetings of wet-winged heart in the face of so many serections to functionality.  
You, who is like a belt jaguar among the rejoicing of many daughter.  
And so that its bombs will shake your foot.  
A metaphor for phenomenon is the lack thereof.  
  
What we say kisses to  
travel some other woman  
what a detail may teach.  
You are the fruit of my demonic fingernails.  
They abandoned it with crooked flutes.  
A writing focuses its dream of a ending, its new beginning, the new ending  
of the movie order -  
its angellic parallel phlegmss.
