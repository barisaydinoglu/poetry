Meaning As Torrents
-------------------
When the night is full of clotting lip  
in granules and cold hushed paths  
and the smothered souls and the magnoliums  
at last give forth their  
clotting puberty. Rusted circumstances and difficult pamphlets.  
Pulled out and closed off like a serenity.  
  
A metaphor for language is the lack thereof.
