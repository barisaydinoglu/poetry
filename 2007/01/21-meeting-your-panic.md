Meeting Your Panic
------------------
Not to flow or even meet  
the alcove of one who reconciles  
among me in a moonlight evening or mingling to a gentleman.  
In your foot of fear the region of forms seek.  
Furious clefts and browbeaten hounds.  
The bolt of gem architecture plan that has everyone sterile.
