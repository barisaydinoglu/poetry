Velvety Theories Of Leaves
--------------------------
And you excite like a warmth and it was the late afternoon of the ostrich.  
Has the universe been woke with phenomena?  
What electric mirrors -  
the universe is filled with it,  
laminated signs for the femininity and the parched diamond.  
A moon -like abys  
what self-assured defenders -  
the moonlight evening is filled with it,  
eddies for the dew and the negligent cedar.  
I took on torrential lights.  
And a clotting muscle's jungle will transform you.  
Only shady and to a  
woman they take on time, too many to count years  
of your blood colored sweetnes when you hold out your foot.  
  
It was the twilight of the lobster.  
The curtains exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
with it in darkness.  
Not to discover or even meet  
the bed of one who fashions  
among me in a universe  
or pulsing to a woman.  
I could rejoice parallel jugulars, stench, and thorn tree  
from bells and waves  
with a black forest  
with rotten stumps in my tail.
