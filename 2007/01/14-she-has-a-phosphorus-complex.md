She Has A Phosphorus Complex
----------------------------
The unguessed leaf gave it pride. And a shady writing's clay will rejoice you.  
A shoulder and a curves  
showering the room.  
A breakfast focuses its dream of a beginning, its beginning, the beginning of the bell order -  
its noble bloods.  
In the smallest marble miracle pride is gone, the subject has galloped.  
You dawn my weak trash barge  
like a somber crab to fresh lemon.  
If I could play the dust and the universe.  
A chorus of crabs at lunchtime un pulsed un mutated  
comes to a halt before a trouser.  
I want you to form on my mouth.  
An odor has blossomed against the springtime,  
a mixture of howl and body, a pulsing  
aspen that brings illusion.  
They abducted it with brutal candles.  
A loaf of bread baked with cold love and salt.  
  
I salute your verdure nectarine  
and envy your celestial pride.  
Wave of wave of tigers rolling down the sea.  
  
This frail soul and fashioning bottle scratches me  
with it's great cactuss like hips and hand  
and ultraviolet writings like breath and foams.
