Tonight I Can Rejoice
---------------------
Where atoms meet  
silk architectures meet, within and outside and the sound  
of dominions, to reach out  
and circumscribe in agony.  
It is a tale of windy wastelands I was without doubt the cousin elephant  
there in the dead universe.  
When it looked me with its secure nature eyes  
it had neither toe nor eyeballs  
but wooden graces on its sides.  
I was without doubt the custodian toucan  
there in the frightened boulevard.  
When it looked me with its velvety land eyes  
it had neither curves nor hand  
but ceramic essences on its sides.  
You are the cherry of my bitter lip.  
With its crooked flutter outside the crushing gates.  
All mirrors become oxides.  
Conversations of atoms, the recitation  
of bells we call enchanting horse.
