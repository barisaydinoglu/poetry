The Brutal Uncle Of The Modern Office
-------------------------------------
In the face of so many walls to positivity.  
I'm the father to the river of immediate quilt.  
When the archipeligos is full of silent brain  
around massacres and banal sterile lunars  
and the dead utensils and the doors  
at last give forth their ghostly saliva.  
Only misunderstood and to a  
mother they take on time, twenty-seven years  
and inside my hammock, during the lunchtime, I woke up naked  
and full of purity.  
Wave of wave of stars rolling down the sea.  
  
Nothing but your round ears.  
What charitable umbrellas -  
the room is filled with it,  
poppies for the school and the silent cedar.  
The tremulous flesh is verdure on your curves.  
Form was no longer above the recording threshold.  
To blush lost knaves and for lunars.  
Legless horses of a hated airplane  
storing next to the land inside a directionless bicycle,  
brandishing as a dry bird.  
  
Inside the ritual of the city where you sleep,  
a dream punctures into calculations.  
The chaotic squirrel discovers outside the stationary receptacles.
