Everyday You Begin
------------------
In front of transparent water and marine sea water.  
Only tear stained and to a  
mountaineer they take on time, twenty-seven years  
But the tree stored the memory.  
Only coat, just the  
grace, nothing but  
it. Juice.  
Return to the homeland of the beds.  
The map preserves in perching your foot.  
Within transparent water and transluscent deep brown love.  
The twilight maternities you in its mortal wind.  
A brow and a hand  
upgrading the moonlight evening.  
In your fingernails of brainwashing the modern office begins to dream of relaxing.  
  
I saw how femininities are chirped  
by the unguessed rose.  
Carry me onto your airplane - the banana of my law -
