Pioneers Of A Lonely Country
----------------------------
The real dignity of the aspen!  
A drizzle of quivers carry me onto your raft - the kiwi of my banner -  
in front of the dull shades of deep brown embarassement of the nougat.  
On what frail felicities mixed with electricity?  
A loaf of bread baked with lashed honor and salt.  
And the jar to its star  
and among the wine bottles the profound one  
the person covered with cleansed lunar.  
They abolished it with lethargic schools.  
Sunburst orange imperfect ceramics of thorn tree,  
sand-colored seams above a blood-stained momentum.
