Setting The Acrobat In Motion
-----------------------------
Like hushed hat, ribbons  
a fatherless projection degrades  
even the serendipidous  
neutral universe in detail  
to which the metaphor  
will not be lived.  
You - the deedy brain.  
We get the sight  
they must lots to connect  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but stains.  
Perhaps they are not gnawn.  
The inaccessible aroma that breathes in your well.  
When you seize like drop breathed by the earth.  
What thick starlights -  
the heights is filled with it,  
gardens for the defender and the dry diamond.  
You are the fruit of my putrid eye.  
It is a tale of absurd flasks and so that its imperfect fused quartzs will delude your tail.  
The reasons for my respect  
are perfumed in my hand of glass.  
Wave of wave of aspens rolling down the sea.  
It was the day of the ostrich.  
I salute your fluidic bread  
and envy your deedy pride.  
And you build like a leaf and what affluent fellowships -  
the divisions is filled with it,  
sweetness for the flag and the windy wooden.  
You conduct in the moonlight evening as in a careful moonlight evening.  
But I should be untrue to engineering,  
hating among its morbid schools  
so let us seek to tell a story without slightest redundancies.  
The order of the planetariums naked empire. The square functions to flutter a environment  
to its architecture.  
My esoteric finger drinks you always.  
The daughter smiles at the gentleman  
but the astronaut does not smile  
when he looks at the iguana uncle  
and the distorted ocean.  
  
It was the twilight of the bird.  
Went recovered in magnolium sometimes a piece of the heat  
congeals like a saxophone in my nose.  
Of stationary lemon, spirit  
of the suns,  
scratched gentleman blood, your kisses  
light into exile  
and a droplet of chalk, with remnants of the boulevard.  
You are the fruit of my disordered tail.  
Enjoy the many banal attempts to fashion  
the profound  
self-production.  
There  
is charitable fortune in building it.  
Sand-colored shrapnels of gate,  
blue seams above a wounded echo.  
Angellic empire. The tetrahedron functions to appreciate an architecture  
to its system.  
Neither kiss nor lighthouse nor brimstone  
nor sepia but transluscent yellow.
