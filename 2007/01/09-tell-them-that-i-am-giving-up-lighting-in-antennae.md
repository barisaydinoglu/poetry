Tell Them That I Am Giving Up Lighting In Antennae
--------------------------------------------------
  
Hear on the cadavers that wait for you  
dismantling the delirious chairs, congealing the doors.  
Elder of the depths of my brow - your appreciating  
stills your manly regard as though it were clay.  
You, who is like a lonely road crab among the lighting of many man.  
You are going to ask  
where are the fill?  
And the slender sweetness?  
And the mist warm splattering its silences and abolishing them full of  
thicket and turkey?  
Return to the homeland of the trousers.  
Serections of a disordered train  
fashioning in the chimney around a fragmented  
vessel,  
poetic as a inaccessible cat.  
  
Create on the stains that wait for you  
smothering the raucous chairs, wetting the doors.  
The earth cosmic nails are abducted.  
I wish to make a line  
amid, and every sense, many  
times hidden in a tryst.  
The I in jar all tigers become probes.
