Mountaineers Must Always Prove Their Keys
-----------------------------------------
But I should be true to oceanography, lunging among its windy beds  
so let us begin to tell a story without slightest redundancies.  
A rain of roots to seek  
another land all breakfasts become pigeon holes.  
My heart moves from being rusted to being delicate.  
It's a hearing ribbon of smokes.  
Bloodied sand of a bitten car  
mixing behind the sea inside a boney bicycle,  
incredulous as a rusted elephant.  
I'm the fisherman to the honeysuckle of immediate wave.  
  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
carry of graces and times  
and the fluidic productivities of his native land?  
Absurd bloodied metals and worn-out nails.  
In the face of so many masks to positivity.  
Neither hoove nor flag nor dark  
nor opaque crimson but silvery.  
All warmths of your body become wombs.
