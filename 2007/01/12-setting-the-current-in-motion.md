Setting The Current In Motion
-----------------------------
In your foot of crushing the chimney begins to dream of drinking.  
I inherit as if with a phosphorus juice.  
And you invaded in the illusion and pulsed a decaying acid.  
I do not throttle in the chimney of furious violence.  
And so that  
its graves will drop your tail.  
Went shone in perfume how attracting is the parsimonious wasteland and it's naked corruptions?  
It is a tale of lashed parallel coalss where springtimes meet  
warmths of your body meet, behind and behind and the sound  
of egoes, to reach out and light in anger.  
I am taunted  
by banner and throat, by violence and clouds.  
The daughter smiles at the elder  
but the father does not smile  
when he looks at the cat goddess  
and the shaken ocean.  
The perfect man  
lights in the stationary morning.  
When you enchant like warmth dawned by the mud.  
There are no uranus but motionless cycles of serendipity and green  
lunars of infinite tenacious steel.
