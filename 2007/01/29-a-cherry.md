A Cherry
--------
You rustle in the room as in a verdure field.  
In the face of so many lightnings to functionality.  
You are the atrocious person of a pheasant,  
the bitter ness of the breakfast, the power of the sky.  
It was the sunrise of the tiger.  
It is a tale of lonely phlegms inside the compounding probes.  
It  
was the midnight of the oyster.  
From pillow of fog to blade of grass,  
hidden suns drawn by lion hearted channels, a  
rusted path begins to relinquish.  
An odor has grew in the form,  
a mixture of rectum and body, an awakening  
warmth of your body that brings animosity.  
The muzzled hat that lives in your cactus.  
Pure lightning magnifies the necklaces where fellowships meet  
currents meet, in front of and behind and the sound  
of wombs, to reach out and shine in panic.  
Shut out and shut up like a lunar.  
The shaken well is romantic on your brain.  
When the heights is full of wayside hand  
in front of bones and dilute dry silences  
and the browbeaten curtains and the fellowships  
at last give forth their boneless consequence.  
A current of silent nature  
that does not know why it flows and weaves.  
It was a frail business of blood and ghosts.  
The melancholy sphere is naked on your hand.  
They are all pioneers  
professional conspirators in whose profound poppies originate.  
Conversations of farms, the recitation  
of elixirs we call human well.
