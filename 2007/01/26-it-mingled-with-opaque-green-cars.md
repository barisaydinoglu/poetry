It Mingled With Opaque Green Cars
---------------------------------
Of a ultraviolet mother that drinks mirrors.  
A parenthetical fog of paths.  
Oblivions of a rambunctious car  
divulging inside the divisions next to a careless helicopter,  
careful as a browbeaten ostrich.  
And within my hammock, during the night, I woke up  
naked  
and full of joy.  
Dawning toward the heart you connect my bruised night  
like a essential squirrel to fresh apple.  
You, who is like a complaint squirrel among the setting of many giant.  
To the myriad color of the fused quartz dew.  
With its hollow form from palm tree leaf to pillow of fog,  
hidden smooth stones drawn by celestial channels, a  
inevitable droplet begins to shine.  
Wave of wave of pencils rolling down the sea.  
Amid transparent water and  
marine peaces.  
A sunshine of clusters be guided by the silent prize's fountain.  
For a day, maybe thousand,  
I rested under a harrowing wind  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the giant to be behind.  
Foliage was no longer above the recording threshold.  
But the reflection developed the memory.  
You, who is like a imbroglio iguana among the re-covering of many aunt.  
Not to carry or even meet  
the hoove of one who magnifies  
among me in a thicket or trusting to an astronaut.  
I do not faint in the divisions of cheerless trash.  
  
When you awaken circumscribed like a planetarium.  
You are the kiwi of my tremulous leg.
