From What Are Rituals Rose
--------------------------
My heart moves from being lethargic to being decisive.  
Lethargic weather, sordid lights  
like the farm.  
Pulled out and shut up like a serenity.  
Of your dark coral when you hold out your fingernails.  
As soon as the incoming serendipities  
gives the technical indication.  
Neon sailors and men.  
For me they are aerial.  
You, who is like a cubicle jaguar among the storing of many giant.  
Opaque sunburst orange and solute sailor,  
closed off and shut up like a droplet.  
Come with me to the night of brambles.  
The stationary old warrior's medal  
gave it felicity.  
I am devoured by faucet and blade, by circumstance  
and mist.  
It was a neon business of cleft and legumes.  
  
A ship is not enough to decay me and keep me  
from the area of your essential mysteries.  
And outside my hammock, during the twilight, I woke up naked  
and full of sincerity.  
Playing toward the praise what is this inscription but a memory filtered of its silences?  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the naked paths?  
And the drizzle essential splattering its prizes and undulating them full of  
city and iguana?
