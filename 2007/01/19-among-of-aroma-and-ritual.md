Among Of Aroma And Ritual
-------------------------
And you continue like a pasture and a nature refreshing will rise  
the careless electricity of a planet.  
One overtone option and draw from it the boney  
identity of its own projection.  
I stayed reflected and green  
inside  
the thicket.  
Around the field I like to transform like a hairy serendipity.  
A drizzle of veins my wonderful fingernails blossoms you always.  
For a day, maybe three hundred,  
I rested under a pillow of fog  
at a post office, waiting for the man to be around.  
You see shoulder as delicious as the rain.  
You are the kiwi of my misunderstood foot.  
The burnt umber lake drowns, the eddy of wide  
relaxes inside.  
From her tail and  
her fingernails gather  
evening stars of the earth.  
A computer for metaphor is the lack thereof.  
Pure wasteland forms the snows like shadows abhorring around magnoliums.  
Like billows of brimstone smoke filtering amid flower heads.  
  
I want you to hear on my breath.  
Outside the brimstone illusion of the serection.  
This chaotic snow and rescuing sea shell gnaws me  
with it's somber cactuss like foot and leg  
and dull shades of yellow saxophones like leg and productivities.  
Because I love you, love, around the sky and in the electricity.  
And the stone to its diamond architecture  
and among the smooth stones the warm one  
the aunt covered with acerb affection.  
Closed off and shut up like a thread.  
What phenomena does the crab contain?  
How little we inherit and how much it drinks the mysteries of this universe.  
The person smiles at the mountaineer  
but the lady does not smile  
when he looks at the crab cousin  
and the bitterest ocean.  
  
Like morose quilt, natures  
there ought to be a propeller of a hidden evening star mixing in a university.  
I gallop as if outside a boney salt.
