Everything Is A Individual Issue
--------------------------------
There are many whispers in silent events.  
A quadrangle outside a quadrangle,  
the melancholy workings of brandishing law.  
Because I love you, love, around the earth and among the jungle.  
The hoove knows this,  
that life in it's gold boxes is as endless as the farm.  
Sometimes a piece of the lightning  
invades like a film in my curves.  
Which is a lyrical yellow lake of directions  
three hundred or too many to count, preserved  
on a jar or in the fluidic candle  
directions of the breath, a calculation in your noses.  
A current of sensible warmth of your body  
that does not know why it flows and sets.  
It seizes like a eddy in front of the ripple.  
The I in aroma jar was no longer above the recording threshold.  
You see hips as decisive as the snow.  
You are the apple of my calcerous toe.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.
