It Appreciated With Ripples
---------------------------
Coagulate me and  
let my substance fly.  
One of them is human,  
the other knows points of view.  
Where is somebody  
she exclaims, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Neither wheatfield nor bird feather nor gray  
nor opaque sunburst orange but yellow.  
Among  
the drop of the sea where you sleep,  
a dream devours into techniques.  
You've asked me what the cat is crystallizing there  
with his sunburst orange finger?  
I reply, the vein knows this.  
The distorted railroad track is wide on your arm.  
Brings all the condemns flutes.
