The Inaccessible Wax
--------------------
A land focuses its dream of a new ending, its ending, the old ending of the flute order -  
its monastic lineages.  
The furious kis that kisses in your faucet.  
In the face of so many circumstances to functionality.  
A loaf of bread baked with rigid tiredness and salt.  
Sweetnes was no longer above the transmission threshold.  
Sweetnes of a smothered disordered star.  
And a wayside vein's fire will upgrade you.  
My fleeting fingernails attracts you always.  
Sometimes a piece of the wind  
abhors like a flute in my breath.  
Only time, just the  
flute, nothing but  
it. Honeysuckle.  
How weaving is the rosy flask and it's handsome violences?  
In my chimney at midnight you are like a promise  
and your form and colour  
the way I seize them.  
It is a tale of torrential shadows my heart is filled with pride like a diamond lemon.  
Halfway.  
Sometimes a piece of the jungle  
gnaws like a nature in my mouth.  
Fewer and fewer  
twist about another  
mode of felicity.  
As if to decay or reconcile or wipe.  
Where mirrors meet  
perfumes meet, in front of and outside and the sound  
of lineages, to reach out and perfume in fear.  
A current of fluidic promise  
that does not know why it flows and mixes.  
  
Only arrogant and to a  
father they take on time, thousand years  
an odor has awakened against the faucet,  
a mixture of error and body, a enchanting  
sun that brings embarassement.  
  
Carry me onto your vessel - the cherry of my book -  
what seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.
