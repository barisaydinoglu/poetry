The Camera Called The Fingernails
---------------------------------
I saw how foams are recovered  
by the moonlit fountain.  
When the university is full of molested eye  
around flasks and pale obscene transluscent deep brown lakes  
and the difficult banners and the kisses  
at last give forth their mechanical trash barge.  
From her curves and her hand protect  
cinnamon lakes of the earth.  
Nothing but your noble brain.  
  
In the modern office like broken glass.
