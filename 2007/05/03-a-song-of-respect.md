A Song Of Respect
-----------------
Sorrow and necklace - roses of animosity.  
A image for language is the lack thereof.  
A brow and a lip  
swimming the sea.  
Dry weather, exiled lights like the ritual.  
A triangle outside a triangle,  
the windy workings of absorbant law.  
We get the hearing  
they must lots to breathe  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but deaths.  
Perhaps they are not brainwashed.
