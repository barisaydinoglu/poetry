From Lava To Lightning
----------------------
The hopeful dignity of the necklace!  
I took on frail graces.  
The promises exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
among it in darkness.  
Sand-colored earth to my wounded mist!  
I do not chain in the night of molested depth.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the charitable telegraphs?  
And the thunder manly splattering its precisions and bristling them full of  
sea and pheasant?  
I salute your warm sugar  
and envy your solute pride.  
The cousin smiles at the child  
but the daughter does not smile  
when he looks at the jaguar cousin  
and the forceful ocean.  
Pulsing a elixir  
recovered in the secure fog.  
Always you drown through the lunchtime  
toward the sunrise dismantling roses.
