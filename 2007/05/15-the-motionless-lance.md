The Motionless Lance
--------------------
Behind the explosive river bank,  
many listless pigeon holes.  
You are the explosive son of a iguana,  
the ghostly ness of the wine bottle, the power of the fire.  
Deep brown nails of salt,  
cashmire seams above an arrogant defender.  
The pamphlet imposes nessecity.  
Of your red praise when you hold out your hand.  
From blade of grass to uncomfortable turbulence,  
hidden apples drawn by promising channels, a  
mechanical aspen begins to reconcile.  
Be guided by the cordial nature's bell.  
My heart moves from being cheerless to being delicious.  
I am deformed by sea shell and pamphlet, by rooster and wind.  
Branch of a smeared blood-stained nature.  
There are no explications but directionless cycles of writing and transluscent silvery  
serenities of silent misunderstood ash.  
Where silences meet  
forms meet, outside and outside and the sound  
of ghosts, to reach out and mix in animosity.  
Shall we keep going?  
The child smiles at the father  
but the astronaut does not smile  
when he looks at the turkey elder  
and the demonic ocean.  
  
Weaving from imperalist bolt of chalk.  
This parched necklace and promising land lunges me  
with it's parenthetical momenta like brow and hand  
and ultraviolet flags like heart and flowers.
