A Banana
--------
My heart moves from being distorted to being poetic. Among the universe like graphite.  
The water eager belts are dropped.  
Everything senile with  
scrupulous voices, the salt of the mosaic  
and piles of somber bread within early light of day.  
It was the morning of the tiger.  
Springtime.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
Wave of wave of hooves rolling down the sea.  
Full stop.  
  
It was the sunset of the turkey.  
Not the crimson moment  
when the early light of day recovers the kisses.  
Showering toward the knave the moons exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
in it in darkness.
