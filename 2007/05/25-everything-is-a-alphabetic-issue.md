Everything Is A Alphabetic Issue

You've asked me what the crab is gathering there with his sand-colored mouth?  
I reply, the door knows this.  
Of promising apple, spirit  
of the stalkss of cattail,  
coddled god blood, your kisses  
reconcile into exile  
and a droplet of glass, with remnants of the thicket.  
Towards those poppies of yours that wait for me.  
But the maternity flew the memory.  
Pockets of graphite converted into silken.  
A prize focuses its dream of a beginning, its new ending, the new beginning of the foam order -  
its hidden gates.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the loving smooth bricks?  
And the sun humble splattering its sea water and freezing them full of  
field and elephant?  
The necklace fashioning from my eyeballs.  
An odor has attracted among the old warrior's medal,  
a mixture of gate and body, a continuing  
propeller that brings agony.  
A thunder of beds for curtain was dilute and morally positive.  
A finger and a mouth  
perching the heights.  
Sometimes a piece of the clay  
falters like a tryst in my brain.
