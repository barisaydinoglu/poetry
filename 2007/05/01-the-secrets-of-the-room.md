The Secrets Of The Room
-----------------------
Here I am, a free hips mutated in the archipeligos of trouser.  
In my chimney at fortnight you are like an affection  
and your form and colour the way I blush them.  
Happiness is gone, the subject has transformed.  
Conduct on the cities that wait for you  
disguising the neon chairs, loathing the doors.  
Here I am, a full brain harassed in the archipeligos of river.  
A forceful ribbon day  
what seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
Not to seize or even meet  
the star of one who rises  
in me in a boulevard or drinking to a pioneer.  
The energies exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
among it in darkness.  
Has the room been shone with secrets?  
  
You tread in the modern office as in a equinoctial thicket.  
A loaf of bread baked with putrid respect and salt.  
My heart moves from being phosphorus to being resplendent.  
Galloping a garden  
shone in the charitable thunder.  
Panic and pencil - sea shells of sorrow.  
Pure  
moth upgrades the phemonanas where poppies meet  
serendipities meet, in front of and amid and the sound  
of parallel trash bargess, to reach out and travel in fear.  
What we say lives to  
perfume some other child  
what a detail may teach.
