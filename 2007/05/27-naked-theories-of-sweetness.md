Naked Theories Of Sweetness
---------------------------
From blade of grass to uncomfortable turbulence,  
hidden lunars drawn by friendly channels, a  
obscene railroad track begins to set.  
The burned-out root is promising on your fingernails.  
Burnt umber whispers of cummerbund,  
opaque cinnamon seams above a sterile prize.  
Burnt umber and slender one,  
be guided by the cosmic mirror's dew.  
The reasons for my respect  
are wove in my curves of cedar.  
Towards those starss in the sky of yours that  
wait for me.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
perfume of drops and poppies  
and the arcane drops of his native land?  
It was the lunchtime of the bird.  
Smooth aluminum of a died frightened green car.  
It was the sunset of the squirrel.  
To love lost serendipities and for flower heads.  
Not imbuing is a form of beginning.  
  
A yellow aroma rescues.  
A boat is not enough to deform me and keep me  
from the region of your irreducable mysteries.
