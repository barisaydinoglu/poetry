Halfway.  
I am degraded by love and error, by bomb and rain.  
There are no trashes  
but fire-tipped cycles of key and deep brown

Draw from it the skeleton  
projection of its own production.  
In the first reel, the iridescent pioneer  
is soddened by a woman. In the second  
scene he returns, to enrich and to play.  
Because I love you, love, among the electricity and outside the wind.  
For a day, maybe too many to count,  
I rested under a palm tree leaf  
at a bus stop, waiting for the stranger to be inside.
