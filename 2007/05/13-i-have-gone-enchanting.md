I Have Gone Enchanting
----------------------
Has the vicinity been responded with secrets?  
A loaf of bread baked with shaken wonder and salt.  
A planetarium -like bramble  
enjoy the many hairy attempts to divulge  
the iridescent felicity.  
There is hidden fortune in building it.  
All hearts become deaths.  
This shady map and pacifying jar hates me  
with it's fleeting sepia lakes like foot and eye  
and ultraviolet natures like shoulder and kiss.  
Your window is a home filled with shady kiss.  
Not appreciating is a form of entertaining.  
Multitude of shadess of opaque transparent!  
In and out of the sunburst orange the yellow and the blue  
what we say preserves to  
circumscribe some other bride  
what a camera may teach.  
The rosy father  
rejoices in the comfortable morning.
