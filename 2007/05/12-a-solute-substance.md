A Solute Substance
------------------
Living the silence of her mist full of love.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
light of graces and wheatfields  
and the fleeting forests of his native land?  
In my heights at late afternoon you are like a honeysuckle  
and your form and colour the way I gather them.  
Everything guilt with friendly voices, the salt of the hoove  
and piles of fresh bread inside late afternoon.
