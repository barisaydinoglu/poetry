Setting The Stone In Motion
---------------------------
A language for machine is the lack thereof.  
With its dry dedicate of a dark man that blossoms sea water.  
Conversations of doors, the recitation  
of honeysuckles we call electric coral.  
Conversations of umbrellas, the recitation  
of lands we call moonlit flute.  
A chorus of birds at day un blushed un gnawn  
comes to a halt before a bed.
