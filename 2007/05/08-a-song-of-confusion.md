A Song Of Confusion
-------------------
What we say relaxes to  
weave some other uncle  
what a language may teach.  
Indicates the writing's  
forming eyeballs.  
Our new bell, our cleansed umbrella circles.  
Appreciating a defender  
rejoiced in the trusting drizzle.  
My heart moves from being callous to being human.  
A triangle inside a tetrahedron,  
the guilt workings of cordial law.  
  
A putrid projection undulates  
even the slender  
historical moonlight evening in language  
to which the metaphor  
will not be carried.
