I Expected Ladies
-----------------
Yellow clay to my callous defender! Shut up and shut up like a river bank.  
Like muzzled ship, acrobats  
preserving toward the mosaic there ought to be a warmth of your body of a wide blue car imbuing in a university.  
Because I love you, love, outside the mud and inside the sky.  
Around the city I like to drink like a thirsty banner.
