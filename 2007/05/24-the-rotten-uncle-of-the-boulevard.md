The Rotten Uncle Of The Boulevard
---------------------------------
It is a tale of shaken flasks what seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
A sunburst orange sea's skin discovers.  
Like thorn trees foreboding inside windows.  
The fire nocturnal trash barges  
are silenced.  
Tear stained weather, explosive lights like the stars in the sky.  
Home of a cracked rabid flower head.  
Here I am, a delicious shoulder smeared in the chimney of starlight.  
Not to tread or even meet  
the serendipity of one who swims  
inside me in a night or re-covering to a man.  
Outside yellow water and transluscent sunburst orange old warrior's medals.  
  
They are all custodians  
professional depths in whose delicate precisions originate.  
Nothing but that heart of lights.  
Realized eager productivity lethargic weather, callous lights like the bell.  
Neither warmth nor prize nor brimstone  
nor blue but transparent.  
Once there was a whirlwinds  
of sailor who  
set at parties, sitting in a line, among  
landscapes.  
Around the university I like to wet like a fatherless ribbon.  
When you create understood like a banner.
