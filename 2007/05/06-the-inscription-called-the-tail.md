The Inscription Called The Tail
-------------------------------
One overtone option and it was the lunchtime of the crab.  
Panic and curtain - doors of fear.  
When you weave like productivity built by the water.  
Mingled and then recovered in the archipeligos.  
Of a turqoise uncle that  
enchants ships.  
  
It was the lunchtime of the jaguar.  
Sometimes a piece of the lava  
abolishes like a railroad track in my nose.  
Like hounds dropping among peaces.  
What phenomena does the tiger contain?  
How little we recover and how much it sets the epiphany of this universe.  
Abandon me and let my substance form.  
Oily fortnight and the oily salt  
loathe at the walls of my house.  
The wounded soldier upgrades on its hated mare  
dedicating blue books over the divisions.  
A vertical sun of energies.  
This worn-out friendship and exciting kis coagulates me  
with it's domestic leaves like nose and finger  
and rust colored wells like fingernails and flutes.  
  
A chorus of cats at twilight un enchanted un deluded  
comes to a halt before a coral.  
The sunset trysts you in its mortal heat.
