Essential Theories Of Yellow Lakes
----------------------------------
Nothing but your infinite brow.  
Conversations of guitars, the recitation  
of wells we call arcane flute.  
Sunburst orange traps of flame,  
burnt umber seams above a thirsty sea's skin.  
Pulled out and closed off like a thread.  
You recover my boneless abys  
like a fresh bird to fresh grape.  
My heart moves from being raucous to being vertical.  
  
Nothing but that wooden architecture of schools.  
It's a perching star of lineages.
