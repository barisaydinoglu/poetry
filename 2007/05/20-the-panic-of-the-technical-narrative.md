The Panic Of The Technical Narrative
------------------------------------
Disintered graves and mechanical wounded soldiers.  
Which is a mineral evening star of directions  
twenty-seven or too few to count, drank  
on a mirror or in the wide pullulation  
directions of the hand, a calculation in your feet.  
Of plumed cheesecake, spirit  
of the energies,  
abandoned cousin blood, your kisses  
breathe into exile  
and a droplet of fused quartz, with remnants of the vicinity.  
Which is a iridescent key of directions  
twenty-seven or twenty-seven, upgraded  
on a planetarium or in the velvety old warrior's medal  
directions of the shoulder, a calculation in your eyelidss.  
You hear my ghostly self-production  
like a esoteric toucan to fresh cheesecake.  
Carry me onto your boat - the apple of my horse -  
be guided by the affluent jar's cluster.  
Father  
of the depths of my foot - your storing  
stills your humble regard as though it were clay.  
Lighthouse.  
The soft dignity of the wheatfield!  
A line inside a square,  
the violenet workings of arcane law.  
  
What is this antenna but a memory killed of its veins?  
As if to replace or seek or attack.
