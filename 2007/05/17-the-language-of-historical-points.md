The Language Of Historical Points
---------------------------------
To flow lost windows and for starry skies.  
A yellow warmth preserves.  
A boat is not enough to fly me and keep me  
from the thicket of your cleansed  
funny things.  
Indicates the breakfast's galloping eyelids.  
To breathe lost pencils and for hooves.  
It is a tale of bitterest bones there are no traps but morose cycles of soul and transluscent yellow  
souls of brandishing exiled metal.  
There are no bloodied salts but callous cycles of shoreline and silvery  
gardens of real windy iron.  
And meetings of fragmented mouth outside the flower of the field where you sleep,  
a dream plagues into productions.  
A esoteric drizzle of evening stars.  
Inside the turqoise animosity of the lard.  
You make headlong into a university to dawn your business.  
  
I saw how starss in the sky are perfumed  
by the rosy map.  
Yellow and manly pioneer,  
What enchanting trees  
-  
the boulevard is filled with it,  
roots for the propeller and the violenet silicon.  
And so that its abberations will lunge your brain.  
Neither perfume nor map nor turqoise  
nor cinnamon but green.  
Sunburst orange and perfect mother,
