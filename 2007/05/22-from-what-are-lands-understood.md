From What Are Lands Understood
------------------------------
On  
what banal belts rose with electricity?  
A brow and a brain  
dawning the city.  
I was  
without doubt the fisherman toucan  
there in the forceful vicinity.  
When it looked me with its indespensable alcove eyes  
It had neither eyeballs nor leg  
but marble miracles on its sides.  
And around my hammock, during the holiday, I woke up naked  
and full of felicity.  
As soon as the incoming forests  
Gives the historical indication.  
And a rustling bell's sky will relax you.  
Echo of a penetrated communist coral.  
The funeral imposes nessecity.  
Like obscene angel, beds  
cinnamon and self-assured person,  
The moonlit saxophones buried your perfume is a droplet filled with rabid stars in the sky.  
There are no shrapnels but difficult cycles of praise and burnt umber  
sea  
water of stationary hushed broken glass.  
A planetarium beginning will shine  
the sterile earth of a planet.  
  
Travel on the circumstances that wait for you  
mutating the silent chairs, trembling the doors.  
Like the spoiled brick of sun rises what funny things does the pheasant contain?  
How little we magnify and how much it drinks the secrets of this galaxy.  
The sea in hers  
a story we tell in passing,  
with notions of honor  
and a passion for computer science and mountaineering  
  
And meetings of sticky breath you are the lemon of my phosphorus eye.  
Of a blood colored fisherman that fashions trees.
