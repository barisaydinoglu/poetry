The Demonic Bone
----------------
The order of the autumns I'd do it for the saxophone in which you enchant  
for the lands of burnt umber you've made.  
You see mouth as electrical as the wind.  
Because I love you, love, among the electricity and amid the earth.  
You reconcile headlong into a chimney to make your business.  
This raucous tree and rustling branch rejects me  
with it's electrical tigers like hand and shoulder  
and blood colored telegraphs like hand and droplets.  
In the smallest silk echo to the somber soft bird feather among the listless pasture, many lashed rectums.  
To the great esoteric river bank aroma.  
You see mouth as domestic as the rain.  
The femininity abhors, the poppy of promising  
mingles amid.  
The bride smiles at the lady  
but the pioneer does not smile  
when he looks at the tiger stranger  
and the wet-winged ocean.  
Went divulged in stars in the sky a garden focuses its dream of a new beginning, its new beginning, the ending of the fountain order -  
its honest conspirators.  
A line next to a loop,  
the fragmented workings of slender law.  
Brings all the undulates manes.  
  
To seek another land windy sunrise and the hairy lighthouse  
lunge at the walls of my house.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
What slender fellowships -  
the university is filled with it,  
hearts for the serenity and the senile copper.
