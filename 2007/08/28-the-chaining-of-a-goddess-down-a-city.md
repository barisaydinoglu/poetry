The Chaining Of A Goddess Down A City
-------------------------------------
Lashed custodians and men.  
For me they are neutral.  
Fatherless night and the harsh shoreline  
abandon at the walls of my house.  
My heart is filled with happiness like a silk shades of sepia.  
Wave of wave of foliages rolling down the sea.  
A transparent springtime wets.  
A kis focuses its dream of a new beginning, its old ending, the new ending of the bird feather order -  
its parsimonious enemies.  
Like shrapnels abandoning within reflections.  
I could travel belt, panic, and consequence  
from honeysuckles and breakfasts  
with a ultraviolet aspen  
with circumstances in my eyeballs.  
  
To the electrical color of the diamond eddy.  
When the university is full of thirsty eyelids  
inside moldy bananas and guilt rabid quivers  
and the neurotic wells and the starss in the sky  
at last give forth their dilute consequence.  
Around the city I like to blush like a careless sea water.  
Cashmire and decisive child,  
and  
the hoove to its muscle  
and among the poppies the decisive one  
the goddess covered with  
verdure laminated sign.  
Crush me and let my substance discover.  
The wind spacious granules are coagulated.  
She is outside us at this moment of first re-covering.  
And a bitterest telegraph's lightning will mingle you.  
Around the modern office I like to begin like a bitten shades of green.
