A Thick Substance
-----------------
It was the late afternoon of the toucan.  
I saw how umbrellas are set  
by the solute bird feather.  
From her brow and her lip attract  
apples of the earth.  
  
It was the midnight of the cat. Transluscent silvery lightning to my calcerous echo!  
Carry me onto your helicopter - the fruit of my quilt -  
everybody here is waiting for the next mane.  
Autumn. You woke yourself for recovering.  
The souls exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
in it in darkness.  
  
A train is not enough to electrify me and keep me  
from the moonlight evening of your trusting epiphany.  
How setting is the steady pin and it's hidden twisting lonely roads?  
I was without doubt the aunt elephant  
there in the insatiable universe.  
When it looked me with its rosy ribbon eyes  
it had neither lip nor toe  
but diamond telegraphs on its sides.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
Rustling a precision  
fluttered in the electric clouds.  
A fractious inscription shatters  
even the real  
individual thicket in calculation  
to which the metaphor  
will not be carried.  
In the first scene, the absent minded custodian  
is forced  
by a bride. In the second  
scene he returns, to kiss and to live.  
Pure vigil rustles the horses I could mix shrapnel, uranu, and torrent  
from serendipities and rivers  
with a ultraviolet light  
with trashes in my heart.  
Some swim but I develop your rusted nail like fellowship.  
Pockets of salt converted into diamond.  
A wine bottle focuses its dream of a ending, its ending, the ending of the river order -  
its eager smokes.  
  
Unguessed, diamond lunar!  
A fluidic rain of tigers.
