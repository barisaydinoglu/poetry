The Cubicle Fallen Into The Sea
-------------------------------
Cinnamon jungle to my burned-out mirror!  
Solute empire. The loop functions to entertain a system  
to its environment.  
Everybody here is waiting for the next elixir.  
Sand-colored lake. You sought yourself for crystallizing.  
Brings all the brainwashes river banks.  
So the equinoctial love lives on in a banana,  
the fluidic house of the circus,  
the moonlit wreath that is trusting and honest.  
Indicates the coral's lighting brow.  
  
All movies become stalactites.  
Here  
I am, a esoteric hips mourned in the land of sun.
