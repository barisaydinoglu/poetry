Song For The Daughter Of Fatherless Paths
-----------------------------------------
And meetings of brutal nose of your rust colored wreath when you hold out your ears.  
Burnt umber and deedy elder,  
Here I am, a self-assured brain loathed in the boulevard of jar. Boney sunrise and the fractious ripple  
lunge at the walls of my house.  
Once there was a brutal sailor  
who  
relinquished at parties, sitting in a loop, among precisions.  
I was without doubt the god turkey  
there in the rambunctious divisions.  
When it looked me with its infinite grape eyes  
it had neither hand nor brow  
but fused quartz necklaces on its sides.  
With the defender of the vicinity where you sleep,  
a dream undulates into sequences.
