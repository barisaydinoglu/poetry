Color As Belts
--------------
Around burnt umber water and deep brown quivers.  
It was the sunset of the crab.  
There are many vagabonds in dry events.  
It was the early light of day of the ostrich.  
We get the hearing  
they must lots to excite  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but beasts.  
Perhaps they are not devoured.  
My heart moves from being oily to being parsimonious.  
Draw from it the difficult  
image of its own metaphor.  
A ship focuses its dream of a ending,  
its ending, the old ending of the acrobat order -  
its irreducable bones.  
  
As if to mutate or fly or attack.  
Goddess of the depths of my foot - your swimming  
stills your free regard as though it were sky.  
In the face of so many polyps to animosity.  
A loaf of bread baked with shaken wonder and salt.  
  
The frightened smooth broken glass that divulges in your nature.
