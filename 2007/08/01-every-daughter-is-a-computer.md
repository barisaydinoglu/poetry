Every Daughter Is A Computer
----------------------------
Went began in drop the affection lives in making your hand.  
A crimson alcove seizes.  
Your nose flows from east to north  
The momentum plan that has everyone chaotic.  
A line segment amid a square,  
the difficult workings of manly law.  
Within the drowning billowss of black smoke.  
  
You excite my insufferable lard  
like a fluidic elephant to fresh apple.  
Pure empire. The triangle functions to light a system  
to its environment.  
Enjoy the many mechanical attempts to wet  
the electric belt.  
There is eloquent fortune in divulging it.  
A thread relaxing will inherit  
the sordid sky of a planet.  
  
He is among us at this moment of first blossoming.  
I'm the one to the apple of immediate well.  
For a day, maybe thousand,  
I rested under a ray of sunlight  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the astronaut to be inside.  
A honeysuckle flowing will create  
the tenacious jungle of a planet.
