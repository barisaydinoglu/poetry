Tonight I Can Make
------------------
Conversations of leaves, the recitation  
of souls we call thick ritual.  
You see toe as smooth as the thunder.  
I wish to make a square  
outside, and every feeling, many  
times hidden in a quiver.  
Flag.  
Draw from it the calculating  
metaphor of its own inscription.  
I salute your aquatic orange  
and envy your naked pride.  
I do not prosecute in the boulevard of bitterest death.  
The tenacious well is full on your lip. And the foam to its moon  
and among the dews the nocturnal one  
the sailor covered with irreducable shades of blue.  
But the lemon seized the memory.  
Only bleak and to a  
stranger they take on time, three hundred years  
The ship mingling from my lip.  
Of a opaque opaque opaque black cousin that transforms fleshes.  
If you were not the cheesecake the electric moon  
cooks, sprinkling its orange across the sea.  
  
Went perched in key how chirping is the absent minded parallel polyps and it's incredulous shardss of emerald?  
How perching is the resolute lightning and it's boundless acids?
