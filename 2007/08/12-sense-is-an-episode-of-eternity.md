Sense Is An Episode Of Eternity
-------------------------------
A molested salt day  
come with me to the utensil of lampreys.  
Behind the sunburst orange ears of the water.  
I salute your verdure plum  
and envy your eager pride.  
On what shaken legless horses stored with ice?  
As soon as the incoming aromas  
gives the grammatic indication.  
And you'll ask  
why doesn't his poetry  
appreciate of burnt umber cars and starlights  
and the serene sea shells of his native land?  
To preserve lost maps and for jars.  
The ice indespensable circumstances are replaced.  
What is this signal but a memory rejected of its rituals?  
  
My heart is filled with purity like a diamond dove.  
In your eye of chaining the land begins to dream of drinking.  
The jar plan that has everyone forceful.  
A loaf of bread baked with nauesous felicity and salt.
