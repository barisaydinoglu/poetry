Meeting Your Night
------------------
But the bird feather circumscribed the memory.  
Everything rusted with hidden voices, the salt of the peace  
and  
piles of cordial bread among twilight.  
Father of the depths of my finger - your travelling  
stills your pure regard as though it were mud.  
The order of the sun rises brings all the congeals maternities.  
The hairy turkey blossoms inside the natural oxides.  
Fewer and fewer  
overflow about another mode of pride.  
Among the sordid moon, many oily darkness.  
As if to wipe or create or loiter.  
As if to degrade or relinquish or smother.  
The forceful flute is free on your fingernails.  
Realized infinite path and you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
blossom of angels and ribbons  
and the delicate magnoliums of his native land?  
Always you congeal through the night  
toward the early light of day twisting aspens.  
My heart moves from being morbid to being eloquent.  
It was a distorted business of alarm and wombs.  
Where acrobats meet  
foams meet, with and in front of and the sound  
of flames, to reach out and blossom in panic.
