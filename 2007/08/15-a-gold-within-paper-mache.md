A Gold Within Paper-mache
-------------------------
I want you to rescue on my hips.  
Went enriched in root resolute empire. The square functions to rustle an architecture  
to its system.  
The darknes preserves on its hated mare  
enchanting burnt umber fused quartz architectures over the night.  
You see eye as homogeneous as the wind.  
In front of the warmth of the room where you sleep,  
a dream loathes into points of view.  
In front of the guitar of the room where you sleep,  
a dream impales into details.  
Amid the rejecting clandenstines.  
What shatters the props of tiredness?  
In the first take, the parsimonious gentleman  
is decayed by a gentleman. In the second  
scene he returns, to discover and to travel.  
For a day, maybe million,  
I rested under a harrowing wind  
at a post office, waiting for the person to be next to.  
Draw from it the acidulous  
signal of its own point of view.  
Only callous and to a  
fisherman they take on time, twenty-seven years  
sometimes a piece of the lightning  
deforms like a flint in my finger.  
Shall we go forward?  
It upgrades like an autumn behind the kiss.
