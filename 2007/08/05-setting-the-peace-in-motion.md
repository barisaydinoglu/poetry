Setting The Peace In Motion
---------------------------
The earth serene trash barges are degraded.  
Here I am, a sensual breath silenced in the area of jar.  
  
Wombs of a rabid airplane  
preserving  
in the jungle outside a delirious vessel,  
Unguessed as a skeleton oyster.  
In your leg of anger the vicinity of lighthouses connect.  
And meetings of careless fingernails where natures meet  
grapes meet, among and amid and the sound  
of shortcuts, to reach out and wet in fear.  
Not the transparent moment  
when the fortnight perches the ships.  
  
Iridescent empire. The line functions to flow a system  
to its architecture.  
Our new quiver, our musical juice squares.  
Everything tremulous with angellic voices, the salt of the splendor  
and piles of domestic bread within late afternoon.  
For shades of crimson was windy and morally negative.
