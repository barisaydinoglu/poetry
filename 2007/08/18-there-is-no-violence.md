There Is No Violence
--------------------
We open the halves of a curiosities and the  
freezing of errors understands into the handsome area. Your hoove is a splendor filled with sticky nature.  
Everything cheerless with irreducable voices, the salt of the heart  
and piles of indespensable bread around day.  
Multitude of promises!  
In and out of the sand-colored the cinnamon and the cashmire  
What phenomena does the ostrich contain?  
How little we enchant and how much it gathers the mysteries of this galaxy.  
In the face of so many masks to functionality.  
I salute your smooth nectarine  
and envy your celestial pride.  
  
I took on morbid paths.  
There are many rectums outside frail events.  
What slender paths -  
the jungle is filled with it,  
productivities for the springtime and the wayside wooden.  
Panic and time - promises of fear.  
Come with me to the hound of walls.  
For a day, maybe twenty-seven,  
I rested under a blade of grass  
at a post office, waiting for the one to be outside.  
You say, what is the autumn waiting for in its green jar?  
I tell you it is waiting for essence like you.  
The breakfast weaving from my brow.  
My arcane eyelids showers you always.  
Like careless form, ships  
the dew protecting from my hips.  
Like sifted friendship, foams  
and meetings of distorted eye what we say recovers to  
gallop some other pioneer  
what a signal may teach.  
The reflection reflects in carrying your foot.  
We open the halves of a mysteries and the  
impaling  
of brambles sets into the loving field.  
You understand in the sea as in a smooth divisions.  
You are the tomato of my cold foot.  
Some magnify but I refresh your rusted nail like bottle.  
I'd do it for the movie in which you perch  
for the femininities of opaque cashmire you've stored.  
  
The darknes imposes nessecity.  
What secrets does the squirrel contain?  
How little we trust and how much it connects the mysteries of this universe.  
  
Like convicts impaling in front of graces.  
Come with me to the evil of bloods.
