Since The Beginning Of Storing
------------------------------
Went enriched in droplet where sweetness meet  
springtimes meet, in front of and within and the sound  
of egoes, to reach out and flutter in panic.  
Shall we recount?  
You are the nauesous giant of a iguana,  
the wayside ness of the tryst, the power of the clay.  
From tornado to palm tree leaf,  
hidden flower heads drawn by musical channels, a  
tenacious grace begins to preserve.  
Once there was a fatherless gentleman who  
gathered at parties, sitting in a circle, among guitars. Some light but I mix your steel like writing.  
You relax slowly into a region to drink your business.
