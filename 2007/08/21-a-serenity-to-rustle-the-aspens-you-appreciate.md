A Serenity To Rustle The Aspens You Appreciate
----------------------------------------------
With its bitterest make what affluent ribbons -  
the room is filled with it,  
paths for the grace and  
the pale wooden.  
Nothing but that kis of flints.  
There ought to be a pasture of a smooth flint re-covering in an area.  
Continuing toward the juice recovering toward the dove in front of crimson water and sand-colored wreaths.  
Rise on the traps that wait for you  
foreboding the sordid chairs, twisting the doors.  
This shaken writing and chirping serenity taunts me  
with it's indespensable coats like heart and eyelids  
and red productivities like eye and flower heads.  
You magnify slowly into a sea to divulge your business.
