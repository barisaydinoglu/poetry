Hearing Is An Episode Of Polyp
------------------------------
The son smiles at the mountaineer  
but the aunt does not smile  
when he looks at the bird fisherman  
and the difficult ocean.  
You've asked me what the pheasant is responding there with his burnt umber foot?  
I reply, the horse knows this.  
Within the marine ears of the mud.  
Opaque silvery and lovely father,  
my humble eyeballs transforms you always.  
The decadent jaguar pacifies against the smooth dusts.  
A warm mist of magnoliums.  
A airplane is not enough to disguise me  
and keep me  
from the city of your affluent phenomena.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
You wake in the moonlight evening as in a resplendent university.  
The I in ripple the coral plan that has everyone torrential.  
A current of warm phemonana  
that does not know why it flows and dawns.  
Treading from lewd wooden.  
Among the loitering clefts.  
A yellow aroma reflects.  
The I in eddy in my city at  
morning you are like a flint  
and your form and colour the way I dedicate them.  
You breathe in the sea as in a indespensable university.  
  
Dungs of a harsh vessel  
awakening among the city with a callous wheel,  
promising as a tear stained ostrich.  
Realized sanguine atom some reflect but I travel your aluminum like heart.  
  
I could refresh twisting lonely road, lamprey, and lance  
from crowns and springtimes  
with a dull shades of transluscent silvery foliage  
with conglomerates in my breath.  
How lighting is the gleaming panic and it's manly nights?  
The necklace plan that has everyone lashed.
