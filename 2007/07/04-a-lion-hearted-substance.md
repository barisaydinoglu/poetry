A Lion Hearted Substance
------------------------
In your fingernails of wetting the chimney begins to dream of hearing.  
From her shoulder and her brow attract  
flower heads of the earth.  
One algorithmic option and inside the rust colored embarassement of the vortex.  
Of your dark momentum when you hold out your finger.  
Multitude of graces!  
In and out of the opaque cashmire the sand-colored and the sand-colored  
a sepia deep brown lake connects.  
The bridge seeking from my mouth.  
Grew and then perfumed in the heights.  
You are the motionless mother of a ostrich,  
the wet-winged ness of the praise, the power of the heat.  
Of infinite nectarine, spirit  
of the veins,  
loathed mountaineer blood, your kisses  
reconcile into exile  
and a droplet of ivory, with remnants of the sea.  
Some continue but I begin your brick like ribbon.
