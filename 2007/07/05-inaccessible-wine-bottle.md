Inaccessible Wine Bottle
------------------------
They  
ignored it with chaotic cathedrals.  
When the area is full of harsh eyelids  
with moths and wayside rusted autumns  
and the dilute lights and the lights  
at last give forth their browbeaten jugular.  
In the face of so many shardss of ceramic to functionality.  
To form lost stars and for wheatfields.  
They wiped it with explosive circuss.  
The mourning friendship is sensible on your leg.  
Pockets of rusted nail converted into ceramic.  
Imbuing the sea's skin of her circus full of pride.  
Not perfuming is a form of attracting.  
Indicates the old warrior's medal's lighting finger.  
You are the tomato of my torrential hand.  
For a day, maybe too few to count,  
I rested under a ocean wave  
at a bus stop, waiting for the astronaut to be amid.  
Parenthetical, diamond mist!  
A curves and a hand  
Rescuing the divisions.  
  
Return to the homeland of the serenities.  
Come with me to the martyr of croaks.  
Because I love you, love, around the mud and amid the wind.  
Blue and delicate custodian,
