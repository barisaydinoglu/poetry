Everything Is A Technical Issue
-------------------------------
A fleeting rug making a loving thing of a chance meeting with a stranger.  
Once there was a callous fisherman who  
reconciled at parties, sitting in a circle, among bird feathers.  
Realized pure springtime you see leg as free as the snow.  
Of decisive lemon, spirit  
of the schools,  
stole god blood, your kisses  
shower into exile  
and a droplet of ceramic, with remnants of the university.
