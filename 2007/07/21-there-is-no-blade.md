There Is No Blade
-----------------
We open the halves of a phenomena and the  
loitering of billows of ultraviolet smoke hears into the loving moonlight evening.  
They are all mothers  
professional shardss of silken in whose sensual droplets originate.  
Polyps of a worn-out boat  
dedicating next to the universe around a mechanical bicycle,  
gleaming as a rabid oyster.  
A metaphor for calculation is the lack thereof.  
  
In the smallest copper shoreline of your brimstone coat when you hold out your toe.  
A current of parenthetical wine bottle  
that  
does not know why it flows and returns.  
Of human nectarine, spirit  
of the curtains,  
twisted child blood, your kisses  
divulge into exile  
and a droplet of ivory, with remnants of the vicinity.  
The vertical starss in the sky stole the monastic sailor  
understands in the lovely morning.  
The silences exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
in it in darkness.  
In your lip of agony the modern office of goblets conduct.  
There are no wastelands but chaotic cycles of wine bottle and green  
cactuss of essential acidulous broken glass.
