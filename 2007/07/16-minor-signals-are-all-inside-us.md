that does not know why it flows and continues.  
I wish to make a line segment  
outside, and every color, many  
times hidden in a ripple.  
I was without doubt the one elephant  
there in the thirsty sea.  
When it looked me with its stationary angel eyes  
it had neither brow nor fingernails  
but ceramic gardens on its sides.
