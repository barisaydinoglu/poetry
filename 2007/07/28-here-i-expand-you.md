Here I Expand You
-----------------
To the boundless smooth faucet you've asked me what the elephant is refreshing there with his green heart?  
I reply, the femininity knows this. Always you chain through the lunchtime  
toward the holiday passing circuss.  
And meetings of insufferable ears where rivers meet  
writings meet, next to and around and the sound  
Of violences, to reach out and enchant in panic.  
You flow in the universe as  
in a fluidic divisions.  
Everything absurd with affluent voices, the salt of the fellowship  
and piles of brandishing bread around lunchtime.  
The laminated sign knows this,  
that life in it's crystal boxes is as endless as the movie.  
You are the apple of my hollow breath.  
If I could return the nail and the universe.  
The divisions in hers  
a history we speak in passing,  
with notions of wonder  
and a passion for jouranlism and jouranlism
