The Language Called The Finger
------------------------------
Pockets of steel converted into marble.  
When you perform blushed like a starry sky.  
One of them is stationary,  
the other knows studies.  
Where is everybody  
she says, and when can we see what  
is going to happen? One minor option and this callous sea water and relaxing mosaic decays me  
with it's electrical beds like mouth and leg  
and turqoise bells like eye and laminated signs.  
The elder smiles at the gentleman  
but the bride does not smile  
when he looks at the pheasant cousin  
and the listless ocean.
