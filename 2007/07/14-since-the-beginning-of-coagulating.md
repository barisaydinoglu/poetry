Since The Beginning Of Coagulating
----------------------------------
So the clear wonder lives on in a fruit,  
the winged house of the magnolium,  
the spacious tree that is thick and ancient.  
Whirlwinds of goddesses and elders.  
For me  
they are side.  
Pure stick protects the lemons the reasons for my respect  
are excited in my brow of copper. I do not electrify in the area of barbaous saliva.  
The I in silence your ears inherits from north to north
