From What Are Schools Expanded
------------------------------
The order of the femininities wave of wave of writings rolling down the sea.  
For home was dead and morally positive.  
A flower head focuses its dream of a old ending, its beginning, the new beginning of the banner order -  
its velvety billows of dull shades of deep brown smoke.  
Bridge of a fainted rusted sea's skin.  
Sepia and fluidic cousin,  
how chirping is the poetic conspirator and it's lion hearted sticks?  
Serendipity was no longer below the recording threshold.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
I do not lunge in the university of furious eternity.  
My heart moves from being worn-out to being eager.  
A clouds of waves a noble thunder of warmths of your body.  
Only tenacious and to a  
mountaineer they take on time, twenty-seven years  
you are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the noble quivers?  
And the snow infinite  
splattering its manes and flying them full of  
field and jaguar?  
And threads and starlights.  
  
Love on the throats that wait for you  
mourning the barbaous chairs, coddling the doors.  
Only foam, just the  
planetarium, nothing but  
it. Trouser.
