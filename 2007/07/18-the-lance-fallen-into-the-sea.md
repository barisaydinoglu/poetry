The Lance Fallen Into The Sea
-----------------------------
Shall we keep going?  
Return to the homeland of the snows.  
You've asked me what the ostrich is seeking there with his sand-colored eyelids?  
I reply, the candle knows this.  
A opaque turqoise and rustling pullulation is pitied in the thicket.  
In the coddling eternities.  
Inside the awe of the city where you sleep,  
a dream undulates into productions.  
I am sobbed by mosaic and viola, by vortex and sunshine.  
Wave of wave of droplets rolling down the sea.  
  
I saw how prizes are expanded  
by the wonderful lighthouse.  
And a guilt star's clay will circumscribe you.  
In your tail of rejecting the archipeligos begins to dream of building.  
If you were not the grape the dashing moon  
cooks, sprinkling its bread across the jungle.  
Your kiss is a flag filled with windy faucet.  
In the smallest wooden wine bottle  
I'm the gentleman to the evening star of immediate pullulation.
