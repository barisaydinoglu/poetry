Color Is An Episode Of Shrapnel
-------------------------------
If I could blossom the eternity and the universe.  
And serenities and kiss.  
Enriching a momentum  
transformed in the poetic thunder.  
I do not mourn in the jungle of barbaous jugular.  
I'm the elder to the school of immediate starry sky.  
Magnifying from muzzled ceramic.  
And the umbrella to its affection  
and among the droplets  
the wide one  
the man covered with fleeting bridge.  
In my boulevard at early light of day you are like a home  
and your form and colour the way I create them.  
  
I re-cover as if next to a bitter rotten stump.  
Return to the homeland of the blue lakes.  
Everything burned-out with incredulous voices, the salt of the dove  
and piles of resolute bread within day. For a day, maybe three hundred,  
I rested under a palm tree leaf  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the one to be outside.  
Nothing but your ancient eye.
