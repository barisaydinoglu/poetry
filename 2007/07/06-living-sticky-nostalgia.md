Living Sticky Nostalgia
-----------------------
Not to perform or even meet  
the splendor of one who continues  
against me in a moonlight evening or returning to an aunt. A grape playing will shine  
the dead clay of a planet.  
It transforms like a circus in the flower head.  
Not to mingle or even meet  
the sea water of one who lives  
inside me in a land or refreshing to a pioneer.  
Shall we keep going?  
Pulled out and closed off like a silvery lake.  
Fewer and fewer  
plague about  
another mode of wonder.  
  
Be guided by the electric bolt of emerald architecture's mosaic.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
  
A technique for metaphor is the lack thereof.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.
