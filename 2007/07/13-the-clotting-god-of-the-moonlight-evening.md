The Clotting God Of The Moonlight Evening
-----------------------------------------
Halfway.  
Everything wounded with somber voices, the salt of the telegraph  
and piles of manly bread behind holiday.  
What is this calculation but a memory condemned of its roses?  
A loaf of bread baked with fractious felicity and salt.  
Phemonana.  
Where  
sweetness meet  
jars meet, among and inside and the sound  
of salivas, to reach out and understand in confusion.  
If you were not the bread the handsome moon  
cooks, sprinkling its nectarine across the land.  
The horse knows this,  
that life in it's ceramic boxes is as endless as the sea shell.  
An odor has woke in the well,  
a mixture of corruption and body, a galloping  
energy that brings embarassement.  
A bicycle is not enough to silence me and keep me  
from the boulevard of your fresh phenomena.  
Continue on the clandenstines that wait for you  
dying the barbaous chairs, twisting the doors.
