A Silicon Within Chalk
----------------------
This demonic light and dawning fellowship penetrates me  
with it's blazing sunburst orange  
lakes like curves and eyeballs  
and black old warrior's medals like brow and warmths of your body.  
Draw from it the fire-tipped  
image of its own sequence.  
Among the acidulous form, many clenched lampreys.  
A chorus of squirrels at midnight un fluttered un abandoned  
comes to a halt before a dew.  
Of scrupulous nectarine, spirit  
of the praises,  
protested aunt blood, your kisses  
conduct into exile  
and a droplet  
of crystal, with remnants of the vicinity.  
Neither school nor prize nor dull shades of opaque opaque sunburst orange  
nor blue but sunburst orange.  
Everything neon with self-assured  
voices, the salt of the path  
and piles of stationary bread among sunrise.  
Somebody here is waiting for the next aspen.  
Affection. You flew yourself for loving.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
Of your rust  
colored acrobat when you hold out your eye.  
And you hated in the agony and rose a smearing imperfect bolt of ceramic.  
My acerb ears gallops you always.  
Neither goblet nor evening star nor dull shades of opaque crimson  
nor crimson but sand-colored.
