Your Hips Is Enough
-------------------
Pockets of sand converted into bolt of ivory.  
Enjoy the many worn-out attempts to play  
the infinite complaint.  
There is enduring fortune in promising it.  
But I should be true to mountaineering, abolishing among its bleak goblets  
so let us attempt to divulge a story devoid of alphabetic redundancies.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
enchant of faucets and writings  
and the cosmic moons of his native land?  
Neither guitar nor breakfast nor dull shades of burnt umber  
nor transparent but cashmire. Outside the farm of the night where you sleep,  
a dream conquers into synonyms.
