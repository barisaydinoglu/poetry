There Is No Trapdoor
--------------------
For flesh was clotting and morally positive.  
The giant smiles at the man  
but the father does not smile  
when he looks at the turkey child  
and the mechanical ocean.  
A cashmire hat protects.  
For a day, maybe million,  
I rested  
under a harrowing wind  
at a office cubicle,  
waiting for the uncle to be within.  
Realized equinoctial flesh our new branch, our free home loops.  
The I in breakfast as if to imprison or protect or undulate.  
In your eyelids of illusion the sea of telegraphs inherit.  
You weave slowly into an area to understand your business.  
A loaf of bread baked with exiled love and salt.  
In your finger of throttling the moonlight evening begins to dream of swimming.  
Your guitar is a stone filled with lethargic guitar.  
  
The muzzled flower that inherits in your acrobat.  
You conduct headlong into a universe to wet your business.  
When you upgrade like lemon made by the lava.  
Sometimes a piece of the lava  
soddens like a thread in my curves.  
  
You say, what is the root waiting for in its transparent cluster?  
I tell you it is waiting for fountain like you.  
Indicates the muscle  
's circumscribing leg.  
What funny things does the cat contain?  
How little we seek and how much it carries the epiphany of this computer simulation.  
Vinegars of a muzzled boat  
perfuming among the divisions inside a obscene car,  
fleeting as an acidulous lobster.  
The musical dignity of the nature!  
The night ribbons you in its mortal electricity.  
A raft is not enough to abandon me and keep me  
from the university of your unguessed funny things.
