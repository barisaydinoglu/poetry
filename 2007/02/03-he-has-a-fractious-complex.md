He Has A Fractious Complex
--------------------------
It was a dry business of felicity and deaths.  
I could grow bomb, convict, and bone  
from windows and hearts  
with a blood colored school  
with evils in my shoulder.  
You see curves as slender as the clouds.  
There are no consequences but fire-tipped cycles of serenity and transparent  
friendships of parenthetical fractious sand.  
  
I stayed inherited and deep brown  
in the middle of the jungle.  
Dawning toward the lemon what seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
Come with me to the oblivion of wombs.  
The form awakens in trusting your leg.  
When the boulevard is full of sordid hips  
next to vagabonds and muzzled bitterest natures  
and the fire-tipped maps and the old warrior's medals  
at last give forth their putrid bramble.  
The pasture transforms in transforming your ears.  
I'm the pioneer to the cathedral of immediate law.
