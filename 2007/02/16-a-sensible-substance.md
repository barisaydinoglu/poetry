A Sensible Substance
--------------------
In the first reel, the serene daughter  
is penetrated by a custodian. In the second  
scene he returns, to swim and to mix.  
They buried it with boneless horses.  
A current of dashing coat  
that does not know why it flows and entertains.  
Only insufferable and to a  
custodian they take on time, too few to count years  
I do not loathe in the heights of pale viola.  
Against the inaccessible land of fragmented dove.  
You've asked me what the turkey is relinquishing there with his transparent leg?  
I reply, the umbrella knows this.  
I crystallize as if in front of a molested parallel granules.  
Where miracles meet  
propellers meet, in front of and around and the sound  
of clocks, to reach out and gather in anger.  
A chorus of crabs at day un lighted un dropped  
comes to a halt before a shoreline.  
Conversations of river banks, the recitation  
of leaves we call honest honeysuckle.  
When the land is full of frail shoulder  
in front of lances and ironous difficult salts  
and the rotten lighthouses and the breakfasts  
at last give forth their disordered wasteland.  
It is a tale of calcerous bones once there was a skeleton father who  
gathered at parties, sitting in a quadrangle, among saxophones.  
In front of the brimstone sorrow of the juice.  
  
There are many  
oxides among parched events.  
I was without doubt the fisherman squirrel  
there in the sticky sea.  
When it looked me with its eager time eyes  
it had neither leg nor mouth  
but saphire essences on its sides.
