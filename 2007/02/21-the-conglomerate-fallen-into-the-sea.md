The Conglomerate Fallen Into The Sea
------------------------------------
The cosmic woman  
shines in the hopeful  
morning.  
It was a wet-winged business of lard and sticks.  
In the face of so many trapdoors to animosity.  
Deceive me and let my substance form.  
Cinnamon mud to my disordered ritual!  
What mourns  
the props of sincerity?  
And the mosaic to its moon  
and among the currents the serene one  
the mountaineer covered with aquatic book.  
The rustling lobster upgrades among the absorbant polyps.  
Outside the wetting twisting lonely roads.  
And inside my hammock, during the twilight, I woke up naked  
and full of joy.  
  
Only disordered and to a  
god they take on time, three hundred years  
return to the homeland of the shadess of blue.  
  
Full stop.  
Pockets of salt converted into cork.
