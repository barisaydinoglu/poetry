It Swam With Energies
---------------------
Deep brown puberties of panic,  
yellow seams above a calcerous eddy.  
I wish to make a loop  
next to, and every sense, many  
times hidden in a thread.  
So the winged happiness lives on in a banana,  
the aquatic house of the movie,  
the enchanting path that is spacious and domestic.  
Mother of the depths of my nose - your refreshing  
stills your celestial regard as though it were lightning.  
I'd do it for the laminated sign in which you live  
for the precisions of opaque sand-colored you've shone.  
The jungle human graves are fainted.  
Fear and gem architecture - energies of sorrow.
