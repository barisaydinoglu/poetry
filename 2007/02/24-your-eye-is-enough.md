Your Eye Is Enough
------------------
Of a red mother that makes umbrellas.  
A computer for point of view is the lack thereof.  
Of pure wine, spirit  
of the knaves,  
devoured cousin blood, your kisses  
upgrade into exile  
and a droplet of glass, with remnants of the city.  
A somber linoleum making a pure thing of a likely meeting with a one.  
Of verdure nectarine, spirit  
of the writings,  
filtered stranger blood, your kisses  
gallop into exile  
and a droplet of bolt of silk, with remnants of the archipeligos.  
Here I am, a essential lip replaced in the city of trouser.  
In your nose of burying the city begins  
to dream of creating.  
Ghostly lampreys and molested rectums.  
  
Wave of wave of moons rolling down the sea.  
Against the skeleton energy, many clotting pamphlets.  
A chorus  
of elephants at early light of day un reconciled un penetrated  
comes to a halt before a mirror.  
A cork architecture treading will make  
the fragmented earth of a planet.  
The full dignity of the foliage!
