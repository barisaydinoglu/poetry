A Chalk Within Saphire
----------------------
I'd do it for the flute in which you weave  
for the bottles of deep brown you've rejoiced.  
You've asked me what the lobster is entertaining there with  
his opaque sepia hips?  
I reply, the maternity knows this.  
I could blush invasion, coal, and lamprey  
from stones and eddies  
with a black current  
with trash barges in my hips.  
A aquatic drizzle of echoes.
