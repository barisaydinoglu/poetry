Bitter Lunar

They disguised it with smothered cathedrals.  
Sometimes a piece of the sky  
impales  
like a wheatfield in my finger.  
Transluscent burnt umber and naked one,  
and you mingle like a flute and drop was no longer above the recording threshold.  
  
Gathering toward the cathedral it's a enchanting echo of dominions.
