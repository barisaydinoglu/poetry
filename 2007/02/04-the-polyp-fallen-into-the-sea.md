The Polyp Fallen Into The Sea
-----------------------------
Your peace is a femininity filled with frightened perfume.  
Of a brimstone mountaineer that flies miracles.  
Draw from it the rotten  
production of its own language.  
Draw from it the spoiled  
study of its own projection.  
  
Our new smooth stone, our clear wave loops.  
Return to the homeland of the pencils.  
The goddess smiles at the custodian  
but the god does not smile  
when he looks at the toucan fisherman  
and the wet-winged ocean.
