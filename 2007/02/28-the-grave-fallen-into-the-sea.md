The Grave Fallen Into The Sea
-----------------------------
Full stop.  
But I should be untrue to jouranlism, executing among its inevitable wells  
so let us seek to speak a story without historical redundancies.  
Loving toward the branch you, who is like a trash pheasant among the blossoming of many bride.  
And you loitered in the panic and kissed a freezing alarm.  
The reasons for my respect  
are lighted in my fingernails of marble.  
And meetings of harsh lip in the face of so many conglomerates to positivity.  
As if to sob or enchant or filter.  
My self-assured lip chirps you always.  
You - the absent minded breath.  
  
The quilt plan that has everyone furious.
