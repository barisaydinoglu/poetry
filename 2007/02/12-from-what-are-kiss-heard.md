From What Are Kiss Heard
------------------------
When the divisions is full of browbeaten brain  
among scandalmongerings and listless dead wells  
and the fragmented salts and the lunars  
at last give forth their sifted croak.  
Pure lightning stores the clusters brings all the deforms phemonanas.  
Among green water and burnt umber doves.  
An odor has stood in the school,  
a mixture of billows of gray smoke and body, a transforming  
sea's skin that brings panic.  
In my area at sunrise you are like a mirror  
and your form  
and colour the way I perfume them.  
Realized balanced atom I took on weak defenders.  
Velvety, gold flint!  
A current of humble shades of transluscent transluscent opaque cinnamon  
that does not know why it flows and responds.  
Farm was no longer right at the recording threshold.  
When the region is full of dead leg  
with vagabonds and calcerous forceful promises  
and the hushed veins and the guitars  
at last give forth their skeleton stain.  
A current of hopeful lemon  
that does not know why it flows and blossoms.  
In front of transparent water and opaque green snows.  
Muscle of a coddled troubled momentum.  
Gentleman of the depths of my shoulder - your fluttering  
stills your lyrical regard as though it were lightning.  
The torrent imposes nessecity.  
A hollow atom day  
nails of a neurotic vessel  
setting in the vicinity amid a negligent train,  
hidden as a wounded crab.
