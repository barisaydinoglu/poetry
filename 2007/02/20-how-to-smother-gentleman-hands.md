How To Smother Gentleman Hands
------------------------------
My winged foot gathers you always.  
Halfway.  
You've asked me what the toucan is understanding there with his blue brow?  
I reply, the tiger knows this.  
I took on skeleton starlights.  
A chorus of toucans at holiday un entertained un foreboded  
comes to a halt before a wine bottle.  
As if to freeze or reconcile or deceive.  
I salute your eager sugar  
and envy your nocturnal pride.  
The bottle plan that has everyone bleak.  
Multitude of knaves!  
In and out of the yellow the silvery and  
the opaque blue  
of wide apple, spirit  
of the juices,  
ignored father blood, your kisses  
trust into exile  
and a droplet of silicon, with remnants of the boulevard.  
  
Has the night been began with phenomena?  
The reasons for my respect  
are began in my leg of gold.  
  
Draw from it the misunderstood  
machine of its own production.
