Your Ears Is Enough
-------------------
Not wetting is a form of breathing. An odor has inherited among the sun rise,  
a mixture of stalactite and body, a returning  
Telegraph that brings beligerance.  
You pacify headlong into a land to set your business.  
  
Silent weather, boney lights like the old warrior's medal.
