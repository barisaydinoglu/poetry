I Expected Pioneers
-------------------
The reasons for my respect  
are rustled in my eye  
of diamond.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
I am passed by time and ghost, by bramble and thunder.  
Full stop.  
In the smallest  
copper movie when you continue like cactus attracted by the lightning.  
Relaxed and then pulsed in the divisions.  
A finger and a ears  
loving the region.  
Myriad empire. The triangle functions to perform a system  
to its architecture.  
  
The time plan that has everyone absurd.  
It's a gathering quilt of nails.
