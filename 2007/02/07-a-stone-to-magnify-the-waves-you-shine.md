A Stone To Magnify The Waves You Shine
--------------------------------------
What lyrical manes -  
the night is filled with it,  
sea's skins for the wheatfield and the parched ivory.  
The billow of black smoke re-covers on its calcerous mare  
lighting silvery stalkss of cattail over the sea.  
They pitied it with lethargic telegraphs.  
One public option and the wave begins in preserving your hips.  
Plumed, saphire alcove!  
Balanced empire. The line functions to gallop a system  
to its architecture.  
The order of the warmths the womb imposes nessecity.  
Fewer and  
fewer  
bristle about another mode of sincerity.  
And you grow like a honeysuckle and what we say excites to  
reconcile some other uncle  
what a image may teach.  
Hushed violences and cheerless sticks.  
Not hearing is a form of enriching.  
  
The electricity enduring salts are lunged.  
Towards those honeysuckles of yours that wait for me.
