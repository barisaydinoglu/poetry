Song For The Lady Of Hushed Landscapes
--------------------------------------
One of them is sensible,  
the other knows languages.  
Where is noone  
he quips, and  
when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Of a black stranger that pulses hats.  
A loaf  
of bread baked with inevitable honor and salt.  
When you awaken like bottle understood by the wind.
