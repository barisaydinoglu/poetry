Hearing Is An Episode Of Corruption
-----------------------------------
They are all sailors  
professional scandalmongerings in whose decisive cathedrals originate.  
Forming from crooked crystal.  
They congealed it with dry quilts.  
Respect is gone, the subject has crystallized.  
Your sphere is a quiver filled with rabid aroma.  
The late afternoon propellers you in its mortal clay.  
A cluster focuses its dream of a new ending, its old ending, the beginning of the kis order -  
its hidden vortices.  
The electricity perfect shadows are brainwashed.  
  
One grammatic option and to continue lost coats and for schools.  
A black and lonely garden is abandoned in the night.  
When you dawn flew like a vein.
