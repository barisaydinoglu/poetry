Fishermen Must Always Prove Their Promises
------------------------------------------
Coral of a struck furious pencil.  
The brutal land that flutters in your salt.  
I am cracked by friendship and invasion, by jackal and wind.  
What poetic trees -  
the university is filled with it,  
wells for the serendipity and the muzzled silken.  
When you entertain like grace flowed by the clay.  
You are the ghostly uncle  
of a cat,  
the silent ness of the dove, the power of the sky.  
Sometimes a piece of the heat  
chains like a fellowship in my nose.  
When the room is full of directionless finger  
in cadavers and rotten rotten moons  
and the neurotic forests and the sea shells  
at last give forth their guilt trap.  
Waking toward the bed be guided by the scrupulous shoreline's star.  
  
Always you congeal through the morning  
toward the sunrise plaguing candles.
