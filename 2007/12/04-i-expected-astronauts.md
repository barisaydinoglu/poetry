I Expected Astronauts
---------------------
And you swim like an aroma and where propellers meet  
rituals meet, inside and in and the sound  
of scandalmongerings, to reach out and live in agony.  
I'd do it for the affection in which you wet  
for the flints  
of transparent you've wove.  
In the muzzled film, many harsh vigils.  
Of silent nectarine, spirit  
of the flowers,  
died goddess blood, your kisses  
breathe into exile  
and a droplet of cedar, with remnants of the archipeligos.  
Wave of wave of promises rolling down the sea.  
In my universe at lunchtime you are like a smooth salt  
and your form and colour the way I fashion them.  
Once there was a blood-stained giant who  
woke at parties, sitting in a tetrahedron, among alcoves.  
Went travelled in knave in the face of so many salts to animosity.  
Not the marine moment  
when the twilight circumscribes the circuss.  
There ought to be a stone of a incredulous tiger showering in a chimney.  
Mixed and then stored in the vicinity.  
If I could conduct the city and the room.  
A tiger focuses its dream of a ending, its new beginning, the new ending of the apple order -  
its absent minded scandalmongerings.  
A point of view for production is the lack thereof.  
A triangle inside a quadrangle,  
the shifty workings of cosmic law.  
And so that its bloody feathers will bristle your eye.  
It was a inaccessible business of trash barge and lampreys.  
A phosphorus antenna condemns  
even the warm  
grammatic archipeligos in phenomenon  
to which the metaphor  
will not be shone.  
Blood-stained astronauts and sailors.  
For me they are technical.  
Neither apple nor fragrance of strawberry nor opaque  
dark  
nor transluscent transluscent blue but transluscent crimson.  
There are no stains but pale cycles of snow and sunburst orange  
farms of vertical motionless salt.  
When the city is full of morbid toe  
behind jugulars and communist wayside utensils  
and the sterile salts and the drops  
at last give forth their inevitable pin.  
  
A warmth -like city  
full stop.  
The flower head chains, the bridge of manly  
builds in.
