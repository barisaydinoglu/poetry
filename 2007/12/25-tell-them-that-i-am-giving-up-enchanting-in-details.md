Tell Them That I Am Giving Up Enchanting In Details
---------------------------------------------------
The sticky elephant pulses in the careful brambles.  
The cactus knows this,  
that life in it's ceramic boxes is as endless as the foliage.  
And the serendipity to its femininity  
and among the autumns the clear one  
the man covered with gleaming river.  
In the first reel, the deedy elder  
is fainted by a god. In the second  
take he returns, to recover and to pacify.  
I want you to begin on my nose.  
Which is a serendipidous flute of directions  
too few to count or too many to count, swam  
on a current or in the comfortable lunar  
directions of the fingernails, a calculation in your eyes.  
In my room at early light of day you are like a ritual  
and your form and colour the way I inherit them.
