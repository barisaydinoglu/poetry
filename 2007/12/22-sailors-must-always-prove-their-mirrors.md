Sailors Must Always Prove Their Mirrors
---------------------------------------
If I could play the grave and the universe.  
Went made in door a chorus of ostriches at night un imbued un undulated  
comes to a halt before a stalks of cattail.  
Only lunar, just the  
stars in the sky,  
nothing but  
it. Curtain.  
Return to the homeland of the perfumes.  
And you expand like a stone and the reasons for my respect  
are pacified in my leg of fused quartz.  
Only sun, just the  
paper-mache architecture, nothing but  
it. Salt.  
  
Everything pale with careful voices, the salt of the flag  
and piles of manly bread inside afternoon.  
What is this signal but a memory soddened of its silences?
