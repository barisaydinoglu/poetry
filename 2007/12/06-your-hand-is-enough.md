Your Hand Is Enough
-------------------
Of your blood colored river bank when you hold out your toe.  
The umbrella hearing from my hips.  
The apple deforms, the flute of hidden  
perfumes next to.  
Behind the region like aluminum.  
  
God of the depths of my eyeballs - your mingling  
stills your vertical regard as though it were lightning.
