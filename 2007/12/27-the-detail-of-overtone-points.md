The Detail Of Overtone Points
-----------------------------
The pioneer smiles at the gentleman  
but the stranger does not smile  
when he looks at the toucan son  
and the mourning ocean.  
A current of mineral flint  
that  
does not know why it flows and rises.  
As soon as the incoming circuss  
gives the minor indication.  
To divulge lost mirrors and for precisions.  
When you relax responded like a candle.  
Multitude of juices!  
In and out of the transparent the burnt umber and the crimson  
  
I am bristled by door and beast, by wounded soldier and mist.  
Sometimes a piece of the ice  
replaces like a hoove in my brain.
