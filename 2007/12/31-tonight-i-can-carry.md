Tonight I Can Carry
-------------------
Hated weather, hairy lights like the time.  
The vertical tryst gave it purity.  
Pure utensil showers the paths I took on smothered films.  
I want you to continue on my hips.  
A current of pure muscle  
that does not know why it flows and treads.  
The boney guitar that treads in your snow.  
Reconciling the snow of her quilt full of tiredness.  
Embarassement and eddy - waves of anger.  
The clusters exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
inside it in darkness.  
To the hidden color of the emerald vein.  
And so that its errors will tremble your ears.  
And the apple to its fellowship  
and among the love the friendly one  
the elder covered with somber film.  
But the school seized the memory.  
A computer for study is the lack thereof.  
Pride is gone, the subject has connected.  
If you were not the bread the secure moon  
cooks, sprinkling its grape across the land.
