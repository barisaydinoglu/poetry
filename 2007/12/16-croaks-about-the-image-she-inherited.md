Croaks About The Image She Inherited
------------------------------------
She is against us at this moment of first seizing.  
You fly my muzzled martyr  
like a incredulous iguana to fresh peach.  
I wish to make a loop  
next to, and every sense, many  
times hidden in a bird feather.  
Not carrying  
is a form of pulsing.  
The perfect suns coagulated one of them is rosy,  
the other knows signals.  
Where is everybody  
she quips, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?
