Ones Must Always Prove Their Sweetness
--------------------------------------
Tryst. The essence knows this,  
that life in it's silken boxes is as endless as the old warrior's medal.  
The human droplet gave it happiness.  
What curiosities does the tiger contain?  
How little we respond and how much it divulges the curiosities of this computer simulation.  
Of your ultraviolet grace when you hold  
out your leg.  
I'd do it for the starlight in which you re-cover  
for the bells of green you've swam.  
When the modern office is full of mechanical fingernails  
behind bombs and imperalist frightened roots  
and the parched kisses and the wine bottles  
at last give forth their morose granule.
