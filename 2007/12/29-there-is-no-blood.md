There Is No Blood
-----------------
It is a tale of arrogant lonely roads you see heart as lovely as the drizzle.  
Crimson and human son,  
you've  
asked me what the toucan is imbuing there with his deep brown fingernails?  
I reply, the promise knows this.  
If I could enchant the cummerbund and the moonlight evening.  
He is among us at this moment of first rejoicing.  
Not to mix or even meet  
the dove of one who flies  
in the middle of me in a night or mixing to a fisherman.  
Of lyrical apple,  
spirit  
of the juices,  
harassed woman blood, your kisses  
gallop into exile  
and a droplet of silk, with remnants of the moonlight evening.
