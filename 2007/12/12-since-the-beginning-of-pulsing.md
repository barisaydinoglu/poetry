Since The Beginning Of Pulsing
------------------------------
Always you silence through the lunchtime  
toward the late afternoon mourning clusters. I do not crack in the area of neon pin.  
A sand-colored dove excites.  
Like the sifted graphite of sun rises in  
my city at morning you are like a essence  
and your form and colour the way I rustle them.
