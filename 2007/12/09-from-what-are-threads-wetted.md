From What Are Threads Wetted
----------------------------
Of your gray circus when you hold out your toe.  
The sordid old warrior's medal is clear on your finger.  
It was a tremulous business of shards of ceramic and flasks.  
With its lewd dawn what indespensable flutes -  
the field is filled with it,  
peaces for the cactus and the fatherless ivory.  
  
Shifty holiday and the atrocious reflection  
mourn at the walls of my house.  
Only wayside and to a  
son they take on time, too few to count years
