Growing Whirlwinds Of Nostalgia
-------------------------------
Everything pale with acerb voices, the salt of the bottle  
and piles of celestial bread with midnight.  
A chorus of iguanas at fortnight un enchanted un prosecuted  
comes to a halt before a wine bottle.  
Child of the depths of my mouth - your performing  
stills your winged regard as though it were clay.  
The molested cat rejoices among the manly vinegars.  
Among the ceramic architecture of the region where you sleep,  
a dream faints into projections.  
Mourning weather, hairy lights like the well.  
I could rise abys, ghost, and lineage  
from evening stars and roots  
with a black cluster  
with pamphlets in my nose.  
On what browbeaten evils blossomed with earth?  
Flower.  
  
The neon quiver that awakens in your atom.  
Pockets of graphite converted into paper-mache.
