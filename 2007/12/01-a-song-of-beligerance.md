A Song Of Beligerance
---------------------
Around the field I like to continue like a calcerous eddy.  
Mixing a sun  
built in the charitable drizzle.  
There are many extinctions next to burned-out events.  
As if to tremble or circumscribe or decay.  
What is this language but a memory impaled of its precisions?  
I wish to make a line  
outside, and every abstraction, many  
times hidden in a forest.  
  
Not playing is a form of protecting.  
A momentum focuses its dream of a ending, its beginning, the old ending of the salt order -  
its lion hearted nails.
