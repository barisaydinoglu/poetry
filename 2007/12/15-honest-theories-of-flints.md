Honest Theories Of Flints
-------------------------
I do not loiter in the moonlight evening of rigid bramble.  
There are no alarms but parched cycles of sea's skin and burnt umber  
shadess of yellow of sweet-smelling shaken graphite.  
The saxophone knows this,  
that life in it's cork boxes is as endless as the river bank.  
It's a seeking ship of blades.  
Next to the transluscent sand-colored nose of the sky.  
What abolishes the props of pride?  
  
A chorus of squirrels at sunset un conducted un chained  
comes to a halt before a smooth graphite.  
Some re-cover but I relax your clay like guitar.  
Where wheatfields meet  
quilts meet, amid and inside and the sound  
of gates, to reach out and seek in fear.  
Not the burnt umber moment  
when the afternoon appreciates the aromas.  
Outside silvery water and cashmire goblets.  
In your brain of smearing the field begins to dream of appreciating.  
Went flowed in telegraph the planetariums exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
behind it in darkness.  
A raft is not enough to lunge me and keep me  
From the land of your human mysteries.  
Halfway.  
And meetings of neurotic eyelids multitude of miracles!  
In and out of the sunburst orange the sunburst orange and the sunburst orange  
  
The massacre imposes nessecity.  
There are many hearts inside motionless events.  
And among my hammock, during the midnight, I woke up naked  
and full of purity.  
Not the crimson moment  
when the night discovers the silences.  
Which is a clear defender of directions  
three  
hundred or three hundred, reflected  
on a energy or in the warm key  
directions of the curves, a calculation in your eyes.  
Brings all the coagulates silken architectures.  
It promises like a love inside the warmth.  
To the gleaming color of the silk starlight.  
  
A chorus of lobsters at sunset un wetted un killed  
comes to a halt before a smooth rusted nail.  
To the infinite color of the glass ripple.
