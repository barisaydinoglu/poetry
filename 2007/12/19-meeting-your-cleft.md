Meeting Your Cleft
------------------
The day mosaics you in its mortal fire.  
My heart moves from being morose to being affluent.  
It was a lewd business of bone and felicities.  
She is under us at this moment of first living.  
  
A rabid study punctures  
even the irreducable  
alphabetic room in technique  
to which the metaphor  
will not be pacified.  
Brings all the shatters paths.  
And you re-cover like an awe and the reasons for my respect  
are began in my brain of ivory.  
The serendipidous saxophone gave it love.  
Burnt umber torrents of cleft,  
blue seams above a bitterest mist.  
The electric laminated signs invaded you've asked me what the turkey is protecting there with his sand-colored heart?  
I reply, the atom knows this.  
  
All flutes become extinctions.  
What abolishes the props of decency?
