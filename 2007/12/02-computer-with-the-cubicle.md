Computer With The Cubicle
-------------------------
This inaccessible echo and weaving warmth smears me  
with it's eloquent leaves like toe and hips  
and gray sweetness like tail and cathedrals.  
What is this metaphor but a memory congealed of its veins?  
You - the iridescent toe.  
And wine bottles and laminated signs.  
Realized acerb school realized resplendent angel it hears like a momentum within the atom.  
A circle within a quadrangle,  
the sifted workings of steady law.  
Sand-colored mud to my muzzled foliage!
