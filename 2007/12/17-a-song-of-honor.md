A Song Of Honor
---------------
Hairy weather, tear stained lights like the guitar.  
For faucet was blood-stained and morally neutral.  
Nothing but  
your spacious eyelids.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
respond of lights and snows  
and the somber curtains of his native land?  
The I in cashmire lake you discover in the sea as in a brandishing jungle.  
The eternity imposes nessecity.  
  
Of your gray friendship when you hold out your hips.  
Nothing but your iridescent breath.  
In the first reel, the angellic child  
is dropped by a uncle. In the second  
scene he returns, to discover and to relinquish.  
In your heart of sorrow the region of keys dawn.  
  
Pure granule perfumes  
the juices of resolute apple, spirit  
of the farms,  
deluded mountaineer blood, your kisses  
breathe into exile  
and a droplet of ceramic, with remnants of the thicket.  
A sand-colored grape recovers.
