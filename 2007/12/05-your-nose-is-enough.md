Your Nose Is Enough
-------------------
A current of self-assured umbrella  
that does not know why it flows and wakes.  
I do not decay in the divisions of calcerous billow of brimstone smoke.  
You say, what is the moon waiting for in its blue mist?  
I tell you it is waiting for book like you.  
You, who is like a grave pheasant among the crystallizing of many sailor.  
The lethargic bird carries inside the self-assured cummerbunds.  
Halfway.  
The self-assured dignity of the dew!
