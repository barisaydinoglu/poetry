The Shards Of Crystal Fallen Into The Sea
-----------------------------------------
The ice delicious granules are invaded.  
A forest protecting will seize  
the skeleton sky of a planet.  
I store as if within a rustling bloody feather.  
From her hand and her hand pacify  
sea water of the earth.  
You've asked me what the jaguar is creating there with his crimson lip?  
I reply, the mosaic knows this.  
Of a red person that seeks grapes.  
  
So the homogeneous respect lives on in a fruit,  
the resplendent house of the warmth,  
the monastic promise that is real and indespensable.  
The order of the smooth sand you've asked me what the jaguar is crystallizing there with  
his sunburst orange mouth?  
I reply, the dove knows this.  
You say, what is the phemonana waiting for in its cinnamon forest?  
I tell you it is waiting for book like you.  
Putrid ladies and sailors.  
For me they are slightest.  
Multitude of warmths!  
In and out of the transluscent transparent the sepia and the crimson  
They loathed it with insufferable femininities.  
For a day, maybe twenty-seven,  
I rested  
under a tornado  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the man to be around.  
Gathering toward the goblet magnolium.  
Enjoy the many disordered attempts to awaken  
the incredulous noise.  
There is trusting fortune in relinquishing it.  
A serene sun of homes.  
For hat was brutal and morally neutral.  
An odor has began in the middle of the elixir,  
A mixture of conglomerate and body, a waking  
lunar that brings beligerance.  
And meetings of fatherless tail pockets of sand converted into saphire.  
  
There are many convicts amid fragmented events.  
With the river bank of the city where you sleep,  
a dream mourns into studies.  
Of a brimstone fisherman that conducts splendors.
