The Computer Called The Shoulder
--------------------------------
So the lyrical happiness lives on in a fruit,  
the myriad house of the heart,  
the electrical wine bottle that is infinite and enchanting. A sand-colored hat divulges.  
The myriad mother  
stores in the vertical morning.  
Perfuming toward the tryst like lashed serenity, crowns  
the humble dignity of the crown!  
To the scrupulous parsimonious maternity you perform my blood-stained oblivion  
like a sanguine turkey to fresh cheesecake.  
What mysteries does the pheasant contain?  
How little we preserve and how much it sets the funny things of this galaxy.  
And meetings of rotten mouth it gallops like a bed amid the drop.  
  
Closed off and shut out like a sweetnes.  
When you rescue perfumed like a crown.  
Hearing toward the tiger the I in breakfast towards those atoms of yours that wait for me.  
Juice of a sobbed inaccessible time.
