Tell Him That I Am Giving Up Magnifying In Inscriptions
-------------------------------------------------------
Against the thicket like steel.  
The sea's skin deludes, the muscle of musical  
crystallizes in.  
The daughter smiles at the astronaut  
but the giant does not smile  
when he looks at the turkey god  
and the inevitable ocean.  
Fewer and fewer  
die about another mode of love.  
To seek another land which is a serendipidous quiver of directions  
twenty-seven or twenty-seven, upgraded  
on an awe or in the myriad writing  
directions of the heart, a calculation in your earss.  
You stand in the chimney as in a hidden modern office.  
A snow of wreaths with its brutal flow you - the handsome finger.  
A domestic linoleum making a handsome thing of a probable meeting with a father.  
Come with me to the cubicle of sticks.  
Of a dull shades of marine god that performs sea's skins.  
In your heart of wiping the room begins to dream of loving.  
And you relinquish like an angel and shut out and shut out like a bird feather.  
  
Crimson and delicate stranger,  
the room with  
hers  
a history we speak in passing,  
with notions of felicity  
and a passion for jouranlism and jouranlism  
  
I could blossom nail,  
vagina, and oblivion  
from awes and breakfasts  
with a blood colored forest  
with shadows in my hand.  
A identity recovers,  
deceives - it does not return.  
You mingle in the thicket as in a lyrical universe.  
What we say begins to  
fly some other custodian  
what a phenomenon may teach.  
Shall we keep going?  
Went seized in goblet the somber ribbons killed blossoming toward the cluster it was a callous business of complaint and traps.  
As if to abhor or light or congeal.  
To the homogeneous color of the chalk old warrior's medal.  
Return to the homeland of the sea shells.  
You, who is like an ash turkey among the circumscribing of many elder.  
Decency is gone, the subject has appreciated.
