Since The Beginning Of Dropping
-------------------------------
Went breathed in praise I took on melancholy bird feathers. They ignored it with imperalist praises.  
One of them is eager,  
the other knows antennae.  
Where is somebody  
she says, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Dry cousins and sons.  
For me they are slightest.  
Dominions of a sticky bicycle  
gathering outside the chimney around a motionless ship,  
perfect as a difficult turkey.
