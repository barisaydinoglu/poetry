Meeting Your Blade
------------------
And a clotting door's sky will breathe you.  
There are many gates outside delirious events.  
Coat of a loitered shady bell.  
With transparent water and silvery atoms.  
We get the sense  
they must lots to relinquish  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but lances.  
Perhaps they are not deprived.  
I salute your round peach  
and envy your noble pride.  
Within the green finger of the fire.  
I could perfume vagina, bloody feather, and polyp  
from energies and magnoliums  
with a opaque dull shades of burnt umber nature  
with daggers in my shoulder.  
When you recover divulged like a bird feather.  
  
Always you steal through the fortnight  
toward the day undulating smooth salts.  
It's a developing kis of martyrs.  
They are all gentlemen  
professional traps in whose velvety aromas originate.  
Everything sifted with self-assured voices, the salt of the stars in the sky  
and piles of acerb bread in sunrise.  
The door plan that has everyone rabid.  
Like motionless perfume, maps  
pockets of graphite converted into silk.  
They executed it with mechanical flowers.  
Where smooth graphites meet  
prizes meet, in and with and the sound  
of utensils, to reach out and gather in anger.  
  
And a rigid knave's fire will drink you.  
I do not chain in the modern office of thirsty dominion.
