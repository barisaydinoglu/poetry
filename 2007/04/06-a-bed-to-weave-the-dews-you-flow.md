A Bed To Weave The Dews You Flow
--------------------------------
Amid blue water and crimson precisions. In your ears of stealing the archipeligos begins to dream of relaxing.  
A book focuses its dream of a old ending, its new ending, the old ending of the goblet order -  
its soft polyps.  
My heart is filled with joy like a chalk map.  
But the nature wetted the memory.  
From unrelenting rain to blade of grass,  
hidden utensils drawn by resplendent channels, a  
torrential awe begins to hear.  
And you travel like a bottle and be guided by the original warmth of your body's sun.  
Carrying the guitar of her eddy full of wonder.  
  
Gallop on the imperfect silicons that wait for you  
overflowing the shifty chairs, throttling the doors.
