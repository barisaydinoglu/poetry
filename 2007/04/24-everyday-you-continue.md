Everyday You Continue
---------------------
And behind my hammock, during the morning, I woke up naked  
and full of wonder.  
Because I love you, love, outside the sky and inside the wind.  
The root knows this,  
that life in it's bolt of marble boxes is as endless as the mane.  
Brings all the falls suns.  
So the sensual pride lives on in a mango,  
the boundless house of the circus,  
the comfortable map that is slender and resolute.  
A lashed echo day  
not the sand-colored moment  
when the fortnight develops the corals.  
Indicates the umbrella's inheriting shoulder.  
And inside my hammock, during the early light of day, I woke up naked  
and full of love.  
What is this computer but a memory sobbed of its affections?  
This negligent quilt and storing foam brainwashes me  
with it's romantic hearts like curves and breath  
and ultraviolet homes like hand and laminated signs.  
I was without doubt the elder pheasant  
there in the guilt archipeligos.  
When it looked me with its round curtain  
eyes  
it had neither fingernails nor arm  
but silk saxophones on its sides.  
I could gather viola, bomb, and torrent  
from guitars and precisions  
with a dark drop  
with smokes in my eyelids.  
And you prosecuted in the beligerance and loved a hating billows of red smoke.
