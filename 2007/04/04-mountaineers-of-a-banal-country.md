Mountaineers Of A Banal Country
-------------------------------
Nothing but your decisive breath.  
Of your rust colored warmth of your body when you hold out your breath.  
I want you to set on my mouth.  
In the first reel, the incredulous mountaineer  
is smeared by a cousin. In the second  
take he returns, to form and  
to perch.  
It was a sticky business of vagabond and ghosts.  
And you fell in the agony and protected a throttling jugular.  
To blossom lost bells and for forms.  
And grapes and serenities.  
Not the transparent moment  
when the midnight pacifies the roots.  
How lighting is the silent death and it's electric massacres?
