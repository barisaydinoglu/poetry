Dashing Theories Of Bridges
---------------------------
In your eyeballs of filtering the archipeligos begins to dream of developing.  
Like lampreys striking outside spheres.  
My heart is filled with honor like a fused quartz horse.  
The inaccessible bird entertains among the incredulous cities.  
Carry me onto your raft - the apple of my ripple -  
the whirlwinds of energy is acerb on your breath.  
In the universe like brick.  
When you divulge like shades of deep brown built by the water.  
In the face of so many walls to functionality.  
The cedar architecture abducts, the prize of rosy  
carries outside.  
What we say wets to  
relinquish some other lady  
what a image may teach.  
There are many wounded soldiers inside frail events.  
I took on bitterest bird feathers.  
And you conduct like a dove and I do not change in the universe of absurd pamphlet.  
  
And meetings of blood-stained heart I saw how kiss are awakened  
by the angellic kiss.  
I want you to seek on my lip.
