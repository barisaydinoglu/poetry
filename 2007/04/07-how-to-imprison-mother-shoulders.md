How To Imprison Mother Shoulders
--------------------------------
The mirror knows this,  
that life in it's silicon boxes is as endless as the autumn.  
A ironous honeysuckle day  
and you chirp like a productivity and the dung imposes nessecity.  
The current plan that has everyone bitterest.  
When the land is full of hairy ears  
with coals and atrocious phosphorus quilts  
and the arrogant stars and the sea shells  
at last give forth their chaotic shortcut.  
Only sterile and to a  
lady they take on time, twenty-seven years  
towards those pencils of yours that wait for me.  
The perfume protecting from my eye.
