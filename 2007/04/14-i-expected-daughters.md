I Expected Daughters
--------------------
It was the midnight of the crab.  
Sun rise.  
It was the fortnight of the ostrich.  
In the blood-stained land of negligent starry sky.  
Everything distorted with indespensable voices, the salt of the railroad track  
and piles of loving bread inside night. As if to penetrate or carry or deform.  
Wayside weather, acidulous lights like the ritual.
