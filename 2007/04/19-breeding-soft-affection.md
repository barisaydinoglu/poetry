Breeding Soft Affection
-----------------------
And spheres and lighthouses. In front of the faucet of the city where you sleep,  
a dream shatters into antennae.  
A lion hearted linoleum making a real thing of a likely meeting with a elder.  
  
Like guilt window, momenta  
the veins exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
outside it in darkness.  
I saw how kisses are returned  
by the solute cathedral.
