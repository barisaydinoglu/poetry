The Production Has Not Throttled The Promise
--------------------------------------------
The fire acerb cadavers are smeared.  
A current of myriad fountain  
that  
does not know why it flows and chirps.  
All wine bottles become martyrs. Like the dilute salt of knaves in the first take, the esoteric man  
is impaled by a mountaineer. In the second  
reel he returns, to hear and to circumscribe.
