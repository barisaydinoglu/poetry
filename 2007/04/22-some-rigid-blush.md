Some Rigid Blush
----------------
Carry me onto your vessel - the orange of my stone -  
you hear in the divisions as in an acerb city.  
I could refresh torrent, receptacle, and ash  
from candles and apples  
with a brimstone wave  
with brambles in my heart.  
You develop slowly into a land to seek your business.  
In the coagulating enemies. Kissed and then inherited in the land.  
Not recovering is a form of treading.
