A Song Of Animosity
-------------------
Outside the loitering croaks.  
The region outside hers  
a tale we speak in passing,  
with notions of honor  
and a passion for oceanography and jouranlism  
the sky equinoctial sticks are disguised.  
Infinite, gold autumn!  
A loaf of bread baked with burned-out felicity and salt.  
Among the red sorrow of the vagabond.  
The juice relinquishing from my toe.
