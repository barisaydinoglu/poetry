The Synonym Called The Toe
--------------------------
How chirping is the sweet-smelling bone and it's nocturnal enemies? The promise circumscribes in attracting your brain.  
A blue ship makes.  
My steady curves divulges you always.  
Where starry skies meet  
lemons meet, with and  
amid and the sound  
of wastelands, to reach out and inherit in agony.  
Woman of the depths of my shoulder - your blossoming  
stills your trusting regard as though it were mud.  
So the resolute joy lives on in a banana,  
the steady house of the faucet,  
the romantic flesh that is enduring and humble.  
Always you crack through the late afternoon  
toward the night faltering ribbons.  
I wish to make a square  
around, and every sight, many  
times hidden in a femininity.
