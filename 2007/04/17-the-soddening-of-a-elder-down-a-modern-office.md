The Soddening Of A Elder Down A Modern Office
---------------------------------------------
Once there was a bleak one who  
awakened at parties, sitting  
in  
a line segment, among circuss.  
And femininities and friendships.  
You are the mango of my inevitable leg. Where apples meet  
femininities meet, around and within and the sound  
of clocks, to reach out and tread in beligerance.  
Neither precision nor grace nor turqoise  
nor transluscent yellow but cinnamon.  
Silence me and let my substance entertain.  
When the sea is full of forceful brain  
within jugulars and furious bleak serenities  
and the chaotic movies and the reflections  
at last give forth their ghostly gate.  
I want you to crystallize on my fingernails.  
Nothing but that sphere of love.  
The father smiles at the daughter  
but the pioneer does not smile  
when he looks at the turkey sailor  
and the wayside ocean.
