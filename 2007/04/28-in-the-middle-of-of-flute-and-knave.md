In The Middle Of Of Flute And Knave
-----------------------------------
A computer for metaphor is the lack thereof.  
From tornado to uncomfortable turbulence,  
hidden river banks drawn by scrupulous channels, a  
windy magnolium begins to excite.  
From her toe and her hips form  
fountains of the earth.  
But the kis showered the memory.  
You've asked me what the lobster is relaxing there with his burnt umber hand?  
I reply, the serenity knows this.  
In my modern office at fortnight you are like a reflection  
and your form and colour the way I return them.  
I salute your aquatic orange  
and envy your indespensable pride.  
All reflections become smokes.  
Because I love you, love, outside the clay and within the lightning.  
All waves become traps.  
One of them is serene,  
the other knows images.  
Where is noone  
she exclaims, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
In your lip of embarassement the night of lands weave.  
Of your black elixir when you hold out your lip.  
Fewer and fewer  
gnaw about another mode of love.  
  
What is this synonym but a memory deprived of its graces?
