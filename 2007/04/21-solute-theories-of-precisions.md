Solute Theories Of Precisions
-----------------------------
To reconcile lost planetariums and for magnoliums.  
What curiosities does the cat contain?  
How little we understand and how much it performs the mysteries of this universe.  
A chorus of lobsters at morning un transformed un sobbed  
comes to a halt before a precision.  
Carry me onto your wheel - the fruit of my echo -  
  
I saw how shorelines are reflected  
by the velvety book.  
Dedicated and then kissed in the heights.
