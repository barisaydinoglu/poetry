Sequence With The City
----------------------
Like puberties dismantling in warmths.  
Sometimes a piece of the sky  
cracks like a foliage in my shoulder.  
And reflections and aspens.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
The lion hearted laminated signs soddened a decadent love day  
in your nose of confusion the moonlight evening of foliages rejoice.
