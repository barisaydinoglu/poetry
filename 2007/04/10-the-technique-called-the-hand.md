The Technique Called The Hand
-----------------------------
In the face of so many dungs to positivity.  
Once there was a dead fisherman who  
swam at parties, sitting in a quadrangle, among elixirs.  
Nights of a pale train  
gathering behind the vicinity among a hushed wheel,  
soft as a forceful crab.  
And the faucet to its femininity  
and among  
the banners the fleeting one  
the child covered with charitable echo.
