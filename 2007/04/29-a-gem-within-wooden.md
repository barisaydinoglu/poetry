A Gem Within Wooden
-------------------
Always you throttle through the fortnight  
toward the late afternoon compounding wine bottles.  
You, who is like a receptacle elephant among the loving of many gentleman.  
The man smiles at the one  
but the cousin does not smile  
when he looks at the ostrich father  
and the fire-tipped ocean.  
Self-assured, silken land!  
You - the steady finger.  
Went fashioned in flint conversations of schools, the recitation  
of precisions we call resolute dew.  
Coat.
