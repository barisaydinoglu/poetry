How To Force Goddess Brows
--------------------------
In the face of so many extinctions to animosity.  
Travelling a serendipity  
lighted in the promising rain.  
She is in us at this moment of first refreshing.  
Felicity is gone, the subject has woke.  
A dew focuses its dream of a beginning, its beginning, the new ending of the cinnamon lake order -  
its iridescent wounds.  
Pockets of brick converted into glass.  
A eloquent thunder of flints.  
Dawning toward the ship to seek another land the rotten stump imposes nessecity.  
To discover lost echoes and for momenta.  
  
Discover on the clocks that wait for you  
coagulating the insatiable chairs, overflowing the doors.  
To dawn lost sweetness and for forms.
