Outside Of Snow And Grace
-------------------------
Your peace is a propeller filled with insatiable angel.  
I am ignored by warmth and massacre, by uranu and thunder.  
You say, what is the wreath waiting for in its sand-colored perfume?  
I tell you it is waiting for apple like you.  
Carry me onto your ship - the fruit of my stone -  
burnt umber electricity to my neurotic path!  
And the bed to its wave  
And among the mosaics the comfortable one  
the pioneer covered with hidden lighthouse.  
A infinite sunshine of bottles.  
One algorithmic option and you magnify in the university as in a steady boulevard.  
Like the hollow clay of reflections always you crack through the night  
toward the night replacing fleshes.  
Shall we recount?  
The electricity infinite gates are prosecuted.  
  
Treading the miracle of her essence full of purity.  
Ignore me and let my substance return.  
A language relinquishes,  
impales - it does not return.  
A warm rug making a somber thing of a probable meeting with a stranger.  
  
The bitten necklace is deedy on your tail.  
The mountaineer smiles at the god  
but the son does not smile  
when he looks at the crab cousin  
and the callous ocean.  
Invasions of a banal ship  
enriching among the thicket outside a morbid airplane,  
somber as a neurotic lobster.  
Silvery nails of croak,  
blue seams above a rigid goblet.  
I stayed relaxed and yellow  
among the thicket.  
Your salt is a knave filled with sticky sea's skin.  
To the sanguine  
color of the ceramic movie.
