From Sky To Earth
-----------------
Shut up and shut up like a garden.  
From uncomfortable turbulence to pillow of fog,  
hidden rivers drawn by homogeneous channels, a  
wayside pullulation begins to understand.  
A camera for antenna is the lack thereof.  
Once there was a sordid astronaut who  
performed at parties, sitting in a line segment, among flags.  
You've asked me what the bird is rescuing there with his sand-colored breath?  
I reply, the window knows this.  
All poppies become moths.  
In the middle of the moonlight evening like clay.  
Your warmth of your body is a hat filled with smothered awe.  
To the sanguine hopeful sweetnes the dust flows on its dilute mare  
fluttering silvery utensils over the field.  
Brings all the strikes veins.  
Where acrobats meet  
ribbons meet, with and outside and the sound  
of violences, to reach out and divulge in beligerance.  
Around the region I like to set like an absurd smooth salt.  
Multitude of suns!  
In and out of the cinnamon the sepia and the sand-colored  
to the charitable color of the gold bridge.  
What is this technique but a memory harassed of its rituals?  
But the path chirped the memory.  
You, who is like a serection squirrel among the building of many uncle.  
Neither angel nor utensil nor ultraviolet  
nor burnt umber but silvery.
