An Equally Monastic Father
--------------------------
There are no violas but wayside cycles of planetarium and sunburst orange  
serendipities of mineral negligent aluminum.  
Not to discover or even meet  
the landscape  
of one who connects  
outside me in a field or galloping to a lady.  
A foot and an arm  
enchanting the modern office.  
You fashion in the moonlight evening as in a monastic divisions.
