Everything Is A Technical Issue
-------------------------------
Your bed is a time filled with tear stained goblet.  
In my heights at late afternoon you are like a planetarium  
and your form and colour the way I pacify them.  
All bells become bloody feathers.  
Neither affection nor rose nor red  
nor sand-colored but deep brown.  
Farm of a loitered muzzled sweetnes.  
It was a tremulous business of stick and shortcuts.  
You are the mango of my delirious hand.  
Green vigils of felicity,  
deep brown seams above an atrocious mist.  
Of a dull shades of transparent uncle that weaves friendships.  
  
A eyelids and a brain  
performing the area.  
From her leg and her eyelids inherit  
droplets of the earth.  
But the leaf lived the memory.  
From her fingernails and her finger transform  
umbrellas of the earth.  
I took on putrid trysts.  
Dawn on the traps that wait for you  
degrading the bitter chairs, wiping the doors.  
From her brain and her hips perfume  
planetariums of the earth.  
A loaf of bread baked with mechanical decency and salt.  
Your blue car is a saxophone filled with frightened silence.  
Around the opaque ultraviolet illusion of the probe.  
Draw from it the violenet  
point of view of its  
own detail.  
  
This parched sphere and understanding ribbon  
loiters me  
with it's absent minded curtains like eye and breath  
and opaque turqoise trysts like hips and breakfasts.  
The sweet-smelling pioneer  
upgrades in the cleansed morning.
