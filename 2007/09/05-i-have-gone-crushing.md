I Have Gone Crushing
--------------------
Our new springtime, our real film circles.  
They are all strangers  
professional wombs in whose silent friendships originate.  
Sometimes a piece of the lightning  
hates like a pencil in my hips.  
And amid my hammock, during the fortnight, I woke up naked  
and full of happiness.  
The hushed movie that flows in your light.  
Towards those pullulations of yours that wait for me.  
Return to the homeland of the landscapes.
