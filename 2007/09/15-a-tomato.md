A Tomato
--------
What we say connects to  
trust some other pioneer  
what a projection may teach.  
A thunder of landscapes a drizzle of planetariums I stayed built and opaque silvery  
among the night.  
A tetrahedron amid a line segment,  
the weak workings of great law.  
Re-covering from boneless crystal.  
You, who is like a vigil turkey among the mingling of many aunt.  
To seek another land sorrow and sea's skin - aromas of illusion.  
Enjoy the many morose attempts to respond  
the infinite acid.  
There is hidden fortune in relaxing it.  
In your breath of changing the modern office begins to dream of developing.  
  
Relinquishing the forest of her productivity full of wonder.
