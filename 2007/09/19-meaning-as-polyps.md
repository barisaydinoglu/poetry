Meaning As Polyps
-----------------
Boney sunset and the blood-stained jar  
tremble at the walls  
of my house.  
Which is a unguessed juice of directions  
twenty-seven or twenty-seven, crystallized  
on a door or in the absorbant fountain  
directions of the nose, a calculation in your feet.  
What celestial goblets -  
the moonlight evening is filled with it,  
Autumns for the sea shell and the molested gem.  
Only farm, just the  
pullulation, nothing but  
it. Home.  
Only leaf, just the  
bell, nothing but  
it. Dew.
