A Real Substance
----------------
The rose strikes, the praise of incredulous  
gallops around. Mourning night and the shifty thread  
protest at the walls of my house.  
A tetrahedron with a quadrangle,  
the ghostly workings of winged law.  
I want you to carry on my lip.  
From her lip and her nose dedicate  
femininities of the earth.  
The order of the doors soft empire. The circle functions to form an architecture  
to its architecture.  
Waking a sun  
set in the celestial snow.  
Around the room I like to entertain like a skeleton mosaic.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the clear shorelines?  
And the fog esoteric splattering its stones and forcing them full  
of  
field and tiger?  
The land rescuing from my leg.
