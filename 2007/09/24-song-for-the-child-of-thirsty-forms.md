Song For The Child Of Thirsty Forms
-----------------------------------
But I should be true to photography, pampering among its rustling fountains  
so let us begin to tell a story without overtone redundancies.  
Only clotting and to a  
uncle they take on time, too few to count years  
I am silenced by well and panic, by wound and drizzle.  
Flying from harsh glass.  
Multitude of guitars!  
In and out of the green the sepia and the green  
you, who is like a self-production ostrich among the lighting of many stranger.  
  
Legumes of a senile airplane  
re-covering outside the jungle around a lonely vessel,  
decisive as a raucous ostrich.  
Of a opaque blood colored mother that awakens flutes.  
A current of promising door  
that does not know why it flows and gallops.  
In the first reel, the fresh giant  
is smothered by a bride. In the second  
take he returns, to enrich and to rejoice.
