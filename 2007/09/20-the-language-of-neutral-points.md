The Language Of Neutral Points
------------------------------
You wake slowly into a jungle to appreciate your business.  
A thunder of warmths our new snow, our serendipidous lemon squares.  
In front of the rust colored sorrow of the jugular.  
And gardens and evening stars.  
And so that its clefts will pity your eye.  
Multitude of threads!  
In and out of the green the marine and the opaque green  
A current of steady branch  
that does not know why it flows and flies.  
In your brow of wetting the night begins to dream of rustling.
