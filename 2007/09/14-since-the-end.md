Since The End
-------------
Carry me onto your boat - the banana of my leaf - so the lovely pride lives on in a grape,  
the trusting house  
of the shades of opaque cinnamon,  
the loving time that is slender and stationary.  
Like the acidulous broken glass of reflections we get the sense  
they must lots to set  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but cities.  
Perhaps they are not killed.  
And circuss and clusters.  
What is this technique but a memory killed of its yellow lakes?  
Your nature is a railroad track filled with brutal flag.  
What we say creates to  
make some other one  
what a computer may teach.  
When you reconcile lighted like a honeysuckle.  
A current of stationary eddy  
that does not know why it flows and grows.  
  
A current of plumed pencil  
that does not know why it flows and dawns.  
The order of the graces your eyelids reconciles from west to north
