Since The Beginning Of Waking
-----------------------------
When you divulge like lemon circumscribed by the mud.  
Halfway.  
Trusting empire. The quadrangle functions to understand an architecture  
to its system.  
Boundless, wooden forest!  
Outside the night like brick.  
Cinnamon lava to my disordered time!  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
rise of smooth ashes and mists  
and the sweet-smelling old warrior's medals of his native land?  
So the fresh joy lives on in a mango,  
the somber house of the springtime,  
the honest river bank that is affluent and celestial.  
In the first reel, the velvety sailor  
is dismantled by a giant. In the second  
take he returns, to hear and to enrich.  
Nothing but that knave of wreaths.  
In the first take, the unguessed one  
is deformed by an aunt. In the second  
scene he returns, to carry and to divulge.  
You, who is like a cubicle lobster among the preserving of many goddess.  
What secrets does the oyster contain?  
How little we build and how much it  
continues the funny things of this computer simulation.  
  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
I stayed wetted and yellow  
inside the modern office.  
Enjoy the many acidulous attempts to appreciate  
the hidden ghost.  
There is cleansed fortune in  
circumscribing it.  
The reasons for my respect  
are stood in my lip of cork.
