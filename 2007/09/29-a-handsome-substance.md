A Handsome Substance
--------------------
A boat is not enough to congeal me and keep me  
from the heights of your delicate curiosities. As soon as the incoming hearts  
gives the grammatic indication.  
Return to the homeland of the awes.  
And you rejoice like a railroad track and the aunt smiles at the mountaineer  
but the woman does not smile  
when he looks at the cat daughter  
and the bleak ocean.  
A bicycle is not enough to shatter me and keep me  
from the thicket of your handsome phenomena.  
Pockets of rusted nail converted into copper.
