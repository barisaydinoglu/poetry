Feeling As Polyps
-----------------
I stayed built and opaque burnt umber  
in the middle of the heights.  
It's a conducting pullulation of explications.  
What epiphany does the ostrich contain?  
How little we develop and how much it expands the phenomena of this universe.  
The order of the hats I want you to blush on my brain.  
The musical warmths of your body filtered only hated and to a  
pioneer they take on time, million years  
because I love you, love, in the wind and within the jungle.  
When the vicinity is full of frightened mouth  
with cubicles and disordered skeleton grapes  
and the decadent old warrior's medals and the rivers  
at last give forth their ghostly stain.  
Sand-colored ice to my inevitable foam!  
A raucous flint day  
you shower in the jungle as in a sensual thicket.  
This insufferable pasture and relinquishing mosaic shatters me  
with it's irreducable suns like mouth and finger  
and opaque dark productivities like foot and gardens.  
An odor has kissed in the middle of the honeysuckle,  
a mixture of coffin and body, a playing  
reflection that brings agony.
