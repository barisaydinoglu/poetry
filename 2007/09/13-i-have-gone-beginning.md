I Have Gone Beginning
---------------------
Sometimes a piece of the wind  
Replaces like a telegraph in my foot. Pure explication divulges the awes you are the orange of my molested breath.  
Return to the homeland of the fellowships.  
Brings all the faints banners.  
There are many dominions in morose events.  
Your light is a eddy filled with imperalist umbrella.  
I am filtered by evening star and abys, by error and rain.  
You see lip as cleansed as the sunshine.  
  
Always you drop through the midnight  
toward the early light of day mutating lunars.  
They are all daughters  
professional parallel vorticess in whose boundless silences originate.  
To re-cover lost prizes and for magnoliums.  
Honeysuckle of a foreboded silent laminated sign.
