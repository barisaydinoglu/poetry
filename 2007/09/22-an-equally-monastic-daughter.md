An Equally Monastic Daughter
----------------------------
From tornado to uncomfortable turbulence,  
hidden paths drawn by starry channels, a  
brutal knave begins to rise.  
Draw from it the misunderstood  
sequence of its own production.  
Shall we keep going?  
There are many wounds next to furious events.  
Steady empire. The square functions to refresh a system  
to its environment.  
What bristles the props of love?  
The stranger smiles at the uncle  
but the cousin does not smile  
when he looks at the squirrel stranger  
and the mourning ocean.  
I stayed enchanted and cinnamon  
behind the sea.  
  
Within blue water and silvery natures.  
Silvery and nocturnal mother,  
Pockets of aluminum converted into fused quartz.  
It was a lewd business  
of cadaver and sticks.  
One of them is enchanting,  
the other knows antennae.  
Where is nobody  
he cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
A hated sea water day  
a reflection -like pigeon hole  
not to travel or even meet  
the planetarium of one who carries  
outside me in a night or enriching to a elder.  
In the smallest chalk ritual sepia earth to my barbaous serenity!  
The bleak umbrella that stores in your energy.  
Has the sea been created with phenomena?
