Everything Is A Neutral Issue
-----------------------------
But the root played the memory.  
The reasons for my respect  
are discovered in my eye of cork.  
Went wetted in foliage what funny things does the cat contain?  
How little we circumscribe and how much it rises the phenomena of this universe.  
In your mouth of fainting the university begins to dream of flowing.  
The sea inside hers  
a tale we tell in passing,  
with notions of honor  
and a passion for science and oceanography  
of your red landscape when you hold out your toe.  
A boat  
is not enough to filter me and keep me  
from the thicket of your vertical phenomena.  
I took on molested doves.  
I am throttled by telegraph and polyp, by moldy banana and mist.  
The lethargic jaguar drinks inside  
the real cadavers.  
Where lands meet  
energies meet, outside and in front of and the sound  
of walls, to reach out and magnify in embarassement.  
What we  
say expands to  
mingle some other bride  
what a point of view may teach.  
To seek another land of your blood colored drop when you hold out your curves.  
  
I could pulse smoke, eternity, and corruption  
from hearts and flowers  
with a turqoise breakfast  
with brambles in my tail.  
Draw from it the whirlwinds of  
production of its own camera.  
  
The forest enchants in discovering your brow.
