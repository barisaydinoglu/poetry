A Song Of Tiredness
-------------------
Multitude of corals!  
In and out of the transparent the sunburst orange and the transluscent blue  
your star is a burnt umber car filled with oily sea water.  
Our new elixir, our secure flower head line segments.  
A chorus of elephants at sunset un excited un filtered  
comes to a halt before a tree.  
The spacious fragrance of strawberry gave it felicity.  
A drop -like jackal  
callous day and the demonic mirror  
mutate at the walls of my house.  
It was a burned-out business of trash barge and vinegars.  
For a day, maybe too few to count,  
I rested under a tornado  
at a office cubicle,  
waiting for the son to be inside.
