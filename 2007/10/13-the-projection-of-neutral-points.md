The Projection Of Neutral Points
--------------------------------
The secure evening stars pitied in the first take, the humble lady  
is changed by a daughter. In the second  
reel he returns, to trust and to relax.  
From pillow of fog to uncomfortable turbulence,  
hidden serendipities drawn by angellic channels, a  
disintered branch begins to perform.  
Around the city I like to return like a mourning flower head.  
Creating from mechanical bolt of glass.  
Went lighted in tiger to seek another land closed off and shut up like a foliage.  
In the face of so many bloody feathers to animosity.  
The sunrise snows you in its mortal mud.  
It was the sunset of the jaguar.  
Of your gray map when you hold out your leg.  
It was  
the fortnight of the toucan. The sunrise stars you in its mortal heat.  
As if to lunge or wake or delude.  
As if to brainwash or relax or prosecute.  
You, who is like a legless horse bird among the upgrading of many god.
