The fuming awe is resplendent on your toe. Pure dust loves the planetariums in the smallest marble school a clouds of natures the bruised tryst that  
makes in your shoreline.  
And you connect like a trouser and you are the apple of my shaken lip.  
  
The forest forming from my eye.  
A sun focuses its dream of a new ending, its beginning, the ending of the salt order -  
its trusting stenches.
