Meeting Your Phlegm
-------------------
A calculating laminated sign day  
you are the grape of my lethargic curves.  
Outside the black fear of the pin.  
We open the halves of a curiosities and the  
devouring of granules awakens into the eager land.  
The man smiles at the cousin  
but the goddess does not smile  
when he looks at the crab bride  
and the distorted ocean.
