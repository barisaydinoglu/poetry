A Original Substance
--------------------
Not treading is a form of beginning. When you continue like circus lighted by the electricity.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
  
Chirp on the belts that wait for you  
petrifying the bleak chairs, lunging the doors.  
Fisherman of the depths of my leg - your reconciling  
stills your changeless regard as though it were fire.  
I saw how kiss are rose  
by the real form.  
A fingernails and a toe  
travelling the modern office.  
Invade me and let my substance awaken.  
Barbaous mountaineers and gods.  
For me they are grammatic.  
Brings all the rejects doves.  
Violences of a muzzled bicycle  
forming in front of the university around a hollow bicycle,  
poetic as a furious toucan.  
Once there was a skeleton bride who  
woke at parties, sitting in a loop, among kisses.  
Pockets of metal converted into ivory.  
  
One of them is iridescent,  
the other knows studies.  
Where is somebody  
he cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
In the first scene, the parsimonious gentleman  
is wiped by a gentleman. In the second  
reel he returns, to inherit and to light.  
  
Sepia jungle to my rustling flower!  
And inside my hammock, during the morning, I woke up naked  
and full of tiredness.
