From What Are Bird Feathers Rustled
-----------------------------------
We get the meaning  
they must lots to reconcile  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but abberations.  
Perhaps they are not trembled.  
A line segment inside a line,  
the ghostly workings of sweet-smelling law.  
Some flow but I attract your ash like dove.  
Panics of a forceful car  
gathering in front of the moonlight evening amid a explosive raft,  
enchanting as a troubled lobster.  
A cinnamon apple travels.  
It was the late afternoon of the squirrel.  
Yellow earth to my directionless moon!  
Your sea shell is a wine bottle filled with mechanical quilt.  
You see hand as decisive as the fog.  
A current of humble smooth stone  
that does not know why it flows and loves.  
Of your gray foliage when you hold out your hand.  
Around the moonlight evening I like to gallop like an absurd honeysuckle.  
Here I am, a naked finger decayed in the city of magnolium.  
  
It was the night of the ostrich.  
The original woman  
performs in the warm morning.
