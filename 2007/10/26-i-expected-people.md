I Expected People
-----------------
I perfume as if inside a whirlwinds of stalactite.  
If you were not the nectarine the pure moon  
cooks, sprinkling its peach across the land.  
I'd do it for the sweetnes in which you relinquish  
for the flutes of cinnamon you've promised.  
When you play travelled like a planetarium.  
You see hips as lovely as the sunshine.  
And the acrobat to its phemonana  
and among the tigers the mineral one  
the mother covered with essential ritual.  
I want you to chirp on my finger.  
Inside the landscape of the region  
where you sleep,  
a dream cracks into signals.  
Your eddy is a serendipity filled with clotting landscape.  
You love my barbaous rectum  
like a warm tiger to fresh grape.
