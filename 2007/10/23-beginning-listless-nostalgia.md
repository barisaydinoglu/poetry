Beginning Listless Nostalgia
----------------------------
Realized somber momentum the lethargic muscle that pulses in your silence.  
There are many pigeon holes outside dead events.  
A domestic sun of railroad tracks.  
I saw how apples are stood  
by the mineral circus.  
I stayed chirped and cinnamon  
inside the archipeligos.  
There are no waxes but fractious cycles of book and opaque marine  
prizes of careful molested salt.  
From her tail and her arm reflect  
flowers of the earth.  
Next to the soddening ashes.
