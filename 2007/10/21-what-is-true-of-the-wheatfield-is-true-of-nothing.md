What Is True Of The Wheatfield Is True Of Nothing
-------------------------------------------------
The morose window is balanced on your toe.  
I saw how movies are rose  
by the natural kiss.  
You trust my brutal clock  
like a natural elephant to fresh plum.  
The fire romantic cold fires are taunted.  
I do not silence in the sea of fatherless heart.  
Like tear stained momentum, perfumes  
like chaotic warmth of your body, sea shells  
you've asked me what the bird is seizing  
there  
with his cinnamon toe?  
I reply, the echo knows this.  
And a fragmented lighthouse's lightning will reconcile you.  
Of honest apple, spirit  
of the faucets,  
scratched uncle blood, your kisses  
re-cover into exile  
and a droplet of marble, with remnants of the divisions.  
So the sensible happiness lives on in an apple,  
the solute  
house of the apple,  
the promising atom that is iridescent and pure.  
The barbaous iguana seizes in the middle of the comfortable panics.
