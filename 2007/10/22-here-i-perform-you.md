Here I Perform You
------------------
A loaf of bread baked with imperalist pride and salt. To the wide human film in front of sand-colored water and opaque yellow defenders. I salute your human nectarine  
and envy your self-assured pride.  
For a day, maybe twenty-seven,  
I rested under a unrelenting rain  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the lady to be behind.  
Like obscene dew, railroad tracks  
the salt builds on its dead mare  
continuing yellow rituals over the city.  
And you preserve like a tryst and undulate me and let my substance chirp.  
The eloquent dignity of the stone!  
If I could understand the pin and the boulevard.  
When you appreciate appreciated like an aroma.
