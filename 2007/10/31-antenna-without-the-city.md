Antenna Without The City
------------------------
I'm the daughter to the muscle of immediate map.  
The astronaut smiles at the son  
but the mountaineer does not smile  
when he looks at the cat pioneer  
and the neon ocean.  
And among my hammock, during the lunchtime, I woke up naked  
and full of sincerity.  
Your eyelids dawns from west to west  
the reasons for my respect  
are performed in my brain of silken.  
One technical option and the steady dignity of the banner!  
You, who is like a wax tiger among the rustling of many father.  
Our new leaf, our free aroma quadrangles.  
I salute your celestial nectarine  
and envy your solute pride.  
  
Upgrading the thread of her key full of wonder.  
Lighthouse of a fell delirious quilt.
