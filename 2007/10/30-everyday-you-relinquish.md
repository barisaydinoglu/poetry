Everyday You Relinquish
-----------------------
Went showered in foliage disintered holiday and the frightened ritual  
strike at the walls of my house.  
Pure dung continues the stars next to the blood colored embarassement of the stick.  
Indicates the pasture's dawning breath.  
The croak imposes nessecity.  
You swim  
slowly into a jungle to relax your business.  
From her ears and her eyeballs build  
landscapes of the earth.  
It is a tale of inevitable legumes closed off and closed off like a friendship.  
Giant of the depths of my ears - your showering  
stills your rosy regard  
as though it were clay.  
And you shook in the anger and dawned a smearing howl.  
  
Panic and bridge - times of beligerance.  
To the somber color of the fused quartz  
sea water.
