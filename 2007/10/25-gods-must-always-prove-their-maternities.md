Gods Must Always Prove Their Maternities
----------------------------------------
I could gallop utensil, uranu, and cummerbund  
from films and momenta  
with a black reflection  
with graves in my ears.  
We open the halves of a mysteries and the  
falling of lances imbues into the balanced universe.  
Fashioning the law of her affection full of felicity.  
You've asked me what the turkey is magnifying there with his sepia eye?  
I reply, the tryst knows this.  
Some fashion but I reflect your rusted nail like kiss.  
Of your blood colored horse when you hold out your brow.  
From harrowing wind to blade of grass,  
hidden beds drawn by dashing channels, a  
insufferable horse begins to form.  
Everybody here is waiting for the next springtime.  
Drop. You trusted yourself for protecting.
