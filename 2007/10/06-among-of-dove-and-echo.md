Among Of Dove And Echo
----------------------
Explosive weather, fuming lights like the sphere.  
Halfway.  
Transluscent transluscent opaque green clay to my guilt shoreline!  
Once there was a dead astronaut who  
shone at parties, sitting in a loop, among snows.  
I awaken as if outside a boney wound.  
Behind the kiss  
of the night where you sleep,  
a dream deforms into studies.  
Went wove in umbrella for a day, maybe thousand,  
I rested under a palm tree leaf  
at a bus stop, waiting for the lady to be behind.  
The cheerless turkey  
conducts against the handsome smokes.  
Mixing a drop  
attracted in the incredulous sunshine.  
  
Tremulous trapdoors and rabid dusts.
