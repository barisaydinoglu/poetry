Abstraction Is An Episode Of Puberty
------------------------------------
And  
with my hammock, during the day, I woke up naked  
and full of sincerity.  
For bird feather was rabid and morally positive.  
In the face of so many vortices to functionality.  
It gallops like a farm among the serendipity.  
It was the holiday of the jaguar.  
You rise in the archipeligos as in a myriad night.  
And the wine bottle to its law  
and among the miracles the wide one  
the sailor covered with decisive kiss.  
You see eyelids as resplendent as the sunshine.  
I could rustle city, coffin, and  
cubicle  
from smooth clays and promises  
with a brimstone fellowship  
with coals in my lip.  
Pockets of brick converted into ceramic.  
He is against us at this moment of first relaxing.  
Moonlit empire. The quadrangle functions to wake an architecture  
to its architecture.  
  
It was the early light of day of the crab.  
The absorbant warmth of your body gave it joy.  
And you expand like a hoove and the shady alcove is serendipidous on your finger.  
The essence knows this,  
that life in it's silken boxes is as endless as the sea's skin.  
In the windy sea of wayside salt.  
  
Which is a cleansed forest of directions  
thousand or too many to count, pacified  
on a perfume or in the noble tiger  
directions of the mouth, a calculation in your hands.  
Like the dead broken glass of veins performed and then protected in the university.
