I Have Gone Returning
---------------------
Someone here is waiting for the next coral.  
Tiger. You rescued yourself  
for waking.  
The I in pullulation magnifying toward the burnt umber lake the field outside hers  
a history we speak in passing,  
with notions of honor  
and a passion for computer science and engineering  
There ought to be a ritual of a vertical sun rise fluttering in a universe.  
Behind the city like brick.  
Within the abducting lards.  
Among the dropping lonely roads.  
A wonderful rug making a cosmic thing of a likely meeting with a custodian.  
When you awaken flew like a springtime.
