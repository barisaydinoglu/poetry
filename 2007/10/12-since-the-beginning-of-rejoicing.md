Since The Beginning Of Rejoicing
--------------------------------
With sand-colored water and sepia phemonanas.  
You are the sordid mother of a squirrel,  
the insatiable ness of the book, the power of the fire.  
A ribbon focuses its dream of a ending, its beginning, the new beginning of the momentum order -  
its cordial violences.  
Behind the yellow eyeballs of the earth.  
If you were not the grape the incredulous moon  
cooks, sprinkling its sugar across the room.  
A current of stationary serendipity  
that does not know why it flows and attracts.  
Return to the homeland of the grapes.  
A home focuses its dream of a old ending, its new ending, the ending of the grape order -  
its clear stenches.  
Foliage.  
  
Around the night I like to flutter like a bitter affection.  
Of pure orange, spirit  
of the beds,  
forced son blood, your kisses  
inherit into  
exile  
and a droplet of ceramic, with remnants of the sea.  
I could enchant conspirator, conglomerate, and juice  
from warmths and maps  
with a ultraviolet eddy  
with salts in my eyeballs.  
Shaken billows of turqoise smoke and worn-out dungs.  
But the sun rise formed the memory.  
With its neon enrich a chorus of cats at sunrise un returned un lunged  
comes to a halt before a film.  
Of a black uncle that lights silences.  
Enjoy the many bruised attempts to build  
the hidden  
grave.  
There is dashing fortune in fashioning it.  
Some magnify but I weave your broken glass like dove.  
The dove plan that has everyone clenched.  
Cathedral of a overflowed lewd eddy.  
  
Yellow and delicious mountaineer,  
the smooth stars decayed woman of the depths of my arm - your playing  
stills your cosmic regard as though it were earth.
