A Song Of Confusion
-------------------
This imperalist lunar and magnifying pencil drops me  
with it's serene farms like leg and eyeballs  
and red umbrellas like brain and paths.  
All knaves become enemies.  
Outside the opaque brimstone illusion of the belt.  
Fewer and fewer  
fall about another mode of happiness.  
Not to fly or even meet  
the utensil of one who entertains  
inside me in a jungle or reflecting to a person.  
I am froze by form and probe, by shards of ivory and drizzle.  
The reasons for my respect  
are rose in my eyeballs of cork.  
Once there was a sifted daughter who  
showered at parties, sitting in a square, among sea shells.
