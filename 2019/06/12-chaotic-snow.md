Chaotic Snow
------------
The area next to hers  
a history we divulge in passing,  
with notions of love  
and a passion for engineering and jouranlism  
went recovered in  
bridge degrade me and let my substance live.  
So the comfortable purity lives on in a cherry,  
the homogeneous house of the femininity,  
the thick smooth broken glass that is homogeneous and hopeful.  
You - the hopeful shoulder.  
The dust imposes nessecity.
