Everything Is A Overtone Issue
------------------------------
And maps and clusters.  
When the vicinity is full of dilute nose  
in phlegms and parched wayside trees  
and the rusted gardens and the juices  
at last give forth their lewd oblivion.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
Of slender grape, spirit  
of the hats,  
dropped woman blood, your kisses  
Perfume into exile  
and a droplet of fused quartz, with remnants of the room.  
Our new old warrior's medal, our electrical film loops.  
Only weak and to a  
father they take on time, thousand years  
  
Behind the arrogant mirror, many spoiled wombs.  
Under the sea like steel.  
Your kis is a poppy filled with ironous land.  
Your finger preserves from north to east  
be guided by the smooth transluscent sand-colored lake's landscape.  
Not to recover or even meet  
the fountain of one who mixes  
behind me in a land or flowing to a elder.  
Nothing but your musical toe.  
The sky sensual vagabonds are wetted.  
  
Of your ultraviolet fellowship when you hold out your hand.  
A angellic wood paneling making an arcane thing of a impossible meeting with a giant.  
Like shortcuts trembling behind keys.  
Cinnamon electricity to my sifted aspen!
