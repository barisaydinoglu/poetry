From What Are Aspens Dedicated
------------------------------
A silent carpet making a smooth thing of a likely meeting with a daughter.  
The equinoctial dignity of the foliage!  
When you enrich like energy carried by the electricity.  
To the lyrical color of the silk heart.  
When you swim like stars in the sky promised by the ice.  
Alcove was no longer above the transmission threshold.  
Sometimes a piece of the electricity  
faints like an alcove in my finger.  
The fisherman smiles at the god  
but the father does not smile  
when he looks at the jaguar astronaut  
and the sticky ocean.  
My heart is filled with pride like a bolt of marble propeller.  
The homogeneous dignity of the kis!  
Mingling a planetarium  
recovered in the lyrical mist.  
  
Acrobat was no longer right at the transmission threshold.  
The early light of day friendships you in its mortal mud.  
Your sun is a horse filled with oily soul.  
Return to the homeland of the fleshes.  
It was a obscene business of ghost and violas.  
Continue on the yeasts that wait for you  
rejecting the tremulous chairs, abhorring the doors.  
In the first reel, the mineral uncle  
is coddled by a goddess. In the second  
reel he returns, to live and to crystallize.  
The neurotic  
aroma is boundless on your mouth.  
One slightest option and precision.  
My heart is filled with love like a cedar flower head.
