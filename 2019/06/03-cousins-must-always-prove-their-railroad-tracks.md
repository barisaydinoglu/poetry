Cousins Must Always Prove Their Railroad Tracks
-----------------------------------------------
Against the sea like metal.  
I weave as if with a muzzled ego.  
Behind the trembling eternities.  
In the smallest marble salt salt was no longer below the transmission threshold.  
Sometimes a piece of the fire  
trembles like a flower in my finger.  
Like obscene branch, currents  
the mud monastic clefts are faltered.  
  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
Some divulge but I swim your ash like warmth of your body.  
Closed off and pulled out like a sun rise.  
God of the depths of my shoulder - your connecting  
stills your perfect regard as though it were ice.
