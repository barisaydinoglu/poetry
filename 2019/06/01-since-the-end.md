Since The End
-------------
Carry me onto your airplane - the fruit of my saxophone -  
the I in atom you've asked me what the lobster is seeking there with his opaque blue brow?  
I reply, the echo knows this.  
For stalks of cattail was guilt and morally negative. There ought to be a goblet of a velvety guitar developing in a divisions.  
What serendipidous hooves -  
the area is filled with it,  
momenta for the transluscent cinnamon car and the sordid silk.
