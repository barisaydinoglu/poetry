From What Are Ships Promised
----------------------------
Your light is  
a friendship filled with imperalist flute.  
But I should be untrue to jouranlism, imprisoning among its tremulous kisses  
so let us attempt to tell a story without side redundancies.  
A pale flint day  
and you coddled in the embarassement and grew a brainwashing phlegm.  
Brings all the pampers kisses.  
Only fatherless and to a  
son they take on time, million years  
in my vicinity at morning you are like a nature  
and your form and colour the way I pulse them.  
A synonym for point of view is the lack thereof.
