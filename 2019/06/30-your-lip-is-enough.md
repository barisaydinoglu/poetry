Your Lip Is Enough
------------------
A bicycle is not enough to conquer me and keep me  
from the thicket of your changeless curiosities.  
In blue water and deep brown roses.  
Realized enduring elixir your ears builds from east to west  
I took on mourning doors.  
A boneless signal deceives  
even the cosmic  
minor night in signal  
to which the metaphor  
will not be stored.  
To carry lost planetariums and for momenta.  
  
Which is a irreducable promise of directions  
twenty-seven or thousand, galloped  
on a flower or in the sensible aspen  
directions of the leg, a calculation in your curvess.  
On what spoiled vigils fashioned with wind?  
How swimming is the lyrical stick  
and it's hopeful legumes? Some stand but I seize your clay like kiss.
