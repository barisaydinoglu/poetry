The Camera Called The Ears
--------------------------
The maternity pulses in discovering your heart.  
A detail preserves,  
steals - it does not return.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
Has the vicinity been promised with epiphany?  
The poppy wakes in travelling your brain.  
A loaf of bread baked with motionless felicity and salt.  
Be guided by the monastic branch's coat.  
Pockets of ash converted into silicon.  
Went began in propeller but the cactus sought the memory.  
Relaxed and then grew in the boulevard.  
And so that its coffins will reject your hips.  
But I should be untrue to photography, falling among its bitter sepia lakes  
so let us try to divulge a story without overtone redundancies.
