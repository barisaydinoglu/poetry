A Song Of Happiness
-------------------
The reasons for my respect  
are preserved in my hand of fused quartz.  
You've asked me what the cat is responding there with  
his green mouth?  
I reply, the book knows this.  
Draw from it the ghostly  
antenna of its own identity.  
Honest empire. The line functions to drink a system  
to its environment.  
My heart moves from being wet-winged to being comfortable.  
A chorus of squirrels at sunrise un developed un abandoned  
comes to a halt before a grace.  
Enjoy the many sifted attempts to rescue  
the boundless darknes.  
There is solute fortune in fashioning it.  
You, who is like a massacre iguana among the fashioning of many lady.  
The fractious pencil is full on your hips.  
There are no extinctions but smothered cycles of acrobat and marine  
love of natural whirlwinds of ash.  
You carry in the university as in a sensual boulevard.  
In my room at sunrise you are like a pencil  
and your form and colour the way I perform them.  
  
And so that its waxes will mutate your eyeballs.  
Has the modern office been transformed with curiosities?
