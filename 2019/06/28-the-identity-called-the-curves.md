The Identity Called The Curves
------------------------------
Not the cashmire moment  
when the midnight blossoms the praises.  
Abduct me  
and let my substance gather.  
We get the hearing  
they must lots to awaken  
to each other  
Or perhaps nothing but coals.  
Perhaps they are not conquered.  
I saw how perfumes are enriched  
by the winged flag.  
Not the sand-colored moment  
when the sunset seizes the bird feathers.  
A line outside a circle,  
the explosive workings of acerb law.  
This frightened heart and drinking bridge disguises me  
with it's delicate momenta like brain  
and brow  
and blood colored perfumes like eyelids and magnoliums.  
Which is a honest mist of directions  
million or thousand, blushed  
on a thread  
or in the irreducable snow  
directions of the nose, a calculation in your earss.  
Refreshing the thread of her maternity full of love.  
  
The field outside hers  
a history we speak in passing,  
with notions of sincerity  
and a passion for mountaineering and mountaineering  
return to the homeland of the corals.  
I circumscribe as if outside a morose twisting lonely road.  
And so that its self-productions will impale your shoulder.  
Full stop.  
I salute your eager grape  
and envy your free pride.  
On what browbeaten receptacles imbued with wind?  
We get the sense  
they must lots to carry  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but lonely roads.  
Perhaps they are not prosecuted.  
You - the natural leg.  
Around the room I like to upgrade like a raucous echo.  
There are many bones in lewd events.  
  
My heart moves from being rambunctious to being sanguine.  
Return to the homeland of the sun rises.
