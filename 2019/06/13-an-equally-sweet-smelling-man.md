An Equally Sweet-smelling Man
-----------------------------
The order of the corals you are the mango of my fuming brain.  
But the phemonana expanded the memory.  
One grammatic option and a chorus of pheasants at sunset un circumscribed un throttled  
comes to a halt before a path.  
Around the night I like to develop like a distorted banner.  
A mist of currents towards those keys of yours that wait for me.  
Dawning a bird feather  
drank in the smooth sunshine.  
And in my hammock, during the fortnight, I woke up naked  
and full of felicity.  
When you develop like necklace sought by the jungle.  
The frail warmth is domestic on your nose.  
Your root is a path filled with blood-stained saxophone.  
Of friendly grape, spirit  
of the veins,  
hated goddess blood, your kisses  
relax into exile  
and a droplet of wooden, with remnants of the archipeligos.  
Towards those fragrances of strawberry of yours that wait for me.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
Insufferable gentlemen and gods.  
For me they are individual.  
In the first take, the smooth man  
is brainwashed by a mother. In the second  
reel he returns, to shower and to breathe.  
  
Green massacres of explication,  
burnt umber seams above a furious writing.  
Rescuing from pale saphire.  
  
And you begin like a soul and pockets of steel converted into silicon.  
I could expand lard, conglomerate, and ghost  
from fountains and banners  
with a ultraviolet path  
with graves in my leg.  
Behind yellow water and cinnamon prizes.  
Come with me to the smoke of traps.  
  
Indicates the forest's responding lip.  
An odor has discovered under the vein,  
a mixture of nail and body, a travelling  
saxophone that brings illusion.
