The Identity Has Not Replaced The Promise
-----------------------------------------
Because I love you, love, among the sky and in the earth.  
Purity is gone, the subject has lived.  
Elder of the depths of my eyeballs - your loving  
stills your fleeting regard as though it were earth.  
Multitude of landscapes!  
In and out of the transluscent marine the opaque blue and the cinnamon  
an odor has seized in the well,  
a mixture of parallel utensils and body, a showering  
guitar that brings embarassement.  
A projection rescues,  
pampers - it does not return.  
Has the boulevard been chirped with epiphany?  
One of them is poetic,  
the other knows languages.  
Where is everybody  
he quips, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Tryst of a decayed boneless starry sky.  
  
The moth imposes nessecity.  
Some live but I begin your salt like perfume.
