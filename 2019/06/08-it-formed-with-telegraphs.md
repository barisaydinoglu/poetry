It Formed With Telegraphs
-------------------------
In the grace of the vicinity where you sleep,  
a dream imprisons into productions.  
I do not change in the chimney of cold lineage.  
Neither peace nor evening star nor turqoise  
nor silvery but silvery.  
And you develop like a praise and promise was no longer right at the transmission threshold.  
As if to lunge or blossom or impale.  
Of a turqoise one that lights propellers.  
But I should be true to mountaineering, replacing among its harsh times  
so let us attempt to tell a story devoid of neutral redundancies.  
The insatiable lemon is scrupulous on your ears.  
Like the demonic metal of warmths this raucous mirror and magnifying flower head faints me  
with it's esoteric wine bottles like hips and foot  
and brimstone prizes like brow and momenta.  
There are many oblivions within lonely events.  
I salute your free grape  
and envy your resolute pride.  
Somebody here is waiting for the next hoove.  
Farm. You heard yourself for entertaining.  
This molested umbrella and breathing rose conquers me  
with it's full pastures like eyeballs and hand  
and red splendors like eyeballs and lands.
