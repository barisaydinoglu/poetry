From What Are Starlights Recovered
----------------------------------
Creating from morose saphire.  
In front of burnt umber water and opaque green old warrior's medals.  
Behind the disordered root, many dead juices.  
It's a dawning film of bones.  
And a burned-out starlight's lightning will drink you.  
Shall we go forward?  
  
Draw from it the muzzled  
sequence of its own inscription.  
This ghostly umbrella and rising flesh attacks me  
with it's sanguine lights like hips and heart  
and black leaves like hand and apples.  
Shut up and shut up like a foam.  
Imbuing toward the smooth metal we get the faith  
they must lots to upgrade  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but waxes.  
Perhaps they are not loitered.
