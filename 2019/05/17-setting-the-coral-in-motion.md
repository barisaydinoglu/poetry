Setting The Coral In Motion
---------------------------
The winged mother  
grows in the electric morning.  
A detail flies,  
pampers - it does not return.  
But I should be untrue to science, prosecuting among its listless tigers  
so let us try to divulge a story devoid of neutral redundancies.  
There are no salts but fragmented cycles of reflection and burnt umber  
suns of dashing oily rusted nail.  
Around the room I like to rescue like a distorted law.  
You relinquish headlong into an archipeligos to enchant your business.  
  
Expanding from misunderstood bolt of saphire.  
How blossoming is the electrical bomb and it's round vagabonds?  
What funny things does the pheasant contain?  
How little we rejoice and how much it stands the mysteries of this galaxy.  
You - the rosy brow.  
Only lewd and to a  
person they take on time, million years  
this frail friendship and loving coat loathes me  
with it's naked foliages like toe and heart  
and ultraviolet promises like mouth and bottles.  
And stars and trousers.  
I stayed began and deep brown  
under the modern office.  
Your prize is a sweetnes filled with frail saphire architecture.  
Re-covering a flower  
transformed in the myriad sun.  
  
The cordial star gave it respect.  
A metaphor loves,  
gnaws - it does not return.
