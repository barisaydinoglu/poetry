Your Arm Is Enough
------------------
And you expand like a marine car and you - the poetic brain.  
And you travel like a grape and shall we proceed?  
Multitude of lemons!  
In and out of the marine the sepia and the cashmire  
my warm eyeballs loves you always.  
I could live womb, coffin, and funeral  
from schools and promises  
with a brimstone pencil  
with clefts in my finger.  
Realized cleansed dew only insufferable and to a  
cousin they take on time, three hundred years  
garden of a impaled bitten path.  
Towards those branches of yours that wait for me.  
There are no holes but wayside cycles of evening star and cinnamon  
awes of humble torrential sand.  
I am fainted by thread and complaint, by billows of black smoke and sun.  
From pillow of fog to blade of grass,  
hidden evening stars drawn by mineral channels, a  
putrid path begins to swim.  
How divulging is the electrical oxide and it's electric vagabonds?  
Pure hound inherits the railroad tracks the wax gallops on its difficult mare  
rescuing marine trousers over the modern office.
