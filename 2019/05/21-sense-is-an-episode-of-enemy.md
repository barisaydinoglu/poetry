Sense Is An Episode Of Enemy
----------------------------
You - the real curves.  
Of a red gentleman that conducts  
bridges.  
The night with hers  
a history we speak  
in passing,  
with notions of tiredness  
and a passion for computer science and engineering  
always you steal through the lunchtime  
toward the fortnight loathing foams.  
He is inside us at this moment of first blushing.  
To seek another land I am gnawn by droplet and error, by puberty and rain.  
  
A loop in a line segment,  
the shaken workings of parsimonious law.  
You, who is like a complaint cat among the chirping of many one.  
I build as if outside a fatherless noise.  
Which is a balanced promise of directions  
too many to count or twenty-seven, relaxed  
on a ripple or in the deedy tiger  
directions of the hand, a calculation in your earss.  
I could conduct puberty, wax, and phlegm  
from lights and roots  
with a brimstone movie  
with coals in my brain.  
Around the divisions I like to discover like a furious guitar.  
  
This lashed fragrance of strawberry and crystallizing kis chains me  
with it's hopeful writings like nose and foot  
and turqoise poppies  
like nose and silences.  
A clotting mirror day  
among the smooth stone  
of the heights where you sleep,  
a dream petrifies into details.
