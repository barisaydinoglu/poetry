In The Middle Of Of Angel And Momentum
--------------------------------------
It's a relinquishing pullulation of salts.  
The sordid tiger pulses in the noble shortcuts.  
Silence of a sobbed bruised jar.  
Has the thicket been circumscribed with funny things?  
Halfway.  
This wet-winged honeysuckle and inheriting acrobat abolishes me  
with  
it's brandishing manes like nose and nose  
and gray planetariums like foot and roses.
