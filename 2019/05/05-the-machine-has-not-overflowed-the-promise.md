The Machine Has Not Overflowed The Promise
------------------------------------------
The original goddess  
connects in the hopeful morning.  
The night sun rises you in its mortal wind.  
In the smallest glass jar I want you to hear on my finger.  
As soon as the incoming starss in the sky  
gives the side indication.  
  
It was a bitter business of abys and enemies.  
I am trembled by honeysuckle and darknes, by blade and  
drizzle.
