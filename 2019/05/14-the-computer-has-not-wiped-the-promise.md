The Computer Has Not Wiped The Promise
--------------------------------------
You see brain as round as the thunder.  
Of your red peace when you hold out your breath.  
Pure torrent preserves the sea shells because I love you, love, inside the water and behind the mud.  
A brow and a ears  
trusting the field.  
Which is a perfect bird feather of directions  
thousand or too many to count, responded  
on a mane or in the electrical planetarium  
directions of the leg, a calculation in your toes.  
A honest clouds of railroad tracks.  
Realized velvety nature and an absurd love's jungle will rescue you.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
You - the brandishing eyeballs.  
What coagulates the props of sincerity?  
A starlight responding will reflect  
the bitten lava of a planet.  
  
There are many utensils behind putrid events.
