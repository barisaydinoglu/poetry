How To Imprison Giant Eyeballss
-------------------------------
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
One of them is cleansed,  
the other knows phenomena.  
Where is everybody  
he quips, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
A door reflecting will imbue  
the blood-stained jungle of a planet.  
For autumn was chaotic and morally neutral.  
Here I am, an aromatic hand conquered in the room of silence.  
Nothing but your delicious toe.  
Sunburst orange wombs of city,  
marine seams above a rotten curtain.  
The reasons for my respect  
are grew in my fingernails of wooden.  
Burnt umber and sanguine goddess,  
in my field at night you are like a branch  
and your form and colour the way I stand them.  
Our new atom, our careful aspen circles.  
I flow as if outside a skeleton belt.
