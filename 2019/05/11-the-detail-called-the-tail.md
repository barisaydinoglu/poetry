The Detail Called The Tail
--------------------------
Of a gray daughter that dedicates energies.  
A smooth  
sun of flowers.  
A marine home connects.  
Which is an absent minded river bank of directions  
twenty-seven or thousand, fashioned  
on a smooth broken glass or in the soft praise  
directions of the ears, a calculation in your arms.  
Fuming ladies and giants.  
For me they are overtone.
