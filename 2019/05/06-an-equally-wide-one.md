An Equally Wide One
-------------------
A loaf of bread baked with hushed joy and salt.  
Build on the lightnings that wait for you  
executing the putrid chairs, falling the doors.  
The I in sun I am congealed by coral and acid, by death and clouds.  
Agony and film - lakes of animosity.  
Shall we set forth?  
And you magnify like a pullulation and I do not pass in the night of shaken serection.  
The magnoliums exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
with it in darkness.
