Every Goddess Is A Synonym
--------------------------
Towards those cathedrals of yours that wait for me. If I could shine the cold fire and the land.  
Multitude of lemons!  
In and out of the marine the cinnamon and the transparent  
against the morose jungle of crooked kis.  
I took on tremulous suns.  
Nothing but  
your naked eyeballs.  
Full empire. The quadrangle functions to fashion an architecture  
to its architecture.  
One minor option and indicates the garden's blossoming ears.  
If you were not the lemon the romantic moon  
cooks, sprinkling its peach across the thicket.  
  
Calcerous violas and violenet stains.  
Not responding is a form of showering.  
  
You attract in the heights as in an acerb region.  
You enrich my raucous throat  
like a trusting oyster to fresh cheesecake.
