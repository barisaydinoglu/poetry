A Smooth Substance
------------------
I stayed swam and sunburst orange  
in the vicinity.  
In the smallest saphire railroad track you see hand as handsome as the snow.  
Fear and flint - lunars of beligerance.  
The sea with hers  
a tale we speak in passing,  
with notions of purity  
and a passion for jouranlism and computer science  
There are many juices with imperalist events.  
Banal astronauts and children.  
For me they are alphabetic.  
Like nights abandoning with warmths.  
The midnight wine bottles you in its mortal sky. For a day, maybe three hundred,  
I rested under a pillow of fog  
at a post office, waiting for the child to be within.
