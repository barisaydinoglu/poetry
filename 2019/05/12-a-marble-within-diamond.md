A Marble Within Diamond
-----------------------
A gray and banal saxophone is coagulated in the land.  
Where phemonanas meet  
wine bottles meet, inside and within and the sound  
of throats, to reach out and appreciate in illusion.  
A brow and a shoulder  
wetting the university.  
Blood-stained weather, calculating lights like the lunar.  
Our new mist, our sensible current loops.  
Purity is gone, the subject has understood.  
Once there was a raucous giant who  
divulged at parties, sitting in a line segment, among pastures.
