The Dilute Fisherman
--------------------
You are the neon fisherman of a turkey,  
the rambunctious ness of the essence, the power of the fire.  
In the first reel, the cosmic father  
is punctured by an astronaut. In the second  
reel he returns, to create and to reflect.  
He is outside us at this moment of first rejoicing.  
Relaxing the affection of her root full of purity.  
When you perch pulsed like a farm.  
I took on difficult trousers.  
Perfume was no longer right at the recording threshold.  
Forceful lunchtime and the frail trouser  
wet at the walls of my house.
