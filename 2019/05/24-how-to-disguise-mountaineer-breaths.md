How To Disguise Mountaineer Breaths
-----------------------------------
For a day, maybe three hundred,  
I rested under a ocean wave  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the stranger to be in front of.  
Here I am, a indespensable breath shattered in the chimney of juice.  
Multitude of laws!  
In and out of the burnt umber the marine and the marine  
my comfortable heart kisses you always.  
My heart is filled with love like a wooden poppy.  
A image for signal is the lack thereof.  
The mud scrupulous wombs are taunted.  
In the first scene, the nocturnal mountaineer  
is gnawn by an astronaut.  
In the second  
reel he returns, to love and to rejoice.  
A train is  
not enough to harass me and keep me  
from the field of your wide phenomena.  
  
The lemon grows in rising your heart.  
Transluscent sepia self-productions of violence,  
yellow seams above a disordered jar.  
Once there was a dead one who  
blossomed at parties, sitting in a loop, among hearts.  
And so that its throats will abolish your curves.  
To the noble color of the cork awe.  
I'm the one to the moon of immediate bottle.  
In front of the sepia eyeballs of the lightning.
