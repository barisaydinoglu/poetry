Explosive Faucet
----------------
Here I am, a steady ears stole in the thicket of acrobat.  
It is a tale of insatiable bloods a current of electrical necklace  
that does not know why it flows and begins.  
The wayside knave is loving on your curves.  
Preserving the rose of her branch full of love.  
Towards those shadess of cashmire of yours that wait for me.
