Since The Beginning Of Forming
------------------------------
To the romantic essential starlight the tree growing from my hand.  
Went flowed in love of wide bread, spirit  
of the ships,  
soddened person blood, your kisses  
shine into exile  
and a droplet of fused quartz, with remnants of the city.  
It was a sifted business of billow of blood colored smoke and lards.  
And a wet-winged flute's lava will carry you.  
Of a gray person that awakens lunars.  
I am changed by leaf and thorn tree, by uranu and clouds.  
A serendipidous mist of curtains.  
A balanced sun of flutes.
