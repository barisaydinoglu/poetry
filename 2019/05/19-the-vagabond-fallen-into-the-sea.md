The Vagabond Fallen Into The Sea
--------------------------------
The holiday jars you in its mortal lava.  
The I in stars in the sky the sea with hers  
a story we tell in  
passing,  
with notions of wonder  
and a passion for computer science and engineering  
you are the blood-stained person of a oyster,  
The sordid ness of the magnolium,  
the power of the fire.  
Of your turqoise elixir when you hold out your shoulder.  
Difficult cities and tear stained clandenstines.  
Transforming toward the foam you've asked me what the pheasant is rejoicing there with his burnt umber shoulder?  
I reply, the light knows this.  
  
All banners become corruptions.  
Our new guitar, our soft peace line segments.
