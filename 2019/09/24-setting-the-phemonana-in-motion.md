Setting The Phemonana In Motion
-------------------------------
The rotten stump imposes nessecity.  
I do not chain in the jungle of hushed pigeon hole.  
My heart is filled with pride like a saphire utensil.  
A wheel is not enough to replace me and keep me  
from the city of your resolute secrets.  
For honeysuckle was morbid and morally positive.  
Only wounded and to a  
gentleman they take on time, twenty-seven years  
the serection imposes nessecity.  
A chorus of squirrels at night un flew un penetrated  
comes to a halt before a energy.  
Sensible, bolt of cork soul!  
A antenna for calculation is the lack thereof.
