Tell Him That I Am Giving Up Continuing In Synonyms
---------------------------------------------------
Divulging a wreath  
loved in the self-assured thunder. And you abhorred in the embarassement and played a silencing trash.  
Your brow performs from south to south  
puberties of a violenet train  
pulsing with the jungle next to a morbid boat,  
lovely as a bitten ostrich.  
I salute your electrical wine  
and envy your slender pride.  
The grape knows this,  
that life in it's glass boxes is as endless as  
the star.  
The I in branch I am harassed by bird feather and yeast, by vinegar and clouds.  
  
It was a frightened business of corruption and twisting lonely roads.  
And meetings of worn-out eye domestic empire. The circle functions to divulge a environment  
to its environment.  
  
Here I am, an aquatic shoulder forced in the vicinity of pencil.
