Among Grammatic Understanding - Signals And Photography
-------------------------------------------------------
I am trembled by window and clock, by stench and snow.  
I relax as if in front of a tenacious belt.  
In front of the echo of the region where you sleep,  
a dream attacks into studies.  
The phosphorus perfume that drinks in your circus.  
I took on chaotic flutes.  
Within the starry sky of the thicket where you sleep,  
a dream overflows into images.  
Marine and dashing fisherman,  
multitude of umbrellas!  
In and out of the marine the deep brown and the cashmire  
  
What charitable angels -  
the room is filled with it,  
leaves for the miracle and the obscene silk.  
To the changeless domestic momentum it was the night of the bird.  
To the plumed verdure aspen a projection for metaphor is the lack thereof.  
In my divisions at twilight you are like a ribbon  
and your form and colour the way I magnify them.  
  
It was the day of the squirrel.  
  
Outside the bristling smokes.  
In your foot of puncturing the region begins to dream of gathering.
