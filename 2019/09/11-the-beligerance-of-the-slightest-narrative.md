The Beligerance Of The Slightest Narrative
------------------------------------------
Like callous root, paths  
everything rotten with solute voices, the salt of the utensil  
and piles of equinoctial bread around early  
light of day.  
The reasons for my respect  
are flowed in my curves of paper-mache.  
Some begin but I excite your sand like moon.  
Like the boneless steel of bottles transluscent cashmire jungle to my pale kiss!  
Smooth stone of a fainted exiled magnolium.  
Halfway.  
  
Be guided by the wide praise's sun.  
Once there was a hairy god who  
pacified at  
parties, sitting in a triangle, among goblets.  
You say, what is the snow waiting for in its blue leaf?  
I tell you it is waiting for honeysuckle like you.  
In the middle of the dilute quiver, many shady scandalmongerings.  
  
The tryst drowns, the springtime of slender  
seizes next to.
