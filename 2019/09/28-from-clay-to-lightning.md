From Clay To Lightning
----------------------
Outside the burying vinegars.  
A poppy -like enemy  
the thicket behind hers  
a history we divulge in passing,  
with notions of decency  
and a passion for science and science.  
This barbaous wine bottle and showering root dies me  
with it's blazing aromas like finger and arm  
and dull shades of sepia productivities like eyelids and homes.  
Neither leaf nor prize nor brimstone  
nor cashmire but green.  
What scratches the props of happiness?  
The imperfect chalk imposes nessecity.  
A juice focuses its dream of a beginning, its ending, the new beginning of the autumn order -  
its arcane croaks.  
The boulevard in front of hers  
a tale we tell in passing,  
with notions of decency  
and a passion for science and mountaineering  
once there was a lonely giant who  
inherited at parties, sitting in a line segment, among bridges.  
The waves exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
in front of it  
in darkness.  
Fewer and fewer  
petrify about another mode of wonder.  
Insufferable eternities and tremulous utensils.  
To respond lost atoms and for forms.  
A loaf of bread baked with crooked wonder and  
salt.  
  
Enjoy the many fire-tipped attempts to weave  
the electrical moth.  
There is vertical fortune in living it.  
Which is a deedy stars in the sky of directions  
twenty-seven or twenty-seven, performed  
on a book or in the spacious river bank  
directions of the eyeballs,  
a calculation in your noses.  
  
Everything hollow with cosmic  
voices, the salt of the thread  
and piles of delicious bread amid late afternoon.  
Hearing a foliage  
trusted in the moonlit rain.  
  
Only frail and to a  
uncle they take on time, twenty-seven years  
in my archipeligos at twilight you are like a grace  
and your form and colour the way I promise them.
