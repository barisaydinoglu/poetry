Song For The Uncle Of Disordered Serendipities
----------------------------------------------
There are many wounds behind sifted events.  
She is behind us at this moment of first perching.  
A bird feather -like vigil  
fewer and fewer  
bristle about another mode of decency.  
Because I love you, love, among the wind and within the sky.  
Like clandenstines scratching within graces.  
Cashmire lampreys of scandalmongering,  
blue seams above a parched propeller.  
But the muscle rose the memory.  
Not preserving is a form of rustling.  
  
Only fuming and to a  
woman they take on time, thousand years  
under the divisions like sand.  
The chalk architecture knows this,  
that life in it's copper boxes is as endless as the tree. And next to my hammock, during the fortnight, I woke up naked  
and full of joy.
