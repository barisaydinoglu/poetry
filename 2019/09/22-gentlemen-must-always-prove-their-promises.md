Gentlemen Must Always Prove Their Promises
------------------------------------------
You - the essential mouth.  
The enchanting sea water buried when you promise like promise grew by the lightning.  
Explosive weather, negligent lights like the stalks of cattail.  
And you expand like a wave and what we say upgrades to  
excite some other god  
what a point of view may teach.  
I salute your parsimonious plum  
and envy your fluidic pride.  
I want you to enchant on my nose.  
Somebody here is waiting for the next horse.  
Planetarium. You fluttered yourself for preserving.
