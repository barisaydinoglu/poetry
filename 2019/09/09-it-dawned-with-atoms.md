It Dawned With Atoms
--------------------
Everything raucous with natural voices, the salt of the prize  
and piles of real bread among afternoon.  
Mingled and then trusted in the divisions.  
You are the rigid lady of a turkey,  
the rustling ness of the film, the power of the earth.  
There are no dominions but mourning cycles of ripple and silvery  
sea's skins of brandishing nauesous brick.  
Infinite, cork flower! What we say seizes to  
preserve some other pioneer  
what a camera may teach.  
Map of a coagulated  
phosphorus land.  
Pure blade grows the moons only starlight, just the  
jar, nothing but  
it. Serendipity.  
Your hoove is a cluster filled with dilute heart.  
I do not sodden in the room of barbaous imbroglio.  
A metaphor discovers,  
falls - it does not return.  
  
As if to smother or breathe or wipe.  
The darknes imposes nessecity.
