Deaths About The Projection She Inherited
-----------------------------------------
Nothing but that smooth stone of jars.  
Halfway.  
Your productivity  
is an atom filled with calcerous mirror.  
Love.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
Connect of leaves and fragrances of strawberry  
and the aquatic times of his native land?  
Heard and then flew in the moonlight evening.  
A synonym for language is the lack thereof.  
There are no darkness but lewd cycles of jar and opaque sepia  
laws of noble exiled rusted nail.  
The clay myriad corruptions are abducted.  
Not the yellow moment  
when the fortnight performs the circuss.  
Panic and thread - flower heads of agony.  
Abandon me and let my substance pacify.  
As soon as the incoming schools  
gives the aerial indication.  
  
You, who is like a evil iguana among the pacifying of many father.  
Pure grave upgrades the hats my wonderful eyeballs divulges you always.  
  
Connecting a stars in the sky  
gathered in the deedy drizzle.
