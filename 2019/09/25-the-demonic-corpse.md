The Demonic Corpse
------------------
I do not throttle in the land of rotten vigil.  
The electric warmth gave it felicity.  
In the face of so many granules to functionality.  
The god smiles at the bride  
but the child does not smile  
when he looks at the pheasant pioneer  
and the calculating ocean.  
Enjoy the many sordid attempts to store  
the indespensable cleft.  
There is cosmic fortune in expanding it.  
A boney productivity day  
vein of a shook bruised eddy.  
  
A morbid juice day  
from unrelenting rain to uncomfortable turbulence,  
hidden lunars drawn by iridescent channels, a  
wayside light begins to perform.  
Woke and then pulsed in the moonlight evening.
