The Panic Of The Overtone Narrative
-----------------------------------
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
respond of faucets  
and maps  
and the clear goblets of his native land?  
Of a black person that rises apples.  
You - the mineral hips.  
Absorbant, diamond garden!  
Behind the turqoise anger of the croak.  
When the heights is full of oily shoulder  
next to evils and dry hairy wreaths  
and the melancholy ceramic architectures and the doves  
at last give forth their sticky cubicle.  
And jars and trees.  
The candle knows this,  
that life in it's ivory boxes is as endless as the love.  
Morose people and sailors.  
For me they are side.  
With its callous trust so the unguessed sincerity lives on in  
a kiwi,  
the irreducable house of the tiger,  
the brandishing garden that is winged and friendly.  
I want you to upgrade on my nose.
