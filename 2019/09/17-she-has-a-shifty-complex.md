She Has A Shifty Complex
------------------------
Not perfuming is a form of galloping.  
Shall we keep going?  
Only law, just the  
railroad track, nothing but  
it. Map.  
In your brow of invading the archipeligos begins to dream  
of treading.  
My heart is filled with purity like a silicon defender.  
Cheerless sunrise and the hairy sun rise  
hate at the walls of my house.  
  
And the law to its hoove  
and among the books the real one  
the fisherman covered with dashing sea water.  
I wish to make a triangle  
outside, and every sight, many  
times hidden in a heart.  
Once there was a skeleton aunt who  
grew at parties, sitting in a tetrahedron, among quivers.  
For love was hairy and morally negative.  
Neither sweetnes nor stalks of cattail nor turqoise  
nor sand-colored but crimson.  
Breathing a evening star  
built in the somber rain.  
The affluent stranger  
performs in the clear morning.
