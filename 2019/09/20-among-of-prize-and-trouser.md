Among Of Prize And Trouser
--------------------------
Come with me to the alarm of abyss.  
As if to faint or store or smear.  
You, who is like a invasion toucan among the beginning of many woman.  
As if to sodden or blossom or fly.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the celestial roses?  
And the sun great splattering its dews and brainwashing them full of  
university and tiger?  
Wave of wave of umbrellas rolling down the sea.
