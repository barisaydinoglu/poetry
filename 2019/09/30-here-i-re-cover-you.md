Here I Re-cover You
-------------------
The father smiles at the aunt  
but the bride does not smile  
when he looks at the lobster custodian  
and the inaccessible ocean.  
Halfway.  
And you begin like a breakfast and my romantic eyeballs preserves you always.  
As soon as the incoming films  
gives the technical indication.
