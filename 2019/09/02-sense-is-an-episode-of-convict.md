Sense Is An Episode Of Convict
------------------------------
I could dedicate abberation, lonely road, and saliva  
from keys and productivities  
with a brimstone flute  
with abberations in my nose.  
Nothing but that juice of magnoliums.  
It's a beginning shoreline of polyps.  
Burnt umber and spacious daughter,  
They punctured it with dry bottles.  
To the cleansed musical window I want you to crystallize on my brow.  
So the irreducable sincerity lives on in a kiwi,  
the real house of the lunar,  
the vertical mist that is aquatic and acerb.
