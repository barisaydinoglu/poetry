Meeting Your Flame
------------------
Lonely weather, rabid lights like the time.  
My hidden shoulder preserves  
you always.  
If you were not the peach the musical moon  
cooks, sprinkling its sugar across the land.  
And you perch like a breakfast and wave of wave of autumns rolling down the sea.  
Breathe on the imbroglios that wait for you  
penetrating the chaotic chairs, deluding the doors.
