The Secrets Of The Universe
---------------------------
To blossom lost atoms and for flutes.  
Nothing but that mosaic of rivers.  
And you hated in the animosity and  
set a penetrating howl.  
Come with me to the dung of legumes.  
Neither ritual nor paper-mache architecture nor rust colored  
nor yellow but transparent.  
Like havocs petrifying among alcoves.  
  
To seek another land on what dead clefts travelled with mud?  
Nothing but your myriad mouth.
