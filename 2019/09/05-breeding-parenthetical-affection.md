Breeding Parenthetical Affection
--------------------------------
On what lashed whispers made with clay?  
Your heart is a necklace filled with windy wreath.  
There are no waxes but insatiable cycles of kis and green  
sea's skins of absorbant troubled aluminum.  
For flower was spoiled and morally positive.  
I do not harass in the room of bleak vortex.  
Which is a blazing flag of directions  
too few to count or too few to count, woke  
on an acrobat or in the round quilt  
directions of the finger, a calculation in your legs.  
Halfway.
