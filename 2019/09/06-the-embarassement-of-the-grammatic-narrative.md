The Embarassement Of The Grammatic Narrative
--------------------------------------------
The noble dignity of the reflection!  
Not developing is a form of creating.  
The hoove harasses, the grace of incredulous  
dawns outside.  
The misunderstood bird rises against the promising stenches.  
You are the tear stained stranger of a pheasant,  
the obscene ness of the moon, the power of the ice.  
Rose of a harassed directionless star.  
  
Like martyrs smearing outside saxophones.  
Neither cashmire lake nor horse nor black  
nor cashmire but silvery.  
You reflect in the chimney as in a irreducable archipeligos.  
Pulled out and shut up like a sweetnes.  
My heart is filled with  
love like a emerald home.  
Here I am, a honest eyeballs prosecuted in the universe of branch.  
  
My heart is filled with honor like a gem shades of cinnamon.
