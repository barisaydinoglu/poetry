From Clay To Wind
-----------------
A miracle -like stench  
Around the universe I like to attract like a frail praise.  
.  
A quadrangle within a circle,  
the disordered workings of comfortable law.  
Pure throat creates the transluscent marine cars full stop.  
My heart is filled with tiredness like a wooden leaf.  
A dull shades of yellow and hushed maternity is deformed in the moonlight evening.  
My heart is filled with purity like a marble mosaic.  
  
And next to my hammock, during the afternoon, I woke up naked  
and full of joy.  
A cinnamon hoove circumscribes.
