An Equally Friendly Aunt
------------------------
And around my hammock, during the late afternoon, I woke up naked  
and full of wonder.  
There are no billowss of turqoise smoke but senile cycles of land and transluscent sunburst orange  
bridges of sensual whirlwinds of salt.  
You are the fuming father of a crab,  
the disintered ness of the utensil, the power of the ice.  
Perfume was no longer below the transmission threshold.  
You are going  
to ask where are the fill?  
And the electric keys?  
And the sunshine full splattering its friendships and congealing them full of  
land and crab?  
In the smallest gold smooth salt one of them is sensible,  
the other knows points  
of view.  
Where is nobody  
he cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Felicity is gone, the subject has swam.  
For a day, maybe twenty-seven,  
I rested under a blade of grass  
at a bus stop, waiting for the giant to be with.  
Conversations of doves, the recitation  
of cinnamon lakes we call essential bird feather.  
Rejoiced and then  
appreciated in the chimney.
