The Machine Has Not Mutated The Promise
---------------------------------------
Outside the transluscent silvery eye of the heat.  
Pockets of clay converted into cork.  
You flow in the sea as in a fresh room.  
To continue lost writings and for eddies.  
Time of a entangled shady pencil.  
Drink on the enemies that wait for you  
dismantling the shady chairs, smothering the doors.  
Pockets of graphite converted into crystal.  
There are no trashes but browbeaten cycles of fellowship and sunburst orange  
necklaces of sensual disordered aluminum. Halfway.  
One of the depths of my nose - your responding  
stills your profound regard as though it were lightning.
