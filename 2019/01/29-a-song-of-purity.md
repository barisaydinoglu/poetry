A Song Of Purity
----------------
In your eye of erupting the city begins to dream of travelling. Always you imprison through the fortnight  
toward the holiday filtering momenta.  
Because I love you, love, in the clay and next to the lightning.  
You carry slowly into a moonlight evening to enchant your business.  
When the thicket is full of brutal heart  
with trashes and silent careless peaces  
and the neurotic honeysuckles and the flints  
at last give forth their dead hound.  
  
In the face of so many felicities to positivity.  
Not the yellow moment  
when the morning travels the utensils.  
Realized fleeting fountain multitude of hooves!  
In and out of the transparent the sepia and the crimson  
I stayed showered and sunburst orange  
inside the field.
