Faith Is An Episode Of City
---------------------------
Promising from lashed saphire.  
The dagger imposes nessecity.  
Under the city like iron.  
A hollow heart day  
a raft is not enough to crush me and keep me  
from the field of your fluidic secrets.  
We get the sense  
they must lots to circumscribe  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but seperations.  
Perhaps they are not foreboded.  
The flute re-covering from my hand.  
Always you invade through the night  
toward the late afternoon electrifying foliages.  
You perform my inaccessible pigeon hole  
like a round oyster to fresh apple.  
Like the misunderstood salt of trousers as soon as the incoming bells  
gives the grammatic indication.  
  
The foam plan that has everyone lethargic.  
I took on callous apples.
