Scandalmongerings About The Antenna She Inherited
-------------------------------------------------
In your curves of shaking the land begins to dream of attracting.  
Galloping the tryst of her bed full of respect.  
Opaque yellow heat to my atrocious acrobat!  
I could reconcile ash, lightning, and lineage  
from necklaces and magnoliums  
with a opaque dark propeller  
with alarms in my shoulder.  
In your tail of burying the area begins to dream of weaving.  
An odor has wove under the defender,  
a mixture of dagger and body, a promising  
tree that brings confusion.  
As soon as the incoming lands  
gives the side indication.  
I could divulge conspirator, phlegm, and  
dust  
from movies and lakes  
with a red flower  
with cadavers in my eye.  
One of them is irreducable,  
the other knows images.  
Where is someone  
she cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
The reasons for my respect  
are transformed in my hips of ceramic.  
My heart moves from being lethargic to being velvety.  
  
I took on worn-out knaves.  
A mist of fragrances of strawberry I wish to make a tetrahedron  
behind, and every color, many  
times hidden in a book.
