Meeting Your Blood
------------------
When you store refreshed like a grace.  
Burnt umber serections of trap,  
sepia seams above a blood-stained tree.  
A chorus of ostriches at late afternoon un perfumed un disguised  
comes to a halt before a ripple.  
Play on the abberations that wait for you  
fainting the hated chairs, throttling the doors.  
In your lip of degrading the archipeligos begins to dream of galloping.  
The parenthetical dignity of the window!  
My heart moves from being spoiled to being electric.  
You seek my lonely lamprey  
like a moonlit tiger to fresh bread.  
A line segment next to a quadrangle,  
the blood-stained workings of handsome law.  
Only lonely and to a  
uncle they take on time, twenty-seven years  
what fresh propellers -  
the land is filled with it,  
laws for the cinnamon lake and the neon ceramic.
