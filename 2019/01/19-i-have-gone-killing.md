I Have Gone Killing
-------------------
In the face of so many graves to animosity.  
When the moonlight evening is full of silent mouth  
with depths and rambunctious demonic flower heads  
and the arrogant sweetness and the kiss  
at last give forth their fire-tipped bloody feather.  
  
The current  
flutters in carrying your ears. Rigid bones and tenacious corruptions.
