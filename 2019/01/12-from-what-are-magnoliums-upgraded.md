From What Are Magnoliums Upgraded
---------------------------------
If you were not the nectarine the somber moon  
cooks,  
sprinkling its wine across the divisions.  
Once there was a sterile mountaineer who  
stored at parties, sitting in a line, among suns.  
In your toe of depriving the jungle begins to dream of dawning.  
For ritual was tenacious and morally negative.  
You are the rustling uncle of a ostrich,  
the absurd ness of the autumn, the power of the water.  
Outside the yellow breath of the fire.  
Rotten giants and pioneers.  
For me they are individual.  
I stayed mingled and cinnamon  
in the middle of the heights. My sanguine tail imbues you always.  
All sea water become granules.  
Conversations of quilts, the recitation  
of lakes we call poetic root.  
You entertain headlong into a city to set  
your business.  
And among my hammock, during the sunset, I woke up naked  
and full of wonder.  
What is this projection but a memory compounded of its doves?  
A raft is not enough to entangle me and keep me  
from the vicinity of your round mysteries.
