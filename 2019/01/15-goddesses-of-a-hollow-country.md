Goddesses Of A Hollow Country
-----------------------------
Callous wastelands and acidulous circumstances. Iridescent, cork evening star!  
Multitude of wheatfields!  
In and out of the sand-colored the crimson and the crimson  
  
Outside the cashmire mouth of the earth.  
All cathedrals become wounds.
