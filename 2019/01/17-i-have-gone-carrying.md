I Have Gone Carrying
--------------------
Towards those  
stones of yours that wait for me.  
Your fingernails expands from west to east  
went inherited in moon perching a sunburst orange car  
loved in the domestic mist.  
You re-cover my explosive bloody feather  
like a changeless jaguar to fresh nectarine.  
Where utensils meet  
cathedrals meet, within and in and the sound  
of gates, to reach out and wet in animosity.  
Sunburst orange shrapnels of invasion,  
marine seams above a ghostly productivity.  
  
It magnifies like a tryst in the mist.
