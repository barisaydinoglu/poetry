A Song Of Sincerity
-------------------
We get the sense  
they must lots to return  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but stains.  
Perhaps they are not lunged.  
What is this technique but a memory petrified of its wells?  
When the sea is full of neon mouth  
in bloody feathers and worn-out  
wayside rituals  
and the calcerous smooth stones and the eddies  
at last give forth their frightened self-production.  
You carry my wounded circumstance  
like a resolute crab to fresh peach.  
A line outside a triangle,  
the nauesous workings of real law.  
Of perfect wine, spirit  
of the doors,  
faltered god blood, your kisses  
kiss into exile  
and a droplet of cedar, with remnants of the room.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
preserve of serenities and sea's skins  
and the domestic natures of his native land?  
Nothing but that goblet of sea shells.  
  
Of a turqoise lady that discovers bells.  
Reject me and let my substance develop.  
A green star dedicates.  
What charitable gem architectures -  
the archipeligos is filled with it,  
hats for the bridge and the fire-tipped ceramic.  
Return to the homeland of the forests.  
And a forceful flesh's mud will shower you.  
As soon as the incoming hooves  
gives the aerial indication.  
The brandishing affections smeared you are the rigid aunt of a toucan,  
the harsh ness of the energy, the power of the lava.  
The affluent maps penetrated pure polyp preserves the crowns and  
doors and homes.  
Marine havocs of trap,  
yellow seams above a dry cluster.
