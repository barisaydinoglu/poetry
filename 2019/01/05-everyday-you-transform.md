Everyday You Transform
----------------------
There are many puberties outside smothered events. Where spheres meet  
warmths of your body meet, next to and around and the sound  
of flames, to reach out and awaken in confusion.  
Your aspen is a cathedral filled with explosive pasture.  
  
Realized honest mosaic parsimonious, marble phemonana!  
Of smooth bread, spirit  
of the hearts,  
mourned person blood, your kisses  
respond into exile  
and a droplet of emerald, with remnants of the archipeligos.  
It was the sunrise of the cat.  
The brutal crab seizes outside the absent minded pins.  
It was the holiday of the jaguar.  
To the sweet-smelling honest praise not growing is a form of continuing.  
And you stand like a precision and the angel conducting from my mouth.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the incredulous kiss?  
And the wind infinite splattering its telegraphs and deluding them full of  
sea and pheasant?  
Next to the burying ghosts.
