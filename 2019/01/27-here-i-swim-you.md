Here I Swim You
---------------
A lemon -like flask  
dedicated and then mixed in the room.  
Not to pulse or even meet  
the awe of one who swims  
in me in a jungle or recovering to a gentleman.  
Shall we move on?  
Imprison me and let my substance reconcile.  
In my university at midnight you are like a current  
and your form and colour the way I magnify them.  
In your arm of pitying  
the heights begins to dream of circumscribing.
