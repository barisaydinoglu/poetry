Calculation In The Side Services
--------------------------------
I salute your hidden nectarine  
and envy your vertical pride. I wish to make a quadrangle  
outside, and every abstraction, many  
times hidden in a land.  
The order of the keys has the night been blossomed with funny things?  
Bury me and let my substance weave.  
I  
was without doubt the woman bird  
there in the torrential thicket.  
When it looked me with its winged essence eyes  
it had neither hand nor breath  
but silk lights on its sides.  
Not developing is a form of perfuming.  
In your hand of confusion the universe of trousers seek.  
I am died by time and death, by night and rain.  
  
The I in river bank our new hat, our rosy ceramic architecture squares.
