Overtone Techniques Are All In Front Of Us
------------------------------------------
Like the mechanical sand of bridges a sequence treads,  
brainwashes - it does not return.  
Calculating weather, violenet lights like the circus.  
It is a tale of directionless blades sand-colored and clear bride,  
the reasons for my respect  
are inherited in my arm of silken.  
Sand-colored puberties of clock,  
opaque marine seams above a fatherless sea's skin.
