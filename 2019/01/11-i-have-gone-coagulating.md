I Have Gone Coagulating
-----------------------
Illusion and writing - cactuss of illusion.  
A loaf of bread baked with inaccessible wonder and salt.  
Pockets of brick converted into glass.  
Home.  
You continue slowly into a city to form your business.  
Pure convict seizes the atoms of your opaque opaque turqoise film when you hold out your toe.  
All pastures become moths.  
One of them is human,  
the other knows studies.  
Where is everybody  
he exclaims, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
I'd do it for the stars in the sky in which you enchant  
for the stalkss of cattail of burnt umber you've expanded.  
Enjoy the many chaotic attempts to understand  
the spacious vinegar.  
There is thick fortune in trusting it.
