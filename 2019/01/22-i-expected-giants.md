I Expected Giants
-----------------
A sun of magnoliums only parched and to a  
mountaineer they take on time, three hundred years boneless pioneers and giants.  
For me they are aerial.  
So the homogeneous happiness lives on in a lemon,  
The starry house of the pencil,  
the esoteric mirror that is stationary and wonderful.  
Cleansed empire. The loop functions to preserve an architecture  
to its system.  
Nothing but that muscle of quilts.  
  
Be guided by the indespensable foam's fellowship.  
And meetings of windy heart what funny things does the bird contain?  
How little we blossom and how much it plays the epiphany of this computer simulation.
