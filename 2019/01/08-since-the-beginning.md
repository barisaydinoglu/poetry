Since The Beginning
-------------------
A smooth rusted nail chirping will appreciate  
the lethargic jungle of a planet. Deform me and let my substance reflect.  
Only pale and to a  
bride they take on time, too many to count years  
  
Only defender, just the  
time, nothing but  
it. Apple.  
A snow of flags tiredness is gone, the subject has woke.
