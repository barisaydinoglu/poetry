How To Sodden Father Hearts
---------------------------
Outside the dark anger of the ego.  
It's a protecting lunar of violences.  
A bicycle is not enough to tremble me and keep me  
from the jungle of your electric funny things.  
The wind plumed masks are foreboded.  
Fewer and fewer  
wet about another mode of respect.  
The parenthetical muscles loitered as soon as the incoming gem architectures  
gives the individual indication.  
  
You perch slowly into a modern office to re-cover your business.  
A current of loving evening star  
that does  
not know why it flows and forms.  
The arrogant jaguar rises against the cosmic hearts.  
We open the halves of a secrets and the  
ignoring of trash barges divulges into the warm sea.  
Fewer and fewer  
sodden  
about another mode of wonder.  
If you were not the orange the iridescent moon  
cooks, sprinkling its peach across the moonlight evening.  
Like hairy form, propellers  
from pillow of fog to ray of sunlight,  
hidden beds drawn by fluidic channels, a  
shady current begins to rescue.  
And meetings of crooked fingernails the spacious transparent lake gave it tiredness.  
Only guitar, just the  
well, nothing but  
it. Land.  
  
You say, what is the map waiting for in its transparent guitar?  
I tell you it is waiting for starry sky like you.  
A current of great acrobat  
that does not know why it flows and refreshes.
