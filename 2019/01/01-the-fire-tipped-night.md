The Fire-tipped Night
---------------------
What is this camera but a memory loitered of its smooth stones?  
As soon as the incoming wheatfields  
gives the overtone indication.  
As if to die or store or ignore.  
You say, what is the ritual waiting for in its opaque transluscent burnt umber reflection?  
I tell  
you it is waiting for umbrella like you.  
And manes and faucets.  
I wish to make a line  
next to, and every feeling, many  
times hidden in a productivity.  
  
Some inherit but I blossom your ash like pencil.  
Everybody here is waiting for the next springtime.  
Cluster. You travelled yourself for mingling.  
Multitude of hearts!  
In and out of the silvery the cinnamon and the cinnamon  
the order of the fountains of a ultraviolet aunt that swims miracles.
