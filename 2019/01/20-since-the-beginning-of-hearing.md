Since The Beginning Of Hearing
------------------------------
In my sea at sunrise you are like a springtime  
and your form and colour the way I refresh them.  
A gray and clotting utensil is abhorred in the moonlight evening.  
Shall we move on?  
The precision knows this,  
that life in it's  
chalk boxes is as endless as the tryst.
