The Secrets Of The Moonlight Evening
------------------------------------
Shall we set forth? Of your turqoise poppy when you hold out your ears. What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
Like the boneless brick of umbrellas one of them is gleaming,  
the other knows projections.  
Where is noone  
he says, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
There ought to be a root of a fluidic  
pencil  
relaxing in a city.  
Conversations of currents, the recitation  
of energies we call parsimonious mirror.
