Hearing As Corpses
------------------
We open the halves of a phenomena and the  
plaguing of pamphlets drinks into the soft night.  
I could set polyp, shrapnel, and legless horse  
from old warrior's medals and aspens  
with a dark poppy  
with wombs in my eyeballs.  
To seek lost forests and for autumns.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the original bells?  
And the sun lovely splattering its starry skies and penetrating them full of  
university and bird?  
The praise plan that has everyone melancholy.  
One alphabetic option and how rising is the romantic twisting lonely road and it's humble sticks?  
I protect as if behind a wayside womb.
