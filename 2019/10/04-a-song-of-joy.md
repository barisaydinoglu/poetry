A Song Of Joy
-------------
To the musical color of the ceramic starry sky.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the gleaming elixirs?  
And the drizzle spacious splattering its peaces and rejecting them full of  
divisions and oyster?  
The probe imposes nessecity.  
Next to silvery water and yellow trees.  
Everything rustling with deedy voices, the salt of the river bank  
and piles of brandishing bread behind midnight.  
To the musical naked perfume I am punctured by home and shrapnel, by shards of marble and clouds.  
Always you strike through the lunchtime  
toward the sunrise hating bird feathers.
