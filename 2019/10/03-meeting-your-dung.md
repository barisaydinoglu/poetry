Meeting Your Dung
-----------------
In the turqoise anger of the explication.  
Miracle of a impaled communist well.  
Not to excite or even meet  
the river of one who responds  
under me in an archipeligos or rescuing to a pioneer.  
I saw how landscapes are fluttered  
by the resolute miracle.  
You say, what is the bottle waiting for in its burnt umber jar?  
I tell you it is waiting for honeysuckle like you.  
When the sea is full of rambunctious eyeballs  
next to lampreys  
and smothered calcerous starlights  
and the silent echoes and the maternities  
at last give forth their fatherless massacre.  
  
Full stop.  
I saw how magnoliums are wetted  
by the smooth saxophone.  
  
Where flower heads meet  
cathedrals meet, inside and amid and the sound  
of billowss of brimstone smoke, to reach out and chirp in embarassement.  
When you play connected like a defender.
