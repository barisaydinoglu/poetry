I Expected Strangers
--------------------
A morose dove day  
if you were not the peach the absorbant moon  
cooks, sprinkling its grape across the area. And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
seize of fragrances of strawberry and natures  
and the careful bird feathers of his native land?  
Among the universe like steel.  
Multitude of snows!  
In and out of the crimson the cashmire and the crimson
