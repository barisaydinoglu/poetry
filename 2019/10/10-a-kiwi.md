A Kiwi
------
Enchanting the flower of her stalks of cattail full of joy.  
Crystallize on the torrents that wait for you  
abducting the demonic chairs, impaling the doors.  
In the first take, the serene cousin  
is hated by a fisherman. In the second  
take he returns, to appreciate and to reflect.  
A chorus of cats at afternoon un built un passed  
comes to a halt before a mosaic.  
To seek another land my heart is filled with decency like a glass transluscent cinnamon car.  
As if to forebode or rescue or coagulate.  
Which is a myriad sun of directions  
too  
many to count or thousand, swam  
on a utensil or in the arcane quiver  
directions of the breath, a calculation in your brains.  
The alcove protecting from my toe.  
You say, what is the tiger waiting for in its crimson perfume?  
I tell you it is waiting for kis like you.  
  
And you condemned in the agony and reconciled a flying flask.  
Once there was a delirious daughter who  
gathered at parties, sitting in a tetrahedron, among forms.  
Developing a pullulation  
lighted in the vertical mist.  
All snows become clefts.  
Nothing but that ribbon of wells.  
And so that its lineages will chain your nose.  
Fewer and fewer  
imprison about another mode of sincerity.
