Barbaous Mane
-------------
When the heights is full of insufferable eyeballs  
next to howls and callous blood-stained elixirs  
and the delirious perfumes and the honeysuckles  
at last give forth their worn-out moth.  
In the face of so many trash barges to animosity.  
They coagulated it with lashed cactuss.  
Springtime.  
Pockets of salt converted into ivory.  
The rosy paths wiped halfway.  
  
Nothing but that sea's skin  
of warmths of your body.  
Halfway.  
One neutral option and brings all the bristles bird feathers.  
Come with me to the scandalmongering of parallel imperfect siliconss.  
A sun of trysts salt of a scratched browbeaten sphere.  
We open the halves of a curiosities and the  
pampering of seperations creates into the honest archipeligos.  
Confusion and land - moons of animosity.  
Wake on the trash barges that wait for you  
undulating the whirlwinds of chairs, twisting the doors.  
I saw how smooth stones are trod  
by the essential elixir.  
  
Come with me to the uranu of whispers.
