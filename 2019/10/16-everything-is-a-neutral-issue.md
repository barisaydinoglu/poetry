Everything Is A Neutral Issue
-----------------------------
You say, what is the bird feather waiting for in its sepia springtime?  
I tell you it is waiting for defender like you.  
I do not impale in the night of inevitable whisper.  
Illusion and root - lights of animosity.  
Lashed late afternoon and the bruised starry sky  
smother at the walls of my house.  
  
Your brain recovers from east to north  
of a black sailor that appreciates praises.  
I saw how atoms are magnified  
by the loving river.  
A square next to a tetrahedron,  
the rabid workings of loving law.  
So the nocturnal sincerity lives on in a fruit,  
the aquatic house of the bottle,  
the angellic peace that is thick and perfect.  
In the face of so many legless horses to positivity.  
The sticky star that flutters in your peace.
