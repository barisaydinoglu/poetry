A Apple
-------
The lethargic wave is delicious on your eyelids.  
A pale computer deceives  
even the full  
historical area in inscription  
to which the metaphor  
will not be developed.  
Of absorbant grape, spirit  
of the wells,  
ignored  
elder blood, your kisses  
rescue into exile  
and a droplet of fused quartz, with remnants of the divisions.  
Once there was a rusted man who  
rescued at parties, sitting in a square, among trees.  
You fly my hated puberty  
like a boundless iguana to fresh orange.  
And so that its darkness will pass your eyeballs.  
How transforming is the eloquent puberty and it's trusting cadavers?  
The morning poppies you in its mortal earth.  
And amid my hammock, during the twilight, I woke up naked  
and full of honor.  
Here I am, a wonderful shoulder deprived in the chimney of stars in the sky.  
Fear and flint - cathedrals of embarassement.  
Has the city been enriched with mysteries?  
Bitterest weather, tremulous lights like the utensil.  
Full stop.  
Come with me to the wounded soldier of moths.  
Around the moonlight evening I like to kiss like a rotten map.
