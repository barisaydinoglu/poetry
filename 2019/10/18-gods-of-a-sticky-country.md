Gods Of A Sticky Country
------------------------
A study responds,  
condemns - it does not return.  
What eager momenta -  
the city is filled with it,  
corals for the foam and the violenet chalk.  
Among the frightened well, many violenet lightnings.  
Somebody here is waiting for the next faucet.  
Garden. You connected yourself for inheriting.  
So the resplendent respect lives on in a fruit,  
the silent house of the sea water,  
the full wave that is moonlit and real.  
The mother smiles at the mountaineer  
but the child does not smile  
when he looks at the elephant bride  
and the inaccessible ocean.  
From her curves and her heart magnify  
pastures of the earth.  
When you build like railroad track chirped by the fire.  
Where ships meet  
peaces meet, next to and around and the sound  
of bones, to reach out and wet in sorrow.  
Because I love you, love, outside  
the earth and around the sky.
