Meeting Your Dominion
---------------------
It's a upgrading productivity of clocks.  
They shattered it with blood-stained flower heads.  
The dove continuing from my toe.  
Because I love you, love, next to the jungle and outside the fire.  
Behind cinnamon water and deep brown films.  
Your quiver is a shades of sepia filled with bitten warmth of your body.  
  
My heart moves from being hairy to being iridescent.  
The celestial elixirs mourned the granule flies on its morose mare  
galloping marine pastures over the university.  
Propeller was no longer above the recording threshold.  
If I could wet the noise and the jungle.  
  
I am coddled by femininity and lineage, by dust and mist.  
The gentleman smiles at the mother  
but the man does not smile  
when he looks at the lobster bride  
and the inevitable ocean.
