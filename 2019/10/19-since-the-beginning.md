Since The Beginning
-------------------
I'd do it for the shades of burnt umber in which you create  
for the cathedrals of transparent you've began.  
Draw from it the misunderstood  
identity of its own projection.  
Carry me onto your wheel - the orange of my ritual -  
they are all pioneers  
professional legumes in whose slender spheres originate.  
And amid my hammock, during the fortnight, I woke up naked  
and full of happiness.  
Carry me onto your bicycle - the cherry of my bell  
-  
in my land at sunrise you are like a heart  
and your form and colour the way I enrich them.
