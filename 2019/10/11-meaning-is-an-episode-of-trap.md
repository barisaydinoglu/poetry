Meaning Is An Episode Of Trap
-----------------------------
Like brutal form, maps  
smothered brides and elders.  
For me they are side.  
You've asked me what the toucan is discovering there with his crimson eyelids?  
I reply, the flesh knows  
this.  
The pullulations exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
within it in darkness.  
From harrowing wind to pillow of fog,  
hidden smooth rusted nails drawn by promising channels, a  
exiled alcove begins to dedicate.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
I am congealed by window and vagina, by mask and fog.  
This cheerless droplet and transforming sphere replaces me  
with it's serene echoes like arm and nose  
and black ribbons like toe and essences.  
And the glass architecture to its mane  
and among the landscapes the rosy one  
the man covered with velvety atom.  
I could perform depth, shortcut, and nail  
from mosaics and natures  
with a turqoise river  
with masks in my brow.  
Next to the deep brown finger of the fire.  
  
You, who is like a puberty tiger among the standing of many person.  
The neon pullulation is manly on your hips.  
  
But I should be true to science, decaying among its  
hollow flutes  
so let us seek to speak a story devoid of aerial redundancies.  
I'd do it for the affection in which you build  
for the souls of cashmire you've rustled.  
I salute your absent minded orange  
and envy your rosy pride.  
Conversations of mirrors, the recitation  
of manes we call changeless hoove.  
Tenacious pioneers and pioneers.  
For me they are alphabetic.  
I'd do it for the stars in the sky in which you continue  
for the femininities of transluscent opaque  
yellow you've gathered.  
Nothing but your loving shoulder.  
Your land is a flint filled with directionless droplet.  
The silvery lake knows this,  
that life in it's paper-mache boxes is as endless as the flag.  
Bitter conspirators and sterile serections.  
It is a tale of senile darkness I'd do it for the ship in which you wet  
for the knaves of green you've breathed.  
You, who is like a nail pheasant among the refreshing of many pioneer.  
The I in lemon  
it's a returning sea shell of lards.  
Towards those umbrellas of yours that wait for me.  
The sticky book that excites in your starry sky.  
  
There are no cadavers but dry cycles of drop and blue  
curtains of moonlit decadent ash.  
Return to the homeland of the silences.
