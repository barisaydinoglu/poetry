Free Theories Of Flags
----------------------
Wave of wave of lights rolling down the sea.  
For a day, maybe million,  
I rested under a ocean wave  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the cousin to be in front of.  
You, who is  
like a gate turkey among the growing of many daughter.  
Lighthouse of a brainwashed negligent affection.  
The delicate woman  
expands in the original morning.  
Around the night I like to build like a rusted dove.  
Yellow walls of extinction,  
cashmire seams above a calculating light.  
And you pampered in the fear and carried a killing salt.  
  
Gather on the granules that wait for you  
scratching the shifty chairs, hating the doors.  
What protests the props of purity?
