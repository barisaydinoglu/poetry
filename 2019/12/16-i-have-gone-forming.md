I Have Gone Forming
-------------------
The late afternoon springtimes you in its mortal jungle.  
Not growing is a form of drinking.  
In the first scene, the human giant  
is undulated by a father. In the second  
take he returns, to pacify and to flutter.  
So the slender happiness lives on in a lemon,  
the unguessed house of the mane,  
the angellic coral that is cordial and brandishing.  
To seek another land a rain of schools and you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
dawn of souls and railroad tracks  
and the decisive waves of his native land?  
To seek another land silence me and let my substance refresh.  
In my divisions at day you are like a wave  
and your form and colour the way I inherit them.  
The sunrise alcoves you in its mortal electricity.  
  
I could develop oblivion, rotten stump, and jugular  
from promises and kisses  
with a blood colored mirror  
with twisting lonely roads in my foot.  
A candle galloping will kiss  
the inaccessible sky of a planet.
