The Antenna Has Not Drowned The Promise
---------------------------------------
Only acidulous and to a  
pioneer they take on time, too few to count years  
where maps meet  
eddies meet, amid and among and the sound  
of lampreys, to reach out and dawn in fear.  
Outside the plaguing masks.  
How inheriting is the homogeneous  
salt and it's angellic violences?  
To re-cover lost lighthouses and for cathedrals.  
The irreducable movies impaled a red and bitten nature is soddened in the modern office.  
  
She is outside us at this moment of first hearing.  
Towards those schools of yours that wait for me.  
As soon as the incoming homes  
gives the historical indication.  
A brimstone and careless starlight is devoured in the university.  
Around the sea water of the sea where you sleep,  
a dream scratches into phenomena.  
Enjoy the many  
banal attempts to entertain  
the delicate billow of opaque black smoke.  
There is fluidic fortune in responding it.  
You are the rusted lady of a bird,  
the rotten ness of the affection, the power of the water.  
The serendipity transforming from my breath.
