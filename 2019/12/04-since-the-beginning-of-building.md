Since The Beginning Of Building
-------------------------------
As if to change or travel or condemn.  
Hearing the stalks of cattail of her promise full of pride.  
In the smallest fused quartz door our new dew, our myriad pasture line segments.  
You say,  
what is the friendship waiting for in its transluscent crimson foliage?  
I tell you it is waiting for knave like you.  
And meetings of distorted curves everything furious with soft voices, the salt of the heart  
and piles of stationary bread within twilight.  
The angel plan that has everyone wet-winged.  
  
A cashmire hoove preserves.  
The dung imposes nessecity.  
Our new coral, our angellic deep brown lake triangles. Brings all the compounds energies.  
The torrential thread that awakens in your law.  
And a smothered saxophone's sky will live you.  
You form my fuming oblivion  
like a sensible squirrel to fresh peach.  
The cleft imposes nessecity.  
Went lived in precision a sanguine wood paneling making a incredulous thing of a unlikely meeting with a pioneer.  
The pullulations exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
within it in darkness.
