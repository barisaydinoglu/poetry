Camera Without The Receptacle
-----------------------------
Wayside imperfect ceramics and atrocious lards. Everything lethargic with fresh voices, the salt of the old warrior's medal  
and piles of irreducable bread among day.  
You - the wide eye.  
Marine imperfect ivories  
of imperfect cork,  
sunburst orange seams above a torrential promise.  
In the rust colored beligerance of the invasion.  
My heart moves from being dry to being hopeful.  
Multitude of umbrellas!  
In and out  
of the transluscent marine the blue and the green  
indicates the hat's creating brow.  
Winged empire. The line functions to imbue a system  
to its system.  
  
Of your rust colored aroma when you hold out your hand.  
The neurotic sea's skin is monastic on your eyeballs.  
  
Sometimes a piece of the clay  
executes like an affection in my breath.  
Among burnt umber water and  
burnt umber wells.  
I am passed by coat and explication, by polyp and wind.  
Which is a equinoctial sea shell of directions  
too many to count or twenty-seven, heard  
on a drop or in the natural stalks of cattail  
directions of the toe, a calculation in your tails.  
Attracting the peace of her landscape full of pride.  
Where suns meet  
branches meet, behind and behind and the sound  
of legless horses, to reach out and drink in sorrow.  
Not relinquishing is a form of breathing.
