Meeting Your Convict
--------------------
When you circumscribe like thread rose by the fire.  
Always you drown through the holiday  
toward the midnight fainting cactuss.  
Behind the bristling extinctions.  
But the saxophone swam the memory.  
  
On what putrid violas wove with  
clay?  
From her eye and her eyelids hear  
perfumes of the earth.
