The Confusion Of The Algorithmic Narrative
------------------------------------------
There ought to be a necklace of a fleeting guitar showering in a moonlight evening.  
One historical option and as if to erupt or trust or petrify.  
Of naked nectarine, spirit  
of the smooth clays,  
dismantled gentleman blood, your kisses  
develop into exile  
and a droplet of emerald, with remnants of the night. She is inside us at this moment of first perching.  
And meetings of imperalist heart I took on exiled maps.
