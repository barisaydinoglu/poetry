It Pacified With Railroad Tracks
--------------------------------
The boundless ripple gave it love. With the yellow heart of the heat.  
Hearing an angel  
mixed in the starry wind.  
A root focuses its dream of a new ending, its new ending, the old ending of the kis order -  
its naked cold fires.
