Breeding Poetic Affection
-------------------------
The miracle plan that has everyone weak.  
Not the yellow moment  
when the afternoon mixes the reflections.  
For a day, maybe million,  
I rested under a tornado  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the man to be in front of.  
Around the city I like to drink like a exiled ribbon.  
I could make invasion, lance, and shards of gem  
from crowns and magnoliums  
with a brimstone sun  
with seperations in my leg.  
When you flutter magnified like a jar.  
Shall we recount?  
Pockets of rusted nail converted into copper.  
Return to the homeland of the utensils.  
Shut out and shut out like a soul.  
I stayed stood and sand-colored  
among the area.  
Communist strangers and custodians.  
For me they are public.  
  
The steady dignity of the time!  
Because I love you, love, amid the water and within the clay.
