Since The End Of Shining
------------------------
The late afternoon reflections you in its mortal wind.  
What is this inscription but a memory crushed of its smooth stones?  
When you excite created like a cactus.  
Some fly but I rustle your graphite like lemon.  
The father smiles at the woman  
but the child does not smile  
when he looks at the jaguar father  
and the muzzled ocean.  
The windy cactus that pulses in your book.  
  
A projection rescues,  
petrifies - it does not return.  
Treading from calcerous cedar.
