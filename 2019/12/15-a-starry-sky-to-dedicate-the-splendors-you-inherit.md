A Starry Sky To Dedicate The Splendors You Inherit
--------------------------------------------------
I wish to make a tetrahedron  
outside, and every meaning, many  
times hidden in a foam.  
Always you kill through the twilight  
toward the day depriving lunars.  
Pockets of rusted nail converted into fused quartz.  
A triangle around a circle,  
the windy workings of enchanting law.
