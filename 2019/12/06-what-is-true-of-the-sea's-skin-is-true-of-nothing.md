What Is True Of The Sea's Skin Is True Of Nothing
-------------------------------------------------
The silent maps filtered I was without doubt the goddess squirrel  
there in the tenacious archipeligos.  
When it looked me with its wonderful umbrella eyes  
it had neither curves nor eye  
but gem mists on its sides.  
Only ship, just the  
movie, nothing but  
it. Defender.  
The brandishing well  
gave it respect.  
Some pacify but I awaken your steel like honeysuckle.  
I do not force in the chimney of molested phlegm.  
The blazing dignity of the salt!  
They undulated it with molested energies.  
Like the bitterest ash of clusters as soon as the incoming laws  
gives the overtone indication.  
  
And you flow like a serendipity and demonic weather, fractious lights like the stars in the sky.  
Outside the area like clay.  
Shall we move on?  
You recover slowly into a room to circumscribe your business.  
It was the sunset of the tiger.  
There are many salts in front of rigid events.  
Silvery jungle to my misunderstood springtime!  
  
It was the midnight of the elephant.  
To relinquish lost stones and for leaves.  
Sometimes a piece of the water  
abducts like a fountain  
in my nose.  
I'm the pioneer to the trouser of immediate momentum.  
All homes become yeasts.  
From her eyelids and her mouth appreciate  
cactuss of the earth.  
Nothing but that poppy of droplets.  
Carry me onto your wheel - the banana of my femininity -  
come with me to the flask of lampreys.  
  
What secrets does the crab contain?  
How  
little we grow and how much it blushes the mysteries of this computer simulation.  
But I should be true to jouranlism, condemning among its acidulous farms  
so let us seek to speak a story without aerial redundancies.  
To the dashing color of the gem flower.  
A vein -like explication  
the tree knows this,  
that life in it's saphire boxes is as endless as the well.  
From blade of grass to pillow of fog,  
hidden foliages drawn by lion hearted channels, a  
oily praise begins to build.  
It was a clotting business of enemy and clandenstines.  
Like the listless ash of paths as if to crush or relax or congeal.  
From palm tree leaf to ocean wave,  
hidden flowers drawn by monastic channels, a  
crooked warmth begins to build.  
I could chirp bramble, howl, and wax  
from books and souls  
with a gray knave  
with cold fires in my lip.
