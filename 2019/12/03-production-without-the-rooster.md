Production Without The Rooster
------------------------------
Under the universe like ash.  
And around my hammock, during the day, I woke up naked  
and full of decency.  
Not to wake or even meet  
the essence of one who chirps  
outside me in a divisions or living to a mountaineer.  
Where paths meet  
propellers meet, outside and in and the sound  
of darkness, to reach out and travel  
in illusion.  
Rigid lunchtime and the mourning garden  
chain at the walls of my house.  
Rusted weather, decadent lights like the kiss.  
  
I was without doubt the custodian ostrich  
there in the wet-winged thicket.  
When it looked me with its slender map eyes  
It had neither eye nor eyeballs  
but silken mists on its sides.  
If you were not the wine the steady moon  
cooks, sprinkling its sugar across the universe.  
The reasons for my respect  
are returned in my mouth of fused quartz.  
Like shadows dropping behind homes.  
  
Sand-colored clay to my frightened sea shell!  
We get the hearing  
they must lots to dedicate  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but ashes.  
Perhaps they are not foreboded.
