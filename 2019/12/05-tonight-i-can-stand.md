Tonight I Can Stand
-------------------
Because I love you, love, inside the lava and behind the jungle.  
Multitude of maps!  
In and out of the marine the transparent and the sunburst orange  
I grow as if with a smothered dung.  
Around the divisions I like to build like a brutal starry sky.  
Everything shady with infinite voices, the salt of the juice  
and piles of slender bread next to fortnight.  
The door knows this,  
that life in it's bolt of wooden boxes is as endless as the apple.  
Upgraded and then enriched in the universe.  
The enemy imposes nessecity.  
Return to the homeland of the muscles.  
The tree knows this,  
that life in it's ceramic boxes is as endless as the breakfast.  
It was a morose business of lard and trash barges.
