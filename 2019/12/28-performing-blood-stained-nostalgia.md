Performing Blood-stained Nostalgia
----------------------------------
Always you faint through the day  
toward the afternoon dying defenders.  
He is inside us at this moment of first developing.  
A signal for calculation is the lack thereof.  
In front of deep brown water and transluscent blue moons.  
Somebody here is waiting for the next garden.  
Flute. You sought yourself for imbuing.  
Only negligent and to a  
gentleman they take on time, thousand years  
the scrupulous person  
inherits in the myriad morning.  
Once  
there was a bitten custodian who  
fluttered at parties, sitting in a square, among starry skies.  
I am decayed by wave and bloodied ash, by rectum and sunshine.  
A signal begins,  
ignores - it does not return.  
Come with me to the jugular of hounds.  
There are many pamphlets in front of skeleton events.  
And the landscape to its starry sky  
and among the banners the human one  
the mountaineer covered with perfect railroad track.  
I'd do it for the smooth rusted nail in which you respond  
for the necklaces of sand-colored you've perched.  
You are the lemon of my crooked mouth.  
Has the land been flew with mysteries?
