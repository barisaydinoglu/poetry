The Antenna Called The Eyeballs
-------------------------------
Like fatherless wreath, prizes  
as soon as the incoming trees  
gives the neutral indication.  
What funny things does the elephant contain?  
How little we pacify and how much it seizes the secrets of this universe.  
The order of the maps you begin slowly into a region to imbue your business.  
The monastic starlights loitered bottle was no longer right at the transmission threshold.  
A triangle around a loop,  
the fractious workings of lyrical law.  
So the electric love  
lives on in a tomato,  
the electrical house of the kiss,  
the warm crown that is original and spacious.  
Not the silvery moment  
when the late afternoon begins the circuss.  
Around the silvery toe of the sky.  
Halfway.  
If you were not the sugar the essential moon  
cooks, sprinkling its plum across the archipeligos.  
Be guided by the delicate land's apple.  
  
I saw how splendors are wove  
by the careful praise.
