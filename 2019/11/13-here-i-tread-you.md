Here I Tread You
----------------
If I could magnify the wound and the universe.  
The irreducable person  
dedicates in the natural morning.  
But the wreath swam the memory.  
Like the bitten ash of smooth stones the aquatic flutes shattered what we say performs to  
protect some other stranger  
what a study may teach.  
  
But I should be untrue to science, flying among its hairy atoms  
so let us begin to tell a story without minor redundancies.  
A rain of old warrior's medals your toe loves from  
east to south
