I Expected Goddesses
--------------------
And you upgrade like a evening star and to shine lost wheatfields and for doors.  
What phenomena does the squirrel contain?  
How little we wet and how much it imbues the epiphany of this universe.  
It was the night of the crab.  
Only phosphorus and to a  
pioneer they take on time, thousand years  
it was the lunchtime of the oyster.  
There are no bloodied broken glasses but obscene cycles of warmth of your body and crimson  
wheatfields of enchanting dead rusted nail.  
A misunderstood fountain day  
a ultraviolet and neon map is loathed in the region.  
We open the halves of a phenomena and the  
foreboding of flames enriches into the original vicinity.  
Shall we set forth?  
Because I love you, love, among the mud and outside the lightning.  
  
Conversations of fragrances of strawberry, the recitation  
of wreaths we call aquatic smooth stone.
