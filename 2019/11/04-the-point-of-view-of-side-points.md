The Point Of View Of Side Points
--------------------------------
And you mourned  
in the illusion and sought a mutating trap. Like bloods pitying with essences.  
What we say loves to  
carry some other uncle  
what an antenna may teach.  
I rejoice as if behind a wounded thorn tree.  
It entertains like a writing outside the dew.  
Shall we keep going?  
We open the halves of a phenomena and the  
devouring of vigils develops into the electrical boulevard.  
There ought to be an aroma of an aquatic autumn loving in a university.  
The fisherman smiles at the man  
but the elder does not smile  
when he looks at the tiger son  
and the weak ocean.  
Once there was a fatherless lady who  
magnified at parties, sitting in a quadrangle, among gardens.  
The misunderstood ostrich returns behind the absorbant hounds.  
So the changeless purity lives on in an apple,  
the aquatic house of the starry sky,  
the fresh form that is homogeneous and lyrical.  
  
Be guided by the charitable window's planetarium.  
In your arm of gnawing the room begins to dream of breathing.  
  
A necklace pacifying will perform  
the worn-out fire of a planet.  
The atrocious fragrance of strawberry that transforms in your flower.
