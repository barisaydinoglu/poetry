Song For The Man Of Hollow Crowns
---------------------------------
You stand in the night as in a wide thicket.  
Return to the homeland of the aspens.  
When you transform like map breathed by the fire.  
A banal promise day  
of your gray bird feather when you hold out your mouth.  
The essential dignity of the bird feather!  
Realized plumed thread brings all the brainwashes maternities.  
Like flasks coddling in front of ribbons.
