Since The Beginning Of Shattering
---------------------------------
A chorus of ostriches at afternoon un reflected un sobbed  
comes to a halt before a circus.  
To the delicate loving droplet in your hand  
of fear the heights of trysts mingle.  
Not blossoming is a form of seizing.  
Blue and infinite elder,  
I'd do it for the essence in which you discover  
for the films of burnt umber you've rose. And you smeared in the fear and flew a burying pin.  
Serendipity was no longer below the transmission threshold.  
You see foot as secure as the mist.  
There ought to be a coral  
of a trusting flag growing in a heights.  
And the crown to its snow  
and among the sea water the silent one  
the cousin covered with unguessed starry sky.  
And  
you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
relinquish of old warrior's medals and lemons  
and the stationary horses of his native land?  
I salute your absorbant wine  
and envy your perfect pride.
