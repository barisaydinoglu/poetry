Uncles Of A Lonely Country
--------------------------
The wind monastic juices are froze.  
Neither mist nor well nor brimstone  
nor deep brown but  
blue.  
How circumscribing is the absent minded  
wax and it's sensible coffins?  
Carry me onto your train - the grape of my ship -  
imprison  
me and let my substance upgrade.  
Garden.  
Return to the homeland of the elixirs.  
I do not penetrate in the field of violenet consequence.  
What homogeneous promises -  
the boulevard is filled with it,  
gardens for the key and the cold emerald.  
The man smiles at the child  
but the bride does not smile  
when he looks at the pheasant goddess  
and the shady ocean.  
  
A machine creates,  
entangles - it does not return.  
On what smothered trash barges chirped with wind?  
  
You - the aromatic breath.  
A phenomenon for inscription is the lack thereof.
