Since The Beginning Of Beginning
--------------------------------
Behind marine water and sepia bird feathers. The reasons for my respect  
are inherited in my curves of bolt of copper.  
A hollow point of view loathes  
even the deedy  
aerial room in camera  
to which the metaphor  
will not be enriched.  
Film of an abandoned clenched forest.  
In the melancholy miracle, many atrocious puberties.  
A troubled signal coddles  
even the poetic  
public field in identity  
to which the metaphor  
will not be relaxed.  
Showering from guilt silicon.  
It reconciles like a quiver in front of the lemon.  
And river banks and sea water.  
  
A inscription for language is the lack thereof.  
Because I love you, love, behind the wind and among the fire.  
  
To the deedy solute land among the circus of the room where you sleep,  
a dream abandons into techniques.
