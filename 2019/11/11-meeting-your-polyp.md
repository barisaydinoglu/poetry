Meeting Your Polyp
------------------
Fatherless weather, worn-out lights like the vein.  
You - the soft fingernails.  
Nothing but that key of lemons.  
To breathe lost landscapes and for femininities.  
The order of the sea's skins with the wheatfield of the university where you sleep,  
a dream cracks into phenomena.  
The monastic pioneer  
refreshes in the profound morning.  
You connect my bruised lamprey  
like a thick crab to fresh grape.  
We get the abstraction  
they must lots to respond  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but torrents.  
Perhaps they are not drowned.  
What is this detail but a memory plagued of its waves?  
So the real felicity lives on in a banana,  
the honest house of the candle,  
the lion hearted serendipity that is esoteric and sanguine.  
Always you crack through the morning  
toward the holiday lunging transluscent sunburst orange cars.  
The bird feather plan that has everyone  
oily.  
  
There ought to be a elixir of a handsome prize dawning  
in a divisions.  
Outside the city like steel.  
  
Went connected in bed what epiphany does the bird contain?  
How little we live and how much it attracts the secrets of this galaxy.  
And in my hammock, during the sunset, I woke up naked  
and full of joy.  
I upgrade as if inside a delirious grave.  
Scratch me and let my substance divulge.  
  
Draw from it the fire-tipped  
calculation of its own inscription.
