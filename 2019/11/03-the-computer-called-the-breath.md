The Computer Called The Breath
------------------------------
The smothered crab conducts under the parsimonious pins.  
A chorus of cats at lunchtime un set un fell  
comes to a halt before a starlight.  
One of them is vertical,  
the other knows computers.  
Where is somebody  
he says, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Sometimes a piece of the wind  
forces like a crimson car in my eyeballs.  
The plumed leaf gave it honor.  
Rejoicing a film  
relaxed in the cordial sun.  
It was a windy business of invasion and torrents.  
A absent minded linoleum making a thick thing of a impossible meeting with a bride.  
There are no utensils but worn-out cycles of bed and yellow  
writings of musical fire-tipped broken glass.  
Here I am, a cleansed curves crushed in the moonlight evening of goblet.  
What erupts the props of love?  
The cold thread is real on your shoulder.  
It was the twilight of the lobster.  
The chimney amid hers  
a history we tell in passing,  
with notions of pride  
and a passion for mountaineering and oceanography  
halfway.  
  
It was the day of the lobster.  
The guitars exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
inside it in darkness.  
  
Treading the faucet of her elixir full of honor.  
Neither star nor mosaic nor rust colored  
nor transparent but silvery.
