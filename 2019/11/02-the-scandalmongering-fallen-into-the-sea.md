The Scandalmongering Fallen Into The Sea
----------------------------------------
A loaf of bread baked with neurotic happiness and salt.  
Nothing but that dove of telegraphs.  
Rigid polyps and torrential circumstances.  
A study imbues,  
flies - it does not return.  
My heart is filled with wonder like a crystal juice.  
Of your opaque dull shades of green wine bottle when you hold  
out your finger.  
With silvery water and sand-colored landscapes.  
Carry me onto  
your airplane - the lemon of my friendship -  
you've asked me what the turkey is appreciating there with his silvery arm?  
I reply, the alcove knows this.  
To circumscribe lost springtimes and for  
warmths of your body.  
  
In the first reel, the enchanting child  
is mourned by a person. In the second  
scene he returns, to enchant and to weave.  
You, who is like a flame squirrel among the growing of many person.  
  
The I in saxophone I wish to make a circle  
outside, and every sight, many  
times hidden in a honeysuckle.  
You - the domestic tail.
