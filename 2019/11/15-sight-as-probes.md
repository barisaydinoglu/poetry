Sight As Probes
---------------
A frail signal steals  
even the gleaming  
minor land in identity  
to which the metaphor  
will not be inherited.  
I could wet rectum, vinegar, and wound  
from lands and roots  
with a blood colored umbrella  
with abyss in my eyeballs.  
A gray and lonely nature is entangled in the jungle.  
You kiss headlong into an archipeligos to seek your business.  
I was without doubt the father tiger  
there in the mechanical room.  
When it looked me with its plumed sun eyes  
it had neither nose nor ears  
but copper sea's skins on its sides.  
Star of a died lethargic farm.
