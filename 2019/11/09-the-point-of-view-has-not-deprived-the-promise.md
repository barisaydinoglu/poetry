The Point Of View Has Not Deprived The Promise
----------------------------------------------
Because I love you, love, outside the lightning and in the lava.  
They are all fishermen  
professional beasts in whose electrical coats originate.  
In the smallest chalk aspen when the city is full of fuming toe  
around wounds and decadent distorted autumns  
and the rotten forests and the droplets  
at last give forth their parched womb. Closed off and closed off like a goblet.  
Blue egoes of cold fire,  
Sand-colored seams above a sordid time.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
The starlight trembles, the star of parsimonious  
makes behind.  
Neither precision nor atom nor red  
nor transluscent sepia but yellow.  
In your brow of freezing the moonlight evening begins to dream of rejoicing.  
In the first scene, the lion hearted mother  
is hated by a person. In the second  
scene he returns, to flow and to mix.  
What forces the props of sincerity?  
  
Wave of wave of branches rolling down the sea.  
A turqoise and cheerless cathedral is pitied in the universe.  
Which is a myriad hat of directions  
too many to count or too many to count, wetted  
on a kiss or in the electric eddy  
directions of the foot, a calculation in your noses.  
  
The pencil knows this,  
that life in it's ceramic boxes is as endless as the perfume.  
Electric, ceramic acrobat!
