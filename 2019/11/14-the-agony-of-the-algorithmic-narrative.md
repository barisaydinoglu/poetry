The Agony Of The Algorithmic Narrative
--------------------------------------
Carry me onto your vessel - the cherry of my awe -  
to the secure color of the cork poppy.  
To seek another land you crystallize in the divisions as in a hidden city.  
A sunshine of elixirs draw from it the shifty  
computer of its own image.  
They are all ladies  
professional daggers in whose steady bottles originate.  
Went showered in aroma  
she is against us at this moment of first promising.  
Wave of wave of precisions rolling down the sea.  
I could breathe jackal, extinction, and moth  
from roots and warmths  
with a black evening star  
with parallel massacress in my lip.  
A warm rug making a musical thing of a lucky meeting with a cousin.  
Closed off and shut out like a praise.
