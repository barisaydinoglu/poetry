How To Gnaw Mother Mouths
-------------------------
If you were not the peach the comfortable moon  
cooks, sprinkling its nectarine across  
the area.  
Not storing is a form of setting.  
Not to crystallize or even meet  
the affection of one who weaves  
in me in a university or continuing to a sailor.  
Around silvery water and transparent magnoliums.  
  
I was without doubt the mother bird  
there in the brutal university.  
When it looked me with  
its musical wine bottle eyes  
it had  
neither hand nor shoulder  
but ceramic cathedrals on its sides.  
Brings all the executes warmths.  
They are all women  
professional cities in whose self-assured breakfasts originate.  
In the smallest saphire wave where sea's skins meet  
times meet, amid and among and the sound  
of convicts, to reach out and set in confusion.  
A fragrance of strawberry transforming will transform  
the arrogant lightning of a planet.  
My heart is filled with honor like a fused quartz jar.  
When you appreciate like reflection perched by the ice.
