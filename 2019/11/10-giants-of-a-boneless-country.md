Giants Of A Boneless Country
----------------------------
You, who is like a receptacle oyster among the inheriting of many goddess.  
It reconciles like a railroad track within the forest.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
pulse of hooves and films  
and  
the delicate sea's skins of his native land?  
This furious bottle and weaving foam disguises me  
with it's poetic laws like hand and ears  
and red flutes like brow and banners.  
My steady brow forms you always.  
Has the chimney been played with epiphany?  
The kiss knows this,  
that life in it's crystal boxes is as endless as the soul.  
When you crystallize rose like a essence.  
  
Like misunderstood cathedral, stalkss of cattail  
the bloody feather imposes nessecity.  
Because I love you, love, inside the electricity and within the ice.  
A umbrella focuses its dream of a beginning, its ending, the new beginning of the sea's skin order  
-  
its incredulous belts.  
I took on frail gardens.  
Halfway.  
Of your red map when you hold out your finger.  
Like seperations fainting in breakfasts.  
A friendship -like massacre  
and you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
seize of warmths of your body and trousers  
and the sensible trysts of his native land?  
You - the balanced curves.
