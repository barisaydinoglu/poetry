A Book To Travel The Magnoliums You Begin
-----------------------------------------
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the enduring femininities?  
And the clouds steady splattering its cinnamon cars and  
filtering them full of  
chimney and elephant?  
Outside the cinnamon finger of the jungle.  
In the face of so many shardss of emerald to functionality.  
Some return but I drink your brick like map.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
Of a brimstone bride that plays clusters.  
  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
Like dry droplet, lakes  
a line segment in a triangle,  
the nauesous workings of domestic law.  
Phemonana was no longer below the transmission threshold.  
The cluster plan that has everyone whirlwinds of.  
I want you to rustle  
on my leg.  
Someone here is waiting for the next shades of opaque opaque burnt umber.  
Thread. You perfumed yourself for reconciling.  
Beginning from insufferable marble.  
I saw how roses are appreciated  
by the delicious thread.  
Pure ash breathes the pencils and bird feathers and trysts.  
  
A brimstone and disordered autumn is penetrated in the thicket.  
Inside the silvery toe of the heat.  
The sunset drops you in its mortal lava.  
Which is a romantic shades of crimson of directions  
million or twenty-seven, discovered  
on a flesh or in the warm bottle  
directions of the ears, a calculation in your curvess.
