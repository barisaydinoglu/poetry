Your Brain Is Enough
--------------------
Within the brimstone sorrow of the explication.  
Anger and dove - hearts of fear.  
One algorithmic option and if I could flow the heart and the room.  
And so that its felicities will deprive your eyelids.  
I took on mechanical elixirs.  
Neither productivity nor mane nor dark  
nor transluscent burnt umber but green.  
I am bristled by telegraph and conspirator, by puberty and sun.  
For a day, maybe thousand,  
I rested under a uncomfortable turbulence  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the mother to be among.  
Like imperfect coppers forcing next to productivities.  
Return to the homeland of the telegraphs.  
Your cactus is a knave filled with hushed laminated sign.  
And the cluster to its aroma  
and among the keys the cosmic one  
the goddess covered with ancient essence.  
Against the crooked vicinity of ironous snow.  
Of your rust colored hat when you hold  
out your breath.  
From  
her eye and her hand magnify  
landscapes of the earth.  
Defender was no longer right at the transmission threshold.  
What mutates the props of joy?  
You crystallize in the modern office as in a incredulous chimney.
