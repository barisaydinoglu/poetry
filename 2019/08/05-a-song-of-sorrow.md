A Song Of Sorrow
----------------
To awaken lost fellowships and for affections.  
Once there was a clotting fisherman who  
stood at parties, sitting in a circle, among femininities.  
How blossoming is the fleeting hound and it's brandishing wounded soldiers?  
A loaf of bread baked  
with careless pride and salt.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
Transparent salivas of uranu,  
opaque deep brown seams above an arrogant  
quilt.  
  
Carry me onto your ship - the cherry of my ritual -  
I was without doubt the one elephant  
there in the decadent field.  
When it looked me with its lyrical circus eyes  
it had neither eyelids nor arm  
but paper-mache horses on its sides.  
I saw how mosaics are connected  
by the parsimonious evening star.  
Not protecting is a form of blossoming.  
Only calcerous and to a  
stranger they take on time, too few to count years  
what seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
  
If I could enrich the vigil and the university.  
Like corruptions bristling outside gardens.  
What curiosities does the bird contain?  
How little we mix and how much it plays the secrets of this universe.  
If I could wet the howl and the field.  
Like whispers scratching next to sea shells.  
Be guided by the unguessed warmth of your body's river bank.  
  
Electrical empire. The quadrangle functions to transform  
an architecture  
to its system.  
And around my hammock, during the fortnight, I woke up naked  
and full of honor.
