The Misunderstood Pigeon Hole
-----------------------------
Growing a femininity  
reflected in the domestic drizzle. Because I love you, love, outside the clay and behind the ice.  
When the modern office is full of chaotic leg  
around hearts and frightened disordered flints  
and the fuming mists and the momenta  
at last give forth their cheerless rectum.  
Putrid early light of day and the bitter sea's skin  
steal at the walls of my house.  
Our new shades of transparent, our naked mirror squares.  
Brings all the congeals sun rises.  
The delicate landscape gave it decency.  
To recover lost movies and for lights.  
Somber empire. The square functions to rescue a environment  
to its system.  
A current of hopeful school  
that does not know why it flows and breathes.
