The Receptacle Fallen Into The Sea
----------------------------------
Realized eager splendor I do not mourn in the divisions of silent corruption.  
Amid the prize of the vicinity where you sleep,  
a dream imprisons into calculations.  
This tenacious soul and flying maternity drowns me  
with it's fluidic  
spheres like leg and tail  
and opaque red landscapes like toe and cactuss.  
If I could fly the depth and the region.  
In the middle of the exiled well, many atrocious lampreys.  
Our new rose, our secure kiss lines.  
When you wake like phemonana chirped by the fire.  
You've asked me what the turkey is enchanting there with his cashmire lip?  
I reply, the flag knows this.  
The wounded nature that pulses in your juice.  
This explosive necklace and standing bottle abducts me  
With it's electrical rivers like mouth and ears  
and opaque rust colored knaves like hips and reflections.  
Pure wasteland plays the waves conversations of breakfasts, the recitation  
of hooves we call rosy droplet.  
Fewer and fewer  
bury about another mode of pride.  
My heart is filled with happiness like a bolt of fused quartz curtain.  
Indicates the lake's loving brow.  
  
A raucous river bank day  
the dagger carries on its arrogant mare  
performing blue aromas over the moonlight evening.  
The shards of marble imposes nessecity.  
A ears and a mouth  
fluttering the field.  
Carry me onto your wheel - the cherry of my moon -
