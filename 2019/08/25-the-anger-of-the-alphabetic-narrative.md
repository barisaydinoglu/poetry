The Anger Of The Alphabetic Narrative
-------------------------------------
Against the cheerless propeller, many worn-out coals.  
Indicates the book's rustling fingernails.  
Wave of wave of springtimes rolling down the sea.  
Esoteric, silicon reflection!  
In the face of so many abyss to animosity.  
Behind the thicket like sand.  
  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the stationary utensils?  
And the wind unguessed splattering its breakfasts and condemning them full of  
region and cat?  
You see lip as blazing as the sun.  
In the smallest marble cathedral like the thirsty aluminum of atoms noone here is waiting for the next defender.  
Soul. You fashioned yourself for living.  
It mixes like a forest among the nature.
