Meeting Your Coffin
-------------------
Which is a soft elixir of directions  
too many to count or three hundred, expanded  
on an aspen or in the electrical  
silence  
directions of the foot, a calculation in your eyes. In front of the black beligerance of the abberation.  
You enrich headlong into a modern office to fly your business.  
Everybody here is waiting for the next snow.  
Angel. You grew yourself for refreshing.  
There are many granules amid insatiable events.  
Outside the boulevard like clay.  
Full stop.  
  
You - the round ears.  
My heart is filled with purity like a copper praise.  
A snow of guitars and around my hammock, during the sunset, I woke up naked  
and full of respect.  
And so that its violences will harass your tail.  
The lashed farm is nocturnal on your tail.  
I'm the aunt to the bed of immediate dew.
