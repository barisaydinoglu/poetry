Breeding Spacious Affection
---------------------------
The apple discovering from my lip.  
From her breath and her curves pulse  
ribbons of the earth.  
I do not fall in the jungle of distorted bramble.  
On what tear stained pigeon holes chirped with wind?  
Daughter of the depths of my hips - your seizing  
stills your acerb regard as though it were heat.  
I took on skeleton branches.  
Necklace.  
Your fellowship is an affection filled with fatherless mane.  
Sometimes a piece of the ice  
congeals like a root in my curves.  
As soon as the incoming farms  
gives the slightest  
indication.  
Pure cummerbund continues the threads and you twisted in the agony and heard a falling cubicle.  
I stayed discovered and burnt umber  
among the region.
