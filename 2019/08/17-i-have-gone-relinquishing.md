I Have Gone Relinquishing
-------------------------
A helicopter is not enough to gnaw me and keep me  
from the chimney of your sensible funny things.  
My heart moves from being wet-winged to being parenthetical.  
A marine muscle flutters.  
Only awe, just the  
path, nothing but  
it. Wine bottle.  
Towards those paths of yours that wait for me.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
weave of currents and lemons  
and the balanced deep brown lakes of his native land?  
Shaken sunrise and the fractious blue car  
force at the walls of my house.  
My heart is filled with happiness like a gold utensil.  
Cashmire pins of cubicle,  
opaque transluscent sunburst orange seams above a dilute snow.  
There ought to be a flint of a natural tryst upgrading in a room.  
  
Everything oily with parsimonious voices, the salt of the landscape  
and piles of warm bread amid lunchtime.  
I am mourned by dove and hole, by legless horse and fog.
