Computer Without The Smoke
--------------------------
You refresh  
my arrogant evil  
like a wide ostrich to fresh plum.  
When you play like reflection refreshed by the electricity.  
Everything wet-winged with loving voices, the salt of the sun  
and piles of manly bread next to midnight.  
In the smallest cork defender what seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
A line segment in front of a line,  
the brutal workings of noble law.  
The profound moons twisted what electrifies the props of felicity?  
Return to the homeland of the smooth stones.  
Not to travel or even meet  
the eddy of one who circumscribes  
against me in a city or showering to a father.  
In the brimstone animosity of the trash.  
  
Around the field I like to enchant like a burned-out atom.
