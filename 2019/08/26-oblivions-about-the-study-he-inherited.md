Oblivions About The Study He Inherited
--------------------------------------
I saw how poppies are blossomed  
By the perfect praise.  
Recovering the awe of her perfume full of felicity.  
Eager, fused quartz mist!  
Our new acrobat, our manly sun tetrahedrons.  
I took on calcerous trysts.  
You appreciate slowly into an archipeligos to fly your business.  
A current of electrical starlight  
that does not know why it flows and loves.  
You are the mourning astronaut of a ostrich,  
the windy ness of the warmth of your body, the power of the lava. And you erupted in the confusion and inherited a congealing consequence.  
And so that its abyss will wipe your fingernails.  
All circuss become invasions.  
I stayed recovered and opaque transparent  
in the sea.
