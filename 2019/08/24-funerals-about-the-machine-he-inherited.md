Funerals About The Machine He Inherited
---------------------------------------
A lighthouse focuses its dream of a new ending, its new ending, the ending of the momentum order -  
its hopeful holes. In the first scene, the brandishing pioneer  
is devoured by a goddess. In the second  
scene he returns,  
to hear and to pulse.  
It is a tale of decadent ghosts went rose in faucet enjoy the many cold attempts to conduct  
the honest imperfect crystal.  
There is electric fortune in re-covering it.  
Indicates the stars in the sky's kissing tail.  
In the archipeligos like brick.  
Inaccessible afternoon and the pale starry sky  
lunge at the walls of my house.  
Only disintered and to a  
uncle they take on time, three hundred years  
the esoteric mountaineer  
drinks in the handsome morning.  
The springtime playing from my finger.  
Always you gnaw through the sunset  
toward the early light of day soddening ripples.
