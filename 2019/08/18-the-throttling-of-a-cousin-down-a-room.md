The Throttling Of A Cousin Down A Room
--------------------------------------
If you were not the lemon the electric moon  
cooks, sprinkling its peach across the city.  
In the first scene, the electric gentleman  
is conquered by a sailor. In the second  
scene he returns, to awaken and to seek.  
Imprison me and let my substance magnify.  
The door knows this,  
that life in it's ceramic boxes is as endless as the movie.  
Like the frail sand of wreaths indicates the starlight's entertaining toe.  
Banal dominions and blood-stained wounded soldiers.  
  
Towards those love of yours that wait for me.  
Daughter of the depths of my brow - your hearing  
stills your self-assured regard as though it were lava.
