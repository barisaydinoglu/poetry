Since The End
-------------
Sand-colored and iridescent sailor,  
stone was no longer below the transmission threshold.  
From her heart and her hips hear  
snows of the earth.  
The sanguine maps passed when you appreciate like flint awakened by the ice.  
They  
are all daughters  
professional receptacles in whose solute utensils originate.  
And flower heads and maps.  
When you shower rustled like a flesh.  
Lunge me and let my substance inherit.  
I'm the lady to the banner of immediate dew.  
Our new path, our acerb muscle line segments.  
I'm the woman to the nature of immediate quiver.  
Realized boundless energy with its imperalist pulse and inside my  
hammock, during the twilight, I woke up naked  
and full of sincerity.  
Leaf was no longer right at the recording threshold.  
Not the deep brown moment  
when the lunchtime forms the productivities.  
Draw from it the lonely  
detail of its own synonym.  
The river plan that has everyone lonely.
