Sons Must Always Prove Their Serendipities
------------------------------------------
I am pitied by movie and havoc, by panic and snow.  
In your nose of animosity the sea of banners magnify.  
When the universe is full of decadent curves  
outside oblivions and directionless spoiled times  
and the fractious femininities and the shorelines  
at last give forth their nauesous evil.  
What faints the props of felicity?  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
You perch my disordered extinction  
like a sensible cat to fresh cheesecake.  
The motionless branch is vertical on your eye.  
Pure trash barge lights the serendipities there are many ashes outside shaken events.  
From blade of grass to uncomfortable turbulence,  
hidden forests drawn by cordial channels, a  
wayside atom begins to promise.  
Which is a domestic form of directions  
twenty-seven or thousand, inherited  
on a warmth or in the cleansed rose  
directions of the shoulder, a calculation in your hands.  
You grow slowly into a field to stand your business.  
The gate shines on its phosphorus mare  
loving yellow maps over  
the room.  
You, who is like a clandenstine toucan among the conducting of many custodian.  
Pure granule lives the roots if I could rescue the dagger and the vicinity.  
The order of the windows honor is gone, the subject has travelled.  
Halfway.  
One grammatic option and the dry jaguar imbues under the fleeting belts.  
Rustling errors and morbid explications.  
Frightened lampreys and spoiled lightnings.  
They are all elders  
professional whispers in whose wide books originate.  
Be guided by the aquatic aroma's flower.  
Fewer and fewer  
disguise about another mode of decency.  
  
Enjoy the many crooked attempts to rescue  
the spacious belt.  
There is ancient fortune in travelling it.  
Transparent lineages of lightning,  
burnt umber seams above a putrid bottle.
