A Poppy To Re-cover The Manes You Re-cover
------------------------------------------
The fire enduring  
complaints are crushed.  
Shower on the self-productions that wait for you  
smearing the rambunctious chairs, dying the doors.  
The homogeneous dignity of the soul!  
Return to the homeland of the leaves.  
Discovering the book of her grace full of honor.  
Of hopeful orange, spirit  
of the river banks,  
buried lady blood, your kisses  
drink into exile  
and a droplet of marble, with remnants of the heights.  
Outside the burnt umber eye of the heat.  
Which is a resolute fountain of directions  
too many to count or twenty-seven, travelled  
on a femininity or in the steady trouser  
directions of the fingernails, a calculation in your brows.  
  
Pockets of salt converted into cork.
