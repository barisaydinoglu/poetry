Outside Of Window And Fragrance Of Strawberry
---------------------------------------------
Honor is gone, the subject has returned.  
But I should be true to science, wiping among its oily foliages  
so let us attempt to speak a story devoid of minor redundancies.  
Towards those flints of yours that wait for me.  
You create my shaken shortcut  
like a gleaming cat to fresh bread.  
Under the barbaous jungle of rotten praise.  
What rosy drops -  
the land is filled with it,  
sweetness for the warmth and the decadent paper-mache.  
  
A bird feather focuses its dream of a old ending, its  
new beginning, the old ending of the root order -  
its honest  
hounds.  
A train is not enough to bury me and keep me  
from the field  
of your careful funny things.
