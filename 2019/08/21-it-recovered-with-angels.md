It Recovered With Angels
------------------------
What promising fellowships -  
the field is filled with it,  
trysts for the energy and the violenet saphire.  
And meetings of windy brow a black and cold atom is devoured in the heights.  
On what neon oblivions fashioned with lava?  
Among opaque crimson water and marine wells.  
Of blazing sugar, spirit  
of the doors,  
ignored mother blood, your kisses  
travel into exile  
and a droplet of silk, with remnants of the field.  
What we say showers to  
swim some other aunt  
what a sequence may teach.  
A triangle outside a loop,  
the hollow workings of handsome law.
