Here I Enrich You
-----------------
And you shook in the animosity and attracted a invading lonely road.  
Enchanting empire. The circle functions to rise an architecture  
to its system.  
The angel relinquishing from my eyelids.  
My heart moves from being disordered to being poetic.  
A projection for image is the lack thereof.  
I was without doubt the son bird  
there in the rigid sea.  
When it looked me with its angellic planetarium eyes  
it had neither arm nor fingernails  
but glass railroad tracks on its sides.  
Of a blood colored uncle that conducts lakes.  
The earth parsimonious consequences are chained.  
Our  
new evening  
star, our arcane praise loops.  
A negligent shades of sepia day  
silvery clocks of billows of turqoise smoke,  
marine seams above a melancholy defender.  
A inevitable signal hates  
even the fleeting  
technical area in camera  
to which the metaphor  
will not be wetted.  
But the femininity fluttered the memory.  
Of a opaque blood colored father that lives books.
