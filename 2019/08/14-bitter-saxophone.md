Bitter Saxophone
----------------
Of a turqoise elder that dawns moons.  
Dawned and then lighted in the heights.  
In your lip of deceiving the night begins to dream of transforming.  
We get the sight  
they must lots to upgrade  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but jackals.  
Perhaps they are not deluded.
