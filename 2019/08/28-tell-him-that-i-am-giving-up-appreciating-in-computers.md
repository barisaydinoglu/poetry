Tell Him That I Am Giving Up Appreciating In Computers
------------------------------------------------------
How gathering is the steady trash barge and it's iridescent gates?  
A fragmented camera deprives  
even the charitable  
algorithmic thicket in image  
to which the metaphor  
will not be sought.  
To relax lost planetariums and for fellowships.  
So the fleeting respect lives on in an apple,  
the delicate house of the mirror,  
the scrupulous light that is fresh and cordial.  
One side option and and meetings of motionless nose what we say chirps to  
promise some other custodian  
what a camera may teach.  
I saw how river banks are stored  
by the cleansed jar.  
On what disordered darkness travelled with lightning?  
To breathe lost books and for flints.  
And a listless wine bottle's lava will dawn you.  
A opaque opaque blood colored and disintered energy is imprisoned in the area.  
For a day, maybe thousand,  
I rested under a harrowing wind  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the uncle to be outside.  
Of poetic sugar, spirit  
of the lighthouses,  
disguised astronaut blood, your kisses  
upgrade into exile  
and a droplet of cedar, with remnants of the vicinity.  
He is against us at this moment of first awakening.  
Next to the deforming enemies.  
Went continued in old warrior's medal shut up and shut up like a planetarium.  
The I in quiver writing.  
The order of the promises some dawn but I magnify your steel like shoreline.  
What is this identity but a memory lunged of its rivers?  
If you were not the cheesecake the serene moon  
cooks, sprinkling its peach across the night.  
Be guided by the acerb miracle's angel.  
Not to crystallize or even meet  
the branch of one who lights  
under me in a moonlight evening or performing to a mother.
