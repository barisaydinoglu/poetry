Tonight I Can Re-cover
----------------------
Against the sticky map, many neurotic gates.  
Of your blood colored flag when you hold out your curves.  
Always you bury through the sunrise  
toward the fortnight congealing windows.  
Cinnamon clay to my rotten time!  
My heart moves from being tremulous to being comfortable.  
It awakens like a time in the dove.  
  
The thick mother  
protects in the trusting morning.  
You form in the thicket as in a steady night.
