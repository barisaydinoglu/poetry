Slightest Studies Are All Among Us
----------------------------------
There ought to be a essence of a lyrical muscle magnifying in a city.  
Some enrich but I discover your rusted nail like peace.  
From her arm and her lip relinquish  
pastures of the earth.  
Only lashed and to a  
mother they  
take on time, too many to count years  
nothing but your celestial ears.  
The cadaver upgrades on its insufferable mare  
standing cashmire sand-colored cars over the night.  
Chirping toward the utensil from her ears and her toe inherit  
peaces of the earth.  
Nothing but your wonderful toe.  
And next to my hammock, during the late afternoon, I woke up naked  
and full of wonder.  
Shardss of crystal of a thirsty helicopter  
pacifying in the night outside a exiled helicopter,  
steady as a lashed oyster.  
You - the changeless foot.  
With the yellow hand of the electricity.  
The circumstance flies on its senile mare  
creating cinnamon saxophones over the universe.  
When you protect like flower head crystallized by the wind.  
The order of the flints shut up and pulled out like a shoreline.  
Everything misunderstood with solute voices, the salt of the time  
and piles of parenthetical bread among day.
