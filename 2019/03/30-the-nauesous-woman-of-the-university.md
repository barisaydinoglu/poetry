The Nauesous Woman Of The University
------------------------------------
From palm tree leaf to unrelenting rain,  
hidden sea water drawn by charitable channels, a  
smothered crown begins to upgrade.  
In the smallest cork current one overtone option and what spacious alcoves -  
the modern office is filled with it,  
coats for the guitar and the distorted saphire.  
Not the deep brown moment  
when the sunset forms the sea's skins.  
Always you dismantle through the holiday  
toward the sunrise entangling keys.  
Some gallop but I promise your clay like river bank.  
To the wonderful color of the gold time.  
The naked woman  
relinquishes in the esoteric morning.  
I'd do it for the movie in which you recover  
for the juices of crimson you've imbued.  
  
Closed off and shut up like a reflection.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the lion hearted evening stars?  
And the fog nocturnal splattering its flowers and pampering them full of  
thicket and lobster?  
My silent ears weaves you always.  
Which is a noble miracle of directions  
too many to count or thousand, reconciled  
on a stone or in the electrical springtime  
directions of the eye, a calculation in your hearts.  
  
You - the serendipidous finger.
