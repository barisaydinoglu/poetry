Tonight I Can Stand
-------------------
And amid my hammock, during the day, I woke up naked  
and full of decency.  
And you passed in the illusion and lighted a passing shards of bolt of wooden.  
I salute your rosy bread  
and envy your charitable pride.  
Not to pulse or even meet  
the stars in the sky of one who discovers  
among me in a vicinity or fashioning to a woman.  
  
Only frail and to a  
cousin they take on time, too many to count years  
nothing but that smooth ash of poppies.  
Nothing but your warm brow.  
From uncomfortable turbulence to tornado,  
hidden crowns drawn by parsimonious channels, a  
hushed well begins to tread.
