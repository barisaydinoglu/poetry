The Identity Has Not Invaded The Promise
----------------------------------------
One neutral option and not crystallizing is a form of playing.  
I'm the aunt to the river bank of immediate splendor.  
Marine wind to my demonic eddy!  
She is among us at this moment of first  
protecting.  
Perched and then gathered in the heights.  
The legless horse imposes nessecity.  
  
You've asked me what the turkey is rejoicing there with his burnt umber leg?  
I reply, the candle knows this.  
A hand and a shoulder  
connecting the room.
