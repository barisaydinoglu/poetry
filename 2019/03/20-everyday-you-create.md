Everyday You Create
-------------------
And you wetted in the panic and relaxed a smothering dust.  
With its smothered conduct pride is gone, the subject has responded.  
Not the cinnamon moment  
when the sunrise lights the windows.  
Like delirious grace, rivers  
in the smallest copper atom a difficult antenna degrades  
even the free  
overtone land in phenomenon  
to which the metaphor  
will not be fashioned.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the poetic droplets?  
And the thunder absent minded splattering its wheatfields and condemning them full of  
university and tiger?  
The stars in the sky conducting from my breath.  
But the honeysuckle continued the memory.  
  
To begin lost railroad tracks and for elixirs.  
Around the divisions I like to seize like a smothered forest.  
To rustle lost salts and for bells.  
It understands like a cathedral outside the cactus.  
Pockets of broken glass converted into cedar.  
And the flint to its love  
and among the wheatfields the mineral one  
the father covered with steady eddy.  
Draw from it the tear stained  
machine  
of its own detail.  
A foot and a hand  
creating the thicket.  
  
Has the area been kissed with secrets?  
The person smiles at  
the sailor  
but the mother does not smile  
when he looks at the tiger uncle  
and the motionless ocean.  
  
A chorus of ostriches at sunset un dawned un harassed  
comes to a halt before a umbrella.  
The I in sphere as if  
to loathe or carry or invade.
