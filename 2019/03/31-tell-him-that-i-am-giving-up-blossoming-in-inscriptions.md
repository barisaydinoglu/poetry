Tell Him That I Am Giving Up Blossoming In Inscriptions
-------------------------------------------------------
I took on senile silences.  
But the faucet shone the memory.  
Not the blue moment  
when the day hears the mosaics.  
Everything melancholy with promising voices, the salt of the peace  
and piles of affluent bread around night.  
In the nauesous room of arrogant pencil.  
You say, what is the mirror waiting for in its transparent moon?  
I tell you it is waiting for faucet like you.  
  
You excite in the chimney as in a dashing boulevard.  
Nothing but that quilt of pastures.
