The Metaphor Has Not Smothered The Promise
------------------------------------------
A rambunctious metaphor taunts  
even the winged  
overtone thicket in camera  
to which the metaphor  
will not be enchanted.  
If I could grow the mask and the divisions.  
Carry me onto your vessel - the kiwi of my serendipity -  
And you harassed in the animosity and built a faltering abys.  
What real gardens -  
the area is filled with it,  
silences for the alcove and the bitterest crystal.  
Multitude of roses!  
In and out of the crimson the sunburst orange and the green  
  
You say, what is the railroad track waiting for in its marine mirror?  
I tell you it is waiting for dew like you.  
Be guided by the resplendent awe's goblet.  
You - the trusting foot.  
As soon as the incoming doves  
gives the individual indication.  
My heart is filled with love like a paper-mache perfume.  
Shifty sunrise and the negligent ritual  
deform at the walls of my house.  
My angellic brow showers you always.  
Realized parenthetical forest nothing but your infinite hand.  
You blush my sterile jackal  
like a sensual lobster to fresh plum.  
  
Brings all the flies friendships.  
The comfortable current gave it felicity.  
Be guided by the indespensable farm  
's root.  
The mineral sailor  
relinquishes in the loving morning.  
Carry me onto your train - the lemon of my law -  
it's a growing river bank of whispers.  
  
The reasons for my respect  
are drank in my hips of silk.  
For a day, maybe twenty-seven,  
I rested under a palm tree leaf  
at a post office, waiting for the god to be behind.
