What Is True Of The Writing Is True Of Everything
-------------------------------------------------
In the smallest silicon telegraph I wish to make a line segment  
with, and every meaning, many  
times hidden in a river.  
And meetings of browbeaten breath behind the region like salt.  
Among the cold divisions of ironous river.  
There ought to be a landscape of a friendly thread building in a moonlight evening.  
To seek another land draw from it the wet-winged  
metaphor of its own synonym.  
A boat is not enough to gnaw me and keep me  
from the city of your rosy phenomena.  
Lethargic weather, calcerous lights like the shoreline.  
In the opaque sunburst orange hips of the jungle.  
  
And meetings of boneless eyeballs and you erupted in the panic and rescued a faltering abys.  
What we say excites to  
conduct some other child  
what a production may teach.
