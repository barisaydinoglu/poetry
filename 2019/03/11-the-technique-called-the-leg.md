The Technique Called The Leg
----------------------------
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the blazing splendors?  
And the sunshine plumed splattering its jars and decaying them full of  
jungle and jaguar?  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the profound acrobats?  
And the rain soft splattering its angels  
and mourning  
them full of  
archipeligos and toucan?  
On what distorted explications relaxed with ice?  
He is behind us at this moment of first promising.  
The furious maternity that seeks in your flint.  
A tetrahedron within a line,  
the brutal workings of handsome law.  
Clocks of an atrocious wheel  
transforming in the boulevard  
outside a torrential car,  
cordial as a rigid cat.
