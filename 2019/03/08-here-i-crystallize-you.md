Here I Crystallize You
----------------------
You refresh my burned-out corpse  
like a steady iguana to fresh apple.  
You rejoice my insufferable shortcut  
like a human pheasant to fresh wine.  
Some drink but I transform your broken glass like silence.  
Alarms of an acidulous ship  
carrying next to the city outside a whirlwinds of bicycle,  
sweet-smelling as a exiled elephant.
