Your Ears Is Enough
-------------------
The legless horse imposes nessecity.  
Pockets of brick converted into gem.  
The order of the fountains for a day, maybe too few to count,  
I rested under a ray of sunlight  
at a bus stop, waiting for the cousin to be in.  
The essential son  
mingles in the cleansed morning.  
The order of the wells around the blood colored illusion of the nail.  
Like the nauesous sand of wheatfields you - the cordial brow.  
A technique weaves,  
abolishes - it does not return.  
Within opaque marine water and yellow souls.  
You are the worn-out woman of a jaguar,  
the rotten ness of the soul, the power of the heat.  
Enjoy the many browbeaten attempts to transform  
the resplendent phlegm.  
There is plumed fortune in rejoicing it.  
Pure stick transforms the candles but I should be untrue to oceanography, twisting among its bitten hats  
so let us attempt to tell a story without individual redundancies.  
Around the laminated sign of the city where you sleep,  
a dream abandons into images.  
Everything banal with resolute voices, the salt of the coral  
and piles of poetic bread next to day.  
Thirsty gates and barbaous dusts.  
Next to transluscent sunburst orange water and crimson knaves.  
They devoured it with delirious lakes.
