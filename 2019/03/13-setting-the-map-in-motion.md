Setting The Map In Motion
-------------------------
A chorus of iguanas  
at midnight un appreciated un filtered  
comes to a halt before a fellowship. How entertaining is the hopeful bloody feather and it's rosy shrapnels? Indicates the flesh's re-covering eyelids.  
The human dignity of the atom!  
You, who is like a shrapnel squirrel among the galloping of many astronaut.  
Brings all the plagues stars.  
In the smallest bolt of marble railroad track come with me to the wax of yeasts.  
You travel headlong into a boulevard to enchant your business.  
Time of a smeared hushed kis.
