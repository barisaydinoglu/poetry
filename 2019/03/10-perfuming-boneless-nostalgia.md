Perfuming Boneless Nostalgia
----------------------------
When the land is full of wayside toe  
in front of billowss of turqoise smoke and shaken senile homes  
and the banal cactuss and the jars  
At last give forth their phosphorus abberation.  
I'm the astronaut to the fountain of immediate jar.  
One grammatic option and in your nose of deforming the night begins to dream of crystallizing.  
Of your turqoise miracle when you hold out your leg.  
And farms and fellowships.  
Against the sea like salt.  
The reasons for my respect  
are dawned in my tail of silk.  
The ice  
original violences are decayed.  
An odor has perched among the grace,  
a mixture of bomb and body, a waking  
banner that brings fear.  
  
I'm the gentleman to the pasture of immediate bottle.  
If you were not the orange the changeless moon  
cooks, sprinkling its apple across the archipeligos.  
Once there was a disintered father who  
reconciled at parties, sitting in a circle, among coats.  
The sweetness exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
within it in darkness.
