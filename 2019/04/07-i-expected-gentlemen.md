I Expected Gentlemen
--------------------
A melancholy image  
entangles  
even the honest  
overtone modern office in projection  
to which the metaphor  
will not be appreciated. I'm the one to the springtime of immediate love.  
This violenet femininity and refreshing garden freezes me  
with it's resplendent bird feathers like ears and curves  
and blood colored farms like curves and knaves.  
  
Putrid massacres and molested brambles.  
When you transform like honeysuckle lighted by the electricity.  
I took on rabid aromas.  
To the electrical warm ribbon it circumscribes like a fragrance of strawberry outside the bridge.
