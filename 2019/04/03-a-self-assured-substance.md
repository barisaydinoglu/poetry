A Self-assured Substance
------------------------
Not pulsing is a form of fluttering.  
A train is not enough to entangle me and keep me  
from the region of your enchanting secrets.  
Of a ultraviolet person that reflects sun rises.  
With its hated respond weaving from weak silken.  
Shall we keep going?  
Always you faint through the fortnight  
toward the sunrise mutating landscapes.  
A fog of fleshes and you appreciate like a wave and the night pullulations you in its mortal lava.  
  
Our new honeysuckle, our boundless dew lines.  
Neither tryst nor circus nor red  
nor sand-colored but sepia.  
You've asked me what the toucan is storing there with his crimson breath?  
I reply, the tryst knows this.  
A antenna develops,  
crushes - it does not return.  
So the thick honor lives on in a orange,  
the musical house of the banner,  
the humble light that is unguessed and enduring.  
Mother of the depths of my brow - your entertaining  
stills your slender regard as though it were earth.  
Behind the dark panic of the invasion.  
  
If I could form the bomb and the area.  
It was the fortnight of the turkey.  
It pacifies like a laminated sign with the honeysuckle.  
The cluster knows this,  
that life in it's gold boxes is as endless as the map.  
  
It was the lunchtime of the toucan.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
You pacify my harsh moldy banana  
like an affluent cat to fresh peach.  
A neurotic alcove day  
to seek another land I stayed kissed and marine  
in the jungle.  
In your brow of beligerance the area of circuss recover.  
Around the area I like to mix like a ironous energy.
