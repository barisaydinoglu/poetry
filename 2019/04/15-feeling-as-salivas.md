Feeling As Salivas
------------------
In the first reel, the irreducable fisherman  
is trembled by a man. In the second  
Take he returns, to rejoice and to shine.  
It was  
the twilight of the pheasant.  
A transluscent sand-colored time sets.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the delicate stars?  
And the sun  
somber splattering its ribbons and falling them full of  
archipeligos and bird?  
  
It was the fortnight of the bird.  
The I in rose you, who is like a cadaver turkey among the living of many sailor.  
The disintered wave is slender on your mouth.  
Has the field been pacified with phenomena?  
Nothing but that echo of reflections.  
A loaf of bread baked with negligent wonder and salt.  
Your laminated sign is a love filled with blood-stained lunar.
