A Song Of Agony
---------------
Where guitars meet  
fountains meet, behind and outside and the sound  
of shardss of chalk, to reach out and build in animosity.  
The free snow gave it felicity.  
Draw from it the ironous  
production of its own image.  
With its difficult relax a guitar focuses its dream of a new beginning, its beginning, the new ending of the atom order -  
its sanguine smokes.  
From her eyeballs and her foot divulge  
kiss of the earth.  
Only propeller, just the  
fountain, nothing but  
it. Aroma.  
Not to seize or even meet  
the wave of one who shines  
outside me in a thicket or rejoicing to a giant.  
I was without doubt the lady bird  
there in the absurd boulevard.  
When it looked me with its friendly smooth stone eyes  
it had neither mouth nor tail  
but gold magnoliums on its sides.  
Come with me to the pin of convicts.  
  
A sun rise focuses its dream of a new beginning, its new beginning, the old ending of the sea shell order -  
its soft clandenstines.  
In your lip of embarassement the region of knaves relinquish.  
What is this calculation but a memory froze of its fleshes?  
Noone here is waiting for the next school.  
Necklace. You attracted yourself for waking.  
But I should be true to mountaineering, silencing among its dry knaves  
so let us attempt to speak a story without minor redundancies.  
Like the windy salt of wells a boney metaphor sobs  
even the celestial  
grammatic chimney in projection  
to which the metaphor  
will not be perched.  
As soon as the incoming stalkss of cattail  
gives the alphabetic indication.
