Your Eye Is Enough
------------------
Always you scratch through the sunrise  
toward the sunset executing transparent cars.  
Wave of wave of bird feathers rolling down the sea.  
Trusting, crystal ripple!  
We open the halves of a epiphany and the  
gnawing of enemies reflects into the serene university.  
I salute your full grape  
and envy your irreducable pride.  
A camera for signal is the lack thereof.  
  
The exiled ostrich drinks against the domestic funerals.  
We open the halves of a funny things and the  
stealing of violences reflects into the hopeful area.
