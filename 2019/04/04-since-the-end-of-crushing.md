Since The End Of Crushing
-------------------------
A antenna for identity is the lack thereof.  
This molested splendor and shining umbrella falls me  
with it's indespensable coats like ears and shoulder  
and turqoise friendships like eyeballs and bird feathers.  
Only molested and to a  
cousin they take on time, three hundred years  
it was the sunset of the ostrich.  
Fewer and fewer  
dismantle about another mode of decency.  
The night warmths of your body you in its mortal lightning.  
  
It was the day of the squirrel.  
Your necklace is a pencil filled with mourning smooth sand.  
I could imbue billow of ultraviolet smoke, utensil, and dung  
from magnoliums and waves  
with a ultraviolet school  
with clandenstines in my eyeballs.  
I stayed connected and transluscent burnt umber  
against the boulevard.  
Dead goddesses and people.  
For me they are minor.  
What we say treads to  
inherit some other one  
what a point of view may teach.  
Burned-out twilight and the rusted fountain  
pass at  
the walls of my house.
