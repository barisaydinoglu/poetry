He Has A Spoiled Complex
------------------------
I wish to make  
a loop  
inside, and every feeling, many  
times hidden in a well. Return to the homeland of the alcoves.  
We open the halves of a curiosities and the  
gnawing of moths attracts into the incredulous vicinity.  
Purity is gone, the subject has pulsed.
