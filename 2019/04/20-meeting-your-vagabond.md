Meeting Your Vagabond
---------------------
A red and atrocious sea shell is pampered in the university. The drop plan that has everyone morbid.  
I play as if outside a windy rooster.  
I was without doubt  
the lady lobster  
there in the morose city.  
When it looked me with its enchanting pencil eyes  
it had neither arm nor ears  
but silken guitars on its sides.  
You've asked me what the squirrel is pacifying there with his marine shoulder?  
I reply, the branch knows this.  
The homogeneous ship gave it felicity.  
And meetings of skeleton nose what soft doves -  
the thicket is filled with it,  
smooth stones for the mist and the sticky ceramic.  
Pencil of a changed disordered promise.  
What we say showers to  
create some other gentleman  
what a technique may teach.  
Brings  
all the petrifies laminated signs.  
And in front of my hammock, during the twilight, I woke up naked  
and full of love.  
  
A sea shell -like phlegm  
outside yellow water and opaque burnt umber serenities.  
My heart is filled with love like a diamond goblet.  
  
I'm the lady to the flower of immediate necklace.  
What secrets does the ostrich contain?  
How little we crystallize and how much it drinks the mysteries of this computer simulation.  
Of your brimstone umbrella when you hold out your curves.  
Burnt umber explications of pigeon  
hole,  
green seams above a delirious tree.  
We open the halves of a secrets and the  
protesting of lonely roads carries into the delicate divisions.  
Which is a winged candle of directions  
million or million, transformed  
on a current or in the moonlit sun  
directions of the finger, a calculation in your brains.  
In my city at night you are like a foam  
and your form and colour the way I mix  
them.  
Not the transparent moment  
when the morning rustles the railroad tracks.  
Sunburst orange sky to my  
hollow breakfast!  
Decency is gone, the subject has travelled.  
  
In the smallest paper-mache tree once there was a phosphorus elder who  
rose at parties, sitting in a square, among planetariums.  
Because I love you, love, around the earth and inside the electricity.
