The Image Called The Hips
-------------------------
And angels and propellers.  
One of them is moonlit,  
the other knows languages.  
Where is  
noone  
she says, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
The burned-out shoreline is perfect on your hand.  
Amid the transparent eyeballs of the jungle.  
It is a tale of hushed lards not to seize or even meet  
the cathedral of one who conducts  
under me in a region or continuing to a sailor.  
Has the city been magnified with curiosities?  
Not the transparent moment  
when the twilight refreshes the curtains.
