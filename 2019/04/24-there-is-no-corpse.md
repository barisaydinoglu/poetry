There Is No Corpse
------------------
Trusting a flag  
drank in the resolute rain.  
The lion hearted pencil gave it honor.  
Outside green water and burnt umber forms.  
The order of the promises you - the electric tail.  
And the pencil to its river bank  
and among the bells the vertical one  
the father covered with comfortable breakfast.  
Next to the quilt of the room where you sleep,  
a dream attacks into signals.  
Silent, chalk cedar architecture!  
You say, what is the wreath waiting for in its transparent quiver?  
I tell you it is waiting for landscape like you.  
You rise slowly into a region to wet your business.  
What phenomena does the crab contain?  
How little we rescue and how much it returns the epiphany of this galaxy.
