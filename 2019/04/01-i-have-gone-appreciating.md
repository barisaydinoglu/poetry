I Have Gone Appreciating
------------------------
Transluscent marine and solute son,  
current.  
A green wine bottle lights.  
One aerial option and within the railroad track of the moonlight evening where you sleep,  
a dream erupts into techniques.  
As if to abhor or conduct or kill.  
To circumscribe lost mirrors and for propellers.  
Against the field like salt.  
Nothing but that shoreline of corals.  
When you grow inherited like a current.  
  
The clay free lineages are crushed.  
Draw from it the negligent  
image of its own synonym.
