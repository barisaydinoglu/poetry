Wetting Careless Nostalgia
--------------------------
The necklace plan that has everyone ironous.  
Full stop.  
Beligerance and silence - autumns of illusion.  
I do not mourn in the thicket of negligent  
billow of blood colored smoke.  
He is outside us at this moment of first forming.  
On what clenched bombs  
circumscribed with fire?  
You fashion my cheerless panic  
like a myriad toucan to fresh nectarine.
