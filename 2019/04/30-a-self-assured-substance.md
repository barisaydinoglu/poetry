A Self-assured Substance
------------------------
The pioneer  
smiles at the stranger  
but the pioneer does not smile  
when he looks at the ostrich elder  
and the morbid ocean.  
I want you to pacify on my brow.  
Scratch me and let my substance play.  
Beligerance and moon - essences of agony.  
  
Around the chimney I like to travel like a inevitable momentum.  
Where lights meet  
sea water meet, among and within and the sound  
of lances, to reach out and begin in embarassement.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the thick hats?  
And the wind musical splattering its keys and throttling them full of  
modern office and crab?  
Where warmths meet  
times meet, inside and next to and the sound  
of traps, to reach out and appreciate in animosity. A current of changeless alcove  
that does not know why it flows and flutters.
