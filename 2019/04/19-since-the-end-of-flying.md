Since The End Of Flying
-----------------------
Inside cinnamon water and sand-colored droplets.  
You enchant my wounded dung  
like an angellic jaguar to fresh apple.  
Carry me onto your wheel - the cherry of my writing -  
like the boneless  
brick of candles from pillow of fog to pillow of fog,  
hidden phemonanas drawn by fresh channels, a  
careless candle begins to rescue.  
I want you to kiss on my finger. Always you decay through the midnight  
toward the late afternoon smearing droplets.  
The imperalist forest is infinite on your eyelids.
