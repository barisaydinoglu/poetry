A Song Of Wonder
----------------
Your finger drinks from west to south  
I saw how candles are perched  
by the esoteric productivity.  
With its listless transform the rigid oyster swims outside the slender coffins.  
In the smallest gold breakfast as if to disguise or attract or silence.  
Banner was no longer below the recording threshold.  
Which is a eloquent quilt of directions  
too few to count or three hundred, responded  
on a shades of cinnamon or in the blazing praise  
directions of the brow, a calculation in your breaths.  
We open the halves of a epiphany and the  
invading of bones preserves into the arcane area.  
I took on rambunctious quivers.
