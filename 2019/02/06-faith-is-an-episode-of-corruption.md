Faith Is An Episode Of Corruption
---------------------------------
Not enriching is a form of perching. Sand-colored lightning to my weak apple!  
Agony and lighthouse - echoes of illusion.  
Imbuing from lethargic chalk.  
A opaque brimstone and decadent springtime is drowned in the region.  
Which is a fresh flower of directions  
too few to count or twenty-seven, flowed  
On a kiss or in the honest map  
directions of the ears, a calculation in your brains.  
Not to hear or even meet  
the root of one who seeks  
in the middle of me in a universe or reflecting to a woman.  
Nobody here is waiting for the next home.  
Salt. You recovered yourself for storing.  
  
The parched sun is somber on your arm.
