The Inscription Of Algorithmic Points
-------------------------------------
Nothing but that stars in the sky of farms.  
You - the angellic nose.  
Like trashes loitering in old warrior's medals.  
I appreciate as if amid an atrocious torrent.  
Be guided by the hidden drop's jar.  
Of a ultraviolet astronaut that upgrades silences.  
But I should be true to oceanography, dying among its distorted starry skies  
so let us seek to tell a story devoid of aerial redundancies.
