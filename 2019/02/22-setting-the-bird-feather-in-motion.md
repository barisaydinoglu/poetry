Setting The Bird Feather In Motion
----------------------------------
Carry me onto your car - the lemon of my circus - you are the banana of my melancholy foot. What taunts the props of purity?  
Be guided by the careful productivity's banner.  
To the essential rosy honeysuckle as if to replace or transform or conquer.  
One aerial option and a brow and a fingernails  
conducting the field.  
The reasons for my respect  
are relinquished in my mouth of cork.  
Pure saliva pacifies  
the saxophones the femininity congeals, the railroad track of secure  
re-covers outside.  
  
From uncomfortable turbulence to unrelenting rain,  
hidden wreaths drawn by steady channels, a  
troubled stars in the sky begins to trust.  
A green time transforms.
