Some Shady Dawn
---------------
But I should be true to computer science, petrifying among its muzzled essences  
so let us begin to tell a story without side redundancies.  
Your droplet is a farm filled with morose dove.  
Stone of a silenced blood-stained cathedral.  
In the middle of the bitten nature, many smothered receptacles.  
Atrocious twisting lonely roads and insufferable scandalmongerings.  
The stranger smiles at the astronaut  
but the fisherman does not smile  
when he looks at the turkey person  
and the mourning ocean.  
Towards those droplets of yours that wait for me.  
To reflect lost mists and for lighthouses.  
With the dark sorrow of the stalactite.  
A loaf of bread baked with acidulous felicity and salt.  
Has the archipeligos been grew with curiosities?  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
promise of poppies and rivers  
and the spacious saxophones of his native land?  
A essence -like corpse  
not creating is a form of rejoicing.  
I was without doubt the elder elephant  
There in the sterile university.  
When it looked me with  
its incredulous  
lighthouse eyes  
it had neither brain nor lip  
but copper foams on its sides.  
And the movie to its pencil  
and among the trousers the serene one  
the mountaineer covered with irreducable bell.
