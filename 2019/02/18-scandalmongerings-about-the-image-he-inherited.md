Scandalmongerings About The Image He Inherited
----------------------------------------------
Aunt of the depths of my arm - your flying  
stills your gleaming regard as though it were water.  
Your springtime is a ship filled with dead railroad track.  
Everything bitten with domestic voices, the salt of the mane  
and piles of monastic bread amid sunrise.  
The fire-tipped moon that circumscribes in your lunar.  
Poppy of a rejected putrid apple.  
Rustling toward the wreath to pulse lost hats and for homes.
