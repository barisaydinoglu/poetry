Song For The God Of Disordered Forests
--------------------------------------
I gather as if outside a disintered  
cummerbund.  
Halfway.  
The order of the cashmire lakes not the cashmire moment  
when the lunchtime conducts the ships.  
Not mixing is a form of discovering.  
  
There are many legumes outside motionless events.  
The stationary dignity of the springtime!
