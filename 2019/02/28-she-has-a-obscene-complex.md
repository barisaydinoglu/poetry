She Has A Obscene Complex
-------------------------
Come with me to the nougat of uranus.  
The sky absent minded violas are loathed.  
Your brow mingles from east to south  
Propeller of a invaded forceful writing.  
Full  
stop.  
The order of the currents and around my hammock, during the morning, I woke up naked  
and full of purity.  
  
What steady laws -  
the field is filled with it,  
goblets for the awe and the harsh crystal.  
As if to abandon or begin or abduct.  
I took on whirlwinds of cathedrals.  
Outside the gnawing massacres.  
A arrogant point of view gnaws  
even the changeless  
alphabetic land in language  
to which the metaphor  
will not be began.  
In the face of so many trapdoors to animosity.  
Pure jugular recovers the lands a gray and delirious candle is forced in the university.  
Nothing but that autumn of laminated signs.  
The rustling dove is noble on your hips.  
I wish to make a quadrangle  
behind,  
and every faith, many  
times hidden in a candle.  
A current of homogeneous saxophone  
that does not know why it flows and breathes.  
To the dashing wonderful root in the wheatfield of the area where you sleep,  
a dream taunts into signals.  
  
There ought to be an apple of a silent love reflecting in an area.  
Communist holiday and the obscene branch  
shatter at the walls of my house.
