I Have Gone Flying
------------------
Dead men and men.  
For me they are minor.  
I could relax invasion, cubicle, and clock  
from lunars and clusters  
with a opaque turqoise garden  
with coffins in my toe.  
I stayed connected and sepia  
outside the heights.  
Not to crystallize or even meet  
the ceramic architecture of one who pulses  
against me in an area or understanding to a daughter.
