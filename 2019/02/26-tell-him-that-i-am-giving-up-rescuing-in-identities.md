Tell Him That I Am Giving Up Rescuing In Identities
---------------------------------------------------
Like lonely roads devouring within splendors.  
The raucous kiss is secure on your hips.  
All bells become funerals.  
And bridges and reflections.  
A phenomenon continues,  
condemns - it does not  
return.
