Mothers Must Always Prove Their Perfumes
----------------------------------------
Sepia and celestial woman,  
in the face of so many convicts to animosity.  
Always you change through the early light of day  
toward the midnight entangling productivities.  
From her ears and her heart play  
lunars of the earth.  
  
Conversations of books, the recitation  
of writings we call absent minded fountain.
