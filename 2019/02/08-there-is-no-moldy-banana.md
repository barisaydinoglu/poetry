There Is No Moldy Banana
------------------------
You expand in the heights as in a serendipidous area. Pockets of steel converted into gold.  
A lip and a brain  
enchanting the heights.  
Of a dull shades of opaque crimson daughter that seizes flints.  
Sifted weather, decadent lights like the film.  
My heart moves from being worn-out to being somber.  
Ghostly ladies and ladies.  
For me they are grammatic.  
The stone sets in reconciling your hand.  
  
Wave of wave of lands rolling down  
the sea.  
If I could relax the cummerbund and the moonlight evening.  
Here I am, a smooth tail killed in the vicinity of necklace.  
Salt.
