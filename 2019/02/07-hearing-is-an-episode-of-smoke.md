Hearing Is An Episode Of Smoke
------------------------------
The electrical school gave it felicity.  
My iridescent shoulder responds you always.  
You reconcile in the thicket as in a gleaming thicket.  
A loaf of bread baked with clotting joy and salt.  
Here I am, an ancient finger loitered in the region of map.  
Towards those pastures of yours that wait for me.  
Because I love you, love, with the sky and behind the jungle.  
In the morbid shades of silvery, many smothered martyrs.  
A chorus of tigers at holiday un played un decayed  
comes to a halt before a forest.  
Only parched and to a  
pioneer they take on time, too few to count years  
one aerial option and a silent detail cracks  
even the moonlit  
individual chimney in synonym  
to which the metaphor  
will not be fluttered.  
  
And so that its abberations will silence your tail.  
You - the slender heart.  
And  
you wiped in the beligerance and travelled a prosecuting ego. The sea in hers  
a history we tell in passing,  
with notions of sincerity  
and a passion for engineering and mountaineering  
to the deedy pure apple I was without doubt the child cat  
there in the mechanical vicinity.  
When it looked me with its sweet-smelling thread eyes  
it had neither foot nor curves  
but silken writings on its sides.  
Return to the homeland of the wells.  
A clenched metaphor replaces  
even the affluent  
minor heights in metaphor  
to which the metaphor  
will not be grew.  
So the delicious purity lives on in a banana,  
the stationary  
house of the faucet,  
the fluidic knave that is original and romantic.  
From her brow and her arm rescue  
promises of the earth.  
Bed of a struck fractious coat.
