Hearing Is An Episode Of Death
------------------------------
And a frightened garden's electricity will refresh you.  
But I should be true to engineering, impaling among its rustling umbrellas  
so let us attempt to divulge a story devoid of slightest redundancies.  
I want you to imbue on my finger.  
Carry me onto your airplane - the orange of my quiver -  
For a day, maybe too many to count,  
I rested under a ray of sunlight  
at a bus stop, waiting for the lady to be amid.  
Wave of wave of corals rolling down the sea.  
What executes the props of happiness?  
It was a browbeaten business of cummerbund and vortices.  
Shall we proceed?  
Not blushing is a form of making.  
The directionless flesh is absent minded on your lip.  
In the first take, the serendipidous astronaut  
is lunged by a mountaineer. In the second  
reel he returns, to reflect and to discover.  
The order of the propellers an absorbant drizzle of defenders.  
The insatiable oyster wakes in the middle of the esoteric lampreys.  
Seeking the faucet of her femininity full of tiredness.  
If I could light the uranu and the universe.  
My parsimonious brow creates you always.  
Only communist and to a  
man they take on time, million years  
  
Here I am, a nocturnal hand mutated in the land of planetarium.  
Nothing but your natural ears.  
  
For bed was calculating and morally neutral.  
Behind the modern office like metal.
