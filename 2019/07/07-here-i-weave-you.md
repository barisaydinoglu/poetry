Here I Weave You
----------------
Next to the blood colored panic  
of the alarm.  
Return to the homeland  
of the dews.  
I saw how gardens are began  
by the winged aspen.  
I'm the gentleman to the smooth graphite of immediate umbrella.  
Gleaming, gold bottle!  
Towards those knaves of yours that wait for me.  
I am entangled by kis and shrapnel, by flask and clouds.  
Transforming toward the sea's skin towards those sea shells of yours that wait for me.  
Lunar was no longer right at the transmission threshold.  
  
I want you to perch on my brain.  
Draw from it the rambunctious  
synonym of its own signal.  
A muscle focuses its dream of a ending, its new beginning, the new beginning of the propeller order -  
its cordial cubicles.  
Of secure wine, spirit  
of the fountains,  
died custodian blood, your kisses  
breathe into exile  
and a droplet of chalk, with remnants of the land.
