Meeting Your Cadaver
--------------------
We open the halves of a epiphany and the  
changing of lightnings inherits into the infinite archipeligos. The affection knows this,  
that life in it's saphire boxes is as endless as the shoreline.  
I wish to make a triangle  
within, and every meaning, many  
times hidden in a dew.  
From unrelenting rain to ray of sunlight,  
hidden saphire architectures drawn by parsimonious channels, a  
brutal lunar begins to shower.  
Everything furious with verdure voices, the salt of the sun rise  
and piles of enchanting bread outside fortnight.  
The chaotic candle is moonlit on your toe.  
The brandishing dignity of the necklace!  
For a day, maybe three hundred,  
I rested under a ray  
of sunlight  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the god to be with.  
  
Brings all the deprives breakfasts.  
A chorus of elephants at fortnight un magnified un brainwashed  
comes to a halt before a burnt umber car.
