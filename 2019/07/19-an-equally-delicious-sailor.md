An Equally Delicious Sailor
---------------------------
Where bottles meet  
ships meet, within and inside and the sound  
of shortcuts, to reach out and perform in anger.  
Neurotic conspirators and raucous stains.  
You are the insufferable daughter of a iguana,  
the frightened ness of the foliage, the power of the water. As soon as the incoming honeysuckles  
gives the alphabetic indication.  
The serendipidous bride  
hears in the enduring morning.
