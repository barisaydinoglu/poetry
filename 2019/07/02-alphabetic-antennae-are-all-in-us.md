Alphabetic Antennae Are All In Us
---------------------------------
The reasons for my respect  
are seized in my brow of copper.  
A hopeful mist of starlights.  
Like wounded soldiers taunting around smooth metals.  
A circle amid a triangle,  
the callous workings of resolute law.  
I stayed crystallized and  
blue  
among the sea.  
A detail for synonym is the lack thereof.  
In my area at afternoon you are like a old warrior's medal  
and your form and colour the way I promise them.
