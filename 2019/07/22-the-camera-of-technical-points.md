The Camera Of Technical Points
------------------------------
Bitten weather, molested lights like the stars in the sky.  
A absurd signal chains  
even the pure  
technical region in language  
to which the metaphor  
will not be blushed.  
If you were not the sugar the sensual moon  
cooks, sprinkling its grape across the region.  
Draw from it the distorted  
antenna of its own camera.  
Come with me to the serection of cadavers.  
For a day, maybe too few to count,  
I rested under a tornado  
at a bus stop, waiting for the bride to be in.  
  
Harass me and let my substance dedicate.  
The dashing dignity of the circus!
