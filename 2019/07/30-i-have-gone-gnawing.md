I Have Gone Gnawing
-------------------
I took on imperalist love. Which is a myriad love of directions  
twenty-seven or too many to count, trod  
on a movie or in the silent thread  
directions of the arm, a calculation in your toes. Of your dark well when you hold out your nose.  
A technique for signal is the lack thereof.  
The mother smiles at the stranger  
but the man does not smile  
when he looks at the elephant gentleman  
and the crooked ocean.  
What we say enchants to  
reconcile some other sailor  
what a point of view may teach.  
The root gathering from my tail.  
Shut out and pulled out like a productivity.  
Of a dark one that imbues old warrior's medals.
