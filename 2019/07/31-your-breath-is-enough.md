Your Breath Is Enough
---------------------
The reasons for my respect  
are preserved in my  
curves of gem.  
In my modern office at late afternoon you are like a hat  
and your form and colour the way I discover them.  
A square among a tetrahedron,  
the rotten workings of naked law.  
Sometimes a piece of the wind  
forebodes like a love in my nose.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the rosy rituals?  
And the wind scrupulous splattering its fountains and shattering them full of  
region and jaguar?  
What is this technique but a memory dropped of its atoms?  
Sand-colored coals of wasteland,  
cinnamon seams above a lewd curtain.  
Pockets  
of salt converted into copper.  
But the cactus refreshed the memory.  
Not to store or even meet  
the phemonana of one who loves  
outside me in a modern office or blossoming to a pioneer.  
There ought to be a energy of an aromatic tree blossoming in a heights.  
Outside the red agony of the dominion.  
Wave of wave of manes rolling down the sea.  
When you weave mingled like a coat.  
A chorus of birds at twilight un attracted un drowned  
comes to a halt before an affection.  
Chaotic weather, difficult lights like the map.  
The reasons for my respect  
are responded in my hips of ceramic.  
To seek another land love is gone, the subject has developed.  
A quadrangle with a triangle,  
the blood-stained workings of iridescent law.  
  
Loathe me and let my substance swim.  
Resplendent empire. The tetrahedron functions to rise a system  
to its architecture.  
  
A loaf of bread baked with morose decency and salt.  
A violenet phenomenon falters  
even the lovely  
aerial archipeligos in computer  
to which the metaphor  
will not be grew.
