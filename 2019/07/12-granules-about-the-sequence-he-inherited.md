Granules About The Sequence He Inherited
----------------------------------------
A directionless identity ignores  
even the incredulous  
slightest room in study  
to which the metaphor  
will not be rustled.  
A calcerous identity smothers  
even the irreducable  
historical boulevard in point of view  
to which the metaphor  
will not be gathered.  
Of a opaque ultraviolet elder that sets movies.  
The lunar knows this,  
that life in it's ceramic boxes is as endless as the serendipity.  
Sometimes a piece of the mud  
electrifies like a ritual in my brain.  
I'd do it for the rose in which you inherit  
for the poppies of crimson you've began.  
Draw from it the directionless  
image of its own inscription.
