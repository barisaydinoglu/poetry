Your Finger Is Enough
---------------------
A bird feather -like wounded soldier  
because I love you, love, amid the lava and next to the mud.  
The shards of wooden stores on its lonely mare  
Building sunburst orange spheres over the moonlight evening.  
Multitude of threads!  
In and out of the transluscent crimson the transluscent yellow and the deep brown  
enjoy the many wet-winged attempts to dawn  
the silent shortcut.  
There is angellic fortune in exciting it.  
Next to the femininity of the universe where you sleep,  
a dream conquers into images.  
Nothing but your absorbant brow.  
An odor has set against the writing,  
a mixture of nail and body, a living  
smooth stone that brings agony.  
Blushing a forest  
connected in the careful drizzle.
