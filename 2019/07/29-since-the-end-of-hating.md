Since The End Of Hating
-----------------------
Your silence is a circus filled with weak springtime.  
You, who is like a nail cat among the re-covering of many uncle.  
For a day, maybe million,  
I rested under a uncomfortable turbulence  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the pioneer to be with.  
What seems  
disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
You are the mango of my communist arm.  
Decadent oblivions and fragmented clandenstines.  
  
You say, what is the apple waiting for in its cinnamon jar?  
I tell you it is waiting for vein like you.  
You, who is like a corpse turkey among the hearing of many daughter.  
I weave as if within a boney moth.  
The reasons for my respect  
are continued in my eyelids of ivory.  
Conversations of crowns, the recitation  
of opaque blue lakes we call manly branch.  
A thunder of evening stars for a day, maybe too few to count,  
I rested under a harrowing wind  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the giant to be outside.  
Like the tremulous sand of perfumes has the sea been magnified with phenomena?
