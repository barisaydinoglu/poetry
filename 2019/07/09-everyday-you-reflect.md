Everyday You Reflect
--------------------
Pockets of graphite converted into diamond.  
My friendly mouth preserves you always.  
Towards those river banks of yours that wait for me.  
Around the thicket I like to seize like a boneless pasture.  
What secrets does the ostrich contain?  
How little we attract and how much it makes the secrets of this computer simulation.  
To seek another land the tenacious pheasant creates under the perfect corpses.
