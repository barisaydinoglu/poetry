Bloody Feathers About The Sequence He Inherited
-----------------------------------------------
My heart moves from being guilt to being ancient.  
Spoiled moldy bananas and lethargic dusts.  
The legless horse responds on its wayside mare  
entertaining sunburst orange apples over the jungle.  
Femininity of a deluded clotting opaque transparent car.  
Sand-colored and deedy giant,  
you - the absorbant hand.  
Be guided by the handsome eddy's moon.
