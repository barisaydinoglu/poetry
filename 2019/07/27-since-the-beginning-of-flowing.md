Since The Beginning Of Flowing
------------------------------
Love is gone, the subject has continued.  
The dew filters, the friendship of loving  
inherits outside.  
Your sphere is a lemon filled with negligent evening star.  
In the face of so many flasks to positivity.  
Multitude of autumns!  
In and out of the cashmire the sepia and the opaque deep brown
