Since The End
-------------
Seizing from whirlwinds of silicon.  
The esoteric knaves brainwashed full stop.  
A tail and a brain  
conducting the boulevard.  
Shall we proceed?  
A thread focuses its dream of a new beginning, its new ending, the old ending of the salt order -  
its full thorn trees.
