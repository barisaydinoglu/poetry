The Synonym Called The Arm
--------------------------
If you were not the lemon the round moon  
cooks, sprinkling its nectarine across the vicinity.  
I want you to recover on my heart.  
A burnt umber alcove protects.  
Among crimson water and cashmire starry skies.  
What stationary forests -  
the divisions is filled with it,  
angels for the quiver and the arrogant fused quartz.  
To the naked plumed dove all graces become oblivions.  
He is in us at this moment of first building.  
Be guided by the cosmic breakfast's form.  
Fragrance of strawberry of a deprived rusted dew.  
Of your dark aroma when you hold out your lip.  
The forest knows this,  
that life in it's saphire boxes is as endless as the apple.  
  
You - the fluidic lip.
