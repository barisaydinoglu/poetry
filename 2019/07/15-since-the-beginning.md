Since The Beginning
-------------------
Multitude of trousers!  
In and out of the marine the deep brown and the burnt umber  
the human saxophones rejected amid the red panic of the bomb.  
The insatiable shades of opaque sepia is celestial on your fingernails.  
A loaf of bread baked with  
wounded happiness and salt.  
Around the rust colored beligerance of the cubicle. But the praise trod the memory.  
Which is a balanced smooth stone of directions  
twenty-seven or million, perched  
on a emerald  
architecture or in the domestic aspen  
directions of the brow, a calculation in your tails.  
They are all ones  
professional coffins in whose clear fellowships originate.  
Joy is gone, the subject has grew.  
What is this machine but a memory electrified of its honeysuckles?  
It's a gathering curtain of flasks.  
  
The dead jaguar discovers behind the hidden deaths.  
Of a ultraviolet one that perfumes hearts.
