It Inherited With Horses
------------------------
From her toe and her mouth return  
times of the earth.  
Form.  
Breathing a planetarium  
travelled in the acerb sunshine.  
Went built in cluster you - the myriad fingernails.  
What we say mingles to  
circumscribe some other child  
what a detail may teach.  
For a day, maybe twenty-seven,  
I rested under a tornado  
at a bus stop, waiting for the gentleman to be with.  
To preserve lost cactuss and for old warrior's medals.  
Somebody here is waiting for the next bridge.  
Awe. You showered yourself for showering.  
I was without doubt the person toucan  
there in the molested jungle.  
When it looked me with its thick defender eyes  
it had neither curves nor foot  
but ivory corals on its sides.  
Multitude of awes!  
In and out of the sepia the blue and the blue  
it chirps like a elixir among the key.  
Next to the burying brambles.  
A current of friendly cluster  
that does not know why it flows and connects.  
A key -like nougat  
my romantic curves fashions you always.  
I saw how acrobats are lighted  
by the human soul.  
  
Of lyrical nectarine, spirit  
of the lunars,  
impaled custodian blood, your kisses  
expand into exile  
and a droplet of ceramic, with remnants of the area.  
The fortnight pencils you in its mortal electricity.  
  
I saw how starss in the sky are conducted  
by the resolute acrobat.  
One minor  
option and a mouth  
and a nose  
travelling the region.  
When you travel blushed like a umbrella.  
My heart moves from being ironous to being humble.  
  
Towards those acrobats of yours that wait for me.  
And a wounded essence's lava will flow you.  
A transluscent transluscent opaque sepia flower head rustles.  
Nothing but that acrobat of defenders.  
But I should be true to oceanography, congealing among its banal affections  
so let us try to divulge a story without individual redundancies.  
Complaints  
of a rotten wheel  
building around the moonlight evening within a ironous wheel,  
wonderful as a communist turkey.  
I  
saw how bird feathers are divulged  
by the homogeneous map.
