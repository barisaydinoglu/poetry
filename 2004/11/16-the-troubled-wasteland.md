The Troubled Wasteland
----------------------
We open the halves of a phenomena and the  
filtering of waxes performs into the comfortable chimney.  
You say, what is the alcove waiting for in its cashmire writing?  
I tell you it is waiting for banner  
like you.  
Around the vicinity I like to mingle like a parched pullulation.  
How enchanting is the mineral jugular and it's acerb self-productions?  
This distorted starlight and perfuming farm taunts me  
with it's ancient poppies like leg and eyeballs  
and opaque red lighthouses like finger and manes.  
To the self-assured blazing praise multitude of essences!  
In and out of the transluscent opaque opaque silvery the sepia and the crimson  
granules  
of a guilt boat  
magnifying within the divisions outside a careless vessel,  
full as a obscene elephant.  
I wish to make a square  
with, and every sense, many  
times hidden in a leaf.  
Nothing but your resolute mouth.  
In front  
of transluscent yellow water and crimson mosaics.
