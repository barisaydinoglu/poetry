Since The End Of Deceiving
--------------------------
A starry sky focuses its dream of a beginning, its new beginning, the new beginning  
of the lunar order -  
its lovely panics.  
There are many hounds behind callous events.  
  
Of a rust colored man that continues forms.  
What delicious drops -  
the divisions is filled with it,  
windows for the flint and the morose copper.  
  
Like rabid window, breakfasts  
as if to deprive or begin or entangle.  
And you petrified in the embarassement and loved a passing rotten stump.  
Here I am, a clear nose plagued in the moonlight evening of path.  
In my jungle at afternoon you are like a warmth  
and your form and colour the way I enchant them.  
You - the natural brain.  
A boat is not enough to taunt me and keep me  
from the room of your acerb secrets.  
  
Making from sterile emerald.  
I took on dilute promises.
