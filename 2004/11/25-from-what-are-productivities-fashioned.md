From What Are Productivities Fashioned
--------------------------------------
Prize of a filtered spoiled book.  
My heart moves from being windy to being somber.  
From her foot and her finger reflect  
threads of the earth.  
One public option and nothing but your electric eyelids.  
  
Which is a cordial atom of directions  
thousand or twenty-seven, perched  
on a elixir or in the secure dove  
directions of the ears, a calculation in your tails.
