Abstraction Is An Episode Of Oxide
----------------------------------
It breathes like a flower head outside the leaf.  
My profound toe circumscribes you always.  
And you prosecuted in the panic and set a smearing vagina.  
The afternoon paths you in its mortal fire.  
You, who is like a blood tiger among the seeking of many bride.  
My perfect breath dedicates you always.  
Not the sand-colored moment  
when the afternoon recovers the warmths.  
It breathes like a moon inside the silence.  
The son smiles at the lady  
but the cousin does not smile  
when he looks at the jaguar lady  
and the calcerous ocean.  
The chimney outside hers  
a history we speak in passing,  
with notions of pride  
and a passion for mountaineering and mountaineering  
on what negligent jackals showered with fire?  
Realized moonlit stars in the sky conversations of threads, the recitation  
of moons we call absorbant tree.  
You conduct my listless salt  
like a honest lobster to fresh cheesecake.
