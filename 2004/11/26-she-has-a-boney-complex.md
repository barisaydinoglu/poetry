She Has A Boney Complex
-----------------------
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the unguessed saxophones?  
And the drizzle somber splattering its  
precisions and harassing them full of  
jungle and squirrel? I do not degrade in the university of putrid abberation.  
Amid the yellow eye of the heat.  
Frightened afternoon and the wet-winged lemon  
execute at the walls of my house.  
Lake.  
They sobbed it with silent energies.  
They protested it with sticky coats.  
And outside my hammock, during the sunset, I woke up naked  
and full of pride.  
Conversations of splendors, the recitation  
of bridges we call poetic sphere.  
A square amid a line segment,  
the dilute workings of serene law.  
In the shaken city of sordid splendor.  
We open the halves of a epiphany and the  
wetting of enemies stores into the scrupulous land.  
I saw how drops are awakened  
by the real river bank.  
A defender making will fly  
the shifty fire of a planet.  
What epiphany does the tiger contain?  
How little we create and how much it fashions the phenomena of this computer simulation.
