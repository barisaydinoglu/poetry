A Kiwi
------
As soon as the incoming evening stars  
gives the public indication.  
Towards those threads of yours that wait for me.  
Fewer and fewer  
abhor about another mode of purity.  
From harrowing wind to pillow of fog,  
hidden promises drawn by solute channels, a  
furious affection begins to rustle.  
I'd do it for the muscle in which you swim  
for the sea shells of sand-colored you've trod.  
A kiss making will shine  
the tear stained electricity of a planet.  
As soon as  
the incoming horses  
gives the alphabetic indication.
