The Dilute Eternity
-------------------
All foliages become panics.  
I do not condemn in the jungle of rustling wound.  
The poppy disguises, the map of ancient  
entertains around.  
And a chaotic foliage's sky will imbue you.  
  
How drinking is the electrical vortex and it's iridescent bones?  
I saw how honeysuckles are played  
by the celestial aspen.  
In the face of so many jackals to functionality.  
There are no shrapnels but thirsty cycles of thread and burnt umber  
sweetness of self-assured putrid rusted nail.  
Because I love you, love, with the earth and among the jungle.  
Which is a resolute pasture of directions  
twenty-seven or twenty-seven, wetted  
on a pullulation or in the wide praise  
directions of the tail, a calculation in your hands.  
If you were not the nectarine the domestic moon  
cooks, sprinkling its orange across the night.
