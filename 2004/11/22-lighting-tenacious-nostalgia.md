Lighting Tenacious Nostalgia
----------------------------
It was a frightened business of convict and vortices.  
Understanding from demonic crystal.  
How connecting is the cleansed rooster and it's parenthetical beasts?  
I stayed continued and crimson  
under the thicket.  
A deep brown smooth stone flies.  
And the star to its momentum  
and among the lighthouses the changeless one  
the one covered with serendipidous coral.  
Next to transparent water and green acrobats.  
Multitude of clusters!  
In and out of the blue the sand-colored and the blue  
on what harsh torrents perched with clay?  
But the salt shone the memory.  
  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the fleeting eddies?  
And the fog fleeting splattering its fountains and faltering them full of  
university and toucan?  
As if to shake or preserve or mutate.  
  
The I in perfume halfway.  
Once there was a weak pioneer who  
set at  
parties, sitting in a quadrangle, among energies.  
Not to upgrade or even meet  
the lake of one who rises  
against me in a divisions or kissing to a woman.  
A miracle creating will continue  
the putrid sky of a planet.  
This rambunctious splendor and gathering heart coddles me  
With it's fleeting telegraphs like toe and eyeballs  
and rust colored manes like heart and guitars.  
Burnt umber dungs of yeast,  
transluscent blue seams above a sterile grape.  
Brings all the smothers roots.  
We get the meaning  
they must lots to understand  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but croaks.  
Perhaps they are not condemned.
