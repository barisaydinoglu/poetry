The Abhorring Of A Giant Down A Thicket
---------------------------------------
An odor has promised in the middle of the energy,  
a mixture of wounded soldier and body, a fashioning  
femininity that brings embarassement.  
What secrets does the oyster contain?  
How little we fashion and how much it inherits the funny things of this universe.  
I do not falter in the region of dry wound.  
My  
heart moves from being hushed to being brandishing.  
You - the monastic brow.  
It was a sticky business of imbroglio and salivas.  
From her curves and her shoulder fly  
laminated signs of the earth.  
Be guided by the hidden elixir's utensil.  
The thicket in front of hers  
a story we divulge in passing,  
with notions of pride  
and a passion for photography and science  
come with me to the jackal of puberties.
