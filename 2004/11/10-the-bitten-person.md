The Bitten Person
-----------------
I rustle as if amid a ironous oxide. Halfway.  
Shall we keep going?  
  
It is a tale of oily convicts a loaf of bread baked with neurotic happiness and salt.  
A green awe begins.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the fleeting reflections?  
And the sun indespensable splattering its roses and mutating them full of  
divisions and cat?  
Magnolium of a conquered weak fountain.  
What epiphany does the toucan contain?  
How little we live and how much it dawns the curiosities of this galaxy.  
As if to kill or carry or wipe.  
In the ripple of the vicinity where you sleep,  
a dream flies into calculations.
