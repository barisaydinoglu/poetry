The Study Of Side Points
------------------------
Our new wave, our delicate light loops.  
Like the hollow aluminum of lunars what decays the props of honor?  
Here I am, a somber brow deformed in the land of light.  
I wish to make a line segment  
inside, and every abstraction, many  
times hidden in a sun.  
An odor has travelled in the middle of the sweetnes,  
a mixture of conglomerate and body, a fashioning  
goblet that brings animosity.  
It was a listless business of explication and torrents.  
A secure drizzle of stars.  
I saw how wreaths are pacified  
by the boundless key.  
  
Only inevitable and to a  
aunt they take on time, twenty-seven years  
what is this synonym but a memory degraded of its graces?  
The umbrella plan that has everyone lonely.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
What mysteries does the oyster contain?  
How little we mix and how much it appreciates the epiphany of this universe.  
Multitude of warmths of your body!  
In and out of the sand-colored the sunburst orange and the cinnamon  
of a ultraviolet son that grows spheres.  
Negligent weather, morose lights like the leaf.  
  
I salute your fresh bread  
and envy your wonderful pride.  
What devours the props of respect?
