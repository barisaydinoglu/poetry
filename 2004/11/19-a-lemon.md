A Lemon
-------
Banal midnight and the pale dew  
puncture at the walls of my house.  
To the perfect essential mirror pulled out and closed off like a pasture.  
I saw how ripples are showered  
by the sanguine well.  
The wasteland circumscribes on its boneless mare  
returning sunburst orange laws over the universe.
