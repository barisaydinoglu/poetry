The Oily Woman Of The Land
--------------------------
If you were  
not the peach the iridescent moon  
cooks, sprinkling its orange across the room.  
Which is a indespensable honeysuckle of directions  
too many to count or million, lived  
on a foam or in the serene shoreline  
directions of the eyelids, a calculation in your brows.  
And you re-cover like a quilt and I salute your deedy plum  
and envy your deedy pride.  
And so that its vagabonds will crush your curves.
