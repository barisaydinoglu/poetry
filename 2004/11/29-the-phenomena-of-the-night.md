The Phenomena Of The Night
--------------------------
When you seek like elixir kissed by the water.  
The ghostly bridge is perfect on your heart.  
Shut up and shut up  
like a starlight.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the manly paths?  
And the clouds monastic splattering its splendors and falling them full of  
city and cat?  
With the map of the archipeligos where you sleep,  
a dream invades into details.
