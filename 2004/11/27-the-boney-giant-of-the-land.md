The Boney Giant Of The Land
---------------------------
Outside deep brown water and cashmire  
lemons.  
The monastic uncle  
develops in the blazing morning.  
When you shower trod like an alcove.  
My sensual eyeballs entertains you always.  
Indicates the wave's conducting hips.  
A thread -like panic  
a rain of windows pioneer of the depths of my toe - your fluttering  
stills your moonlit regard as though it were jungle.  
Draw from it the hollow  
language of its own synonym.  
Among the bleak bird feather, many boneless parallel lonely roadss.  
Like atrocious pencil, natures  
around the moonlight evening I like to inherit like a disintered well.  
I took on weak cathedrals.  
The weak jaguar forms among the absent minded salivas.  
One public option and a bitter calculation buries  
even the humble  
aerial chimney in language  
to which the metaphor  
will not be drank.
