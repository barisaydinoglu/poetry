The Language Has Not Fainted The Promise
----------------------------------------
A current of boundless tiger  
that does not know why it flows and dawns.  
Around the city I like to flow like a bitten productivity.  
A hated machine mutates  
even the domestic  
technical university in antenna  
to which the metaphor  
will not be responded.  
Come with me to the complaint of shadows.  
It was the morning of the tiger.  
Breathing the flint of her reflection full of joy.  
Outside the loathing clefts.  
The harsh starry sky is infinite on your tail.  
What is this production but a memory pampered of its mirrors?  
Shut out and shut up like an affection.  
Some carry but I pulse your steel like cactus.  
And a senile landscape's sky will appreciate you.  
  
It was the late afternoon of the ostrich.
