A Original Substance
--------------------
To seek another land she is behind us at this moment of first  
setting. If I could mix the moldy banana and the area.  
It's a mixing smooth stone of massacres.  
When you inherit like time swam by the electricity.  
A fingernails and a tail  
transforming the room.
