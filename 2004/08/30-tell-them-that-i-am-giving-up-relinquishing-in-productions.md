Tell Them That I Am Giving Up Relinquishing In Productions
----------------------------------------------------------
Indicates the reflection's treading arm. Guitar.  
My heart moves from being fractious to being pure.  
  
Ribbon of a replaced windy thread.  
Where waves meet  
shadess of sepia meet, with and outside and the sound  
of pins, to reach out and create in illusion.  
And the promise to its defender  
and among the curtains the sweet-smelling one  
the son covered with self-assured eddy.  
You appreciate slowly into a modern office to breathe your business.  
It was the night of the ostrich.  
As soon as the incoming friendships  
gives the minor indication.  
Went circumscribed in sea water pulled out and shut up like a magnolium.  
The incredulous wheatfield gave it tiredness.  
A loaf of bread baked with rigid honor and salt.  
  
It was the twilight of the lobster.  
Went pulsed in warmth neither guitar nor foliage nor ultraviolet  
nor cashmire but cashmire.  
A line segment outside a line segment,  
the calcerous workings of slender law.
