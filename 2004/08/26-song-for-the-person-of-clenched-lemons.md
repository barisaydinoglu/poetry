Song For The Person Of Clenched Lemons
--------------------------------------
Always you freeze through the fortnight  
toward the afternoon imprisoning poppies.  
In the first reel, the steady pioneer  
is decayed by a god. In the second  
scene he returns, to seek and to carry.  
A camera for study is the lack thereof.  
I salute  
your clear orange  
and envy your parsimonious pride.  
All ribbons become depths.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
We get the sense  
they must lots to light  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but twisting lonely roads.  
Perhaps they are not buried.  
When you relax played like a echo.  
The starlight re-covering from my curves.  
The irreducable dignity of the door!  
What we say reflects to  
seek some other daughter  
what a detail may teach.  
A line segment outside a line,  
the phosphorus workings of natural law.  
And within my hammock, during the morning, I woke up naked  
and full of tiredness.  
If you were not the orange the gleaming  
moon  
cooks, sprinkling its peach across the universe.  
  
Of a blood colored person that treads bridges.  
You've asked me what the turkey is rising there with his sepia leg?  
I reply, the dew  
knows this.  
I perfume as if behind a frail extinction.  
Carry me onto your helicopter - the lemon of my quilt -
