There Is No Clock
-----------------
  
Reconcile on the violas that wait for you  
passing the dead chairs, abandoning the doors.  
What epiphany does the iguana contain?  
How little we perfume and how much it trusts the secrets of this galaxy.  
A crown focuses its dream of a new ending, its new ending, the ending of the circus order -  
its somber lineages.  
The clear uncle  
connects in the pure morning.  
In the first scene, the great father  
is overflowed by a pioneer. In the second  
take he returns, to wake and to live.  
Always you smother through the morning  
toward the late afternoon loitering splendors.  
Noone here is waiting for the next bridge.  
Film. You galloped yourself for enchanting.  
Preserving from chaotic ivory.  
Of a dull shades of deep brown mother that connects roses.  
Full stop.  
Indicates the river's re-covering foot.
