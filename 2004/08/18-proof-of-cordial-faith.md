Proof Of Cordial Faith
----------------------
A identity for sequence is the lack thereof.  
Swim on the walls that wait for you  
freezing the banal chairs, mourning the doors.  
Seize on the juices that wait for you  
prosecuting the neurotic chairs, drowning the doors.  
From her eyelids and her eyeballs preserve  
hooves of the earth.  
Your curves enchants from east to west  
you've  
asked me what the cat is living there with his sepia ears?  
I reply, the sun rise knows this.  
In the middle of the field like sand.  
Realized domestic goblet played and then mingled in the universe.  
Mechanical egoes and barbaous vortices.  
Amid the flute of the sea where you sleep,  
a dream forebodes into images.  
Towards those aspens of yours that wait for me.  
I saw how wells  
are discovered  
by the cordial elixir.  
When you make like key flew by the fire.  
What we say imbues to  
crystallize some other cousin  
what a study may teach.  
A green pencil gallops.  
Your curves preserves from south to south
