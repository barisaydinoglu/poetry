Proof Of Full Abstraction
-------------------------
Only coat, just the  
energy, nothing but  
it. Cathedral.  
Arrogant brambles and whirlwinds of phlegms.  
I blossom as if outside a misunderstood scandalmongering.  
I could swim cummerbund, depth, and howl  
from lemons and ripples  
with a blood colored quilt  
with trapdoors in my toe.  
Marine jungle to my morbid snow!  
What enchanting mosaics -  
the universe is filled with it,  
railroad  
tracks for the umbrella and the tenacious marble.  
Next to the turqoise sorrow of the moldy banana.
