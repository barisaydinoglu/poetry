Abstraction As Croaks
---------------------
Realized hopeful mirror where lunars meet  
magnoliums meet, next to and amid and the sound  
of holes, to reach out and crystallize in illusion.  
The wounded soldier builds on its insufferable mare  
pacifying burnt umber autumns over the field.  
Because I love you, love, inside the lightning and around the ice.  
A starry sky focuses its dream of a new beginning, its beginning, the ending of the vein order -  
its great holes.  
Wonder is gone, the subject has loved.  
A chorus of crabs at early light of day un heard un degraded  
comes to a halt before a lake.  
If I could love the dust and the moonlight evening.  
I am lunged by eddy and vortex, by oxide and thunder.  
Not the cinnamon moment  
when the lunchtime stands the knaves.
