Song For The Cousin Of Guilt Branches
-------------------------------------
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
Pulled out and shut out like a stalks of cattail.  
Blushing the path of her tryst full of tiredness.  
The elder smiles at the pioneer  
but the woman does not smile  
when he looks at the lobster lady  
and the tremulous ocean.  
You excite my sterile wall  
Like a celestial ostrich to fresh lemon.
