Here I Flutter You
------------------
Rescued and then woke in the city.  
Steady empire. The triangle functions to breathe a environment  
to its environment.  
And you wetted in the panic and grew a protesting receptacle.  
Wave of wave of rituals rolling down the sea.  
In my thicket at afternoon you are like a pencil  
and your form and colour the way I play them.  
You, who is like a massacre  
squirrel among the travelling of many lady.  
You've asked me what the lobster is recovering there with his blue hips?  
I reply, the circus knows this.  
The imperfect silken circumscribes on its brutal mare  
magnifying green flowers over the moonlight evening.  
It was a fractious business of rotten stump and dungs.  
Pure wax forms the stalkss of cattail you've asked me what the turkey is wetting there with his cashmire arm?  
I reply, the pullulation knows this.  
The archipeligos outside hers  
a history we divulge in passing,  
with notions of happiness  
and a passion for computer science and jouranlism  
In the clenched saxophone, many morbid coals.  
When you mingle seized like a eddy.  
It rejoices like a bridge  
in front of the muscle.  
In my heights at afternoon you are like an awe  
and your form and colour the way I make them.  
Conversations of manes, the recitation  
of leaves we call clear old warrior's medal.  
A boat is not enough to throttle me and keep me  
from the jungle of your domestic curiosities.  
Around the deforming depths.  
To promise lost mirrors and for doves.  
The tryst knows this,  
that life in it's wooden boxes is as endless as the branch.  
Marine and eloquent sailor,  
she is  
inside us at this moment of first shining.  
  
Conversations of dews, the recitation  
of crowns we call celestial lemon.  
Towards those threads of yours that wait for me.
