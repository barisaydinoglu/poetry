A Song Of Fear
--------------
My heart moves from being phosphorus to being human.  
Tenacious imperfect chalks and barbaous alarms.  
My heart is filled with felicity like a ceramic stars in the sky.  
This shaken dew and drinking echo electrifies me  
with it's manly candles  
like foot and heart  
and gray muscles like mouth and railroad tracks.  
Indicates the aspen's appreciating ears.  
I  
could relinquish wax, convict, and nail  
from corals and awes  
with a turqoise sun rise  
with sticks in my toe.  
When you live flew like a rose.  
Bristle me and let my substance shine.  
And outside my hammock, during the sunrise, I woke up naked  
and full of decency.
