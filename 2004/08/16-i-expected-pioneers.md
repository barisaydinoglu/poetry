I Expected Pioneers
-------------------
A loaf of bread baked with directionless wonder and salt.  
With the burnt umber mouth of the mud.  
What absorbant faucets -  
the region is filled with it,  
starry skies for the stalks of cattail and the misunderstood chalk.  
Opaque yellow bloody feathers of trash,  
opaque opaque green seams above a hollow railroad track.  
Where faucets meet  
schools meet, in front of and among and the sound  
of masks, to reach out and relinquish in illusion.  
In the first take, the electrical god  
is faltered by a mountaineer. In the second  
scene he returns, to reconcile and to attract.  
  
You - the velvety breath.  
You expand headlong into a divisions to enrich your business.
