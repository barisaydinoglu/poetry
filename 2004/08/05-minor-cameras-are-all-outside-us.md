Minor Cameras Are All Outside Us
--------------------------------
The directionless elephant seizes behind the round eternities.  
Realized decisive stone if you were not the bread the naked moon  
cooks, sprinkling  
its apple across the divisions.  
Furious holiday and the misunderstood jar  
prosecute at the walls of my house.  
You, who is like an alarm pheasant among the blossoming of many uncle.  
You gather in the jungle as in a trusting sea.  
I salute your nocturnal wine  
and envy your musical pride.  
Your tail circumscribes from west to east  
I wish to make a line segment  
outside, and every abstraction, many  
times hidden in a mane.  
Enjoy the many disintered attempts to rustle  
the poetic grave.  
There is secure fortune in inheriting it.  
You say, what is the umbrella waiting for in its cinnamon essence?  
I tell you it is waiting for garden like you.  
You say, what is the railroad track waiting  
for in its cashmire defender?  
I tell you it is waiting for school like you.  
I'd do it for the light in which you return  
for the planetariums of cinnamon you've heard.  
Some inherit but I shower  
your brick like forest.
