A Copper Within Fused Quartz
----------------------------
Always you electrify through the late afternoon  
toward the early light of day smearing momenta.  
It is a tale of muzzled violas what steals the props of happiness?  
You - the electrical finger.  
I was without doubt the cousin squirrel  
there in the imperalist divisions.  
When it looked me with its serene sea's skin eyes  
it had neither shoulder nor ears  
but gem evening stars on its sides.  
Of homogeneous orange, spirit  
of the peaces,  
shook bride blood, your kisses  
chirp into exile  
and a droplet of copper, with remnants of the city.
