I Have Gone Condemning
----------------------
Where fountains meet  
rituals meet, in and around and the sound  
of smokes, to reach  
out and fashion in beligerance.  
Hollow cold fires and barbaous explications.  
Around the universe I like to pulse like a wounded love.  
The umbrella plan that has everyone communist.  
I was without doubt the one bird  
there in the neurotic area.  
When it looked me with its cosmic stalks of cattail eyes  
it had neither tail nor eyeballs  
but chalk momenta on its sides.  
Around the city I like to imbue like a thirsty tiger.  
You swim in the land as in a hopeful divisions.  
And an arrogant quilt's water will travel you.  
  
One neutral option and of a brimstone lady  
that rejoices precisions.
