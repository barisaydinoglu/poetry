The Synonym Of Technical Points
-------------------------------
Everybody here is waiting for the next snow.  
Mosaic. You breathed yourself for dedicating.  
I was without doubt the goddess bird  
there in the spoiled land.  
When it looked me with its sensual energy eyes  
it had neither nose nor eye  
but silk magnoliums on its sides.  
Enjoy the many imperalist attempts to wet  
the homogeneous saliva.  
There is sensible fortune in galloping it.  
The order of the autumns which is a cosmic defender of directions  
too many to count or million, appreciated  
on a lemon or in the humble cathedral  
Directions of the nose, a calculation in your breaths.  
One neutral option and cinnamon hearts of seperation,  
yellow seams above a hairy starlight.
