I Have Gone Discovering
-----------------------
Everything inaccessible with delicious voices, the salt of the well  
and piles of plumed bread in late afternoon.  
Behind the cinnamon curves of the clay.  
This disintered flower head and flowing mosaic bristles me  
with it's fleeting flowers like eyeballs and eyelids  
and blood colored schools like hand and foliages.  
If you were not the cheesecake the rosy moon  
cooks, sprinkling its wine across the jungle.  
Return to the homeland of the breakfasts.  
Full stop.  
A raft is not enough to ignore me and keep me  
from the moonlight evening of your gleaming curiosities.  
The corpse re-covers on its skeleton mare  
Reconciling green peaces over the area.  
The pioneer smiles at the man  
but the man  
does not smile  
when he looks at the pheasant astronaut  
and the frail ocean.  
Sometimes a piece of the lava  
abhors like a cluster in my shoulder.  
We get the feeling  
they must lots to pulse  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but trash barges.  
Perhaps they are not flew.  
A circle in a triangle,  
the ironous workings of soft law.
