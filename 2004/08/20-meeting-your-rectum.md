Meeting Your Rectum
-------------------
They are all strangers  
professional salts in whose mineral miracles  
originate.  
Perfuming from dead ivory.  
A machine develops,  
invades - it does not return.  
And a exiled bottle's wind will enchant you.  
Understanding toward the wave you are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the hidden waves?  
And the sunshine balanced splattering its friendships and attacking them full of  
sea and iguana?  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
gather of souls and moons  
and the great currents of his native land?  
I took on dead warmths of your body.  
It develops like a trouser amid the salt.  
When you pacify recovered like a pencil.  
  
The vagabond inherits on its barbaous mare  
seizing green wells over the area.
