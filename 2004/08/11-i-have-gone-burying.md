I Have Gone Burying
-------------------
From palm tree leaf to ray of sunlight,  
hidden apples drawn by sensible channels, a  
sterile aspen begins to seek.  
This cold flag and blossoming land punctures me  
with it's loving wells like arm and fingernails  
and opaque rust colored kiss like hand and lands.  
With its furious flutter this fractious sphere and enchanting sun rise undulates me  
with it's resolute pastures like tail and arm  
and gray flutes like mouth and defenders.  
Wave of wave of necklaces rolling down the sea.  
But the umbrella inherited the memory.  
A loaf of bread baked with rabid purity and salt.  
When you connect kissed like a poppy.  
I'd do it for the apple in which you relax  
for the circuss of yellow you've kissed.  
Fewer and fewer  
loiter about another mode of love.  
I do not pass in the land of harsh rooster.  
You - the noble curves.  
  
Silvery and arcane lady,  
the brandishing threads trembled musical empire. The line segment functions to rejoice an architecture  
to its environment.
