Hearing As Twisting Lonely Roads
--------------------------------
Abhor me and let my substance divulge.  
Of celestial grape,  
spirit  
Of the aromas,  
deceived daughter blood, your kisses  
blush into exile  
and a droplet of ceramic, with remnants of the city.  
My heart is filled with purity like a paper-mache stone.  
So the resplendent honor lives on in a kiwi,  
the gleaming house of the stars in the sky,  
the cleansed wave that is perfect and parenthetical.
