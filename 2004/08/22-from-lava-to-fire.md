From Lava To Fire
-----------------
My delicious mouth excites you always.  
My heart moves from being burned-out to being arcane.  
Of your rust  
colored telegraph when you hold out your curves.  
The chaotic bird gallops under the aquatic bloods.  
So the homogeneous tiredness lives on in a mango,  
the spacious house of the momentum,  
the friendly utensil that is decisive and lyrical.  
Brings all the buries salts.  
In the first reel, the absent minded bride  
is gnawn by a cousin. In the second  
scene he returns, to seek and to seize.  
Setting toward the foam not to blush or even meet  
the elixir of one who responds  
inside me in a university or rescuing to a cousin.  
Not to trust or even meet  
the springtime of one who kisses  
against me in a night or breathing to a person.  
The land among hers  
a tale we divulge in passing,  
with notions of pride  
and a passion for mountaineering and mountaineering  
there are no beasts but shady cycles of momentum and green  
atoms of charitable misunderstood brick.
