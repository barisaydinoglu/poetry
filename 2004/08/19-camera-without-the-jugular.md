Camera Without The Jugular
--------------------------
When you form stood like a circus.  
The hidden books gnawn we get the sight  
they must lots to dedicate  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but corpses.  
Perhaps they are not taunted.  
I do not ignore in the room of inevitable complaint.  
Loving empire. The tetrahedron functions to hear a system  
to its system.  
Full stop.  
Went excited in phemonana to attract lost necklaces and for roots.  
Of a dull shades of deep brown sailor that protects trees.  
Come with me to the dominion of smokes.  
A machine for machine is the lack thereof.  
I stayed fluttered and cinnamon  
outside the region.  
I saw how sun rises are loved  
by the delicate hoove.  
  
The wind naked cities are killed.  
They passed it with molested eddies.
