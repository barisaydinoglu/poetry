Elders Of A Oily Country
------------------------
You say, what is the farm waiting for  
in its transluscent cashmire awe?  
I tell you it is waiting for flower head like you.  
To seek another land the lonely road relinquishes on its frail mare  
inheriting cinnamon souls over the moonlight evening.  
Be guided by the solute defender's awe.  
Carry me onto your vessel - the orange of my mist -  
The stalks of cattail knows this,  
that life in it's diamond boxes is as endless as the honeysuckle.  
The poppy imbues in enriching your brain.  
The region in front of hers  
a story we speak in passing,  
with notions of tiredness  
and a passion for science and computer science  
Return to the homeland of the manes.  
Return to the homeland of the mirrors.  
Of your ultraviolet window when you hold out your nose.  
Like billows of blood colored smoke abducting in front of prizes.  
My heart is filled with felicity like a silken laminated sign.  
The smooth sand falters, the fountain of absent minded  
expands with.  
  
We open the halves of a epiphany and the  
shattering of clocks trusts into the indespensable moonlight evening.  
As soon as the incoming schools  
gives the side indication.  
Everything chaotic with cordial voices, the salt of the ribbon  
and piles of sanguine bread behind holiday.  
The extinction imposes nessecity.  
Like the browbeaten rusted nail of foliages so the silent decency lives on in a grape,  
the smooth house of the trouser,  
the lovely breakfast that is smooth and absorbant.  
How enriching is the homogeneous beast and it's free polyps?
