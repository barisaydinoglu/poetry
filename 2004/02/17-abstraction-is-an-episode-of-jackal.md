Abstraction Is An Episode Of Jackal
-----------------------------------
And warmths and mists.  
The sea water understanding from my heart.  
You - the lyrical eyelids.  
With the energy of the room where you sleep,  
a dream attacks into calculations.  
With the burnt umber hand of the fire.  
The circus mingles in rescuing your shoulder.  
How flowing is the serendipidous vigil and it's electric torrents?  
I wish to make a tetrahedron  
among, and every faith, many  
times hidden in a femininity.  
A grape -like city  
and you decayed in the sorrow and transformed a deforming polyp.  
  
Of your turqoise utensil when you hold out your toe.  
The billows of brimstone smoke imposes nessecity.  
It's a transforming silence of conspirators.  
But the school travelled the memory.  
I want you to promise on my fingernails.  
Because I love you, love, around the heat and in the mud.  
In the middle of the divisions like steel.
