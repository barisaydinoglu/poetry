Here I Begin You
----------------
The I in precision towards those windows of yours that wait for me. A wreath focuses its dream of a new ending, its beginning, the ending of the sun order -  
its absent minded conglomerates.  
Inside the boulevard like brick.  
The hearts exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
within it in darkness.
