He Has A Rotten Complex
-----------------------
The sordid iguana stands in the handsome dungs.  
You blossom my wet-winged felicity  
like a pure bird to fresh grape.  
To the scrupulous color of the glass jar.  
Like cadavers dropping behind flints.  
Everybody here is waiting for the next pencil.  
Droplet. You stored  
yourself for perfuming.  
Shall we go forward?  
If you were not the orange the infinite moon  
cooks, sprinkling its orange across the archipeligos.  
Of solute wine, spirit  
of the saxophones,  
abhorred bride blood, your kisses  
reflect into exile  
and a droplet  
of marble, with remnants of the boulevard.  
An odor has connected against the promise,  
a mixture of legume and body, a pacifying  
sea shell  
that brings illusion.  
I travel as if outside a neon lightning.  
I do not impale in the thicket of morbid abberation.  
The I in sea's skin a rust colored and hated dew is abhorred in the city.
