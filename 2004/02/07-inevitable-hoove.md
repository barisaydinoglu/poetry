Inevitable Hoove
----------------
Of your dark pencil when you hold  
out your breath.  
With the bird feather of the archipeligos where you sleep,  
a dream conquers into productions.  
Sometimes a piece of the electricity  
shakes like a tiger in my curves.  
Come with me to the vortex of dominions.  
There are many oblivions outside harsh events.  
I stayed protected and yellow  
outside the jungle.  
Nothing but your promising ears.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
create of wells and dews  
and the gleaming serenities of his native land?  
You say, what is the salt waiting for in its crimson perfume?  
I tell  
you it is waiting for wreath like you.  
Indicates the pencil's breathing leg.  
I'd do it for the poppy in which you shower  
for the planetariums of silvery you've rustled.  
Behind the falling trapdoors.  
Around the wreath of the archipeligos where you sleep,  
a dream brainwashes into projections.  
Pure ghost responds the evening stars a cinnamon law discovers.  
What we say enchants to  
play some other mother  
what a technique may teach.  
To the plumed color of the gem path.  
A signal hears,  
gnaws - it does not return.  
Here I am, a resolute tail conquered in the area of time.
