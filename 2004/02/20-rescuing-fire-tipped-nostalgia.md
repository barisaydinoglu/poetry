Rescuing Fire-tipped Nostalgia
------------------------------
Not living is a form of pulsing.  
The I in foam I was without doubt the giant lobster  
there in the shifty archipeligos.  
When it looked me with its free ripple eyes  
it had neither curves nor shoulder  
but cork laminated signs on its sides.  
To the careful clear circus my heart is filled with felicity like a diamond sphere.  
Your toe drinks from north to south  
In front of the transparent tail of the water.  
Towards those springtimes of yours that wait for me.
