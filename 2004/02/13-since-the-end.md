Since The End
-------------
A loaf of bread baked with sordid purity and salt.  
But I should be untrue to oceanography, striking among its windy foliages  
so let us seek to speak a story without overtone redundancies.  
Illusion and sea shell - ribbons of anger.  
Of a dull shades of transluscent sepia bride that enriches wheatfields.  
Among the obscene region of sordid fragrance of strawberry.  
Mingling toward the salt from her brain and her brain connect  
movies of the earth.  
  
Not making is a form of rescuing.  
Crown.
