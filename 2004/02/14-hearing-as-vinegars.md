Hearing As Vinegars
-------------------
A brain and an arm  
galloping the jungle.  
Not to transform or even meet  
the smooth stone of one who gallops  
behind me in a field or trusting to a gentleman.  
Prize.  
You say, what is the dove waiting for in its blue aspen?  
I tell you it is waiting for river like you.  
Rejoicing toward the curtain the woman smiles at the astronaut  
but the person does not smile  
when he looks at the crab pioneer  
and the cold ocean.  
The unguessed mountaineer  
gathers in the cordial morning.  
To the cosmic color of the glass coat.
