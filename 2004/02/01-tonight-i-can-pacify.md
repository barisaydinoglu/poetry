Tonight I Can Pacify
--------------------
Nobody here is waiting for the next promise.  
Saxophone. You woke yourself for living.  
You've asked me what the turkey is growing there with his burnt umber fingernails?  
I reply,  
the curtain knows this.  
Nothing but your loving tail.  
And the angel to its old warrior's medal  
and among the momenta the humble one  
the son covered with naked stone.  
  
For a day, maybe too many to count,  
I rested under a pillow of fog  
at a bus stop, waiting for the pioneer to be in front of.  
So the honest honor lives on in a fruit,  
the monastic house of the pasture,  
the parenthetical atom that is solute and hopeful.
