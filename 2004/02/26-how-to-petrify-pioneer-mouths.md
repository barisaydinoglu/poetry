How To Petrify Pioneer Mouths
-----------------------------
You upgrade my insufferable vagabond  
like a lyrical squirrel to fresh peach. A silent snow of stalkss of cattail.  
Shut out and shut out like a productivity.  
Outside the flower  
head of the vicinity where you sleep,  
a dream kills into points of view.  
Like harsh foam, serendipities  
always you congeal through the lunchtime  
toward the holiday faltering saxophones.  
Not attracting is a form of waking.  
Loved and then rescued in the room.  
A current of deedy moon  
that does not know why it flows and performs.  
In the first reel, the lion hearted gentleman  
is chained by a fisherman.  
In the second  
scene he returns, to return and to seek.
