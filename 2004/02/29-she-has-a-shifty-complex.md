She Has A Shifty Complex
------------------------
And a shady thread's earth will pacify you.  
A femininity focuses its dream of a ending, its new beginning, the new ending of the sun order -  
its promising flasks.  
Nothing but that wine bottle of branches.  
Eddy.  
Carry me onto your wheel - the mango of my  
femininity -  
enjoy the many  
wayside attempts to inherit  
the great rotten stump.  
There is sanguine fortune in dawning it.  
  
Not to tread or even meet  
the tree of one who creates  
against me in a jungle or fashioning to a lady.  
In my sea at sunset you are like a wreath  
and your form and colour the way I rustle them.
