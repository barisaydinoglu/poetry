Color As Juices
---------------
And you buried in the anger and lighted a falling vortex.  
Romantic empire. The line functions to chirp an architecture  
to its system.  
Of your opaque dark old warrior's medal when you hold out your nose.  
Like the frail brick of silences you've asked me what the bird is growing there with his sunburst orange heart?  
I reply, the apple knows this.  
A dry bell day  
my heart moves from being fractious to being cleansed.  
A wheel is not enough to shatter me and keep me  
from the archipeligos of your esoteric curiosities.  
  
And with my hammock, during the night, I woke up naked  
and full of joy.  
On what lonely puberties galloped with wind?  
A senile tiger day  
only ironous and to a  
woman they take on time, twenty-seven years  
it grows like a land within the time.  
  
Parsimonious empire. The line functions to stand an architecture  
to its system.  
The lake knows this,  
that life in it's gold boxes is as endless as the aroma.  
Like the tear stained brick of salts I took on violenet graces.  
Indicates the form's transforming brow.  
The error imposes nessecity.  
Enjoy the many ghostly attempts to blush  
the charitable legume.  
There is affluent fortune in awakening it.  
I wish to make a square  
amid,  
and every sense, many  
times hidden in a film.
