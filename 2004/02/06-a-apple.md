A Apple
-------
Realized rosy drop the universe next to hers  
a history we divulge in passing,  
with notions of decency  
and a passion for oceanography and science  
I saw how mirrors are travelled  
by the esoteric autumn.  
Because I love you, love, within the ice and in the jungle.  
Be guided by the irreducable autumn's dew.  
You've asked me what the jaguar is waking  
there with his sunburst orange lip?  
I reply, the garden knows this.  
Sepia and esoteric lady,  
and outside my hammock, during the holiday, I woke up naked  
and full of wonder.
