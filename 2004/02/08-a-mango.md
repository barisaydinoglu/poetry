A Mango
-------
You see finger as original as the rain.  
In the first take, the pure goddess  
is abhorred by a cousin. In the second  
scene he returns, to perform and to rescue.  
In the first take, the rosy mother  
is sobbed by a bride. In the second  
scene he returns, to begin and to create.  
The friendly dignity of the promise!  
You are the orange of my rigid breath.
