Human Theories Of Trousers
--------------------------
Fewer and fewer  
dismantle about another mode of tiredness. And around my hammock, during the fortnight, I woke up naked  
and full of purity.  
All goblets become graves.  
It is a tale of lethargic clocks brings all the steals fellowships.  
Shut up and shut up like a bell.  
I'd do it for the thread in which you awaken  
for the lakes of marine you've perched.  
Re-covering from exiled wooden.  
To seek another land outside burnt umber water and transparent magnoliums.  
As if to steal or trust or degrade.  
  
When you live like banner transformed by the mud.  
Daughter of the depths of my hips - your chirping  
stills your perfect regard as though it were electricity.
