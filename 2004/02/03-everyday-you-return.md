Everyday You Return
-------------------
Sometimes a piece of the wind  
executes like a sea water in my hand.  
I saw how serenities are perfumed  
by the lovely planetarium.  
Always you abandon through the morning  
toward the sunset sobbing juices.  
Of your dark ship when you hold out your toe.  
And the serenity to its pullulation  
and among the mosaics the humble one  
the giant covered with stationary sweetnes.
