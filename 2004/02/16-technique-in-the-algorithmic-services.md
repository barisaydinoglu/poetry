It was a forceful business of phlegm and shrapnels.  
Sometimes a piece of the fire  
undulates like a candle in my eye.  
I could carry explication, corruption, and scandalmongering  
from echoes and ripples  
with a red poppy  
with wastelands in my eye. And mirrors and cactuss.  
Of smooth lemon, spirit  
of the maps,  
pitied man blood,  
your kisses  
trust into exile  
and a droplet of gem, with remnants of the chimney.
