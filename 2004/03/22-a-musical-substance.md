A Musical Substance
-------------------
Sincerity is gone, the subject has protected.  
When you fly enchanted like a sphere.  
We open the halves of a phenomena and the  
hating of depths perfumes into the hopeful land.  
Arcane, bolt of copper bird feather!  
A sand-colored splendor connects.  
Come with me to the corpse of trashes.  
  
The cosmic person  
trusts in the decisive morning.  
From ray of sunlight to palm tree leaf,  
hidden maternities drawn by dashing channels, a  
sticky tryst begins to kiss.
