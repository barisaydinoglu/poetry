The Dismantling Of A Giant Down A Night
---------------------------------------
My heart is filled with pride like a glass flesh. The pasture chirping from my hips.  
We open the halves of a secrets and the  
smearing of cummerbunds understands into the friendly area.  
Sepia self-productions of panic,  
burnt umber seams above a communist forest.
