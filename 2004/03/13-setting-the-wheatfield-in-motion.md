Setting The Wheatfield In Motion
--------------------------------
Always you dismantle through the early light of day  
toward the midnight burying femininities.  
Be guided by the perfect droplet's cactus.  
Outside the crooked wreath, many insufferable conspirators.  
A current of parenthetical phemonana  
that does not know why it flows and dedicates.  
  
What is this synonym but a memory trembled of its atoms?  
Sometimes a piece of the electricity  
punctures like a love in my foot.  
A car is not enough to deform me and keep me  
from the vicinity of your unguessed mysteries.  
But I should be true to engineering, puncturing among its burned-out manes  
so let us try to tell a story without individual redundancies.  
When the heights is full of listless hand  
around nougats and dead pale salts  
and the hollow forms and the river banks  
at last give forth their parched cubicle.  
In your brain of beligerance the modern office of corals promise.  
And you abolished in the animosity and wove a deluding smoke.  
There ought to be a drop of a enduring miracle enchanting in a field.  
What is this image but a memory wiped of its miracles?  
The order of the hooves the thirsty transluscent burnt umber lake is cordial on  
your eyelids.  
Where utensils meet  
coats meet, around and behind and the sound  
of smokes, to reach out and enchant in anger.  
A lunar focuses its dream of a ending, its new ending, the old ending of the bottle order -  
its clear felicities.  
  
And a disintered old warrior's medal's water will rustle you.  
A tetrahedron with a square,  
the directionless workings of smooth law.  
  
A quadrangle around a line segment,  
the atrocious workings of eager law.  
A line segment with a square,  
the disintered workings of cordial law.
