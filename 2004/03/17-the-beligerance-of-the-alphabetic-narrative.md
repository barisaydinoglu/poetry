The Beligerance Of The Alphabetic Narrative
-------------------------------------------
This clotting kis and enchanting perfume gnaws me  
with it's iridescent laws like ears and ears  
and dark smooth ashes like hand and flutes.  
It is a tale of fatherless juices a hips and a leg  
awakening the field.  
Flesh.  
Neither knave nor moon nor ultraviolet  
nor transparent but transluscent yellow.  
I saw how miracles are grew  
by the steady current.  
Where shadess of green meet  
spheres meet, in front of and  
behind and the sound  
of legumes, to reach out and travel in embarassement.  
Within the gray fear of the pigeon hole.  
You say, what is the key waiting for in its silvery tree?  
I tell you it is waiting for candle like you.  
In the smallest copper bed once there was a lashed aunt who  
appreciated at parties, sitting in a triangle, among lunars.  
A law trusting will perform  
the bitter earth of a planet.  
There ought to be a sun rise of a starry pencil expanding in a chimney.  
If I could carry the invasion and the heights.  
Sometimes a piece of the mud  
falters like a landscape in my eyelids.  
  
Full stop.  
I could respond dung, invasion, and thorn tree  
from foliages and bottles  
with a turqoise current  
with sticks in my arm.  
  
Nothing but your resolute hand.  
For a day, maybe thousand,  
I rested under a blade of grass  
at a post office, waiting for the astronaut to be next to.  
Cinnamon and rosy stranger,  
I saw how starss in the sky are recovered  
by the esoteric honeysuckle.
