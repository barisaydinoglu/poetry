He Has A Blood-stained Complex
------------------------------
On what windy cubicles flew with mud?  
The wonderful dignity of the sea's skin!  
With its fire-tipped grow enjoy the many bleak attempts to flutter  
the full wound.  
There is steady fortune in crystallizing it.  
I salute your eloquent wine  
and envy your pure pride.  
What natural laminated signs -  
the chimney is filled with it,  
aromas for the umbrella and the dead chalk.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
Enchanted and then relinquished in the vicinity.  
I saw how splendors are kissed  
by the domestic star.  
Indicates the drop's inheriting fingernails.  
But the transluscent green car stored the memory.  
Towards those ribbons of yours that wait for me.  
  
In the smallest cedar quilt and starry skies and hooves.  
There are no bones but wounded cycles of atom and sunburst orange  
necklaces of wide ironous rusted nail.
