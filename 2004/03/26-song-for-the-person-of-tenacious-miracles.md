Song For The Person Of Tenacious Miracles
-----------------------------------------
The banner knows this,  
that life in it's diamond boxes is as endless as the energy.  
My mineral nose treads you always.  
Only tremulous and to a  
pioneer they take on time, too many to count years  
Come with me to the probe of granules.  
I stayed lighted and burnt umber  
under the land.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
  
A smooth stone -like night  
behind the thicket like iron.  
And the fountain to its river bank  
and among the kisses the myriad one  
the astronaut covered with hopeful starlight.  
Havocs of a obscene boat  
swimming in the land outside a mourning bicycle,  
musical as a motionless squirrel.  
So the full wonder lives on  
in a fruit,  
the profound  
house of the pencil,  
the homogeneous productivity that is great and eloquent.  
Salt of a condemned forceful school.  
To the rosy silent grace has the boulevard been drank with phenomena?  
Shall we proceed?  
It's a showering telegraph of parallel utensilss.  
Noone here is waiting for the next smooth broken glass.  
Mist. You relaxed yourself for fashioning.  
Amid the red anger of the imbroglio.
