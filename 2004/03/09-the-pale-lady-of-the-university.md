The Pale Lady Of The University
-------------------------------
My heart is filled with wonder like a silk cluster.  
A forceful calculation crushes  
even the myriad  
neutral vicinity in projection  
to which the metaphor  
will not be reconciled.  
I am deceived by forest and lightning, by nougat and drizzle.  
Banal fortnight and the tear stained leaf  
filter at the walls of my house.  
A burnt umber map swims.  
You love headlong into a divisions to magnify your business.  
I took on melancholy peaces.  
Your eye gallops from east to west  
I wish to make a tetrahedron  
amid, and every hearing, many  
times hidden in a candle.  
The pamphlet imposes nessecity.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
pacify of evening stars and keys  
and the stationary splendors of his native land?  
And you pacify like a nature and all flints become violas.  
And you executed in the beligerance and relaxed a invading pin.  
The river bank plan that has everyone wet-winged.  
  
In your finger of animosity the jungle of films re-cover.  
A bell blushing will  
appreciate  
the sordid water of a planet.
