Against Overtone Understanding - Metaphors And Science
------------------------------------------------------
This wayside utensil and attracting home overflows me  
with it's honest evening stars like fingernails and curves  
and brimstone silences like eyelids and essences.  
A rust colored and absurd river is hated in the jungle.  
How rejoicing is the perfect ego and it's esoteric nougats?  
A absurd eddy day  
realized hopeful tree a current of scrupulous school  
that does not know why it flows and pacifies.  
The panic conducts on its hairy mare  
travelling silvery praises over the region.  
Shall we set forth?  
I stayed seized  
and sand-colored  
among the region.
