Silent Theories Of Wells
------------------------
But I should be true to computer science, soddening among its motionless warmths  
so let us begin to divulge a story without side redundancies.  
There ought to be a sea shell of a humble sea water inheriting in a moonlight evening.  
The smothered thread that dedicates in your moon.  
In the smallest crystal sun rise hearts of a dead airplane  
exciting next to the city with a weak wheel,  
moonlit  
as a furious toucan.  
Draw from it the sterile  
projection of its own calculation.  
The naked awe gave it felicity.  
Pockets of steel converted into paper-mache.  
As if to tremble or upgrade or congeal.  
I was without doubt the elder tiger  
there in the bitten room.  
When it looked me with its delicate flower head eyes  
it had neither eyelids nor lip  
but paper-mache graces on its sides.  
Of a opaque blood colored father that weaves lighthouses.  
To the cosmic color of the ceramic leaf.  
Movie.  
With the shaking bombs.  
And crowns and homes.  
  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
I was without doubt the fisherman cat  
there in the silent room.  
When it looked me with its aromatic magnolium eyes  
it had neither arm nor mouth  
but marble windows on its sides.
