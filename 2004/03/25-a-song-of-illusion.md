A Song Of Illusion
------------------
Sorrow and flag - keys of confusion.  
Here I am, a changeless brain abandoned in the archipeligos of grace.  
The I in wave the I in ritual pockets of iron converted into cork.  
But the heart recovered the memory.  
A hand and a hand  
attracting the night.  
Conversations of drops, the recitation  
of maternities we call absorbant railroad track.  
The spheres exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
behind it in darkness.  
A loaf of bread baked with frail joy and salt.  
The pullulations exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
outside it in darkness.  
  
A chorus of ostriches at early light of day un trusted un undulated  
comes to a halt before a cluster.
