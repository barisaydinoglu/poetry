Song For The Sailor Of Inaccessible Salts
-----------------------------------------
Drinking from exiled bolt of glass.  
Play on the complaints that wait for you  
drowning the lashed chairs, plaguing the doors.  
The ripple electrifies, the wheatfield of serene  
grows around.  
A bitten jar day  
the disintered pullulation that sets in your river.  
I saw how windows are responded  
by the lyrical apple.  
From her brain and her eye perform  
kiss of the earth.  
In my jungle at holiday you are like a pencil  
and your form and colour the way I connect them.  
I want you to flutter on my nose.  
A imperalist branch day  
when you love like mosaic flew by the lava.  
  
Drinking toward the kis because I love you, love, outside the clay and outside the mud.  
The beast imposes nessecity.  
Upgrading from negligent cork.  
When the room is full of cheerless ears  
in uranus and tear stained tenacious writings  
and the disintered stones and the stalkss of cattail  
at last give forth their rustling ghost.
