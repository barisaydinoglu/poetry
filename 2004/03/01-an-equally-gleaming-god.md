An Equally Gleaming God
-----------------------
With opaque sand-colored water and green gardens.  
Sometimes a piece of the mud  
devours like a perfume in my lip.  
Be guided by the verdure guitar's drop.  
Behind the field like graphite.  
And meetings of inaccessible nose your dew is a wave filled with rustling muscle.  
Sordid bloodied aluminums and molested masks.  
  
There are many utensils outside whirlwinds of events.  
In cinnamon water and deep brown poppies.
