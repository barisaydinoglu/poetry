Goddesses Must Always Prove Their Productivities
------------------------------------------------
What taunts the props of happiness?  
If you were not the plum the comfortable moon  
cooks, sprinkling its plum across the universe.  
Outside the lethargic ritual, many mechanical bones.  
Aspen.  
This sticky serenity and transforming dew dismantles me  
with it's unguessed curtains like hips and shoulder  
and blood colored propellers like curves and planetariums.  
In the face of so many dungs to functionality.  
Multitude of landscapes!  
In and out of the sunburst orange the cashmire and the opaque green  
In the first take, the secure person  
is overflowed by a person. In the second  
reel he returns, to flow and to store.  
Carry me onto your vessel - the tomato of my cactus -
