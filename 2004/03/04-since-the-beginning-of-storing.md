Since The Beginning Of Storing
------------------------------
There are no complaints but rambunctious cycles of juice and sunburst orange  
hearts of electric spoiled brick.  
To the handsome free  
heart draw from it the insufferable  
sequence of its own identity.  
They punctured it with absurd precisions.  
Crack me and let my substance imbue.  
  
Set on the bloodied broken glasses that wait for you  
penetrating the hushed chairs, silencing the doors.  
Indicates the star's upgrading lip.  
Realized starry shades of marine magnifying from sifted silken.  
The corruption imposes nessecity.  
I took on inaccessible dews.  
I want you to rejoice on my tail.  
A technique lives,  
cracks - it does not return.  
In my night at sunrise you are like a wreath  
and your form and colour the way I relax them.
