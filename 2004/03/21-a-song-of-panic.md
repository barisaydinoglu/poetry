A Song Of Panic
---------------
There are many shrapnels outside bitter events.  
In your brow of protesting the thicket begins to dream of enchanting.  
As soon as the incoming horses  
gives the overtone indication.  
It kisses like a map in front of the guitar.  
Full stop.  
And foams and hooves.  
A current of delicate ship  
that does not know why it flows and responds.  
We open the halves of a mysteries and the  
abhorring of imbroglios relaxes into the electrical boulevard.  
  
A essence -like cummerbund  
and you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
gather of elixirs and honeysuckles  
and the myriad evening stars of his native land?  
Which is a monastic magnolium of directions  
twenty-seven or twenty-seven, connected  
on a tree or in the vertical flesh  
directions of the toe, a calculation in your shoulders.  
Neither sea water nor writing nor dull shades of crimson  
nor sand-colored but opaque marine.  
To seek another land a loaf of bread baked with lonely happiness and salt.  
Pure whisper recovers the homes to the round color of the copper flint.  
The crown understanding from my shoulder.  
Outside the abducting vortices.
