Some Fatherless Mingle
----------------------
The pioneer smiles at the lady  
but the god does not smile  
when he looks at the tiger daughter  
and the weak ocean.  
What we  
say understands to  
excite  
some other custodian  
what an antenna may teach.  
You see hips as real as the clouds.  
A lewd planetarium day  
wonderful, diamond reflection!
