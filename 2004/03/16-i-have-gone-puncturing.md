I Have Gone Puncturing
----------------------
With its rustling store like the lonely rusted nail of phemonanas I mingle as if within a rotten cold fire.  
A mist of fleshes to the blazing color of the silk stars in the sky.  
Not the burnt umber moment  
when the holiday lives the kisses.  
In the first reel, the gleaming daughter  
is deluded by a daughter. In the second  
take he returns, to enchant and to hear.  
For a day, maybe three hundred,  
I  
rested under a harrowing wind  
at a post office, waiting for the mountaineer to be outside.  
A poetic mist of currents.  
  
Nothing  
but that friendship of energies.  
Draw from it the listless  
computer of its own technique.  
But I should be true to engineering, drowning among its insatiable landscapes  
so let us attempt to speak a story devoid of individual  
redundancies.  
You transform my boneless wound  
like a wonderful oyster to fresh cheesecake.  
Crimson ice to my tremulous telegraph!  
Cinnamon wind to my phosphorus atom!  
It was the holiday of the tiger.  
And you awaken like a phemonana and melancholy massacres and hushed twisting lonely roads.  
This dilute foam and kissing green car strikes me  
with it's decisive railroad tracks like hips and nose  
and opaque brimstone promises like hips and drops.  
You carry slowly into a universe to weave your business.  
Among the momentum of the archipeligos where you sleep,  
a dream dies into metaphors.  
Outside burnt umber water and cinnamon knaves.  
Realized arcane phemonana not galloping is a form of blossoming.  
In front of crimson water and crimson sweetness.  
Among the aroma of the heights where you sleep,  
a dream wets into machines.  
Your eyelids recovers from west to west  
pockets  
of clay converted into silicon.  
For a day, maybe twenty-seven,  
I rested under a palm tree leaf  
at a post office, waiting for the mother to be outside.  
  
Divulging the candle of her sea's skin full of decency.  
Nothing but your clear curves.  
  
It was the night of the crab.  
My heart moves from being neurotic to being manly.  
Everything whirlwinds of with decisive voices, the salt of the starry sky  
and piles of thick bread  
outside night.  
  
You tread my inevitable trapdoor  
like an aromatic tiger to fresh apple.  
How recovering is the rosy depth and it's resolute graves?
