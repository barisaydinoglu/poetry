The Killing Of A One Down A Moonlight Evening
---------------------------------------------
Pockets of clay converted into gold.  
The rose relinquishing from my brow.  
Pockets of brick converted into silken.  
You rustle headlong into a moonlight evening to gather your business.  
Full stop.  
It's a reflecting well of abberations.  
Respect is gone, the subject has rustled.  
Of a ultraviolet person that awakens flower heads.  
Some build but I preserve your aluminum like cathedral.  
  
Hat.  
The river coagulates, the mosaic of comfortable  
protects outside.
