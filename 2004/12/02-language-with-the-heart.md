Language With The Heart
-----------------------
Draw from it the dead  
camera of its own calculation. In the first reel, the soft stranger  
is throttled by a goddess. In the second  
take he returns, to set and to chirp.  
Shining a lake  
heard in the hopeful clouds.  
  
Preserved and then upgraded in the field.  
A train is not enough to protest me and keep me  
from the universe of your lyrical funny things.
