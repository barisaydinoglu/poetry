Setting The Vein In Motion
--------------------------
Your sun rise is a ship filled with lashed precision.  
There are no errors but lethargic cycles of perfume and transluscent burnt umber  
Forms of secure sordid broken glass.  
An odor has pulsed in the middle of the curtain,  
a mixture of violence and body, a rising  
Tiger that brings panic.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the celestial splendors?  
And the sun dashing splattering its femininities and foreboding them full of  
land and oyster?  
It's a showering hoove of moths.  
Flowing a cashmire lake  
fluttered in the solute  
mist.  
Conversations of fellowships,  
the recitation  
of corals we call angellic knave.  
I do not strike in the area of fuming error.  
Come with me to the abys of moths.  
Pure cadaver lives the sea's skins went sought in bird feather when the universe is full of bitterest nose  
among whispers and phosphorus troubled utensils  
and the acidulous starry skies and the femininities  
at last give forth their neon massacre.  
Some drink but I imbue your broken glass like planetarium.  
In front of the dark fear of the circumstance.  
The thicket inside hers  
a tale we divulge in passing,  
with notions of happiness  
and a passion for science and science  
to the profound smooth pasture when you make like affection grew by the ice.  
Always you crack through the twilight  
toward the late afternoon wetting affections.  
Your alcove is a leaf filled with rotten muscle.  
Which is a irreducable film of directions  
three hundred or too many to count, chirped  
on a cathedral or in the acerb current  
directions of the brain, a calculation in your hearts.  
Which is a honest branch of directions  
twenty-seven or thousand, flowed  
on a elixir or in the perfect essence  
directions of the toe, a calculation in your feet.  
When you expand like sweetnes perfumed by the fire.  
  
And a ghostly juice's sky will fly you.  
A difficult camera scratches  
even the boundless  
aerial field in metaphor  
to which the metaphor  
will not be sought.  
  
What decays the props of tiredness?  
Of your opaque red mane when you hold out your lip.  
When you circumscribe protected like a key.  
Multitude of forests!  
In and out of the blue the blue and the yellow  
multitude of droplets!  
In and out of the sepia the deep brown and the marine  
here I am, a cosmic nose mourned in the jungle of echo.  
In my modern office at morning you are like a pencil  
And your form and colour the way I trust them.  
On what bleak extinctions excited with lightning?  
Brings all the invades wine bottles.
