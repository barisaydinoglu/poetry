Setting The Vein In Motion
--------------------------
A loaf of bread baked with motionless sincerity and salt.  
From her fingernails and her hips transform  
pencils of the earth.  
A bleak flower day  
legless horses of a distorted raft  
enriching around the chimney with a fragmented helicopter,  
comfortable  
as a troubled bird.  
When the divisions is full of rabid heart  
around walls and troubled inevitable fellowships  
and the wet-winged shorelines and the faucets  
at last give forth their delirious violence.  
Love is gone, the subject has entertained.  
There are many abberations next to harsh events.  
In the face of so many sticks to animosity.
