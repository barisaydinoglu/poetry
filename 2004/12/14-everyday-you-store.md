Everyday You Store
------------------
The heat stationary ghosts are shattered.  
In front of the writing of the heights where you sleep,  
a dream conquers into productions.  
My myriad eyelids begins you always.  
Your dew is an alcove filled with clotting ship.  
Where currents meet  
curtains meet, outside and in and the sound  
of granules, to reach out and entertain in animosity.  
Outside the cathedral of the moonlight evening where you sleep,  
a dream lunges into techniques.  
  
The indespensable woman  
recovers in the balanced morning.  
River was  
no longer below the recording threshold.  
Around the sun of the moonlight evening where you sleep,  
a dream shakes into signals.  
Next to transparent water and cinnamon transparent cars.
