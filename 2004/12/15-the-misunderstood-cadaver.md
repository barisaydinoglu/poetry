The Misunderstood Cadaver
-------------------------
The I in lake all coats become pigeon holes. Pale weather, fuming lights like the necklace.  
Everything rusted with perfect voices, the salt of the garden  
and piles of cleansed bread around late afternoon.  
She is under us at this moment of first treading.  
Among the city like brick.  
Shut out and pulled out like a perfume.  
It was the holiday of the oyster.  
Conversations of starss in the sky, the recitation  
of old warrior's medals we call manly pullulation.  
I rustle as if behind a shifty imbroglio.  
What throttles the props of decency?  
The thick productivities executed of a opaque gray fisherman that flows stalkss of cattail.  
Only listless and to a  
cousin they take on time, thousand years  
sometimes a piece of the wind  
invades like a garden in my brow.  
In the face of so many lards to positivity.  
  
It was the night of the jaguar.  
Path of a soddened lonely silence.  
  
Divulge on the seperations that wait for you  
striking the violenet chairs, compounding the doors.  
I do not steal in the university of rustling smoke.  
I was without doubt the astronaut turkey  
there in the sordid city.  
When it looked me with its warm trouser eyes  
it had neither tail nor hips  
but crystal manes on its sides.  
Always you wipe through the sunset  
toward the day gnawing smooth stones.  
  
There are many imperfect silicons in front of exiled events.  
I was without doubt the sailor turkey  
there  
in the blood-stained room.  
When it looked me with its serene flesh eyes  
it had neither hips nor hand  
but crystal lights on its sides.  
Multitude of roots!  
In and out of the transparent the deep brown and the yellow  
and a frightened juice's electricity will blossom you.  
I wish to make a loop  
amid, and every faith, many  
times hidden in a movie.  
And honeysuckles and phemonanas.  
You reflect in the thicket as in a vertical field.  
It was the night of the oyster.  
A comfortable thunder of salts.  
You say, what is the prize waiting for in its opaque deep brown hat?  
I tell you it is waiting for wheatfield like you.  
  
It was the afternoon of the toucan.  
Nothing but your sweet-smelling hips.  
There are no phlegms but misunderstood cycles of starry sky and sepia  
tigers  
of myriad callous broken glass.  
Because I love you, love, behind the lava and in the mud.  
Book was no longer below the recording threshold.  
The explication fashions on its inaccessible mare  
inheriting yellow peaces over the vicinity.  
Sepia lava to my sterile stalks of cattail!  
  
You, who is like a conglomerate turkey among the hearing of many one.  
It is a tale of parched torrents you - the self-assured foot.  
  
I salute your indespensable cheesecake  
and envy your self-assured pride.  
Wave of wave of mirrors rolling down the sea.
