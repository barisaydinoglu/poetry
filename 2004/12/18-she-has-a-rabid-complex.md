She Has A Rabid Complex
-----------------------
Crimson billows of gray smoke of funeral,  
blue seams above a obscene breakfast. Draw from it the rabid  
projection of its own machine.  
A forest focuses its dream of a old ending, its beginning, the ending of the banner order -  
its blazing cummerbunds.  
  
Friendly, marble peace!  
When the jungle is full of lonely hips  
outside scandalmongerings and insufferable bitten foams  
and the bitterest fragrances of strawberry and the books  
at last give forth their rabid night.
