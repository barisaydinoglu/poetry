The Synonym Has Not Dismantled The Promise
------------------------------------------
Enjoy the many dilute attempts to wet  
The absent minded trash barge.  
There is parsimonious fortune in standing it.  
This careless essence and reconciling sweetnes drowns me  
with it's parenthetical leaves like toe and shoulder  
and rust colored foams like finger and fragrances of strawberry.  
Where momenta meet  
stars meet, among and with and the sound  
of vortices, to reach out and blossom in sorrow.  
But I should be untrue to oceanography, faltering among its sterile grapes  
so let us begin to divulge a story without neutral redundancies.  
Multitude of propellers!  
In and out of the sepia the transparent and the silvery
