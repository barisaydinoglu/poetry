A Orange
--------
In my  
vicinity at early light of day you are like an affection  
and your form and colour the way I live them.  
What secrets does the jaguar contain?  
How little we set and how much it mingles the secrets of this computer  
simulation.  
To love lost circuss and for forests. A nose and a heart  
rustling the sea.  
In the face of so many walls to animosity.
