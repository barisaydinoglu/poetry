Your Lip Is Enough
------------------
The affluent currents cracked all corals become legless horses.  
The beast performs on its clenched mare  
expanding cashmire circuss over the divisions.  
I wish to make a line segment  
next to, and every abstraction, many  
times hidden in a map.  
Carry me onto your vessel - the banana of my perfume -  
full stop.  
And defenders and natures.  
Return to the homeland of the salts.  
Indicates the banner's relinquishing arm.  
It is a tale of motionless imbroglios on what troubled polyps circumscribed with earth?  
Setting the ripple of her awe full of joy.  
  
Around the region I like to travel like a tenacious lake.  
A loop amid a line segment,  
the exiled workings of moonlit law.  
I saw how sea water are showered  
by the homogeneous serendipity.  
From unrelenting rain to unrelenting rain,  
hidden propellers drawn by aquatic channels, a  
absurd crown begins to blush.  
It is a tale of fragmented throats in the green hips of the mud.  
The ship fashions in fluttering your curves.
