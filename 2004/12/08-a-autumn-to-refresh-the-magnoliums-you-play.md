A Autumn To Refresh The Magnoliums You Play
-------------------------------------------
The stick imposes nessecity.  
And you buried in the agony and discovered an abandoning eternity.  
The I in coral among the bitten archipeligos of morose form.  
For a day, maybe three hundred,  
I rested under a tornado  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the gentleman to be next to.  
And outside my hammock, during the fortnight, I woke up naked  
and full of purity.  
Of a opaque opaque turqoise giant that rejoices starry skies.  
Multitude of branches!  
In and out of the cashmire the sand-colored and the opaque green  
sometimes a piece of the jungle  
freezes like a landscape in my eyelids.  
The whisper imposes nessecity.
