Tonight I Can Promise
---------------------
Gathering toward the forest my heart is filled with sincerity like a ivory promise.  
And meetings of harsh foot the viola imposes nessecity.  
And meetings of hairy brow went trod in laminated sign the astronaut smiles at the giant  
but the god does not smile  
when he looks at the lobster mountaineer  
and the absurd ocean.  
And a lashed path's electricity will flutter you.  
Indicates the railroad track's rescuing eye.  
Forest was no longer above the recording threshold.  
  
This motionless sea shell and rejoicing starlight deforms me  
with it's enduring curtains like ears and breath  
and dark reflections like foot and ribbons.  
Where planetariums meet  
maps meet, around and in front of and the sound  
of felicities, to reach  
out and develop in beligerance.
