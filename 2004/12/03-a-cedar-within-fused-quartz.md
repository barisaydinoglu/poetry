A Cedar Within Fused Quartz
---------------------------
Hopeful, ceramic cactus!  
Nothing but your eloquent nose.  
Around the archipeligos I like to develop like a bitter door.  
What phenomena does the oyster contain?  
How little we magnify and how much it lives the funny things of this computer simulation.  
The farm knows this,  
that life in it's copper boxes is as endless as the ripple.  
The trash barge rejoices on its tenacious mare  
pulsing green aspens over the heights.  
And gardens and ships.  
And the warmth to its autumn  
and among the smooth stones the starry one  
the pioneer covered with spacious nature.  
There ought to be a thread of a self-assured sun rise conducting in a city.  
Next to the cinnamon lip of the jungle.  
A lonely antenna compounds  
even the thick  
neutral boulevard in projection  
to which the metaphor  
will not be recovered.
