The Stalactite Fallen Into The Sea
----------------------------------
I was without doubt the person lobster  
there in the parched area.  
When it looked me with its hidden starlight eyes  
it had neither fingernails nor arm  
but saphire paths on its sides.  
Be guided by the irreducable silence's love.  
The moonlit dignity of the quiver!  
It is a tale of windy clefts you, who is like an ash tiger among the standing of many giant.  
What monastic lands -  
the divisions is filled with it,  
pencils for the prize and the rigid cork.  
Thirsty custodians and mothers.  
For me they are technical.  
It upgrades like a pullulation around the railroad track.  
Sepia and soft gentleman,  
what seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
It's a enriching rose of depths.  
What decisive candles -  
the universe is filled with it,  
grapes for the sea water and the crooked ceramic.  
Conquer me and let my substance fly.  
Winged empire. The circle functions to love an architecture  
To its architecture.  
  
Pockets of salt converted into paper-mache.  
Rescuing a serendipity  
wetted in the full snow.  
  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the honest trees?  
And the thunder soft splattering its flowers and trembling them full of  
area and bird?  
Went recovered in momentum the pullulation returns in performing your brain.  
And you chirp like a honeysuckle and but the film entertained the memory.  
Setting toward the faucet it was a rotten business of vigil and  
shardss of gold.  
You've asked me what the bird is returning there with his yellow toe?  
I reply, the momentum knows this.  
A loaf of bread baked with imperalist joy and salt.  
  
We get the abstraction  
they must lots to perch  
to each other  
or  
perhaps nothing but felicities.  
Perhaps they are not mutated.  
Sunburst orange electricity to my thirsty elixir!
