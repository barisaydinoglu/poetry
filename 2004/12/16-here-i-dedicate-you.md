Here I Dedicate You
-------------------
Our new stone, our loving film squares.  
But the time grew the memory.  
Sometimes a piece of the heat  
replaces like a smooth stone in my brain.  
Lethargic twilight and the shifty sphere  
force at the walls of my house.  
Expanding the bottle of her river bank full of love.
