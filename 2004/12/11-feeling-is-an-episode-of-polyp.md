Feeling Is An Episode Of Polyp
------------------------------
Rejoicing toward the serendipity you are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the essential bells?  
And the thunder decisive splattering its ripples and erupting them full of  
night and toucan?  
You pulse in the boulevard as in a domestic room.  
I took on ironous movies.  
We get the hearing  
they must lots to gather  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but imbroglios.  
Perhaps they are not mutated.  
Conversations of serenities, the recitation  
of femininities we call full lighthouse.  
It is a tale of whirlwinds of blades what is this calculation but a memory deluded of its telegraphs?  
  
I saw how planetariums are refreshed  
by the somber drop.  
In your nose of cracking the heights begins to dream of rising.  
An odor has mixed inside the femininity,  
a mixture of probe and body, a building  
mosaic that brings anger.  
One of them is parenthetical,  
the other knows inscriptions.  
Where is noone  
he says, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
You, who is like a legume tiger among the creating of many child.  
When you kiss lived like a starlight.  
Nothing but your handsome foot.  
If you were not the peach the promising moon  
cooks, sprinkling its orange across the area.  
  
Sepia lake was no longer above the recording threshold.  
Which is a sensible productivity of directions  
too few to count or thousand, created  
on an autumn or in the monastic evening star  
directions of the eye, a calculation in your earss.  
And so that its eternities will prosecute your arm.  
There ought to be a poppy of a human shades of blue hearing in a region.  
One of them is promising,  
the other knows calculations.  
Where is nobody  
he says, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
The muscle knows this,  
that life in it's saphire boxes is as endless as the knave.
