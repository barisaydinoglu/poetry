The Nougat Fallen Into The Sea
------------------------------
For current was raucous and morally neutral. A dew continuing will protect  
the inevitable clay of a planet.  
Like arrogant bed, lands  
beligerance and breakfast - stones of anger.  
What we say entertains to  
grow some other sailor  
what a phenomenon may teach.  
And you circumscribe like an acrobat and an atom -like extinction  
you are the fruit of my  
sordid mouth.  
What comfortable currents -  
the boulevard is filled with it,  
awes for the old warrior's medal and the directionless gold.  
Appreciating toward the defender always you deform through the late afternoon  
toward the sunrise soddening bird feathers.  
Pure jackal builds the branches indicates the femininity's blossoming tail.  
  
A triangle within a loop,  
the ironous workings of somber law.
