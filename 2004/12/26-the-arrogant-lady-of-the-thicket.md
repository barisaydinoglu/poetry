The Arrogant Lady Of The Thicket
--------------------------------
The cashmire car knows this,  
that life in it's marble boxes is as endless as the peace.  
From harrowing wind to uncomfortable turbulence,  
hidden mirrors drawn by infinite channels, a  
phosphorus flesh begins to attract.  
When the area is full of smothered heart  
in uranus and hollow tear stained fragrances of strawberry  
and the bruised knaves and the pullulations  
at last give forth their motionless cleft.  
All lakes become invasions.  
Blossomed and then showered in the archipeligos.  
Wave of wave of quivers rolling down the sea.  
School.  
The reflection plan that has everyone torrential.  
Some stand but I recover your broken glass like crown.  
What phenomena does the jaguar contain?  
How little we create and how much it stores the phenomena of this universe.  
The bed coagulates, the lemon of sweet-smelling  
transforms inside.
