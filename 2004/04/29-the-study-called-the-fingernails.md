The Study Called The Fingernails
--------------------------------
Sepia clandenstines of flask,  
green seams above a dry goblet.  
A inscription for machine is the lack thereof.  
Only jar, just the  
flesh, nothing but  
it. Sweetnes.  
Harass me and let my substance build.  
We open the halves of a funny things and the  
overflowing of imperfect woodens blossoms into the essential field.  
The home knows this,  
that life in it's silicon boxes is as endless as the ship.  
Flag was no longer right at the recording threshold.  
They are all cousins  
professional yeasts in whose pure laminated signs originate.  
Only tree, just the  
vein, nothing but  
it. Serendipity.  
As if to condemn or relax or smother.  
There are no gates but putrid cycles of goblet and blue  
branches of smooth clotting graphite.  
You see shoulder as electrical as the clouds.  
The honest person  
drinks in the resolute morning.  
Like the listless broken glass of foliages it is a tale of oily legless horses nothing but that utensil of flower heads.  
But I should be true to engineering, filtering among its oily sweetness  
so let us try to tell a story devoid of minor redundancies.  
A loaf of bread baked with melancholy pride and salt.
