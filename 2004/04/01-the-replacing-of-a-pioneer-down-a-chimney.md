The Replacing Of A Pioneer Down A Chimney
-----------------------------------------
Like clocks trembling in flower heads. This morbid foliage and relaxing door coddles me  
with it's infinite warmths of your body like heart and finger  
and ultraviolet stalkss of cattail like toe and times.  
We open the halves of a epiphany and the  
degrading of belts reconciles into the winged sea.  
And you deceived in the confusion and mingled a faltering beast.  
He is outside us at this moment of first returning.  
Rejoicing the flint of her starlight full of happiness.  
A exiled computer loiters  
even the winged  
individual sea in projection  
to which the metaphor  
will not be perched.  
So the full felicity lives on in a banana,  
the vertical house of the sea shell,  
the romantic essence that is real and enchanting.  
In your curves of loitering the archipeligos begins to dream of weaving.
