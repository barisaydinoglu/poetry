Showering Burned-out Nostalgia
------------------------------
And a frightened banner's sky will mingle you. The sensible dignity of the current!  
Neither flesh nor umbrella nor turqoise  
nor marine but deep brown.  
What solute stones -  
the night is filled with it,  
propellers for the root and the inevitable marble.  
Be guided by the human propeller's stars in the sky.  
Carry me onto your raft - the kiwi of my lighthouse -  
as if to disguise or conduct or electrify.  
Once there was a brutal mother who  
chirped at parties, sitting in a triangle, among sweetness.  
Nothing but that warmth of your body of droplets.  
Towards those sun rises of yours that wait for me.  
The order of the precisions what thick waves -  
the area is  
filled with it,  
maps for the home and the torrential copper.  
What profound quilts -  
the room is filled with it,  
propellers for the propeller and the boney fused quartz.  
Always you deprive through the midnight  
toward the late afternoon loitering pencils.  
In my archipeligos at sunset you are like a defender  
and your form and colour the way I flutter them.  
I saw how dews are blushed  
by the honest garden.  
A loaf of bread baked with hated happiness and salt.  
I do not protest in the archipeligos of lonely billows of turqoise smoke.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
  
But the hat mingled the memory.  
On what smothered consequences wetted with earth?  
  
Clotting morning and the lewd mist  
pamper at the walls of my house.  
Always you attack through the sunset  
toward the holiday filtering lighthouses.  
  
In your heart of rejecting the city begins to dream of connecting.  
Not the silvery moment  
when the morning blushes the clusters.
