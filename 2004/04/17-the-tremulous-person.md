The Tremulous Person
--------------------
I could develop corruption, stench, and rectum  
from times and precisions  
with a black faucet  
with eternities in my hips.  
My heart is filled with love like a silk muscle.  
Always you undulate through the lunchtime  
toward the midnight entangling perfumes.  
One grammatic option and all ribbons become serections.  
The evening star freezes, the film of mineral  
continues behind.  
Not re-covering is a form of inheriting.  
The howl imposes nessecity.
