Public Machines Are All Outside Us
----------------------------------
Amid sand-colored water and sunburst orange spheres.  
The miracles exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
in front of it in darkness.  
Shining a lunar  
trod in the somber sunshine.  
Shut out and pulled out like a cathedral.  
A chorus of toucans at morning un lived un hated  
comes to a halt before a peace.  
Root of a disguised tremulous leaf.  
Of your turqoise saxophone when you hold out your hips.  
One aerial option and I'm the cousin to the bed of immediate heart.  
Towards those angels of yours that wait for me.  
A raft is not enough to wet me and keep me  
from the land of your poetic funny things.
