Since The Beginning Of Upgrading
--------------------------------
Tremble me and let my substance seize.  
I'm the child to the silk architecture of immediate bird feather.  
In the middle of the land like steel.  
Shut up and closed off like a sun.  
A monastic wood paneling making a esoteric thing of a likely meeting with a woman.  
A current of nocturnal sea's skin  
that does not know why it flows and pacifies.  
Fashioned and then rejoiced in the sea.  
Crystallizing from harsh crystal.  
  
Conduct on the wounds that wait for you  
passing the banal chairs, degrading the doors.  
You seek my whirlwinds of ash  
like an absent minded bird to fresh grape.  
The holiday saxophones you in its mortal mud.
