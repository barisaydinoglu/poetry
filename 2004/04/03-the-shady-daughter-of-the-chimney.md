The Shady Daughter Of The Chimney
---------------------------------
I wish to make a triangle  
around, and every feeling, many  
times hidden in a wheatfield.  
One individual option and fresh empire. The circle functions to build a environment  
to its system.  
Noone here is waiting for the next shoreline.  
Essence. You recovered yourself for re-covering.  
The chimney in hers  
a tale we speak in passing,  
with notions of tiredness  
and a passion for engineering and science  
but the wreath reconciled the memory.  
Went perched in bridge the coal imposes  
nessecity.  
My heart moves from being torrential to being manly.  
The loving giant  
fashions in the cosmic  
morning.  
Acidulous errors and arrogant torrents.  
  
Pure belt pulses the productivities you are the tomato of my banal fingernails.  
Wave of wave of sea's skins rolling down the sea.
