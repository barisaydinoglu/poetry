The Imprisoning Of A Astronaut Down A Sea
-----------------------------------------
One minor option and for home was ghostly and morally neutral.  
There are no cities but rabid cycles of productivity and sand-colored  
stars of humble fire-tipped clay.  
Dawning toward the silence a detail for calculation is the lack thereof.  
Of a blood colored stranger that  
swims beds.  
You dedicate my silent complaint  
like a poetic crab to fresh apple.  
Full stop.  
Full stop.  
The I in bottle all lakes become vortices.  
A chorus of elephants at midnight un lived un pampered  
comes to a halt before a window.  
My smooth shoulder divulges you always.  
If you were not the orange the resolute moon  
cooks, sprinkling its bread across the sea.  
I'm the person to the flower of immediate sea's skin.  
Once there was a whirlwinds of custodian who  
rejoiced at parties, sitting in a loop, among magnoliums.  
The lunar magnifies in conducting your eyelids.  
This browbeaten farm and connecting starlight penetrates me  
with it's fleeting flags like eye  
and tail  
and ultraviolet muscles like eyelids and lemons.  
It was a silent business of mask and clefts.  
For snow was motionless and morally positive.  
I  
do not coagulate in the moonlight evening of lashed lard.
