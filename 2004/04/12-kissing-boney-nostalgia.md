Kissing Boney Nostalgia
-----------------------
A image transforms,  
deforms - it does not return.  
We open the halves of a funny things and the  
crushing of extinctions perches into the cosmic jungle.  
As soon as the incoming fleshes  
gives the technical indication.  
It's a returning bell of lances.
