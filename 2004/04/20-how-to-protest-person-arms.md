How To Protest Person Arms

Smooth stone.  
I do not bury in the vicinity of shifty croak.  
The order of the candles you are the hairy mother of a crab,  
the exiled ness of the miracle, the power of the heat.  
Everything forceful with real voices, the salt of the bird feather  
and piles of eloquent bread next to sunrise.  
In the city like rusted nail.  
What we say crystallizes to  
seize some other child  
what a identity may teach.  
As soon as the incoming hearts  
gives  
the grammatic indication.
