Elders Must Always Prove Their Coats
------------------------------------
In the smallest silken shoreline the bridge perfumes in swimming your mouth.  
What erupts the props of pride?  
Because I love you,  
love, in front of the fire and in front of the heat.  
The warm dignity of the crown!
