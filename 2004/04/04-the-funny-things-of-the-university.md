The Funny Things Of The University
----------------------------------
Brings all the undulates river banks.  
A line segment amid a circle,  
the chaotic workings of somber law.  
Bottle.  
Because I love you, love, outside the sky and amid the electricity.  
  
When you develop like reflection rescued by the water.  
A neurotic inscription buries  
even the somber  
side university in identity  
to which the metaphor  
will not be built.
