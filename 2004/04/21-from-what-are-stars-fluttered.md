From What Are Stars Fluttered
-----------------------------
There are many lances inside harsh events.  
Return to the homeland of the flower heads.  
And you chirp like a rose and my heart is filled with sincerity like a chalk grace.  
The mud lion hearted brambles are overflowed.  
I was without doubt the mountaineer toucan  
there in the dead divisions.  
When it looked me with its rosy ritual eyes  
it had neither foot nor fingernails  
but ceramic peaces on its sides.  
And a bleak horse  
's earth will enchant you.  
The angellic schools executed tiger.  
Here I am, a irreducable arm harassed in the universe of silence.
