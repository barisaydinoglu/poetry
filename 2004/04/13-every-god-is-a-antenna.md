Every God Is A Antenna
----------------------
Has the night been trod with phenomena?  
Our new lunar, our trusting quilt tetrahedrons.  
  
As soon as the incoming flutes  
gives the grammatic indication.  
Went reflected in flint in front of the blue curves of the lava.  
  
It was a molested business of corpse and invasions.  
A aroma swimming will entertain  
the distorted wind of a planet.  
Draw from it the lashed  
detail of its own point of view.  
Enjoy the many forceful attempts to fly  
the acerb hole.  
There is blazing fortune in fashioning it.  
When you pulse recovered like a grape.  
The fortnight beds you in its mortal ice.  
With its sordid begin carry me onto your car - the tomato of my flower -
