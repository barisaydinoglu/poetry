Color As Granules
-----------------
Building toward the flint and beds and schools.  
Multitude of beds!  
In and out of the burnt umber the opaque cinnamon and the burnt umber  
I stayed divulged and marine  
among the divisions.  
Rosy, fused quartz poppy!  
Seized and then enchanted in the region.  
You set in the area  
as in a mineral night.  
There are many abyss behind shaken events.  
It's a transforming poppy of rectums.  
  
I'd do it for the silence in which you reflect  
for the moons of burnt umber you've discovered.  
I'm the goddess to the moon of immediate perfume.
