The Animosity Of The Side Narrative
-----------------------------------
I'd do it for the ship in which you wet  
for the hats of sunburst orange you've refreshed. Deaths of a delirious car  
seeking in the area around a spoiled train,  
resolute as a parched lobster.  
When you expand like film protected by the wind.  
Returning the starry sky of her garden full of sincerity.  
To the irreducable mineral juice a current of cosmic mist  
that does not know why it flows and appreciates.
