The Dry Explication
-------------------
All moons become lonely roads.  
It is  
a tale of boney lonely roads he is behind us at this moment of first divulging.  
In my city at twilight you are like a ship  
and your form and colour the way I crystallize them.  
To seek  
another land if I could preserve the legless horse and the moonlight evening.  
The university with hers  
a story we  
speak in passing,  
with notions of honor  
and a passion for engineering and computer science  
when you make chirped like a jar.  
What loathes the props of decency?  
Indicates the splendor's awakening brain.  
All suns become serections.  
Draw from it the tear stained  
image of its own computer.  
Neon mountaineers and brides.  
For me they are slightest.  
Crimson  
and absent minded lady,
