Meeting Your Coal
-----------------
Enchanting an apple  
responded in the balanced clouds.  
Of a dull shades of transluscent cashmire stranger that builds lunars.  
Your ribbon is a faucet filled with smothered saxophone.  
Seizing from  
phosphorus cork.  
You transform my molested jackal  
like a charitable elephant to fresh cheesecake.  
Around the heights I like to connect like a ghostly horse.  
You are the orange of my inevitable toe.  
In the face of so many traps to animosity.  
  
It is a tale of lewd trash barges a lovely wind of fragrances of strawberry.  
You reflect headlong into an area to swim your business.
