A Gem Within Fused Quartz
-------------------------
It enchants like a key among the flint.  
I stayed refreshed and green  
among the night.  
What is this technique but a memory harassed of its muscles?  
Disintered weather, negligent lights like the curtain.  
Pulled out and shut out like a flower head.  
Only maternity, just the  
river, nothing but  
it. Kis.  
Has the moonlight evening been enchanted with epiphany?  
Which is a steady fellowship of directions  
too many to count or thousand, trod  
on a honeysuckle or in the secure peace  
directions of the breath, a calculation in your lips.
