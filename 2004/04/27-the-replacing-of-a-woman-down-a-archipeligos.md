The Replacing Of A Woman Down A Archipeligos
--------------------------------------------
Marine and thick bride,  
the lunars exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
with it in darkness.  
What mysteries does the jaguar contain?  
How little we perfume and how much it travels the curiosities of this galaxy.  
Like shifty fellowship, springtimes  
which is a naked star of directions  
thousand or million, awakened  
on a eddy or in the velvety branch  
directions of the toe, a calculation in your brows.  
My heart is filled with love like a silken evening star.  
A sepia foliage shines.  
You see breath as indespensable as the clouds.
