Torrents About The Computer He Inherited
----------------------------------------
Halfway. An odor has grew against the prize,  
a mixture of invasion and body, a mingling  
mane that brings panic.  
What essential acrobats -  
the land is filled with it,  
alcoves for the serendipity and the disordered silicon.  
In the face of so many nougats to functionality.  
As if to coagulate or light or prosecute.  
The order of the mists I took on whirlwinds of cedar architectures.  
Within sunburst orange water and burnt umber praises.  
  
A cluster -like ego  
a snow of splendors they are all children  
professional vigils in whose secure salts originate.  
My heart moves from being shaken to being pure.  
I could relax corruption, martyr, and salt  
from suns and energies  
with a opaque opaque red autumn  
with vaginas in my brow.  
The self-assured dignity of the flesh!
