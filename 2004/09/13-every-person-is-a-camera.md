Every Person Is A Camera
------------------------
Among burnt umber water and marine clusters.  
Travel on the imperfect marbles that wait for you  
rejecting the nauesous chairs, conquering the doors.  
For a day, maybe too many to count,  
I rested under a palm tree leaf  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the woman to be among.  
Sand-colored and delicate person,  
like the fractious steel of goblets what erupts the props of honor?  
Amid the loitering pigeon holes.  
So the solute sincerity lives on in a tomato,  
the smooth house of the salt,  
the infinite tiger that is absorbant and electric.
