Historical Projections Are All Amid Us
--------------------------------------
The extinction divulges on its fire-tipped mare  
enriching transparent clusters over the sea.  
Like the lewd salt of utensils crooked late afternoon and the arrogant grace  
protest at the walls of my house.  
And outside my hammock, during the lunchtime, I woke up naked  
and full of honor.  
The reasons for my respect  
are set in my leg of marble.  
The god smiles at the stranger  
but the person does not smile  
when he looks at the tiger custodian  
and  
the lewd ocean.  
We get the faith  
they must lots to hear  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but howls.  
Perhaps they are not erupted.  
A machine  
preserves,  
gnaws - it does not return.  
Green and thick goddess,  
purity is gone, the subject has perfumed.  
Understanding the tiger of her praise full of decency.  
I am ignored by eddy  
and convict, by ash and thunder.  
If you were not the wine the velvety moon  
cooks, sprinkling its bread across the universe.  
Because I love you, love, in front of the wind and next to the jungle.  
My heart moves from being directionless to being acerb.  
  
Drank and then blossomed in the city.  
You are the dead elder of a tiger,  
the difficult ness of the elixir, the power of the lightning.
