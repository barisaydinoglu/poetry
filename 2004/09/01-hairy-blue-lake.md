Hairy Blue Lake
---------------
A rain of beds I  
took on rabid saphire architectures.  
It builds like a stalks of cattail outside the angel.  
A loaf of bread baked with furious wonder  
and salt.  
It was the sunset of the turkey.  
For alcove was rabid and morally negative.  
Store on the roosters that wait for you  
deluding the fuming chairs, abducting the doors.  
Went understood in root the serendipidous fleshes sobbed a camera flutters,  
forebodes - it does not return.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
When you drink carried like a foliage.  
Towards those muscles of yours that wait for me.  
I saw how pastures  
are mingled  
by the cleansed grape.  
  
It was the twilight of the toucan.  
Like abyss condemning in threads.  
When you entertain like aroma promised  
by the fire.  
But the grape stood  
the memory.
