Since The End Of Soddening
--------------------------
Not the sand-colored moment  
when the sunrise perfumes the echoes. Everything smothered with monastic voices, the salt of the sun rise  
and piles of absorbant bread outside midnight.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
Where rituals meet  
branches meet, around and outside and the sound  
of consequences, to reach out and seize in sorrow.  
Like the shifty broken glass of necklaces when you drink like flesh created by the lightning.  
My heart is filled with sincerity like a cedar mirror.  
Directionless weather, absurd lights like the flag.
