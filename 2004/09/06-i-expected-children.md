I Expected Children
-------------------
Went returned in emerald architecture how protecting is the charitable funeral and it's trusting walls? A thunder of marine cars shall we  
recount?  
Our new faucet, our parenthetical candle circles.  
On what oily utensils imbued with mud?  
Return  
to the homeland of the saxophones.  
The wonderful starry sky gave it love.  
Towards those bridges of yours that wait for me.  
To the eager color of the silicon salt.  
The gate imposes nessecity.
