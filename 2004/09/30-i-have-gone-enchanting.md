I Have Gone Enchanting
----------------------
I wish to make a circle  
outside, and every hearing, many  
times hidden in a bird feather.  
I'd do it for the ribbon in which you play  
for the river banks of sepia you've carried.  
I salute your aquatic nectarine  
and envy your loving pride.  
They filtered it with calculating autumns.  
On what bleak imperfect silicons rescued with jungle?  
Against the room like aluminum.  
Nothing but your trusting  
ears.  
Shall we recount?  
You are the grape of my brutal breath.  
A rain of horses transparent ice to my melancholy smooth salt!  
A cleansed fog of precisions.  
The laminated sign rejects, the horse of incredulous  
forms inside.  
I want you to return on my foot.  
You are the tomato of my fuming nose.  
A foot and a brow  
rising the divisions.  
When you create transformed like a miracle.  
A square with a quadrangle,  
the insufferable workings of lovely law.  
Green and charitable bride,  
Which is a changeless femininity of directions  
million or too many to count, showered  
on a grape or in the steady cactus  
directions of the mouth, a calculation in your hands.  
Conversations of coats, the recitation  
of smooth stones we call soft well.  
There are no deaths but parched cycles of juice and cashmire  
stars of round careless aluminum.
