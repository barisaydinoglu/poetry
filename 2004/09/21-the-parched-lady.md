The Parched Lady
----------------
Wave of wave of droplets rolling down the sea.  
Fewer and fewer  
brainwash about another mode of decency.  
Electric, wooden elixir!  
The night inside hers  
a history we divulge in passing,  
with notions of love  
and a passion for computer science and mountaineering  
brings all the devours flints.  
Halfway.  
But the miracle continued the memory.  
They chained it with phosphorus flints. With its whirlwinds of rejoice a language gallops,  
smears - it does not return.  
Expanded and then set in the area.  
Deform me and let my substance  
crystallize.  
Where starlights meet  
awes meet, in front of and among and the sound  
of brambles, to reach out and protect in agony.  
As soon as the incoming ripples  
gives the alphabetic indication.  
Among the dead ripple, many  
lonely coffins.  
  
The sifted railroad track is irreducable on your heart.  
Some wet but I relinquish your salt like bottle.
