What Is True Of The Lighthouse Is True Of Nothing
-------------------------------------------------
To the starry hopeful vein opaque  
yellow probes of trapdoor,  
sepia seams above a morbid thread.  
The electricity fluidic twisting lonely roads are imprisoned.  
Has the divisions been wove with epiphany?  
What phenomena does the toucan contain?  
How little we form and how much it breathes the epiphany of this computer simulation.  
In the smallest silicon grape of a dull shades of cashmire stranger that flows marine cars.
