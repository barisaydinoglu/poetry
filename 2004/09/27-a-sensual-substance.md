A Sensual Substance
-------------------
Hated weather, ironous lights like the coat.  
And hooves and shadess of marine.  
Conversations of cork architectures, the recitation  
Of quilts we call promising sun.  
The listless toucan seizes in the indespensable utensils.  
Blue electricity to my  
furious key!  
It's a blushing poppy of violas.  
Wave of wave  
of reflections rolling down the sea.  
In the middle of the city like rusted  
nail.  
To the lion hearted equinoctial aroma what plagues the props of honor?  
  
The law trusting from my curves.  
Not to swim or even meet  
the home of one who discovers  
among me in a jungle or inheriting to a father.  
My heart is filled with pride like a silken angel.  
Wave of wave of honeysuckles rolling down the sea.  
Draw from it the negligent  
technique of its own antenna.  
Because I love you, love, around the lightning and around the water.  
Nothing but that river of love.
