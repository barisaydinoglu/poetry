A Kiwi
------
I imbue as if within a muzzled martyr. For essence was  
wounded and morally negative.  
The hound swims on its calculating mare  
upgrading crimson trees over the divisions.  
  
Towards those currents of yours that wait for me.  
The dew plan that has everyone boneless.  
Among the rose of the universe where you sleep,  
a dream degrades into inscriptions.  
Reflecting from frail copper.  
Serections of a dead airplane  
fluttering outside the thicket outside a lewd wheel,  
scrupulous as a insatiable cat.  
There are no wounds but brutal cycles of lemon and sand-colored  
farms of homogeneous furious brick.  
Kissing a foliage  
excited in the great sunshine.
