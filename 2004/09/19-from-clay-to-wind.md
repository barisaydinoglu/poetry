From Clay To Wind
-----------------
Return to the homeland of the flowers.  
It was a raucous business of blood and convicts.  
It was a rabid business of billows of dull shades of burnt umber smoke and errors.  
Illusion and stalks of cattail - love of embarassement.  
From  
her toe and her fingernails play  
guitars of the earth.  
You - the poetic lip.  
  
Some blush but I play your salt like vein.  
On what shady cummerbunds enriched with mud?
