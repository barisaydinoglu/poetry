I Have Gone Devouring
---------------------
Calcerous sailors and sons.  
For me they are overtone.  
In your ears of pampering the room begins to dream of beginning.  
Once there was a careless lady who  
awakened at parties,  
sitting in a triangle, among goblets.  
Green clay to my rotten planetarium!  
  
So the sweet-smelling wonder lives on in an apple,  
the natural house of the hoove,  
the gleaming wine bottle that is plumed and wonderful.  
She is inside us at this moment of first enchanting.  
A blood colored and hollow horse is penetrated in the sea.  
They loitered it with rigid veins.
