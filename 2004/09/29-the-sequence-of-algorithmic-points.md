The Sequence Of Algorithmic Points
----------------------------------
Pure smoke showers the aromas when the land is full  
of demonic eyelids  
in front of nights and whirlwinds of banal atoms  
and the skeleton sun rises and the springtimes  
at last give forth their lewd city. All warmths of your body become stains.  
I'd do it for the breakfast in which you awaken  
for the promises of silvery you've stored.  
The shadow imposes nessecity.  
Your arm rescues from east to north  
Full stop.
