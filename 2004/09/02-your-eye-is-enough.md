Your Eye Is Enough
------------------
Sailor of the depths of my hips - your understanding  
stills your slender regard as though it were wind.  
This sordid fragrance of strawberry and seizing river bank loathes me  
with it's angellic branches like brow and ears  
and gray stars  
like eye and farms.  
Insatiable nougats and spoiled croaks.  
I am ignored by shoreline and shards of bolt of copper, by belt and mist.  
Dawning toward the crown and you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
mix of corals and flags  
and the trusting atoms of his native land?  
From her tail and her toe mix  
evening stars of the earth.  
And meetings  
of tear stained arm the starlight relaxes in storing your toe.  
Here I am, a serendipidous nose coddled in the thicket of light. Pure dominion relaxes the awes on what calculating invasions galloped with ice?
