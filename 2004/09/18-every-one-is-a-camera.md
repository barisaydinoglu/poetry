Every One Is A Camera
---------------------
Come with me to the viola of lances.  
Transluscent sunburst orange and homogeneous aunt,  
bruised goddesses and mothers.  
For me they are minor.  
Once there was a careless astronaut who  
expanded at parties, sitting in a line, among river banks.  
A line among a line segment,  
the morbid workings of full law.  
And behind my hammock, during the night, I woke up naked  
and full of joy.  
Everybody here is waiting for the next ribbon.  
Alcove. You sought yourself for rustling.  
To the gleaming color of the gem friendship.  
Raucous weather, raucous lights like the mirror.
