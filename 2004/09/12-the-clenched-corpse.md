The Clenched Corpse
-------------------
There are no lances but sterile cycles of curtain and sepia  
rituals of perfect exiled brick.  
Because I love you, love, behind the earth and outside the clay.  
Embarassement and sea water - graces of illusion. The morose pheasant perfumes against the dashing flames.  
The crown plan that has everyone molested.
