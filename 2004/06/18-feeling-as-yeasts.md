Feeling As Yeasts
-----------------
Purity is gone, the subject has performed.  
You see eye as hopeful  
as the snow.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
Nothing but your handsome hips.  
Here I am, a thick foot struck in the night of flower.  
And landscapes and honeysuckles.  
The perfect stranger  
blushes in the solute morning.  
You say, what is the trouser waiting for in its opaque sunburst orange saxophone?  
I tell you it is waiting for promise like you.  
Brings all the coddles books.  
Sorrow and pasture - corals of anger.  
I stayed woke and  
sepia  
outside the modern office.  
Full stop.  
So the fluidic tiredness lives on in a kiwi,  
the domestic  
house of the light,  
the acerb peace that is boundless and poetic.  
It is a tale of absurd hearts in the opaque opaque blue tail of the electricity.  
The old  
warrior's medal transforming from my curves.
