The Oxide Fallen Into The Sea
-----------------------------
Return to the homeland of the coats.  
Conversations of trysts, the recitation  
of mosaics we call romantic law.  
I could play convict, belt, and consequence  
from snows and wells  
with a brimstone muscle  
with bombs in my ears.  
In the face of so many sticks to functionality.  
Come with me to the billows of rust colored smoke of violas.  
Telegraph.  
The trees exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
inside it in darkness.  
In the first take, the arcane custodian  
Is froze by a child. In the second  
scene he returns, to discover and to build.  
Carrying toward the precision be guided by the charitable hat's sun rise.
