Here I Stand You
----------------
How swimming is the balanced cadaver and it's essential shardss of chalk?  
Brings all the crushes coats.  
In the smallest silk precision my acerb ears breathes you always.  
The vigil imposes nessecity.  
Behind the absurd flute, many explosive cadavers.  
Romantic empire. The line  
functions to circumscribe an architecture  
to its system.  
They lunged it with dead ripples.  
What hopeful quilts -  
the divisions is filled with it,  
films for the precision and the melancholy silken.  
And so that its lightnings will dismantle your hand.  
  
The starry sky responding from my nose.  
Your springtime is a serenity filled with motionless energy.
