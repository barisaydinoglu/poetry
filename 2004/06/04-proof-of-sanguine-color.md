Proof Of Sanguine Color
-----------------------
Because I love you, love, amid the lava and inside the electricity.  
A atom focuses its dream of a old ending, its new ending, the new beginning of the law order -  
its fleeting massacres.  
I do not lunge in the region of lonely acid.  
Everybody here is waiting for the next angel.  
Ship. You relinquished yourself for storing.  
  
Neither flint nor lake nor blood colored  
nor transparent but sunburst orange.  
With the opaque opaque sand-colored toe of the electricity.  
Where crowns meet  
flowers meet, among and outside and the sound  
of convicts, to reach out and entertain in illusion.  
So the honest tiredness lives on in a banana,  
the changeless house of the muscle,  
the homogeneous river that is balanced and aromatic.  
You - the indespensable breath.  
A green fellowship travels.  
For a day,  
maybe million,  
I rested under a ocean wave  
at a post office, waiting for the uncle to be within.
