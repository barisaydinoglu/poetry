From What Are Muscles Reconciled
--------------------------------
The gentleman smiles at the pioneer  
but the son does  
not smile  
when he looks at the turkey god  
and the arrogant ocean.  
Once there was a careless custodian who  
rejoiced at parties, sitting in a loop, among echoes.  
Nothing but that saxophone of farms.  
The sweetness exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
around it in darkness.  
Here I am, a infinite arm cracked in the university of flesh.  
Green and solute child,  
  
Return to the homeland of the moons.  
Twist me and let my substance carry.
