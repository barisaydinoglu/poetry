Feeling Is An Episode Of Granule
--------------------------------
You play my dead coal  
Like a unguessed bird to fresh peach.  
The free cousin  
wakes in the winged morning.  
Nothing but that curtain of femininities.  
Sunburst orange hounds of conspirator,  
cinnamon seams above a explosive film.  
Went preserved in rose the uranu imposes nessecity.  
Some swim but I enrich your rusted nail like phemonana.  
Of a black aunt that sets crowns.  
Towards those precisions of yours that wait for me.  
In your mouth of degrading the city begins to dream of promising.  
Because I love you, love, with the electricity and around the jungle.  
A star -like convict  
the original flutes punctured a hand and a leg  
attracting the moonlight evening.  
.  
  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
Come with me to the night of corruptions.
