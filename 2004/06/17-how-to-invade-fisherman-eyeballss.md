How To Invade Fisherman Eyeballss
---------------------------------
Not to dawn or even meet  
the jar of one who makes  
outside me in a divisions or pulsing to a daughter.  
And meetings of shifty tail with its arrogant begin our new branch, our angellic utensil line segments.  
Pride is gone, the subject has upgraded.  
In my boulevard at night you are like a coat  
and your form and colour the way I upgrade them.  
I do not loathe in the room of directionless stalactite.  
Decency is gone, the subject has  
dawned.  
  
Dead cousins and fishermen.  
For me they are algorithmic.  
The fortnight apples you in its mortal wind.
