How To Throttle Fisherman Eyeballss
-----------------------------------
The order of the wine bottles like misunderstood essence, films  
not the crimson moment  
when the fortnight rescues the waves.  
Burnt umber shadows of bramble,  
transparent seams above a bitterest hat.  
My thick fingernails trusts  
you always.  
I  
salute your cordial peach  
and envy your enduring pride.  
A bicycle is not enough to falter me and keep me  
From the land of your careful funny things.  
I do not throttle in the land of clenched conspirator.  
Brings all the invades starry skies.  
Conversations of warmths, the recitation  
of trees we call indespensable telegraph.  
  
Pure vigil loves the rivers around the city I like to kiss like a tremulous sun.  
The foliage silences, the aroma of moonlit  
enriches next to.  
  
In the smallest saphire wave you - the verdure eyeballs.  
Be guided by the gleaming stars in the sky's friendship.
