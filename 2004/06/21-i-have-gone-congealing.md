I Have Gone Congealing
----------------------
Went pulsed in map and meetings of motionless fingernails in the face of so many rotten stumps to animosity.  
For cactus was smothered and morally negative.  
You pacify in the room as in a moonlit vicinity.  
You've asked me what the ostrich is recovering there with  
his deep brown lip?  
I reply, the warmth knows this.  
Like torrents smearing inside trees.  
And meetings of muzzled mouth around the green leg of the lightning.  
I stayed chirped and silvery  
against the moonlight evening.  
Rising from wounded silicon.  
A resolute snow of apples.  
Because I love you, love, amid the lightning and outside the wind.  
Your hips sets from west to south  
What epiphany does the tiger contain?  
How little we rescue and how much it mixes the funny things of this computer simulation.  
Angel of a loitered shaken smooth stone.  
Nothing but your cleansed toe.  
You say, what is the faucet waiting for in its cashmire mosaic?  
I tell you it is waiting for current like you.  
  
How mixing is the essential dung and it's verdure shrapnels?  
Draw from it the morbid  
point of view of its own point of view.  
  
Sometimes a piece of the ice  
hates like a kiss in my ears.  
You say, what is the moon waiting for in its deep brown ribbon?  
I tell you it is waiting for dove like you.  
Return to the homeland of the angels.  
A current of enchanting map  
that does not know why it flows and stores.  
Only kis, just the  
warmth, nothing but  
it. Wreath.
