Color As Dusts
--------------
Towards those sea water of yours that wait for me.  
Your foam is a window filled with violenet reflection.  
They are all giants  
professional clefts in whose stationary silences originate.  
The bleak oyster lights among the dashing oblivions.  
The acidulous sea's skin that trusts in your pencil.  
A transluscent marine starry sky understands.  
  
How kissing is the absent minded billows of rust colored smoke and it's sanguine juices?  
Umbrella of a conquered bitter movie.  
For lighthouse was ghostly and morally neutral.  
What we say promises to  
gallop some other mother  
what a point of view may teach.  
One of them is free,  
the other knows projections.  
Where is somebody  
he says, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Nothing but your human eyeballs.  
The lady smiles at the cousin  
but the giant does not smile  
when he looks at  
the squirrel bride  
and the atrocious ocean.  
Multitude of sepia lakes!  
In and out of the cinnamon the cashmire and the transparent  
The saxophone upgrades in travelling your ears.  
Our new horse, our secure stalks of cattail lines.  
A train is not enough to kill me  
and keep me  
from the night of your somber mysteries.
