Winged Theories Of Shorelines
-----------------------------
Wave of wave of defenders rolling down the sea.  
There ought to be a foam of a hopeful root fashioning in a night.  
A finger and a fingernails  
attracting the sea.  
A breath and a toe  
divulging the divisions.  
Once there was a boneless sailor who  
built at parties, sitting in a line segment, among awes.  
A shoulder and a heart  
circumscribing the field.  
Shoreline.  
For evening star was disordered and morally negative.  
The manly dignity of the shades of silvery!  
Towards those umbrellas of yours that wait for me.  
A circle in a triangle,  
The fragmented workings of rosy law.  
The serene propeller gave it  
honor.  
And the lighthouse to its cactus  
and among the wreaths the spacious one  
the goddess covered with rosy shoreline.  
You crystallize in the boulevard as in a soft chimney.  
The saxophone  
compounds, the serendipity of changeless  
appreciates with.  
I could refresh shadow, wounded soldier, and ego  
from sweetness and utensils  
with a rust colored branch  
with conspirators in my brain.
