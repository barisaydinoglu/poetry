Men Of A Hollow Country
-----------------------
You awaken in the modern office as in a cosmic sea.  
Outside the dull shades of opaque burnt umber panic of the pin.  
What decisive sun rises -  
the land is filled with it,  
precisions for the time and the browbeaten cork. I blossom as if with an arrogant wasteland.  
Once there was a skeleton fisherman who  
reflected at  
parties, sitting in a tetrahedron, among warmths of your body.
