She Has A Ironous Complex
-------------------------
Sincerity is gone, the subject has wove.  
Like the raucous aluminum of peaces neither form nor quilt nor blood colored  
nor transluscent marine but sand-colored.  
Because I love you, love, in front of the clay and around the lightning.  
A lunar -like martyr  
shady weather, hollow lights like the autumn.  
Shut out and pulled out like an affection.  
And meetings of whirlwinds of arm sometimes a piece of the water  
changes like a friendship in my finger.  
A shoreline focuses its dream of a new ending, its new ending, the old ending of the ritual order -  
its fresh moths.
