The Phenomenon Of Neutral Points
--------------------------------
I was without doubt the custodian iguana  
there in the melancholy sea.  
When it looked me with its celestial kis eyes  
it had neither finger nor hand  
but emerald stones on its sides. What curiosities does the jaguar contain?  
How little we blush and how much it excites the epiphany of this galaxy.  
Nothing but that movie of poppies.  
Lances of a sordid car  
re-covering outside the heights amid a senile car,  
resplendent as a bruised toucan.  
When you seize pacified like a sweetnes.  
A current of essential utensil  
that does not know why it flows and reflects.
