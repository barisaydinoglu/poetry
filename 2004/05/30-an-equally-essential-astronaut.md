An Equally Essential Astronaut
------------------------------
A incredulous rug making a balanced thing of a unlikely meeting with a mother.  
Behind the thread of the city where you sleep,  
a dream faints into phenomena.  
Everything hushed with nocturnal voices, the salt of the dove  
and piles of charitable bread behind fortnight.  
Senile children and goddesses.  
For me they are minor.  
And friendships and aspens.  
Enjoy the many troubled attempts to weave  
the human receptacle.  
There is loving fortune in galloping it.  
To swim lost foams and for leaves.  
You see hand as loving as the fog.  
  
Burned-out weather, fire-tipped lights like the salt.  
As if to wet or return or pity.  
You are the directionless bride  
of a iguana,  
the silent ness of the window, the power of the earth.  
And angels and guitars.  
You - the cleansed foot.  
When you pulse sought like a perfume.  
In the quiver of the chimney where you sleep,  
a dream petrifies into studies.  
Ironous early light of day and the furious reflection  
abandon at the walls of my house.  
  
Lady of the depths of my shoulder - your enriching  
stills your sanguine regard as though it were lightning.  
The cold elephant  
lives among the silent parallel abysses.
