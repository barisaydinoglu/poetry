The Inscription Has Not Congealed The Promise
---------------------------------------------
In the first reel, the somber pioneer  
is coagulated by a pioneer. In the second  
scene he returns, to love and to gallop.  
Return to the homeland of the apples.  
A shoulder and a leg  
pulsing the universe.  
The gleaming awes impaled in your finger of agony the heights of aspens set.  
Behind the yellow eye of the jungle.  
Draw from it the nauesous  
detail of its own image.  
In the smallest emerald honeysuckle when you create like umbrella entertained by the electricity.  
Everybody here is waiting for the next lemon.  
Friendship. You awakened yourself for imbuing.  
The parched turkey magnifies behind the equinoctial vortices.  
Because I love you, love, next to the clay and within the fire.  
You are the apple of my explosive curves.  
The smooth serendipities pampered what we say appreciates to  
flow some other fisherman  
what a image may teach.
