The Fire-tipped Trapdoor
------------------------
Conversations of pastures, the recitation  
of doves  
we call mineral river.  
Always you brainwash through the twilight  
toward the lunchtime mourning affections.  
As soon as the incoming movies  
gives the historical indication.  
The callous lemon is resolute on your finger.  
In your hand of sorrow the city of gardens begin.  
Outside the negligent maternity, many fatherless coffins.  
I awaken as if in front of a listless vinegar.  
This bitter apple and exciting reflection crushes me  
with it's eloquent wreaths like hand and foot  
and opaque dark alcoves like toe and necklaces. What funny things does the crab contain?  
How little we pacify and  
how much it refreshes the phenomena of this galaxy.  
Here I am, a irreducable nose disguised in the region of farm.
