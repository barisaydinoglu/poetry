The Replacing Of A Stranger Down A Night
----------------------------------------
Essential empire. The circle functions to carry a system  
to its architecture.  
Of your opaque turqoise essence when you hold out your tail.  
And the lemon to its root  
and among the threads the sensible one  
the mountaineer covered with electric grape.  
My heart is filled with happiness like a gold sea water.  
Like the worn-out iron of mists it is a tale of tremulous extinctions there are no self-productions but rotten cycles of knave and transluscent cinnamon  
praises of charitable cold clay.  
Among the parched quilt, many tear stained wounds.  
Around the chimney I like to discover like a frightened vein.  
A current of soft grape  
that does not know why it flows and rejoices.  
A flower head focuses its dream of a old ending, its beginning, the new ending of the aroma order -  
its blazing vortices.  
Opaque yellow and free god,  
to the parenthetical color of the emerald salt.
