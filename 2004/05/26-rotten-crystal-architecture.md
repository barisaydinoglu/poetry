Rotten Crystal Architecture
---------------------------
I was without doubt the one oyster  
there in the fuming divisions.  
When it looked me with its plumed ripple eyes  
it had neither eyelids nor shoulder  
but emerald smooth irons on its sides.  
Only shaken and to a  
astronaut they take on time, million  
years  
I saw how hooves are recovered  
by the pure flower head.  
Green bloody feathers of hound,  
yellow seams above a rambunctious juice.  
A clenched rose day  
halfway.  
A current of noble door  
that does not know why it flows and gathers.  
Full stop.  
A loaf of bread baked with hairy felicity and salt.  
Because I love you, love, inside the sky and around the water.  
  
A computer for production is the lack thereof.  
Not discovering is a form of blossoming.  
Only flower, just the  
snow, nothing but  
it. Landscape.  
Towards those lights of yours that wait for me.  
I took on muzzled breakfasts.  
Went crystallized in goblet the I in lemon and meetings of nauesous eye as if to pamper or kiss or pass.  
  
Fear and snow - momenta of confusion.  
What we say imbues to  
transform some other cousin  
what a production may teach.
