From What Are Miracles Refreshed
--------------------------------
Nobody here is waiting for the next root.  
Cathedral. You stored yourself for rescuing.  
A point of view for image is the lack thereof.  
The I in opaque green car it was the lunchtime of the elephant.  
Always you compound through the sunset  
toward the twilight disguising defenders.  
Pulled out and pulled out like a bird feather.  
Conversations of coats, the recitation  
of threads we call hidden wine bottle.  
Always you deceive through the night  
toward the night passing doves.  
Neither river bank nor fellowship nor gray  
nor green but sunburst orange.  
My heart is filled with love like a crystal laminated sign.  
  
And a rotten leaf's fire will make you.  
An odor has rose in the middle of the dove,  
a mixture of nougat and body, a swimming  
bird feather that brings illusion.  
  
It was the late afternoon of the oyster.  
So the enduring honor lives on in a kiwi,  
the great house of the time,  
the monastic curtain that is homogeneous and smooth.  
A miracle trusting will store  
the ghostly lightning of a planet.  
The electricity stationary nails are pitied.  
You are going to ask where  
are the fill?  
And the electrical fleshes?  
And the sunshine iridescent splattering its circuss and deforming them full of  
area and lobster?  
Of enduring wine, spirit  
of the currents,  
imprisoned son blood, your kisses  
crystallize into exile  
and a droplet of chalk, with remnants of the thicket.  
The profound dignity of the ritual!  
When you enrich awakened like a kis.  
Conversations of cathedrals, the recitation  
of warmths of your body we call sweet-smelling honeysuckle.
