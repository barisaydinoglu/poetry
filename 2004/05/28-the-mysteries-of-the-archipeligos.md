The Mysteries Of The Archipeligos
---------------------------------
I'm the goddess to the silvery lake of immediate honeysuckle.  
Has the field been blossomed with phenomena?  
When the university is full of smothered shoulder  
within throats and muzzled clotting warmths  
and the communist poppies and the veins  
at last give forth their acidulous bloody feather.  
Outside the divisions like brick.  
What is this projection but a memory wetted of its necklaces?  
So the loving pride lives on in an apple,  
the changeless house of the apple,  
the warm angel that is free and eloquent.  
The chimney outside hers  
a tale we speak in passing,  
with notions of felicity  
and a passion for photography and computer science  
in the smallest chalk acrobat for a day, maybe million,  
I rested under a palm tree leaf  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the person to be outside.  
There ought to be a wave of a equinoctial window showering in a sea.  
  
Not the sunburst orange moment  
when the midnight develops the lights.  
Among the disordered land of tenacious time.  
We  
get the abstraction  
they must lots to blossom  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but deaths.  
Perhaps they are not cracked.  
Around the jungle I like to weave like a boney knave.
