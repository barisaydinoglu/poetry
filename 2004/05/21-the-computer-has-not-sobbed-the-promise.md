The Computer Has Not Sobbed The Promise
---------------------------------------
It's a trusting warmth of your body of egoes.  
Your brain flies from east to east  
anger and miracle - saxophones of embarassement.  
And you penetrated in the beligerance and flowed a changing vinegar.  
Against the explosive sea of rotten aspen.  
Deform me and let my  
substance fly.  
The equinoctial giant  
hears in the solute morning.
