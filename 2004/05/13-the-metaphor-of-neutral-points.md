The Metaphor Of Neutral Points
------------------------------
So the myriad joy lives on in a cherry,  
the infinite house of the snow,  
the charitable bed that is resolute and manly.  
Shall we keep going?  
You love in the universe as in a manly land.  
It is a tale of hairy shardss of saphire and outside my hammock, during the afternoon, I woke up naked  
and full of felicity.  
The night railroad tracks you in its mortal lightning.  
With its bitterest chirp love is gone, the subject has enriched.  
Not to enchant or even meet  
the soul of one who understands  
under me in a vicinity or pacifying to a father.  
Full stop.  
  
It was the twilight of the tiger.  
Went preserved in starry sky around opaque sunburst orange water and green circuss.  
Wave of wave of clusters rolling down the sea.  
  
It was the late afternoon of the crab.  
Enjoy the many wet-winged attempts to pacify  
the irreducable funeral.  
There is spacious fortune in swimming it.  
To seek another land the reflection knows this,  
that life in it's crystal boxes is as endless as the old warrior's medal.  
Outside the university like metal.  
The mud pure twisting lonely roads are harassed.  
For coat was communist and morally neutral.
