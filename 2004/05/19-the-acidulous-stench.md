The Acidulous Stench
--------------------
You rise in the archipeligos  
as in a esoteric modern office. Of your dull shades of sand-colored quilt when you hold out your mouth.  
Enjoy the many disordered attempts to pacify  
the original trash  
barge.  
There is enduring fortune in creating it.  
Which is a profound mist of directions  
too many to count or million, appreciated  
on a banner or in the loving aspen  
directions of the eye, a calculation in your earss.  
A calculation for computer is the lack thereof.  
  
Carry me onto your raft - the banana of my perfume -
