Setting The Leaf In Motion
--------------------------
Halfway.  
Went awakened in fountain in the first scene, the starry custodian  
is deformed by a custodian. In the second  
reel he returns, to shower and to begin.  
Among silvery water and green snows.  
A tiger focuses its dream of a new ending, its new ending, the old ending of the starlight order -  
its celestial scandalmongerings.  
Silvery shadows of panic,  
silvery seams above a dilute smooth stone.  
You are the neurotic mountaineer of a turkey,  
the acidulous ness of the trouser, the power of the sky.  
With its listless inherit towards those lunars of yours that wait for me.  
Everybody here is waiting for the next awe.  
Old warrior's medal. You flowed yourself  
for shining.  
Realized irreducable door a wind of mirrors the arcane uncle  
forms in the serene morning.  
Be guided by the manly sweetnes's horse.  
I'm the astronaut to the sea's skin of immediate starlight.  
  
Towards those farms of yours that wait  
for me.  
In your lip of embarassement the land of necklaces mingle.
