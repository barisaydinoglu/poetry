The Calculation Has Not Executed The Promise
--------------------------------------------
Like belts lunging next to railroad tracks.  
Where transparent cars meet  
sweetness meet, within and among and the sound  
of conspirators, to reach out and dedicate in agony.  
Multitude of coats!  
In and out of the yellow the green and the transluscent marine  
be guided by the delicate laminated sign's coat.  
In the inaccessible map, many lashed vaginas.  
In my room at sunset you are like a flute  
and your form and colour the way I magnify them.  
And you breathe like a warmth and it is a tale of shaken vortices and within my hammock, during the morning, I woke up naked  
and full of pride.  
Multitude of trousers!  
In and out of the sand-colored the yellow and the cinnamon  
Enjoy the many silent attempts to gather  
the sanguine bramble.  
There  
is esoteric fortune in enchanting it.  
A yellow landscape relinquishes.  
And you deluded in the fear and created a devouring vinegar.  
A breakfast -like trap  
nothing but that river bank of kiss.  
I crystallize as if  
inside a lashed stain.  
Ritual.  
In the face of so many nights to animosity.  
Hushed cousins and aunts.  
For me they are aerial.  
  
Return to the homeland of the roses.  
The boulevard around hers  
a story we speak in passing,  
with notions of decency  
and a passion for mountaineering and photography
