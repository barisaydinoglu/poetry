An Equally Verdure Elder
------------------------
How flowing is the naked dominion and it's solute belts?  
The honest curtains conquered I stayed reflected and sunburst orange  
outside the field.  
Within sand-colored water and yellow starry skies.  
Our new ripple, our infinite splendor loops.  
Green earth to my fuming ripple!  
A essential linoleum making a boundless thing of a probable meeting with a goddess.  
  
Senile children and custodians.  
For me they are technical.  
A tree perching will grow  
the cold ice of a planet.
