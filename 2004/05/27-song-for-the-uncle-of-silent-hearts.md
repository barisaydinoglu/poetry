Song For The Uncle Of Silent Hearts
-----------------------------------
A camera for identity is the lack thereof.  
An odor has lived inside the wreath,  
a mixture of shards of cork and body, a weaving  
current that brings sorrow.  
Towards those cathedrals of yours that wait for me.  
Halfway.  
I salute your balanced orange  
and envy your esoteric pride.  
When the sea is full of inevitable eye  
outside walls and neurotic wayside rivers  
and the barbaous juices and the friendships  
at last give forth their wet-winged bomb.  
  
Dawned and then enriched in the jungle.
