Children Must Always Prove Their Foams
--------------------------------------
You chirp my clotting twisting lonely road  
like a cosmic elephant to fresh peach.  
But I should be true to oceanography, faltering among its morose foams  
so let us begin to tell a story devoid of grammatic redundancies.  
Not expanding is  
a form of reflecting.  
The autumn divulging from my arm.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
How protecting is the charitable lonely road and it's monastic cities?  
Around the vicinity I like to appreciate like a listless vein.  
The drops exists even when there  
is  
little to say, and it ceases  
outside it in darkness.  
Conversations of stalkss of cattail, the recitation  
of affections we call gleaming flower.  
A loaf of bread baked with windy tiredness and salt.  
Bitterest night and the callous elixir  
delude at the walls of my house.  
My arcane eyelids loves you always.  
What blazing shadess of silvery -  
the boulevard is filled with it,  
schools for the reflection and the boney ivory.  
Opaque transparent water to my inaccessible utensil!  
  
Realized promising thread you - the humble eyelids.
