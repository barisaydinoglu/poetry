Mothers Of A Mourning Country
-----------------------------
Like the torrential broken glass of echoes because I love you, love, in front of the earth and next to the jungle.  
The lava esoteric trash barges are chained.  
How imbuing is the boundless moldy banana and it's infinite howls?  
Which is a winged maternity of directions  
million or too few to count, pacified  
on a mist or in the lion hearted smooth iron  
directions of the foot, a calculation  
in your brains.  
You are the banana of my calcerous tail.  
In the face of so many havocs to functionality.  
For a day, maybe too many to count,  
I rested under a tornado  
at a bus stop, waiting for the pioneer to be amid.  
I play as if with a lonely legume.  
Fewer and fewer  
bristle about another mode of pride.  
It is a tale of hollow graves sun.  
The order of the circuss the late afternoon productivities you in its mortal fire.  
All laws become dominions.  
You are the demonic elder of a oyster,  
the melancholy ness of the flower, the power of the earth.  
  
There ought to be a horse of a solute fragrance of strawberry circumscribing  
in a city.  
And a rigid peace's jungle  
will enchant  
you.  
Around the blue  
fingernails of the earth.
