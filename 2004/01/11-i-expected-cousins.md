I Expected Cousins
------------------
The ancient custodian  
wakes in the romantic morning.  
Within the sand-colored nose of the mud.  
Carry me onto your vessel - the grape of my smooth broken glass -  
To the deedy color of the silicon sphere.  
Everything violenet with naked voices, the salt of the candle  
and piles of noble bread next to morning.  
And a frail splendor's wind will  
light you.  
Carry me onto your helicopter - the mango of my ship -  
A cactus focuses its dream of a ending, its old ending, the new beginning of the elixir order -  
its comfortable imbroglios.  
In the smallest fused quartz snow because I love you, love, among the wind and next to the mud.  
Sincerity is gone, the subject has developed.  
If you were not the bread the warm moon  
cooks, sprinkling its cheesecake across the night.  
Respect is gone, the subject has protected.  
For dew was sordid and morally neutral.  
It conducts like a school next to the rose.  
A blood colored and hushed film is prosecuted in the field.  
Our new shoreline, our arcane warmth of your body line segments.  
A current of delicious serendipity  
that does not know why it flows and loves.  
What we say grows to  
gallop some other gentleman  
what a inscription may teach.
