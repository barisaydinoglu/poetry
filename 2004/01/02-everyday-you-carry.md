Everyday You Carry
------------------
I was without doubt the daughter elephant  
there in the dilute chimney.  
When it looked me with its myriad writing eyes  
it had neither tail nor eyeballs  
but ivory forests on its sides.  
The grape harasses, the form of romantic  
continues outside.  
Crown  
of a brainwashed frightened candle.  
Carry me onto your vessel  
- the banana of my autumn -  
love is gone, the subject has  
swam.  
Halfway.  
When you preserve like branch played by the water.  
Pockets of aluminum converted into silicon.  
There ought to be a fragrance of strawberry of a cleansed mane responding in a field.  
  
In the devouring funerals.
