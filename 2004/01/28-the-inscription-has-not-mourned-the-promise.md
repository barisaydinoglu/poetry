The Inscription Has Not Mourned The Promise
-------------------------------------------
Nothing but your manly eye.  
Shall we move on?  
One of them is spacious,  
the other knows projections.  
Where is noone  
she exclaims, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Enriching the key of her map full of love.  
A trusting carpet making a lion hearted thing of a lucky meeting with a sailor.  
The winged cousin  
blossoms in the incredulous morning.  
The flask imposes nessecity.  
From her ears and her brain rustle  
forms of the earth.  
Transluscent sunburst orange rectums of bone,  
cashmire seams above a nauesous miracle.  
Kill me and let my substance discover.  
  
My heart is filled with felicity like a gem femininity.  
If I could divulge the ego and the moonlight evening.  
As if to harass or refresh or execute.  
To the full lion hearted quiver wave of wave of horses rolling down the sea.
