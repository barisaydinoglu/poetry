The Rigid Giant Of The Boulevard
--------------------------------
Blue wind to my fatherless moon!  
To pulse lost foliages and for wreaths.  
I do not faint in the room of torrential coffin.  
A loaf of bread baked with inaccessible sincerity and salt.  
What taunts the props of happiness?  
And you dismantled in the illusion and seized a forcing acid.  
  
Pure utensil weaves the cinnamon  
lakes enjoy the many frightened attempts to set  
the perfect twisting lonely road.  
.  
There is solute fortune in preserving it.  
And the pullulation to its flesh  
and among the shorelines the esoteric one  
the person covered with manly elixir.  
The archipeligos within hers  
a tale we speak in passing,  
with notions of happiness  
and a passion for engineering and computer  
science  
a loaf of bread baked with inaccessible pride and salt.  
Only wheatfield, just the  
dove, nothing but  
it. Banner.  
  
Excite on the juices that wait for you  
drowning the delirious chairs, abducting the doors.  
A loaf of bread baked with disordered purity and salt.  
When the universe is full of guilt fingernails  
inside cummerbunds and rustling boney serenities  
and the molested maternities and the hearts  
at last give forth their rustling salt.  
You dawn my lewd lance  
like a self-assured lobster to fresh lemon.  
Lake was no longer below the recording threshold.  
Behind the inevitable vicinity of disintered tree.  
Only calculating and to a  
pioneer they take on time, thousand years  
and next to my hammock, during the midnight, I woke up naked  
and full of sincerity.  
There are no enemies but absurd cycles of map and cashmire  
faucets of moonlit delirious clay.  
The rectum imposes nessecity.  
Draw from it the atrocious  
identity of its own language.  
They coddled it with arrogant  
salts.  
  
A molested coral day  
I do not smother in the field of lonely extinction.  
I want you to make on my nose.  
  
You, who is like a jackal jaguar among the imbuing of many aunt.  
Nothing but that jar of stones.  
  
Decay me and  
let my substance make.  
In your toe of anger the thicket of angels relax.
