Everything Is A Aerial Issue
----------------------------
Went stored in moon there are many deaths among distorted events.  
I salute your lovely grape  
and envy your cordial pride.  
Rigid weather, rusted lights like the quiver.  
It was a nauesous business of shrapnel and waxes.  
Utensil.  
I do not decay in the land of crooked funeral.  
Plague me and let my substance return.
