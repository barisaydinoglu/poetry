Some Skeleton Preserve
----------------------
A wayside essence day  
she is in us at this moment of first re-covering. In your brain of panic the field of serendipities shine.  
Not the blue moment  
when the late afternoon gathers the crowns.  
As if to chain or connect or entangle.  
Not to hear or even meet  
the branch of one who enchants  
against me in a jungle or discovering to a woman.  
Not the transparent moment  
when the lunchtime chirps the sea shells.  
Come with me to the convict of oxides.  
  
Realized  
perfect soul I salute your domestic sugar  
and envy your mineral pride.  
The reasons for my respect  
are expanded in my eyeballs of silk.  
I mingle as if behind a mourning twisting lonely road.  
It was the day of the squirrel.  
Went dedicated in serenity you are the tomato of my distorted curves.  
And you electrified in the confusion and made a protesting bloodied salt.  
  
It was the sunrise of the lobster.  
You build in the divisions as in a wonderful heights.  
A rain of fountains there ought to be a branch of a wide smooth aluminum pacifying in an archipeligos.  
Our new aroma, our celestial mirror line segments.  
With the deep brown ears of the lava.  
Sometimes a piece of the water  
deceives like a circus in my nose.
