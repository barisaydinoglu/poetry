Song For The Mountaineer Of Putrid Lighthouses
----------------------------------------------
She is under us at this moment of first discovering.  
The musical dignity of the book!  
Yellow electricity to my inevitable wave!  
A brain and a breath  
refreshing the archipeligos.  
Not the deep brown moment  
when the morning flows the beds.  
My heart moves from being browbeaten to being absent minded.  
The wind original trashes are fainted.
