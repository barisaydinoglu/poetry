A Fresh Substance
-----------------
They are all  
ladies  
professional bloodied clays in whose changeless flags originate.  
When you promise like film developed by the ice.  
My wide finger rescues you always.  
They deprived it with cheerless lemons.  
It was the late afternoon of the iguana.  
This barbaous blue car and protecting flute bristles me  
with it's myriad currents like eyeballs and ears  
and black shorelines like brain and stalkss of cattail.  
So the friendly decency lives on in a lemon,  
the friendly house of the jar,  
the perfect river that is esoteric and incredulous.  
  
It was the night of the bird.  
A grace connecting will rejoice  
the barbaous wind of a planet.  
The depth imposes nessecity.
