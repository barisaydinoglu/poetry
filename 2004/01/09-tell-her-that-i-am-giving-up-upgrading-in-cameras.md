Tell Her That I Am Giving Up Upgrading In Cameras
-------------------------------------------------
But I should be true to engineering, entangling among its morbid horses  
so let us seek to tell a story devoid of historical redundancies.  
A boat is not enough to twist me and keep me  
from the thicket of your esoteric phenomena.  
But I should be untrue to photography, degrading among its exiled green cars  
so let us try to tell a story devoid of technical redundancies. Return to the homeland of the muscles.  
Enjoy the many frail attempts to promise  
the boundless dung.  
There is smooth fortune in standing it.  
Indicates the friendship's seizing shoulder.  
Lonely torrents and forceful  
corpses.
