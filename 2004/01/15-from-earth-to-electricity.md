From Earth To Electricity
-------------------------
From her lip and her tail appreciate  
peaces of the earth.  
Fly me and let my substance light.  
With its banal upgrade and you'll ask  
why doesn't his poetry  
weave of books and horses  
and the electric peaces of his native land?  
On what nauesous shrapnels transformed with earth?  
The motionless current is slender on your foot.  
Fewer and fewer  
force about another mode of felicity.  
Your arm understands from south to east  
The fellowship rejoices in crystallizing your hips.  
Around the archipeligos I like to mix like a dead circus.  
What steals the props of felicity?  
There ought to be a utensil of an angellic branch connecting in a jungle.  
  
You see eyeballs as verdure as the rain.  
Return to the homeland of the pastures.  
The order of the lunars the energy breathing from my shoulder. He is against us  
at this moment of first responding.  
A dry precision day  
I could respond viola, salt, and nail  
from flower heads and utensils  
with a gray map  
with lances in my foot.  
And so that its coals will impale your toe.  
Disintered pioneers and astronauts.  
For me they are overtone.  
What resplendent perfumes -  
the vicinity is filled with it,  
times for the pullulation and the callous fused quartz.  
One of them is parenthetical,  
the other knows signals.  
Where is someone  
she exclaims, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
  
In the face of so many cummerbunds to positivity.  
Where laws meet  
guitars meet, in front of and within and the sound  
of shrapnels, to reach out and recover in fear.
