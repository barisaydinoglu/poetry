Sight As Conspirators
---------------------
Enjoy the many tremulous attempts to gather  
the cleansed vagina.  
There is arcane fortune in playing it.  
Has the divisions been created with secrets?  
The laminated sign shines in rejoicing your eyeballs.  
With the pencil of the moonlight evening where you sleep,  
a dream strikes into projections.  
Silvery heat to my dead jar!  
Noone here is waiting for the next wave.  
Current. You kissed yourself for mixing.  
Your dove is a prize filled with mourning bird feather.
