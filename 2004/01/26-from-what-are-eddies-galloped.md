From What Are Eddies Galloped
-----------------------------
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the delicate paths?  
And the clouds affluent splattering its juices and puncturing them full of  
divisions and squirrel?  
The trash barge imposes nessecity.  
The wounded well is vertical on your leg.  
Full stop.  
Not to wake or even meet  
the droplet of one who connects  
in me in an archipeligos or transforming to a father.  
When the region is full of calculating breath  
among bombs and ironous smothered pullulations  
and the misunderstood corals and the kisses  
at last give forth their torrential alarm.  
  
My heart is filled with decency like a silken magnolium.  
The telegraphs exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
outside it in darkness.
