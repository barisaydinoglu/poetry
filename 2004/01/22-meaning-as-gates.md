Meaning As Gates
----------------
Yellow and serendipidous person,  
a path reconciling will tread  
the hated heat of a planet.  
There are no graves but thirsty cycles of knave and sand-colored  
doors of hidden calculating aluminum.  
Not to flutter or even meet  
the railroad track of one who wets  
against me in a thicket or circumscribing to a one.  
  
The region in hers  
a history we speak in passing,  
with notions of tiredness  
and a passion for engineering and oceanography  
difficult weather, windy lights like the movie.
