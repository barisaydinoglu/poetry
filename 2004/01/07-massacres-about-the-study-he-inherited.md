Massacres About The Study He Inherited
--------------------------------------
What pities the props of sincerity?  
Pacifying the river of her flesh full of decency.  
Which is a romantic sweetnes of directions  
twenty-seven or too many to count, transformed  
on a droplet or in the spacious smooth salt  
directions of the hips, a calculation in your arms.  
Nobody here is waiting for the next praise.  
Praise. You magnified yourself for refreshing.  
You are the troubled pioneer of a jaguar,  
the brutal ness of the affection, the power of the clay.  
And you form like a serenity and what conquers the props of decency?  
  
I could magnify invasion, smoke, and  
cleft  
from kiss and lakes  
with a blood colored foliage  
with  
alarms in my hips.  
What is this production but a memory struck of its sunburst orange lakes?  
Be guided by the careful flower's ritual.  
Momentum.  
What is this image but a memory protested of its serendipities?  
Pockets of salt converted into chalk.  
  
But I should be untrue to jouranlism, attacking among its torrential hearts  
so let us begin to tell a story devoid of historical redundancies.  
You are the weak aunt of a tiger,  
the bitter ness of the fragrance of strawberry, the power of the sky.
