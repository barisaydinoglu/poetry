Setting The Peace In Motion
---------------------------
When the field is full of fatherless mouth  
behind felicities and morose smothered lights  
and the weak lighthouses and the jars  
at last give forth their morbid juice.  
The key blushes in playing your tail.  
Sepia and dashing lady,  
I'd do it for the lighthouse in which you begin  
for the tigers of yellow  
you've drank.  
I want you to preserve on my mouth.  
Silence me and let my substance protect.  
Realized charitable shades of sepia in the first reel, the cosmic sailor  
is harassed by a sailor. In the second  
reel he returns, to gallop and to love.  
Conducting toward the saxophone has the thicket been relinquished with secrets?  
  
Dismantle me and let my substance travel.  
The bitten landscape that continues in your movie.  
Like the shifty iron of apples ship. Blue and monastic one,  
I want you to respond on my breath.
