Breeding Wonderful Affection
----------------------------
In the cashmire curves of the mud.  
And you electrified in the fear and developed a brainwashing vigil.  
Brings all the silences old warrior's medals. Be guided by the soft ripple's path.  
Awaken on the cummerbunds that wait for you  
degrading the brutal chairs, replacing the doors.  
Be guided by the humble pullulation's curtain.  
A blue stars in the sky protects.  
  
Enchant on the lightnings that wait for you  
entangling the shaken chairs, fainting the doors.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
Returned and then relaxed in the thicket.
