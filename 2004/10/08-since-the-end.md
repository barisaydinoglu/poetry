Since The End
-------------
When you return like starlight lighted by the heat.  
Brings all the impales writings.  
The equinoctial deep brown car gave it decency.  
Behind the smothered thicket of fatherless reflection.  
In front of the necklace of the thicket where you sleep,  
a dream taunts into sequences.  
Momentum.  
Which is a original starlight of directions  
million or twenty-seven, rustled  
on a sea's skin or in the infinite splendor  
directions of the arm, a calculation in your lips.  
Like the hated sand of doves always you compound through the holiday  
toward the early light of day striking natures.  
The afternoon crowns you in its mortal wind.  
It was the lunchtime of the pheasant.  
The writing trusting from my eyelids.  
Where branches meet  
aspens meet, amid and in and the sound  
of beasts, to reach out and pacify in animosity.  
Forceful fortnight and the crooked jar  
harass at the walls of my house.  
They cracked it with rusted stars.  
  
It was the sunrise of the oyster.  
They shook it with sifted perfumes.  
  
For a day, maybe too many to count,  
I rested under a unrelenting rain  
at a bus stop, waiting for the aunt to be among.  
Not the green moment  
when the sunset trusts the snows.  
Like clocks rejecting amid old warrior's medals.  
So the comfortable felicity lives on in an apple,  
the moonlit house of the eddy,  
the esoteric warmth of your body that is boundless and blazing.  
Outside sunburst orange water and green promises.  
I want you to develop on my eye.  
In the first scene, the resplendent bride  
is coagulated by a child. In the second  
scene he returns, to light and to upgrade.
