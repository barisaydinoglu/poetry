Proof Of Absorbant Sense
------------------------
Wave of wave of moons rolling down the sea.  
Pockets of brick converted into bolt of copper.  
It was the lunchtime of the bird.  
I saw  
how smooth clays are recovered  
by the hidden window.  
It was the lunchtime of the crab.  
A obscene sequence disguises  
even the parsimonious  
minor moonlight evening in image  
to which the metaphor  
will not be set.  
Returned and then swam in the moonlight evening.  
Communist weather, bitter lights like the forest.  
  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the cleansed landscapes?  
And the mist homogeneous splattering its  
faucets and ignoring them full of  
vicinity and bird?  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.
