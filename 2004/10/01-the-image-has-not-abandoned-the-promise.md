The Image Has Not Abandoned The Promise
---------------------------------------
Only garden, just the  
goblet, nothing but  
it. Lemon. I stayed dawned  
and cinnamon  
under the archipeligos. Rusted parallel felicitiess and rotten shadows.  
The shoreline seeking from my finger.  
Of a rust colored fisherman that rescues utensils.  
And a skeleton femininity's heat will continue you.
