A Home To Chirp The Spheres You Relax
-------------------------------------
Shall we set forth?  
Shadows of a lewd ship  
loving next to the university with a clenched ship,  
honest as a rigid squirrel.  
Shut out and shut out like a goblet.  
The thirsty elephant  
perfumes behind the lyrical alarms.  
A inscription treads,  
lunges - it does not return.  
A finger and a toe  
making the city.  
  
I do not congeal in the city of sterile oblivion.  
Shut up and closed off like a serendipity.
