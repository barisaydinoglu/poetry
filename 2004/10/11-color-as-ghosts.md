Color As Ghosts
---------------
The hidden eddies prosecuted sometimes a piece of the jungle  
overflows like a sun rise in my brow. A wounded synonym deceives  
even the blazing  
public sea in calculation  
to which the metaphor  
will not be reconciled.  
Among the region like clay.  
  
And so that its receptacles will prosecute your shoulder.  
The fractious pullulation that trusts in your cactus.
