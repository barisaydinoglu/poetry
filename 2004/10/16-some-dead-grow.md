Some Dead Grow
--------------
A tetrahedron in a tetrahedron,  
the rabid workings of boundless law.  
The resolute dignity of the garden!  
What brainwashes the props of joy? One side option and a drizzle of laws to seek lost muscles and for windows.  
A worn-out machine coagulates  
even the balanced  
side archipeligos in antenna  
to which the metaphor  
will not be conducted.  
Full stop.  
My heart is filled with sincerity like a cedar mirror.  
As soon as the incoming gardens  
gives the historical indication.  
You shine in the boulevard as in a loving sea.  
So the infinite respect lives on in a orange,  
the soft house of the sweetnes,  
the serendipidous poppy that is solute and round.  
Among the opaque opaque turqoise illusion of the alarm.  
A honeysuckle imbuing will relax  
the tear stained fire of a planet.  
A wind of grapes what is this computer but a memory undulated of its writings?  
And outside my hammock, during the morning, I woke up naked  
and full of happiness.  
Multitude of cactuss!  
In and out of the sand-colored the cashmire and the deep brown  
  
When the region is full of imperalist lip  
in shardss of gem and fire-tipped dead maps  
and the torrential circuss and the planetariums  
at last give forth their sterile vigil.  
I'm the mountaineer to the acrobat of immediate essence.  
  
A map re-covering will fly  
the boneless fire of a planet.  
A tetrahedron among a tetrahedron,  
the delirious workings of self-assured law.
