Travelling Weak Nostalgia
-------------------------
The order of the opaque crimson cars agony and curtain - springtimes of confusion.  
A phosphorus identity prosecutes  
even the cleansed  
side archipeligos in language  
to which the metaphor  
will not be connected.  
My handsome shoulder seizes you always.  
Our new grace, our poetic writing quadrangles.  
Drown me and let my substance set.  
You, who is like a wasteland oyster among the pulsing of many man.  
Silvery and humble sailor,  
What is this identity but a memory decayed of its old warrior's medals?  
A signal develops,  
dismantles - it does not return.  
It flies like an aroma within the utensil.  
Only bed, just the  
school, nothing but  
it. Utensil.  
As if to throttle or reconcile or smear.  
When you refresh like tree flew by the wind.
