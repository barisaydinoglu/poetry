An Equally Wide Pioneer
-----------------------
But I should be true to mountaineering, loathing among its shady lemons  
so let us begin to tell a story without algorithmic redundancies.  
I want you to seize on my foot.  
As if to smother or kiss or replace.  
Like jackals sobbing in front of keys.  
You are the mango of my skeleton toe.  
You entertain in the thicket as in a slender room.  
There are many rotten stumps amid careless events.  
I am undulated by jar and complaint, by dung and fog.  
Rescuing from mechanical silicon.  
So the soft  
sincerity lives on in a kiwi,  
the homogeneous house of the root,  
the charitable ritual that is smooth and fleeting.  
I could gather cadaver, clock, and wound  
from flowers and crowns  
with a ultraviolet grape  
with stains in  
my breath.  
So the eager felicity lives on in a kiwi,  
the serendipidous house of the bird feather,  
the fresh sun rise that is hopeful and parsimonious.  
You, who is like a wall turkey among the reflecting of many daughter.
