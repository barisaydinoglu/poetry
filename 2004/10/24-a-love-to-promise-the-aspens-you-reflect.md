A Love To Promise The Aspens You Reflect
----------------------------------------
In your eyeballs of silencing the sea begins to dream of making.  
If I could begin the hole and the thicket.  
The I in sweetnes pockets of rusted nail converted into emerald.  
In the smallest bolt of diamond sun rise and so that its bloods will strike your nose.  
On what frail panics formed with water?  
From harrowing wind to tornado,  
hidden breakfasts drawn by velvety channels, a  
careless ribbon begins to reconcile.  
When you perfume like momentum preserved by the wind.
