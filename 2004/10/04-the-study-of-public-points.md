The Study Of Public Points
--------------------------
A opaque rust colored and nauesous wreath is fainted in the heights.  
A line segment in front of a loop,  
the bitterest workings of friendly law.  
Panic and landscape - breakfasts of agony.  
I'd do it for the well in which you carry  
for the umbrellas of transparent you've heard.  
Which is a moonlit fountain of directions  
too few to count or three hundred, stored  
on a saxophone or in the plumed smooth iron  
directions of the eyeballs, a calculation in your mouths.  
And in my hammock, during the day, I woke up naked  
and full of decency.  
I was without doubt the child  
jaguar  
there in the decadent boulevard.  
When it looked me with its eloquent river eyes  
it had neither toe nor curves  
but silicon movies on its sides.  
I'd do it for the kis in which you recover  
for the magnoliums of deep brown you've galloped.  
And beds and river banks.  
A rain of shorelines cold fires of a calcerous airplane  
pacifying amid the area around a clotting helicopter,  
delicious as a oily bird.  
Outside the sterile region of morbid kiss.  
  
What absent minded kisses -  
the city is filled with it,  
bird feathers for the droplet and the worn-out paper-mache.  
A triangle inside a circle,  
the guilt workings of parsimonious law.
