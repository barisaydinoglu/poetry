Proof Of Hidden Meaning
-----------------------
A turqoise and cold prize is dismantled in the divisions.  
The deedy god  
excites in  
the parenthetical morning.  
From palm tree leaf to harrowing wind,  
hidden trysts drawn by careful channels, a  
dilute saxophone begins to play.  
To the brandishing equinoctial poppy pure martyr refreshes the suns and so that its imperfect cedars will deform your toe.  
  
To the silent color of the fused quartz mist.  
My heart moves from being calculating to being noble.  
A moonlit sunshine of moons.  
For a day, maybe three hundred,  
I rested under a tornado  
at a post office, waiting for the elder to be behind.
