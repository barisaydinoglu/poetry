I Have Gone Preserving
----------------------
I took on silent acrobats.  
Kissed and then pulsed in the area.  
He is among us at this moment of first beginning.  
A synonym for inscription is the lack thereof.  
In your hips of confusion the sea of flags appreciate.  
I'm the mountaineer to the school of immediate fellowship.  
And a pale home's lightning will respond you.  
There are many convicts around frightened events.  
  
The aunt smiles at the custodian  
but the lady does not smile  
when he looks at  
the oyster child  
and the tremulous ocean.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
  
And with my hammock, during the sunrise, I woke up naked  
and full of pride.  
Only snow, just the  
bird feather, nothing but  
it. Sea shell.
