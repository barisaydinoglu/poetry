Granules About The Metaphor She Inherited
-----------------------------------------
Of a dark lady that begins affections.  
There are no coals but acidulous cycles of quilt and crimson  
branches of irreducable calcerous aluminum.  
Of fluidic cheesecake, spirit  
of the maps,  
lunged god blood, your kisses  
reconcile into exile  
and a droplet of paper-mache, with remnants of the area.  
Living the praise of her candle full of joy.  
In the smallest cork deep brown lake around the dark anger of the ghost.  
Only grace, just the  
book, nothing but  
it. Splendor.  
  
The bleak pasture is spacious on your nose.  
Went blushed in peace I do not drop in the boulevard of crooked moth.
