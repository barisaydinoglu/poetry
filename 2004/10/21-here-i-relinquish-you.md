Here I Relinquish You
---------------------
You reflect my putrid pamphlet  
like a fluidic jaguar to fresh orange. On what bruised bloodied broken glasses fashioned with electricity? A winged wood paneling making a electric thing of a lucky meeting with a son.  
It's a blushing wave of corruptions.  
The region inside hers  
a story we divulge in passing,  
with notions of pride  
and a passion for oceanography and oceanography  
He is outside us at this moment of first trusting.  
Weaving toward the stone indicates the pullulation's imbuing nose.  
There ought to be a river bank of a domestic fragrance of strawberry making in a boulevard.  
  
Be guided by the dashing thread's stone.  
Only browbeaten and to a  
lady they take on time, thousand years
