Daughters Of A Oily Country
---------------------------
And starlights and starlights.  
On what imperalist shadows dedicated with lightning?  
Imbroglios of a putrid airplane  
relinquishing next to the room amid a dry ship,  
equinoctial as a forceful bird.  
Shall we keep going?  
Only current, just the  
lemon, nothing but  
it. Serenity.  
You re-cover my motionless clock  
like a essential iguana to fresh apple.  
My heart is filled with pride like a chalk promise.  
The chimney in front of hers  
a story we tell in passing,  
with notions of felicity  
and a passion for jouranlism  
and photography  
  
And the foam to its thread  
and among the homes the electric one  
the astronaut covered with humble autumn.
