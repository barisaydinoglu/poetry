Everyday You Seize
------------------
The order of the juices pacified and then pulsed in the moonlight  
evening.  
You, who is like a stick elephant among the showering of many fisherman.  
It was the afternoon of the lobster.  
Outside the sea's skin of the moonlight evening where you sleep,  
a dream decays into points of view.  
For rose was windy and morally neutral.  
  
It was the day of the tiger.  
In transluscent opaque blue water and opaque silvery goblets.
