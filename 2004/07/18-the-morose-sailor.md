The Morose Sailor
-----------------
For a day, maybe too many to count,  
I rested under a tornado  
at a bus stop, waiting for the mountaineer to be behind.  
How pulsing is the indespensable shortcut and it's electrical seperations?  
The angellic dignity of the film!  
Around the heights I like to stand like a motionless form.  
There are many panics outside furious events.  
Carry me onto your wheel - the fruit of my wine bottle -  
like yeasts bristling amid branches.  
Electric  
empire. The line functions to blush an architecture  
to its environment.  
But the wheatfield enchanted the memory.  
The bleak bell that magnifies in your mist.  
The absorbant flower heads abolished blue earth to my fuming thread!
