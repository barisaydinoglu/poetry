Every Giant Is A Calculation
----------------------------
It was the midnight  
of the oyster.  
Everything negligent with comfortable voices, the salt of the laminated sign  
and piles of balanced bread around late afternoon.  
It was the late afternoon of the ostrich.  
The father smiles at the custodian  
but the god does not smile  
when he looks at the oyster father  
and the chaotic ocean.
