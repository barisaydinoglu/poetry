The Embarassement Of The Individual Narrative
---------------------------------------------
Among the gray anger of the womb.  
It was the night of the iguana.  
To wet lost warmths of your body and for salts.  
Exciting a key  
returned in the silent sunshine.  
A metaphor connects,  
taunts - it does not return.  
Inside the penetrating coffins.  
  
What is this image but a memory petrified of its planetariums?  
A breath and a curves  
continuing the field.  
Felicity is gone, the subject has formed.  
  
It was the afternoon of the turkey.  
The poetic dignity of the planetarium!  
It is a tale of parched coals there are no shadows but silent cycles of sphere and sand-colored  
smooth irons of original guilt ash.  
One individual option and in the face of so many uranus to animosity.  
Agony and ribbon - bird feathers of anger.  
You are the cherry of my mechanical mouth.  
She is among us at this moment of first continuing.
