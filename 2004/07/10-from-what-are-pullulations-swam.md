From What Are Pullulations Swam
-------------------------------
One of them is sweet-smelling,  
the other knows computers.  
Where is someone  
she says, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Abhor me and let my substance kiss.  
An odor has lived in the middle of the sphere,  
a mixture of ghost and body, a mixing  
river bank that brings fear.  
My comfortable lip blushes you always.  
The pioneer smiles at the mountaineer  
but the mountaineer does not smile  
when he looks at the jaguar giant  
and the crooked ocean.  
Like ashes dropping with grapes.  
A vessel is not enough to overflow me and keep me  
from the boulevard of your acerb  
epiphany.  
In my moonlight evening at late afternoon you are like a phemonana  
and your form and colour the way I love them. The archipeligos behind hers  
a tale we divulge in passing,  
with notions of respect  
and a passion for science and jouranlism  
nothing but that jar of flutes.  
You wake slowly into a university to fly your business.  
It's a fashioning  
foliage of cummerbunds.  
I am condemned by flower head and vagina, by coal and thunder.  
Pockets  
of metal converted into saphire.  
You've asked me what the oyster is flowing there with his marine fingernails?  
I  
reply, the eddy knows this.
