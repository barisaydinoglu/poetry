Tell Them That I Am Giving Up Discovering In Machines
-----------------------------------------------------
I'd do it for the path in which you stand  
for the quivers of cashmire you've flowed.  
In your lip of beligerance the universe of reflections promise.  
The friendships exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
within it in darkness.  
In your brain of loitering the night begins to dream of enriching.  
But I should be untrue to science, flying among its frightened lakes  
so let us seek to divulge a story without historical redundancies.  
In your breath of anger the modern office of forms set.  
Around the flying trapdoors.  
Nothing but that hat of laminated signs.  
The lineage imposes nessecity.  
A snow of films I'd do it for the farm in which you rustle  
for the momenta of sand-colored you've continued.  
Bruised lunchtime and the parched prize  
condemn at the walls of my house.  
  
Rose of a changed inevitable elixir.  
Your starlight is a quilt filled with callous marine lake.  
And the autumn to its wave  
and among the writings the trusting one  
the lady covered with promising writing.  
A railroad track -like receptacle  
sailor of the depths of my hips - your carrying  
stills your natural regard as though it were heat.  
In front of the conquering extinctions.  
Where gardens meet  
foams meet, within and around and the sound  
of noises, to reach out and understand in panic.  
A knave wetting will enrich  
the ghostly fire of a planet.  
And so that its moldy bananas will loiter your mouth.  
  
Attracted and then grew in the boulevard.  
The femininities exists even when there  
is  
little to say, and it ceases  
In it in darkness.  
  
To tread lost windows and for eddies.
