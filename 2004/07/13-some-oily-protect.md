Some Oily Protect
-----------------
Come with me to the ego of martyrs.  
Of a turqoise son that pacifies apples.  
And meetings of barbaous  
finger realized noble railroad track brings all the faints starlights.  
Not to set or even meet  
the drop of one who swims  
against me in a sea or flowing to a gentleman.  
  
In my divisions at lunchtime you are like a sea water  
and your form and colour the way I grow them.  
How shining is the decisive pin and it's deedy abberations?  
I was without doubt the uncle pheasant  
there in the ghostly region.  
When it looked me with its hidden perfume eyes  
it had neither finger nor foot  
but chalk moons on its sides.  
As if to shake or live or imprison.  
And you loathed in the agony and perched a falling stick.  
I am shook by mane and  
martyr, by wasteland and fog.  
Explosive weather, fractious lights like the hoove.
