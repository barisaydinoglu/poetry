The Delirious Woman Of The Chimney
----------------------------------
Crimson funerals of billows of gray smoke,  
deep brown seams above a tenacious guitar.  
When you breathe dawned like a flesh.  
Conversations of doors, the recitation  
of maternities we  
call secure flag.  
You've asked me what the oyster is  
hearing there with his opaque marine ears?  
I reply, the elixir knows this.  
Shut out and pulled out like a sun.  
Wonder is gone, the subject has played.  
  
Only home, just the  
miracle, nothing but  
it. Laminated sign.  
My heart is filled with wonder like a copper lemon.
