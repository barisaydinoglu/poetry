There Is No Ego
---------------
To seek another land under the shaken perfume, many shaken panics. With its obscene  
create when the boulevard is full of thirsty lip  
with lampreys and hollow decadent apples  
and the weak reflections and the energies  
at last give forth their neurotic phlegm.  
In the middle of the morose night of atrocious knave.  
Not the crimson moment  
when the day expands the trees.  
Sometimes a piece of the water  
invades like a ship in my leg.  
To seek another land all tigers become flames.  
A sea water dawning will dedicate  
the disintered mud of a planet.  
So the fleeting purity lives on in a cherry,  
the irreducable house of the telegraph,  
the pure salt that is charitable and moonlit.  
Foliage of an attacked oily ribbon.
