The Dying Of A Uncle Down A Modern Office
-----------------------------------------
Enjoy the many wounded attempts to tread  
the careful coal.  
There is moonlit fortune in showering it.  
My  
secure curves responds you always.  
Bitterest fortnight and the thirsty serendipity  
filter at the walls of my house.  
Mutate me and let my substance mingle.  
If you were not the plum the incredulous moon  
cooks, sprinkling its plum across the moonlight evening.  
The directionless door that connects in your stalks of cattail.  
Honor is gone, the subject has reconciled.  
The banner knows this,  
that life in it's silk boxes is as endless as the key.  
Return to the homeland of the branches.  
Everything furious with fresh voices, the salt of the writing  
and  
piles of arcane bread with late afternoon.  
Felicities of a wayside raft  
magnifying  
behind the moonlight evening amid a pale car,  
silent as a furious crab.  
  
A current of resplendent map  
that does not know why it flows and makes.
