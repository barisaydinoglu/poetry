The Production Has Not Petrified The Promise
--------------------------------------------
Next to the opaque sepia eyelids of the wind. And inside my hammock, during the morning, I woke up naked  
and full of happiness.  
Behind the fatherless starlight, many shifty conspirators.  
Relinquishing from exiled silken.  
And you make like a starlight and we get the faith  
they must lots  
to develop  
to each  
other  
or perhaps nothing but eternities.  
Perhaps they are not abhorred.  
A loaf of bread baked with sifted wonder and salt.  
Of unguessed  
nectarine, spirit  
of the droplets,  
scratched god blood, your kisses  
dawn into exile  
and a droplet of marble, with remnants of the archipeligos.  
For sun was tear stained and morally neutral.  
  
Like calcerous eddy, windows  
you say, what is the fragrance of strawberry waiting for in its sepia planetarium?  
I tell you it is waiting for sun like you.
