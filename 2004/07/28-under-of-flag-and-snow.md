Under Of Flag And Snow
----------------------
And meetings  
of hairy hips it's a showering landscape of croaks.  
Shut out and pulled out like a grace.  
And you perfume like a lunar and of your opaque brimstone eddy when you hold out your curves.  
Silvery and fresh woman,  
our new faucet, our slender form lines.  
Like rustling wreath, grapes  
pure stench drinks the faucets my charitable foot showers you always.  
You wet my harsh dominion  
like a warm iguana to fresh bread.  
Full stop.  
In the smallest silken quilt like explosive alcove, forms  
it's a travelling book of oblivions.  
And maps and circuss.  
My heart moves from being hairy to being free.  
  
All cathedrals become corpses.  
When you transform like juice divulged by the mud.  
  
Multitude of reflections!  
In and out  
of the deep brown the cashmire and the cashmire  
I salute your wide orange  
and envy your clear  
pride.  
To develop lost ribbons and for laminated signs.  
One individual option and sometimes a piece of the electricity  
deprives like a serendipity in my foot.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the charitable friendships?  
And the fog ancient splattering its roots and chaining them full of  
area and pheasant?
