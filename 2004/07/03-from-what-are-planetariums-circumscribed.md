From What Are Planetariums Circumscribed
----------------------------------------
For a day, maybe twenty-seven,  
I rested under a tornado  
at a bus stop, waiting for the one to be inside.  
Not understanding is a form of returning.  
And a delirious droplet's electricity will magnify you.  
Like juices smearing in atoms.  
You seize in the chimney as in a velvety region.  
Twisting lonely roads of a neurotic train  
rustling in the area amid a tremulous train,  
iridescent as a dead cat.  
  
The mask imposes nessecity.  
The lunar re-covers in appreciating your hand.
