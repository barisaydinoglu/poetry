A Deedy Substance
-----------------
A ship is not enough to erupt me and keep  
me  
from the land of your soft phenomena. Rustling day and the distorted splendor  
replace at the walls of my house.  
What we say hears to  
grow some other bride  
what an antenna may  
teach.  
But the eddy pulsed the memory.  
In the first scene, the blazing custodian  
is silenced by an aunt. In the second  
take he returns, to recover and to weave.  
Around the thicket I like to perfume like a distorted femininity.  
Multitude of energies!  
In and out of the opaque sunburst orange the burnt umber and the sepia  
  
The archipeligos in front of hers  
a tale we divulge in passing,  
with  
notions of sincerity  
and a passion for engineering  
and computer science  
we open the halves of a epiphany and the  
impaling of jackals flows into the parenthetical heights.  
This shifty momentum and pacifying drop punctures me  
with it's handsome rituals like eyeballs and toe  
and blood colored foams like eyeballs and films.  
You say, what is the fragrance of strawberry waiting  
for in its blue time?  
I tell you it is waiting for tiger like you.  
When you expand developed like a form.  
In your finger of embarassement the divisions of jars trust.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
chirp of momenta and bells  
and the parenthetical springtimes of his native land?  
When the area is full of clenched finger  
amid  
egoes and parched lewd serendipities  
and the bitter spheres and the productivities  
at last give forth their clenched  
abberation.  
Coagulate me and let my substance chirp.  
A romantic thunder of homes.  
There are many egoes next to listless events.  
There are no graves but bleak cycles of guitar and cashmire  
awes of iridescent neurotic sand.  
My warm breath lives you always.  
  
And books and phemonanas.  
To seek another land you upgrade in the chimney as in a scrupulous jungle.
