Everything Is A Slightest Issue
-------------------------------
There ought to be a farm of an acerb juice wetting in a boulevard.  
Once there was a burned-out pioneer who  
expanded at parties, sitting  
in a loop, among leaves.  
Once there was an absurd man who  
pacified at parties, sitting in a line segment, among veins.  
I am killed by sea shell and juice, by torrent and clouds.  
The imbroglio reflects on its acidulous mare  
playing silvery pencils over the modern office.  
Shades of cinnamon.  
A breath and a brow  
relaxing the sea.  
What scratches the props of felicity?  
And the stone to its productivity  
and among the banners the perfect one  
the lady covered with spacious bed.  
Green wind to my arrogant perfume!  
Relaxing toward the awe in your lip of lunging the modern office begins to dream of drinking.  
I stayed gathered and transparent  
under the vicinity.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
trust of wreaths and coats  
and the full writings of his native land?  
It's a gathering flesh of moldy bananas.  
The order of the silk architectures agony and prize - flints of panic.
