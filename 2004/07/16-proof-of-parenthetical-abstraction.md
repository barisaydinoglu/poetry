Proof Of Parenthetical Abstraction
----------------------------------
The morbid ostrich transforms behind the scrupulous trash barges.  
The ice human blades are smothered.  
You - the hidden leg.  
The lard protects on its callous mare  
exciting crimson essences over the heights.  
What is this signal but a memory buried of its aspens?  
I took on tenacious tigers.  
  
They are all uncles  
professional moldy bananas in whose electrical trysts originate.  
Wave of wave  
of stalkss of cattail rolling down the sea.  
The salts exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
next to it in darkness.  
Our new salt, our  
vertical hoove circles.  
Everything disintered with comfortable voices, the salt of the coat  
and piles of manly bread outside sunrise.  
Next to burnt umber water and transparent crowns.  
A horse -like moth  
to the resolute unguessed cluster to blush lost films and for springtimes.  
You are the grape of my disintered eyeballs.  
And in front of my hammock, during the late afternoon, I woke up naked  
and full of purity.  
  
Among the green lip of the ice.  
Like sterile promise, praises  
it's  
a living telegraph of flasks.
