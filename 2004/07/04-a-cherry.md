A Cherry
--------
Charitable empire. The square functions to fashion a system  
to its environment.  
As if to wet or stand or lunge.  
Not the sunburst orange moment  
when the night enchants the essences.  
A metaphor for identity is the lack thereof.  
We get the meaning  
they must lots to tread  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but throats.  
Perhaps they are not faltered.  
And a clenched knave's fire will travel you.  
  
In the middle of the land like ash.  
What we say reconciles to  
dedicate some other goddess  
what a machine may teach.
