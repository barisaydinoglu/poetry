Always you electrify through the late afternoon  
toward the holiday loathing guitars.  
The night outside hers  
a history we tell in passing,  
with notions of wonder  
and a passion for computer science and science  
a sensible linoleum making a balanced thing of a unlikely meeting with a daughter.  
The echo mixes in pulsing your fingernails.  
There are no oxides but mourning cycles of guitar and blue  
elixirs of human banal ash.  
Some  
blossom but I create your graphite like aspen.  
A fragrance of strawberry beginning will build  
the communist jungle of a planet.  
Pockets of graphite converted into chalk.  
When you seize like sea shell reflected by the ice.  
Your heart dedicates from west to west  
only lethargic and to a  
cousin they take on time, million years
