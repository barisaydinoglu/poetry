The Phlegm Fallen Into The Sea
------------------------------
You've asked me what the oyster is showering there with his sunburst orange hand?  
I reply, the lunar knows this. A circle in front of a quadrangle,  
the raucous workings of clear law.  
The moldy banana responds on its cheerless mare  
perfuming transparent hats over the boulevard.  
  
The celestial goddess  
perches in the poetic morning.  
A loaf of bread baked with inevitable pride and salt.  
Nothing but that tryst of bells.  
Because I love you, love, outside the electricity and outside the electricity.
