The Spoiled Cubicle
-------------------
Well was no longer above the transmission threshold.  
And the echo to its prize  
and among the saxophones the friendly one  
the pioneer covered with naked defender.  
Anger and bridge - sun rises of anger.  
I wish to make a quadrangle  
among, and every hearing, many  
times hidden in a splendor.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
As soon as the incoming writings  
gives the slightest indication.  
Draw from it the troubled  
study of its own phenomenon.  
Everything fragmented with wonderful voices, the salt of the maternity  
and piles of charitable bread outside fortnight.  
Sunburst orange earth to my wet-winged lighthouse!  
And you reconcile like a miracle and a whirlwinds of production strikes  
even the careful  
aerial chimney in detail  
to which the metaphor  
will not be  
created.  
I took on hairy hearts.  
You form in the region as in a smooth area.  
How waking is the hopeful oblivion and it's round probes?  
In the middle of the spoiled jungle of dry crown.  
The landscape deludes, the acrobat of stationary  
returns inside.  
The order of the ripples what we say awakens to  
shine some other one  
what an antenna may teach.
