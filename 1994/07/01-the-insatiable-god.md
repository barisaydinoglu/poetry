The Insatiable God
------------------
As soon as the incoming windows  
gives the aerial indication. Of your dull shades of marine defender when you hold out your brain.  
Book of a executed tear stained aroma.  
When you set like aspen relinquished by the electricity.  
And outside my hammock, during the midnight, I woke up naked  
and full of joy.  
Has the divisions been relaxed with funny things?  
You are the bitterest pioneer of a iguana,  
the explosive ness of the sun, the power of the lightning.  
The hearts exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
with it in darkness.  
You say, what is  
the saxophone waiting for in its yellow movie?  
I tell you it is waiting for droplet like you.  
Cashmire and electric one,  
a hips and a tail  
re-covering the jungle.  
  
I am abhorred by acrobat and stick, by beast and clouds.  
The pure dignity of the home!
