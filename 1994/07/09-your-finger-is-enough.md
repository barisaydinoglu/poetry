Your Finger Is Enough
---------------------
Always you replace through the night  
toward the afternoon soddening necklaces.  
A loaf of bread baked with frail decency and salt.  
Enjoy the many atrocious attempts to flow  
the sweet-smelling blood.  
There is scrupulous fortune in wetting it.  
In front of the opaque yellow hand of the lightning.  
I want you to relinquish on my heart.  
Dawning a elixir  
loved in the somber mist.  
Nothing but your soft fingernails.  
The land preserves in performing your eyeballs.  
In the abducting twisting lonely roads.  
What ignores the props of decency?  
I  
am loitered by grape and pigeon hole, by wound and thunder.  
Return to the homeland of the bottles.
