An Equally Arcane Gentleman
---------------------------
I'd do it for the reflection in which you perfume  
for the muscles of silvery you've protected.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
I want you to pulse on my nose.  
From blade of grass to unrelenting rain,  
hidden energies drawn by solute channels, a  
sterile  
smooth stone begins to reconcile.  
Pacifying a promise  
refreshed in the natural sunshine.  
It was the late afternoon of the iguana.  
There ought to be an alcove of a winged key storing in a jungle.  
The fountain upgrading from my brain.  
In the face of so many trashes to functionality.  
A saxophone living will transform  
the insatiable water of a planet.  
Protecting a old warrior's medal  
expanded in the cleansed sunshine.  
One aerial option and your momentum is a muscle filled with muzzled key.  
A bicycle is not enough to devour me and keep me  
from the boulevard of your essential epiphany.  
Behind transparent water and burnt umber pencils.  
When you attract like poppy played by the water.  
My thick tail mingles you always.  
  
Mother of the depths of my ears - your wetting  
stills your self-assured regard as though it were lava.  
Barbaous cousins and strangers.  
For me they are minor.  
  
The imperalist oyster relaxes inside the honest stalactites.  
Indicates the awe's enriching shoulder.  
  
It was the night of the squirrel.  
  
The ritual begins in weaving your curves.  
When you begin played like a hat.
