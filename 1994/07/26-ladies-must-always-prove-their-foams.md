Ladies Must Always Prove Their Foams
------------------------------------
In the film of the boulevard where you sleep,  
a dream petrifies into techniques.  
Return to the homeland of the roses.  
I saw how keys are preserved  
by the comfortable aroma.  
It's a upgrading heart of cadavers.  
When you stand like smooth stone drank by the lightning.  
To the friendly equinoctial awe I took on rusted coats.  
Under the vicinity like iron.  
  
Circumscribe on the jackals that wait for you  
devouring the raucous chairs, dropping the doors.  
Swimming toward the crown when you mingle kissed like a serenity.  
Has the boulevard  
been woke with secrets?
