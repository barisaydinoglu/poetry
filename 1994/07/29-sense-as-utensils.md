Sense As Utensils
-----------------
Always you congeal through the lunchtime  
toward the early light of day coddling crowns.  
Of your brimstone bottle when you hold out your hips.  
Around the thicket I like to swim like a smothered leaf.  
Inside the turqoise illusion of the shards of bolt of cedar.  
Upgrading from mechanical paper-mache.  
For quilt was nauesous and morally neutral.  
Return to the homeland of the fragrances of strawberry.  
A chorus of lobsters at sunrise  
un trod un cracked  
comes to a halt before a kiss.  
A chorus of crabs at night un built un filtered  
comes to a halt before a smooth stone.  
Where mosaics meet  
hearts meet, outside and outside and the sound  
of salivas, to reach out and stand in illusion.  
My heart is filled with love like a cork umbrella.  
  
I wish to make a triangle  
behind, and every sight, many  
times hidden in a telegraph.  
Amid crimson water and crimson laws.  
Realized arcane magnolium conversations of books, the recitation  
of foams we call electrical circus.  
The decadent squirrel fashions among the cosmic howls.  
Drop of a loathed neurotic salt.  
You are the mango of my disintered finger.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.
