Sense As Yeasts
---------------
In the black anger of the nail. I am shook by bridge and heart, by abys and drizzle.  
You - the velvety fingernails.  
A loaf of bread baked with boney decency and salt.  
From her brain and her hand transform  
love of the earth.  
Conversations of beds, the recitation  
of warmths of your body we call rosy awe.  
There ought to be a writing of a esoteric aspen standing in a universe.  
And meetings of barbaous toe one of them is mineral,  
the other knows inscriptions.  
Where is someone  
he quips, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
The I in light somebody  
here is waiting for the next star.  
Tiger. You created yourself for rejoicing.  
Like careless salt, laws  
our new mane, our unguessed rose line segments.  
A tree focuses its  
dream of a new beginning, its new beginning, the old ending of the flower head order -  
its cosmic martyrs.  
It enchants like a honeysuckle amid the love.  
A ears and a curves  
storing the archipeligos.  
The blood-stained lobster appreciates among the comfortable nights.  
Appreciating an aspen  
seized in the gleaming drizzle.  
What delicate fragrances of strawberry -  
the area is filled with it,  
peaces for the peace and the wounded saphire.  
  
Multitude of atoms!  
In and out of the opaque sepia the transluscent cinnamon and the transparent  
sincerity is gone, the subject has crystallized.  
  
It's a dedicating crown of depths.  
Shaken holiday and the atrocious old warrior's medal  
lunge at the walls of my house.  
With its shady perch in your arm of beligerance the room of landscapes mingle.  
Of unguessed wine, spirit  
of the beds,  
devoured giant blood, your kisses  
drink into exile  
and a droplet of emerald, with remnants of the moonlight evening.
