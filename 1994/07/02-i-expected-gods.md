I Expected Gods
---------------
Cheerless rectums and bleak panics.  
Because I love you, love, next to the jungle and next to the fire.  
On what tremulous bloody feathers loved with lightning?  
Multitude of railroad tracks!  
In and out of the crimson the crimson and the green  
There ought to be a light of a trusting well performing in a vicinity.  
I took on brutal guitars.  
  
You - the free leg.  
It flutters like a path in the snow.  
Carry me onto your helicopter  
- the mango of my coral -  
Shut up and closed off like a circus.  
Multitude of writings!  
In  
and out of the opaque transparent the marine and the sepia  
everything dead with enchanting voices, the salt of the springtime  
and piles of indespensable bread around holiday.  
Stone.
