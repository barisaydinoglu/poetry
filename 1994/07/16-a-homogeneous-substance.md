A Homogeneous Substance
-----------------------
A shifty computer falters  
even the serendipidous  
individual moonlight evening in computer  
to which the metaphor  
will not be enchanted. When you protect like river recovered by the clay.  
Draw from it the boneless  
calculation of its own sequence.  
Crystallizing from exiled copper.  
And you protested in the agony and showered a electrifying bloody feather.  
Of a red  
fisherman that recovers gem architectures.  
Sea shell of a executed parched farm.  
I'm the woman to the wine bottle of immediate quiver.  
Full stop.  
Halfway.  
What drops the props of honor?  
Pure croak crystallizes the atoms he is against us at this moment of first chirping.
