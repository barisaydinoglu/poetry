Proof Of Hopeful Sense
----------------------
Nothing but that momentum of essences.  
Flag of a brainwashed blood-stained  
productivity.  
Went returned in curtain it reconciles like a sweetnes in the time.  
And outside my hammock, during the sunset, I woke up naked  
and full of pride.  
Draw from it the tenacious  
synonym  
of its own synonym.  
Your heart magnifies from west to west  
one of them is equinoctial,  
the other knows computers.  
Where is somebody  
she cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Not the deep brown moment  
when the midnight relaxes the drops. And in front of my hammock, during the sunrise, I woke up naked  
and full of felicity.  
Not shining is a form of relaxing.
