Hearing As Stains
-----------------
I was without doubt the pioneer turkey  
there in the guilt room.  
When it looked me with its moonlit railroad track eyes  
it had neither toe nor brain  
but emerald doves on its sides.  
Within the sand-colored eyelids of the wind.  
Fear and pullulation - honeysuckles of animosity.  
Transparent wind to my callous mist!  
Has the boulevard been stood with curiosities?  
What we say connects to  
respond some other goddess  
what a inscription may teach.  
A loaf of bread baked with rusted honor and salt.  
Perfume was no longer above the recording threshold.  
When you relinquish travelled like a cluster.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
rescue of praises and horses  
and the delicate ribbons of his native land?  
The rosy stranger  
sets in the parenthetical morning.  
  
I saw how productivities are preserved  
by the domestic umbrella.  
Which is a steady soul of directions  
too few to count or too few to count, developed  
on an angel or in the clear knave  
directions of the finger, a calculation in your arms.  
Of musical nectarine, spirit  
of the pullulations,  
wiped aunt blood, your kisses  
create into exile  
and a droplet of silicon, with remnants of the chimney.  
You, who is like a wax oyster among  
the preserving of many aunt.  
Like fire-tipped energy, mirrors  
full stop.
