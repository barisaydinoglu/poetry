An Equally Absent Minded God
----------------------------
Return to the homeland of the warmths.  
And you attract like a momentum and like barbaous breakfast, affections  
I could gather rooster, felicity, and moth  
from foams and perfumes  
with a dull shades of sunburst orange sunburst orange car  
with massacres in my arm.  
Be guided by the iridescent momentum's coat. He is in us at this moment of first breathing.
