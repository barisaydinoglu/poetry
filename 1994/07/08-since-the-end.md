Since The End
-------------
Some relinquish but I blossom your graphite like coral.  
A machine for metaphor is the lack thereof.  
It is a tale of disordered twisting lonely roads always you lunge through the holiday  
toward the sunset smearing reflections.  
A thunder of forms and the serendipity to its bird feather  
and among the bird feathers the scrupulous one  
the child covered with fresh farm.  
Poppy was no longer right at the recording threshold.  
The bridges exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
amid it in darkness.  
The enchanting god  
plays in  
the musical morning.  
Reflect on the jugulars that wait for you  
brainwashing the insufferable chairs, soddening the doors.  
Transparent ghosts of rotten stump,  
burnt umber seams above a violenet echo.  
As if to bury or travel or steal.
