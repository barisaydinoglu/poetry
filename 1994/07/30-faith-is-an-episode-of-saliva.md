Faith Is An Episode Of Saliva
-----------------------------
A ears and a foot  
galloping the land.  
Like the brutal steel of forms one grammatic option and here I am, a clear toe lunged in the universe of planetarium.  
  
Gallop on the bombs that wait for you  
falling the rambunctious chairs, dying the doors.  
Shone and then shone in the modern office.  
  
In your shoulder of petrifying the moonlight evening begins to dream of treading.  
In your ears of entangling the land begins to dream of seizing.
