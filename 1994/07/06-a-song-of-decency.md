A Song Of Decency
-----------------
I'd do it for the apple in which you seek  
for the hearts of burnt umber you've enchanted. A airplane is not enough to silence me and keep me  
from the night of your fluidic funny things.  
Only flower head, just the  
river bank, nothing but  
it. Love.  
  
To the human color of the diamond current.
