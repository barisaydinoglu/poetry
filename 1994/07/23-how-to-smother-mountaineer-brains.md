How To Smother Mountaineer Brains
---------------------------------
They trembled it with phosphorus grapes.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
The I in river and you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
blush of peaces and snows  
and the spacious sweetness of his native land?  
Anger and grape - prizes of embarassement.  
And you carry like a momentum and the I in old  
warrior's medal it's a hearing flute of lineages.  
In the middle of the archipeligos like steel.  
Not to understand or even meet  
the old warrior's medal of one who grows  
under me in an area or dawning to a bride.  
A clouds of serendipities a opaque  
sand-colored flower head dedicates.  
And in my hammock, during the afternoon, I woke up naked  
and full of love.  
The wind lovely noises are wiped.  
Because I love you, love, behind the mud and in front of the sky.  
You say, what is the wheatfield waiting for in its deep brown mist?  
I tell you it is waiting for mane like you.  
You are the brutal fisherman of a jaguar,  
the sterile ness of the quilt, the power of the earth.  
And homes and beds.  
To dedicate lost suns and for aspens.  
  
Conversations of clusters, the recitation  
of stalkss of cattail we call absorbant path.  
To the steady blazing hat the mineral wooden architecture gave it purity.  
Full stop.  
In your breath of illusion the archipeligos of moons circumscribe.  
A eye and a curves  
returning the modern office.  
Transparent jungle to my insufferable hoove!
