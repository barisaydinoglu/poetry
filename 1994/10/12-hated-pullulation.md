Hated Pullulation
-----------------
The burned-out landscape is moonlit on your foot.  
Blades of a rustling airplane  
preserving next to the divisions outside a fuming vessel,  
Natural as a morbid squirrel.  
The noise chirps on its hushed mare  
crystallizing cashmire acrobats over the universe. Our new warmth of your body, our incredulous wheatfield triangles.
