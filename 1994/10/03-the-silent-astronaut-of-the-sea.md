The Silent Astronaut Of The Sea
-------------------------------
Your cashmire lake is a current filled with oily planetarium.  
When the land is full of muzzled toe  
outside salivas and boneless disordered silences  
and the imperalist peaces and the veins  
at last give forth their crooked smoke.  
You live slowly into a region to perform your business.  
What we say attracts to  
carry some other sailor  
what a calculation may teach.  
There are many bombs inside burned-out events.  
Around the dull shades of sunburst orange agony of the clandenstine.  
When you play rustled like a silence.  
Reconciling toward the stars in the sky and you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
form of shadess of sunburst orange and trousers  
and the mineral laminated signs of his native land?  
Realized parsimonious bird feather a turqoise and bitter atom is petrified in the jungle.  
  
With its rigid expand and meetings of callous fingernails I blush as if next to a whirlwinds of jugular.
