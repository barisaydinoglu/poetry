Outside Side Understanding - Metaphors And Computer Science
-----------------------------------------------------------
And meetings of lethargic mouth you are going to ask where are the fill?  
And  
the unguessed flutes?  
And the sunshine moonlit splattering its cactuss and filtering them full of  
room and lobster?  
Silence was no longer above the transmission threshold.  
A love travelling will seek  
the mourning clay of a planet.  
Reflection.  
For hat was ghostly and morally neutral.  
Has the moonlight evening been awakened with curiosities?  
A ship is not enough to coagulate me and keep me  
from the night of your cordial curiosities.  
The loving ship gave it decency.  
  
Always you protest through the fortnight  
toward the morning dismantling knaves.  
For a day, maybe twenty-seven,  
I rested under a palm tree leaf  
at a post office, waiting for the custodian to be outside.  
I am shook by heart and abberation, by cadaver and thunder.  
Like silent smooth aluminum, peaces  
inside silvery water and green lunars.
