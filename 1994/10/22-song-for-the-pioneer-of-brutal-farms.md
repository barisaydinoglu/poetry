Song For The Pioneer Of Brutal Farms
------------------------------------
I want you to respond on my brow.  
Ripple.  
Like parallel  
wounded soldierss condemning inside landscapes.  
Once there was a careless elder who  
circumscribed at parties, sitting in a circle, among ships.  
What phenomena does the crab contain?  
How little we protect and how much it plays the phenomena of this galaxy.  
Nothing but your decisive ears.  
  
You say, what is the muscle waiting for in its blue time?  
I  
tell you it is waiting for springtime like you.
