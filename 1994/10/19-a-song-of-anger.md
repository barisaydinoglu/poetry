A Song Of Anger
---------------
Conversations of elixirs, the recitation  
of saxophones we call hidden muscle.  
Dead aunts and giants.  
For me they are grammatic.  
I want you to seize on my tail.  
Light on the waxes that wait for you  
congealing the senile chairs, abhorring the doors.  
Neither goblet nor key nor red  
nor marine but marine.  
My stationary brow lights you always.  
Seperations of a ghostly vessel  
shining outside the thicket outside a negligent bicycle,  
rosy as a disintered cat.  
Towards those angels of yours that wait for me.  
Next to the impaling belts.  
A triangle outside a line,  
the guilt workings of trusting law.  
What abandons the props of joy?  
On what shady yeasts returned with sky?  
Ignore me and let my substance reflect.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the nocturnal laminated signs?  
And the clouds monastic splattering its  
splendors and compounding them full of  
region and squirrel?  
Vein.
