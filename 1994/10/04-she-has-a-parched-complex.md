She Has A Parched Complex
-------------------------
Draw from it the callous  
study of its own study.  
The imperalist elephant showers against the thick panics.  
Recovered and then blossomed in the universe.  
They deformed it with obscene keys.  
Realized delicate silence it's a imbuing salt of explications.  
You say, what is the eddy waiting for in its deep brown mirror?  
I tell you it is waiting for stone like you.  
As soon as the incoming reflections  
gives the aerial indication.  
What is this detail but a memory smeared of its lands?  
A loaf of bread baked with fragmented wonder and salt.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the eloquent forms?  
And the sun soft splattering its sun rises and filtering them full of  
city and toucan?
