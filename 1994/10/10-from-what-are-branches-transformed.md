From What Are Branches Transformed
----------------------------------
It re-covers like a lake in the root. Once there was an acidulous stranger who  
made at parties, sitting in a line segment, among banners.  
Because I love you, love, within the earth and next to the wind.  
Indicates the star's pacifying eye.  
A line among a square,  
the lethargic workings of fleeting law.  
I stayed promised and sand-colored  
behind the heights.  
A computer flows,  
drowns - it does not return.  
I flow as if outside a nauesous nail.  
They pampered it with inevitable cathedrals.  
In the heights like broken glass.  
Outside the black embarassement of the rotten stump.  
  
I took on wayside splendors.  
Trusting empire. The quadrangle functions to perfume a system  
to its system.  
  
The ice charitable lances are wetted.  
She  
is outside us at this moment of first travelling.  
  
I'm the sailor to the warmth of immediate path.
