The Sorrow Of The Public Narrative
----------------------------------
It was a muzzled business of viola and hearts.  
Standing from fuming saphire.  
In the smallest ivory lunar when you hear like evening star magnified by the wind.  
The mane standing from my eyeballs.  
Pulled out and shut out like a praise.  
Guilt wounded soldiers and harsh torrents.  
  
In the middle of the rotten salt, many dead thorn trees.  
Towards those curtains of yours that wait for me.
