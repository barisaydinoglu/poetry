Public Techniques Are All Next To Us
------------------------------------
Carry me onto your wheel - the apple of my current -  
like rotten stumps deceiving outside hearts.  
From harrowing wind to uncomfortable turbulence,  
hidden paths drawn by loving channels, a  
furious film begins to relinquish.  
Lunar of a drowned neurotic circus.  
A ship -like stain  
the shades of cashmire flows in re-covering your eyelids.  
In the middle of the calculating flag, many neurotic abyss.  
  
I want you to rise on my arm.  
To build lost mists and for perfumes.  
Violenet masks and browbeaten gates.  
Mist was no longer below the recording threshold.  
Be guided by the cordial writing's quiver.  
To the enduring color of the bolt of silicon precision.  
And you trembled in the panic and breathed a executing flask.
