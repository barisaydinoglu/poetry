I Expected Custodians
---------------------
Pure stench begins the horses halfway.  
It mixes like a thread amid the aroma.  
I was without doubt the giant bird  
there in the callous room.  
When it looked me  
with its brandishing current eyes  
it had neither eyelids nor foot  
but ceramic flutes on its sides.  
What we say relaxes to  
protect some other uncle  
what a inscription may teach.  
Because I love you, love, inside the earth and inside the electricity.  
Our new flower head, our musical flag quadrangles.  
Sensible, silken juice!
