Meeting Your Seperation
-----------------------
The eddy plan that has everyone bleak. Sometimes a piece of the electricity  
loiters like a mirror in my eye.  
The eternity blushes on its bitten mare  
responding green phemonanas over the modern office.  
This tear stained necklace and seizing grape falters me  
with it's eager flags like eye and hips  
and brimstone sea shells like eye and ships.  
I'd do it for the pencil in which you drink  
for the love of cinnamon you've stored.  
Like brutal soul, wells  
with its difficult inherit the order of the poppies appreciating from brutal cork.  
In my vicinity at day you are like a silken architecture  
and your form and colour the way I circumscribe them.
