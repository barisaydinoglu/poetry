The Sticky Heart
----------------
The late afternoon acrobats you in its mortal clay.  
It's an appreciating friendship of coffins.  
Nothing but that bolt of ivory architecture of flower heads.  
What eloquent utensils -  
the archipeligos is filled with it,  
fountains for the essence and the molested copper.  
In your leg of abolishing the chimney begins to dream of kissing.  
Halfway.  
There are no beasts but mechanical cycles of angel and cinnamon  
lakes of angellic insatiable iron.  
I kiss as if inside a hairy alarm.
