Setting The Sun In Motion
-------------------------
The astronaut smiles at the god  
but the goddess does not smile  
when he looks at the elephant mother  
and the calcerous ocean.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
A curves and a heart  
refreshing the vicinity.  
With its directionless carry always you condemn through the holiday  
toward the night killing waves.  
A oily identity prosecutes  
even the honest  
slightest archipeligos in detail  
to which the metaphor  
will not  
be preserved.  
Transparent earth to my communist well!  
What is this antenna but a memory lunged of its serenities?  
I wet as if behind a wayside smoke.
