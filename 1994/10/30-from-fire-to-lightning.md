From Fire To Lightning
----------------------
I stayed rescued and silvery  
against the vicinity.  
Wave of wave of aromas rolling down the sea.  
Carry me onto your boat - the orange of my mane -  
Nothing but your naked nose.  
Sometimes a piece of the heat  
deforms like a time in my arm.  
What we say seeks to  
respond some other giant  
what a sequence may teach.  
The dagger imposes nessecity.  
Has the sea been refreshed with  
epiphany?  
A bruised perfume day  
when the divisions is full of tremulous curves  
with corpses and browbeaten hated perfumes  
and the mourning poppies and the magnoliums  
at last give forth their negligent stain.  
  
My heart moves from being boney to being musical.  
And inside my hammock, during the morning, I woke  
up naked  
and full of pride.  
Inside the blood colored animosity of the croak.  
There are no serections but  
bitterest cycles of kiss and cinnamon  
honeysuckles of enduring melancholy aluminum.  
You are the orange of my bruised hand.  
One of them is soft,  
the other knows productions.  
Where is everybody  
he exclaims, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
There ought to be a starry sky of a soft peace developing in a night.
