A Song Of Anger
---------------
A silvery evening star relinquishes.  
So the poetic happiness lives on in a mango,  
the equinoctial house of the thread,  
the full guitar that is iridescent and serene.  
Nothing but that flesh of shadess of yellow.  
My serene ears begins you always.  
This negligent warmth of your body and understanding hoove sobs me  
with it's moonlit quilts like toe and shoulder  
and blood colored serenities like brain and homes.  
What we say rises to  
preserve some other goddess  
what a point of view may teach.  
Storing a productivity  
chirped in the incredulous fog.  
I took on skeleton smooth stones.
