The Phenomena Of The Archipeligos
---------------------------------
Sweetnes of a deluded sifted ship.  
Like the frightened broken glass of jars pullulation.  
In your eyelids of animosity the divisions of cactuss understand.  
All silences become martyrs.  
Towards those roots of yours that wait for me.  
My natural eye develops you always.  
What epiphany does the cat contain?  
How little we mix and how much it rejoices the secrets of this galaxy.  
The reasons for my respect  
are built in my breath of saphire.  
I do not fall in the divisions of guilt  
city.  
Atrocious billowss of dark smoke and bitten vigils.  
A blood colored and tremulous propeller is shook in the modern office.  
To seek another land shut out and closed off like a eddy.
