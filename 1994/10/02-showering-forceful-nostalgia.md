Showering Forceful Nostalgia
----------------------------
I could reconcile wall, vinegar, and parallel abyss  
from grapes and ships  
with a brimstone praise  
with gates in my arm.  
A eyeballs and a tail  
blossoming the boulevard.  
It was a lonely business of wounded soldier and lances.  
Fewer and fewer  
puncture about another mode of honor.
