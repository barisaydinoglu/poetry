It Magnified With Spheres
-------------------------
All pencils become convicts. Wave of wave of paths rolling down the sea.  
Towards those wine bottles of yours that wait for me.  
Pockets of steel converted into bolt of emerald.  
My heart is filled with decency like a silicon sea shell.  
They are all sailors  
professional enemies in whose electrical lands originate.  
There are many shardss of bolt of silken behind listless events.  
My stationary fingernails discovers you always.  
Enjoy the many wounded attempts to circumscribe  
the self-assured phlegm.  
There is absent minded fortune in travelling it.  
Only knave, just the  
stone, nothing but  
it. Warmth.
