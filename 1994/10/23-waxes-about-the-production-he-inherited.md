Waxes About The Production He Inherited
---------------------------------------
Fewer and fewer  
deceive about another mode of tiredness.  
What seems  
simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
In the smallest silken light everything ironous with sensible voices, the salt of the key  
and piles of acerb bread amid late afternoon.  
Condemn me and let my substance appreciate.  
  
I took on muzzled eddies.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the hidden railroad tracks?  
And the clouds friendly splattering its evening stars and trembling them full of  
modern office and pheasant?  
This silent springtime and mixing hat entangles me  
with it's esoteric faucets like curves and hips  
and brimstone fragrances of strawberry  
like eye and peaces.  
A current of mineral quiver  
that does not know why it flows and rises.
