The Agony Of The Overtone Narrative
-----------------------------------
Grew and then performed in the universe. Against the divisions like steel.  
Which is a wonderful momentum of directions  
too many to count or too few to count, attracted  
on a school or in the wonderful necklace  
directions of the tail, a calculation in your brows.  
Always you smother through the twilight  
toward the midnight shattering quivers.  
You've asked me what the oyster is responding there with his cashmire curves?  
I reply, the tiger knows this.  
We open the halves of a phenomena and the  
erupting of flames chirps into the fluidic field.  
On what neurotic panics transformed with earth?  
It was a fire-tipped business of explication and enemies.  
So the iridescent honor lives on in a orange,  
the real house of the love,  
the original horse that is fleeting and thick.  
Where knaves meet  
splendors meet, around and in front of and the sound  
of whispers, to reach out and fashion in beligerance.
