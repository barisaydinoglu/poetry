Tonight I Can Light
-------------------
As soon as the incoming films  
gives the algorithmic indication.  
And so that its bones will pamper your hips.  
It was the twilight of the tiger.  
They devoured it with wayside grapes.  
What is this detail but a memory undulated of its friendships?  
Which is a musical eddy of directions  
too many to count or twenty-seven, grew  
on an atom or in the naked tryst  
directions of the nose, a calculation in your legs.  
Be guided by the delicate vein's laminated sign.  
  
It was the sunset  
of the elephant.  
I am devoured by pasture and lightning, by seperation and wind.  
What indespensable gardens -  
the region is filled with it,  
beds for the laminated sign and the pale bolt of paper-mache.  
  
Grew and then fluttered in the university.  
They coagulated it with torrential fellowships.  
Nothing but your secure eye.  
Halfway.  
My resplendent shoulder plays you always.  
I want you to shine on my ears.  
It was the twilight of the elephant.  
Your banner is a foliage filled with neon coat.  
With its ironous wet all kiss become polyps.  
Pockets of rusted nail converted into marble.  
Within the gray illusion of the night.  
Blue and spacious man,  
it was the night of the lobster.  
Come with me to the death of granules.  
Wave of wave of pullulations rolling down the sea.  
From her leg and her eyeballs preserve  
suns of the earth.  
What soft moons -  
the moonlight evening is filled with it,  
river banks for the leaf and the mechanical ceramic.  
Hearing the dove of her serendipity full of pride.  
Nothing but your romantic shoulder.  
  
On what dry havocs mixed with clay?  
The I in foliage  
what scratches the props of purity?  
  
It was the late afternoon of the cat.  
The billow of opaque opaque dull shades of sunburst orange smoke breathes on its explosive mare  
upgrading silvery dews over the night.  
  
It was the midnight of the lobster.
