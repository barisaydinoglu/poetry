From What Are Utensils Transformed
----------------------------------
The insufferable bird rescues under the electrical corruptions.  
In the middle of the banal momentum, many putrid yeasts.  
A leaf -like throat  
here I am, a indespensable lip coagulated in the city of maternity.  
Once there was a insatiable person who  
protected at parties, sitting in a quadrangle, among paths.  
When the universe is full of atrocious hand  
inside  
legumes and silent melancholy defenders  
and the motionless doors and the dews  
at last give forth their bitter cubicle.  
For a day, maybe too many to count,  
I rested under a harrowing wind  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the bride to be outside.  
Showering a banner  
carried in the starry sunshine.  
The tear stained maternity is human on your toe.  
From unrelenting rain to uncomfortable turbulence,  
hidden atoms drawn by real channels, a  
phosphorus mosaic begins to promise.  
To seek another land and you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
reflect of lunars and stalkss of cattail  
and the eloquent love of his native land?
