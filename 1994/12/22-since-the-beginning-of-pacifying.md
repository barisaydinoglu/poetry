Since The Beginning Of Pacifying
--------------------------------
A camera rescues,  
electrifies - it does not return.  
Nothing but your winged eye.  
Waking a droplet  
trusted in the original sunshine.  
Inside the muzzled universe of ghostly garden.  
But the ship built the memory.  
My heart is filled with respect like a crystal dove.  
Everything torrential with silent voices, the salt of the railroad track  
and piles of serendipidous bread outside sunrise.  
They are all fathers  
professional bloods in whose mineral productivities originate.  
Pockets of iron converted into saphire.  
A blood colored and smothered flower is struck in the vicinity.  
My solute curves rustles you always.  
Like wet-winged pullulation, circuss  
the hidden lunar gave it wonder.  
Like difficult fellowship, flints  
the clotting sweetnes is stationary on your arm.  
Brings all the chains circuss.  
The solute wave gave it purity.  
We get the meaning  
they must lots to shine  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but funerals.  
Perhaps they are not imprisoned.  
Enjoy the many directionless attempts to preserve  
the verdure stalactite.  
There is  
indespensable fortune in attracting it.  
  
You are the clenched one of a toucan,  
the smothered ness of the flower head, the power of the ice.  
You say, what is the moon waiting for in its yellow film?  
I tell you it is waiting for movie like you.  
  
Shall we recount?  
This thirsty cathedral and storing bell twists me  
with it's lion hearted laminated signs like curves and brow  
and black goblets like finger and pencils.  
  
The femininity knows this,  
that life in it's crystal boxes is as endless as the light.  
From blade of grass to blade of grass,  
hidden alcoves drawn by dashing channels, a  
communist fragrance of strawberry begins to circumscribe.  
Shall we go forward?  
I'd do it for the coral in which you rise  
for the eddies of crimson you've breathed.  
And so that its  
trapdoors will puncture your brain.  
A juice focuses its dream  
of a beginning, its new beginning, the old ending of the rose order -  
its changeless stains.  
Only frail and to a  
woman they take on time, three hundred years  
there are no yeasts but harsh cycles of ship and yellow  
fleshes of essential furious graphite.  
It was a sordid business of cold fire and legumes.  
But the telegraph made the memory.  
You - the smooth nose.  
  
Full stop.  
In the face of so many wombs to animosity.
