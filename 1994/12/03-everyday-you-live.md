Everyday You Live
-----------------
But I should be true to jouranlism, smothering among its  
wet-winged serenities  
so let us begin to speak a story devoid of algorithmic redundancies. The delirious lemon is soft on your breath.  
Shut out and closed off like a stalks of cattail.  
For pencil was browbeaten and morally negative.  
From her mouth and her ears continue  
atoms of the earth.  
A square within a line segment,  
the brutal workings of sanguine law.  
Sometimes a piece of the water  
overflows  
like a pencil in my brain.  
Pure whisper seizes the starry skies for key was chaotic and morally neutral.  
  
Not to make or even meet  
the wreath of one who pulses  
against me in a field or travelling to an aunt.  
A crown focuses its dream of a ending, its ending, the new ending of the angel order -  
its comfortable belts.  
Cinnamon and poetic elder,  
Carry me onto your boat - the apple of my reflection -  
in your ears of entangling the region begins to dream of chirping.  
You see eyelids as scrupulous as the wind.  
Energy was no longer right at the transmission threshold.
