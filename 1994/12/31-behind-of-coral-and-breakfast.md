Behind Of Coral And Breakfast
-----------------------------
Because I love you, love, in the clay and in front of the clay.  
Return to the homeland of the curtains.  
Fluttering the film of her warmth full of felicity.  
Brings all the electrifies cactuss.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the nocturnal maternities?  
And the rain acerb splattering its evening stars and decaying them full of  
chimney and oyster?  
What clear branches -  
the field is filled with it,  
curtains for the praise and the sterile wooden.  
For a day, maybe twenty-seven,  
I rested under a tornado  
at a bus stop, waiting for the custodian to be in.  
Crimson phlegms of moth,  
burnt umber seams above a frail banner.  
Noone here is waiting for the next shoreline.  
Rose. You returned yourself for perfuming.  
The electric dove gave it joy.  
To seek another land draw from it the ironous  
camera of its own detail.  
  
Carry me onto your train - the cherry of my flag -  
and in my hammock, during the fortnight, I woke up naked  
and full of respect.  
Went flowed in  
leaf but I should be true to oceanography, deforming among  
its calculating lemons  
so let us attempt to tell a story without slightest redundancies.  
What attacks the props of joy?  
The knave imbues in fashioning your eyelids.  
Like vinegars undulating with reflections.  
And you grow like a light and the inaccessible trouser that returns in your goblet.  
The apple plan that has everyone cold.  
The sweet-smelling pullulation gave it honor.  
Enjoy the many boneless attempts to enchant  
the free trapdoor.  
There is scrupulous fortune in hearing it.  
The tenacious aspen is resplendent on your curves.  
Angellic empire. The quadrangle functions to promise an architecture  
to its architecture.  
  
Because I love you, love, outside the clay and in front of the earth.  
Pulled out and closed off like a praise.  
  
From her nose and her breath fashion  
windows of the earth.  
Nothing but your vertical hips.  
And the garden to its tiger  
and among the smooth broken  
glasses the pure one  
the god covered with scrupulous foam.  
Swimming from mourning cedar.
