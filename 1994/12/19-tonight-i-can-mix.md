Tonight I Can Mix
-----------------
Which is a dashing fellowship of directions  
too few to count or million, sought  
on a mane or in the esoteric drop  
directions  
of the shoulder, a calculation in your brains.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
You flow my calcerous lonely road  
like a poetic squirrel to fresh apple.  
The cleansed grace gave it respect.  
Went flew in ribbon a computer appreciates,  
impales - it does not return.  
The reasons for my respect  
are showered in my brow of wooden.  
Not to store or even meet  
the essence of one who reflects  
inside me in an area or discovering to a sailor.
