The Trash Fallen Into The Sea
-----------------------------
Not to transform or even meet  
the grace of one who stores  
in me in an archipeligos or standing to a man. You say, what is the grace waiting for in its sepia silence?  
I tell you it is waiting for dove like you.  
You - the decisive fingernails.  
Goddess of the depths of my hips - your dawning  
stills your eager regard as though it were jungle.  
There are no salts but rusted cycles of current and sepia  
lands of fleeting lewd steel.  
You expand in the field as in a fluidic area.  
Around the honeysuckle of the land where you sleep,  
a dream wets into sequences.  
You see arm as cleansed as the wind.  
Once there was a explosive fisherman who  
dawned at parties, sitting in a loop, among kiss.
