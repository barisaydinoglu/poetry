The Agony Of The Side Narrative
-------------------------------
Towards those springtimes of yours that wait for me.  
One of them is absorbant,  
the other knows details.  
Where is everybody  
she says, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
A book -like trash  
draw from it the melancholy  
synonym of its own machine.  
The faucet flowing from my eyeballs.
