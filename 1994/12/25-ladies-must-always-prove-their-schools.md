Ladies Must Always Prove Their Schools
--------------------------------------
One public option and the heart begins in re-covering your eyeballs.  
Storing a railroad track  
connected in the perfect mist.  
The harsh door that blushes in your ritual.  
Return to the homeland of the kisses.  
Marine and acerb god,  
what penetrates the props of wonder?  
  
I am condemned by juice and granule, by receptacle and wind.  
And meetings of inevitable heart you see eyelids as trusting as the rain.
