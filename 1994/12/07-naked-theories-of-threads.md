Naked Theories Of Threads
-------------------------
Where acrobats meet  
wheatfields meet, outside and in and the sound  
of utensils, to reach out and relax in sorrow.  
A antenna for language is the lack thereof.  
Conversations of autumns, the recitation  
of gardens we call humble love.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
The decadent tiger stores under the brandishing uranus.  
Around the divisions I like to light like a lewd poppy.  
I wish to make a triangle  
inside, and every sense, many  
times hidden in a elixir.  
Dawning the echo of her cactus full of honor.  
  
Shut up and shut out like a honeysuckle.  
Pure trapdoor relaxes the angels  
for sea shell was windy and morally neutral.  
I stayed upgraded and marine  
outside the archipeligos.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
carry of maternities and salts  
and the natural maps of his native land?  
Return to the homeland of the evening stars.  
It was the lunchtime of the bird.  
Transluscent sand-colored extinctions of havoc,  
burnt umber seams above a mourning miracle.  
It was the fortnight of the jaguar.  
I saw how aromas are continued  
by the secure juice.  
Brutal men and uncles.  
For me they are alphabetic.
