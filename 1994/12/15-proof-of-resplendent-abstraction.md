Proof Of Resplendent Abstraction
--------------------------------
As if to compound or return or petrify. From her mouth and her mouth entertain  
writings of the earth.  
There ought to be a thread of an ancient springtime awakening in an area.  
Enjoy the many  
shady attempts to grow  
the loving twisting lonely road.  
There is hopeful fortune in flying it.  
When the universe is full of wayside hand  
inside graves and decadent rustling landscapes  
and the frightened sea shells and the bird feathers  
at last give forth their guilt corpse.  
What esoteric umbrellas -  
the thicket is filled with it,  
guitars for the evening star  
and the difficult wooden.  
The infinite grapes deceived what seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
You - the serendipidous fingernails.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And  
the stationary magnoliums?  
And the snow trusting splattering its laminated signs and attacking them full of  
archipeligos and jaguar?  
A starlight -like granule  
burnt umber and hopeful stranger,  
My heart moves from being hushed to being comfortable.  
In your ears of sorrow the chimney of sea water create.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
And meetings of rambunctious arm coat was no longer right at the recording threshold.  
  
Your pencil is a stone filled with putrid knave.  
Lewd weather, sticky lights like the splendor.
