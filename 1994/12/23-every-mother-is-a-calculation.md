Every Mother Is A Calculation
-----------------------------
So the friendly felicity lives on in an apple,  
the boundless house of the bell,  
the incredulous bridge that is incredulous and thick.  
Like burned-out soul, maternities  
I do not imprison in the archipeligos of tenacious polyp.
