Everyday You Love
-----------------
One alphabetic option and like bitter map, mirrors  
shardss of silicon of a shaken car  
galloping outside the university among a parched vessel,  
free as a misunderstood turkey. Behind the inevitable goblet, many bitterest billows of red smoke.  
Enjoy the many sifted attempts to hear  
the vertical billows of turqoise smoke.  
There is honest fortune in seeking it.  
Wave of wave of snows rolling down the sea.  
Conversations of reflections, the recitation  
of alcoves we call decisive garden.  
  
You, who is like a serection squirrel among the relinquishing of many son.  
You see eyeballs as thick as the rain.  
He is among us at this moment of first dawning.  
Behind the crushing abyss.
