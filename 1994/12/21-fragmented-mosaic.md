Fragmented Mosaic
-----------------
I stayed breathed and opaque sepia  
against the archipeligos.  
To rise lost moons and for defenders.  
The calcerous oyster forms under the soft blades.  
A current of cosmic landscape  
that does not know why it flows and preserves.  
Perching from difficult marble.  
To seek another land I took on acidulous knaves.  
Transparent fire to my dead candle!
