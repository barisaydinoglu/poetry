Color As Flames
---------------
A current of homogeneous hoove  
that does not know why it flows and pulses. Against the blood-stained kis, many calculating  
bombs. Went responded in reflection multitude of elixirs!  
In and out of the crimson the marine and the opaque cashmire  
because I love you, love, around the wind and with the lightning.  
They dismantled it with frail wheatfields.  
If you were not the sugar the arcane moon  
cooks, sprinkling its lemon across the boulevard.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the acerb books?  
And the sunshine changeless splattering its flowers and abolishing them full of  
archipeligos and iguana?  
  
I could connect pigeon hole, bone, and felicity  
from pastures and bird feathers  
with a rust colored branch  
with bombs in my brow.  
Fatherless weather, negligent lights like the law.
