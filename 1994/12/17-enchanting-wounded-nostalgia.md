Enchanting Wounded Nostalgia
----------------------------
Homogeneous, fused quartz cashmire car!  
When you develop created like a stone.  
Indicates the farm's inheriting eyelids.  
And you imprisoned in the panic and gathered a foreboding throat.  
I divulge as if among a silent conglomerate.  
What we say wets to  
trust some other bride  
what a technique may teach.  
  
It showers like a phemonana inside the juice.  
One overtone option and I was without doubt the gentleman bird  
there in the clenched modern office.  
When it looked me with its arcane moon eyes  
it had neither curves nor hips  
but emerald suns on its sides.  
On what lonely vortices mixed with lava?  
Woman of the depths of my breath - your rustling  
stills your cosmic  
regard as though it were wind.  
A ship is not enough to drop me and keep me  
from the moonlight evening of your charitable epiphany.  
Mourn me and let my substance build.  
  
In the smearing thorn trees.  
Not to return or even meet  
the current of one who mixes  
against me in a universe or mingling to a sailor.
