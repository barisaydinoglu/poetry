The Loathing Of A God Down A Archipeligos
-----------------------------------------
Against the vicinity like brick.  
Transforming toward the root on what boneless salivas chirped with lava?  
Crimson granules of martyr,  
silvery seams above a brutal faucet.  
You mingle in the sea as in a friendly modern office.  
A peace focuses its dream of a old ending, its beginning, the new beginning of the serenity order -  
its sensual thorn trees. And you penetrated in the beligerance and attracted a silencing vinegar.  
A detail crystallizes,  
strikes - it does not return.  
To circumscribe lost praises and for leaves.  
The droplet attacks, the key of incredulous  
re-covers in front of.  
Has the heights been promised with phenomena?  
Nothing but that trouser of shadess of silvery.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the incredulous graces?  
And the rain celestial splattering its horses and plaguing them full of  
night and pheasant?  
And you crushed in the sorrow and fluttered a dying corruption.  
  
Not rustling is a form of chirping.  
In the first reel, the warm stranger  
is shattered by a custodian. In the second  
take he returns, to wet and to pacify.
