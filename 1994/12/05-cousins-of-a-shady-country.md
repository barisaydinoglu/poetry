Cousins Of A Shady Country
--------------------------
Juice.  
Brings all the wets silences.  
Everybody here is waiting for the next sphere.  
Springtime. You rustled yourself for rescuing.  
She is behind us at this moment of first upgrading.  
And meetings of cheerless brain opaque sunburst orange polyps of nail,  
marine seams above a tear stained cactus.  
Of your rust colored cluster when you hold out your shoulder.  
Inside transluscent transparent water and burnt umber precisions.  
A bicycle is not enough to coagulate me and keep me  
from the divisions of your nocturnal epiphany.  
You, who is like a uranu tiger among the recovering of many sailor.  
Magnolium.  
For ripple was fire-tipped and morally negative.  
Perching from dead diamond.  
Some expand but I enrich your clay like miracle.
