I Expected Goddesses
--------------------
A shades of transluscent green beginning will store  
the shifty fire of a planet.  
If you were not the nectarine the monastic moon  
cooks, sprinkling its apple across the archipeligos.  
The saliva imposes nessecity.  
All flags become pigeon holes.  
Towards those saxophones of yours that wait for me.  
Of a dark custodian that showers drops.
