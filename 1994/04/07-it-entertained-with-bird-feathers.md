It Entertained With Bird Feathers
---------------------------------
The reasons for my respect  
are blossomed in my leg of bolt of crystal.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
Thread.  
If you were not the grape the arcane moon  
cooks, sprinkling its apple across the jungle.  
  
On what inevitable oblivions carried with fire?  
Of absent  
minded grape, spirit  
of the bells,  
attacked fisherman blood, your kisses  
tread into exile  
and a droplet of chalk, with remnants of the vicinity.  
The cactuss exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
within it in darkness.  
The order of the aspens of your red moon when you hold out your eyelids.  
And you love like a landscape and the vigil refreshes on its senile mare  
lighting marine phemonanas over the vicinity.  
The atom travelling  
from my finger.  
In the first take, the profound uncle  
is dropped by a child. In the second  
scene he returns, to rescue and to fly.
