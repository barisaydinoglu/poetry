Rambunctious Wheatfield
-----------------------
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
With  
its calculating enchant you've asked me what the oyster is forming there with his blue foot?  
I reply, the root knows this.  
The chimney behind hers  
a tale we speak in passing,  
with  
notions of wonder  
and a passion for mountaineering and photography  
brings all the changes circuss.  
Not the burnt umber moment  
when the lunchtime upgrades the river banks.  
But the railroad track excited the memory.  
To gallop lost bottles and for elixirs.  
You are the orange of my hated fingernails.  
Propeller of a overflowed inevitable reflection.  
What is this antenna but a memory punctured of its corals?
