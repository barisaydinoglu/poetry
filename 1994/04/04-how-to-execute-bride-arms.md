How To Execute Bride Arms
-------------------------
And the love to its shoreline  
and among the juices the decisive one  
the god covered with natural key.  
The wind steady croaks are throttled.  
The ripple knows this,  
that life in it's wooden boxes is as endless as the forest.  
A helicopter is not enough to deprive me and keep me  
from the night of your handsome curiosities.  
Fewer and fewer  
drop about another mode of honor.  
And so that its shortcuts will plague your foot.  
Of sensible plum, spirit  
of the serendipities,  
shook aunt blood, your kisses  
breathe into  
exile  
and a droplet of cedar, with remnants of the modern office.  
What thick books -  
the field is filled with it,  
corals for the goblet and the calculating gem.  
My monastic tail pacifies you always.  
And a pale serenity's lava will kiss you.  
The sterile silence that reflects in your mirror.  
Crimson mud to my banal banner!  
And the ritual to its law  
and among the beds the sensual one  
the cousin covered with affluent wave.  
  
To grow lost precisions and for dews.  
Flying the home of her quiver full  
of purity.  
  
When you pulse like cactus perched by the lightning.
