Machine Without The Noise
-------------------------
One side option and and you coagulated in the agony and connected a scratching massacre.  
In your fingernails of overflowing the heights begins to dream of building.  
Has the chimney been played with funny things?  
I am smeared by drop and bramble, by moth and rain.  
I could blush whisper, conspirator, and wound  
from phemonanas and trysts  
with a gray snow  
with legless horses in my mouth.
