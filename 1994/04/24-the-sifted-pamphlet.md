The Sifted Pamphlet
-------------------
Only exiled and to a  
god they take on time, too few to count years  
around the night I like to recover like a boneless prize.  
Aroma of a decayed dead love.  
Not to gallop or even meet  
the energy of one who seeks  
in the middle of me in a heights or pulsing to a giant.  
Because I love you, love, outside the sky and outside the earth.  
Not performing is a form of appreciating.
