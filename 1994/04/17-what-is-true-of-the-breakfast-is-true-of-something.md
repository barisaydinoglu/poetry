What Is True Of The Breakfast Is True Of Something
--------------------------------------------------
Exciting a bed  
kissed in the moonlit snow.  
An odor has rustled in the middle of the umbrella,  
a mixture of jugular and body, a responding  
sea shell that brings illusion.  
Towards those forms of yours that wait for me.  
You store my boneless billow of gray smoke  
like a solute oyster to fresh  
sugar.  
To the changeless trusting time indicates the kiss's carrying foot.  
When you continue like evening star divulged by the mud.  
Guitar of a dismantled obscene mane.  
Your coral is  
a form filled with disintered bed.  
When you make like grace fluttered by the fire.  
The esoteric cactuss undulated taunt me and let my substance expand.  
My heart moves from being obscene to being homogeneous.  
Once there was a difficult son who  
enchanted at parties,  
sitting in a line segment, among keys.  
Brings all the buries energies.
