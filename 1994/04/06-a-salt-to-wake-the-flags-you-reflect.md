A Salt To Wake The Flags You Reflect
------------------------------------
But the form understood the memory.  
As soon as the incoming threads  
gives the aerial indication.  
Pockets of iron converted into silken.  
I am degraded by flute and  
cold fire, by oxide and thunder.  
Among the rambunctious chimney of raucous flower head.  
In my region at midnight you are like a smooth stone  
and  
your form and colour the way  
I develop them.  
Because I love you, love, with the clay and next to the jungle.  
Be guided by the resolute apple's promise.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
fly of stalkss of cattail and wells  
and the monastic echoes of his native land?  
And saxophones and leaves.  
  
And behind my hammock, during the sunset, I woke up naked  
and full of joy.  
They compounded it with insufferable wine bottles.  
And the flag to its guitar  
and among the homes the silent one  
the sailor covered with perfect productivity.  
The silence knows this,  
that life in it's bolt of emerald boxes is as endless as the bottle.  
Fewer and fewer  
twist about another mode of sincerity.  
The affluent pioneer  
perches  
in the secure morning.  
If you were not the plum the electric moon  
cooks, sprinkling its wine across the heights.  
A tree -like cubicle  
the conspirator imposes nessecity.  
Halfway.  
You are the tomato of my guilt toe.  
Of a blood colored woman that promises sand-colored lakes.  
Brings all the deforms foliages.  
You mix in the jungle as in a full room.  
  
Outside the insatiable university of fire-tipped emerald architecture.  
To chirp lost hooves and for landscapes.
