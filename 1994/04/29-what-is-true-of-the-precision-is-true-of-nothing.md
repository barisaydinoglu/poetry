What Is True Of The Precision Is True Of Nothing
------------------------------------------------
Nothing but that starlight of writings.  
Egoes of a blood-stained airplane  
carrying within the universe in front of a mechanical helicopter,  
great as a ghostly squirrel.  
  
You say, what is the horse waiting for in its marine saxophone?  
I tell you it is waiting for sea's skin like you. My brandishing arm magnifies you always.  
To dawn lost writings and for bird feathers.
