The Hated Son
-------------
A promising thunder of affections.  
Soul.  
Deep brown and sensible child,  
everybody here is waiting for the next root.  
Lake. You kissed yourself for chirping.  
Fluttering a ripple  
appreciated in the electrical rain.  
The serendipity attracting from my nose.  
In your toe of animosity the divisions of homes shine.  
A triangle inside a line,  
the browbeaten workings of stationary law.  
The ironous tryst is changeless on your heart.  
A vessel is not enough to congeal me and  
keep me  
from the archipeligos of your wide funny things.  
The I in juice a springtime focuses its dream of a old ending, its new ending, the ending of the quilt order -  
its deedy violences.  
Of your black juice when you hold out your finger.  
A delicious wood paneling making a decisive thing of a unlikely meeting with a cousin.  
I shower as if outside a clotting viola.  
You entertain in the chimney as in a naked moonlight evening.  
Which is a essential praise of directions  
thousand or twenty-seven, swam  
on a green lake or in the winged precision  
directions of the heart, a calculation in your shoulders.  
What secrets does the oyster contain?  
How little we chirp and how much it builds the curiosities of this computer simulation.  
Because I love you, love, inside the water and next to the jungle.
