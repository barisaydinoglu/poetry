An Equally Infinite Mountaineer
-------------------------------
All magnoliums become cold fires.  
Around the divisions I like to seek like a boney flower.  
From ray of sunlight to harrowing wind,  
hidden laminated signs drawn by sensible channels, a  
absurd momentum begins  
to divulge.  
The faucets exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
within it in darkness.  
A defender focuses its dream of a beginning, its new beginning, the new beginning of the atom order -  
its sanguine juices.  
And a sticky silence's wind will store you.  
Of your dark sea water when you hold out your leg.  
A sunshine of pullulations and you kiss like a flag and a study rustles,  
forebodes - it does not return.  
Full stop.  
Outside the sepia hand of the lava.  
  
A great snow of propellers.  
The bomb imposes nessecity.  
  
Pulled out and shut out like a dew.  
Like the hushed broken glass of umbrellas like the fuming aluminum of shadess of silvery worn-out weather, phosphorus lights like the planetarium.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the comfortable roses?  
And the mist mineral splattering its femininities and abolishing them full of  
university and iguana?  
Full stop.
