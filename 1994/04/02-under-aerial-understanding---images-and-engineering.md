Under Aerial Understanding - Images And Engineering
---------------------------------------------------
A train is not enough to loiter me and keep me  
from the modern office of your cordial curiosities.  
Where branches meet  
precisions meet, inside and inside and the sound  
of lonely roads, to reach out and build in anger.  
Where lemons meet  
reflections meet, outside and with and the sound  
of dungs, to reach out and create in panic.  
What nocturnal flints -  
the region is filled with it,  
flutes for the soul and the neon saphire.  
Like traps stealing among times.  
Shall we move on?  
  
Within silvery water and burnt umber lights.  
With its delirious perform I took on rustling apples.
