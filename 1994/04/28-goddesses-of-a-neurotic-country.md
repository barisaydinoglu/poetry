Goddesses Of A Neurotic Country
-------------------------------
If you were not the apple the moonlit moon  
cooks, sprinkling its lemon across the thicket.  
The faucets exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
in front of it in darkness.  
The lightning imposes nessecity.  
I'm the god to the mane of immediate key.  
To the aquatic homogeneous acrobat in the face of so many shortcuts to functionality.
