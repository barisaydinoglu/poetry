Public Productions Are All Inside Us
------------------------------------
Once there was a rigid goddess who  
chirped at parties,  
sitting in a loop, among aromas.  
The heat musical deaths are abolished.  
When you wet like telegraph dawned by the clay.  
You see toe as rosy as the sun.  
I'm the custodian to the angel of immediate love.  
I'd do it for the friendship in which you reconcile  
for the momenta of sunburst orange you've excited.  
Only phemonana, just the  
pencil, nothing but  
it. Prize.  
And a rotten poppy's ice will respond you.  
But I should be untrue to oceanography, wiping among its tenacious tigers  
so let us try to tell a story without algorithmic redundancies.  
A rustling machine freezes  
even the iridescent  
technical area in synonym  
To which the metaphor  
will not be rustled.
