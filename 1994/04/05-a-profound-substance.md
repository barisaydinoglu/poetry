A Profound Substance
--------------------
Come with me to the ash of vaginas.  
Of a gray man  
that re-covers wells.  
There are many deaths among decadent events.  
The hushed dove that magnifies in your school.  
Among the hollow jungle of molested promise.  
As soon as the incoming breakfasts  
gives the alphabetic indication.  
Like distorted wine bottle, smooth stones  
the dove playing from my hand.  
I saw how mirrors are discovered  
by the profound current.
