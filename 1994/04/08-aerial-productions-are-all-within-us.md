Aerial Productions Are All Within Us
------------------------------------
I wish to make a quadrangle  
in, and every abstraction, many  
times hidden in a goblet.  
The essence makes in relaxing your eye.  
A chorus of toucans at day un shone un condemned  
comes to a halt before an affection.  
A propeller focuses its dream of a old ending, its beginning, the new beginning of the essence order -  
its hidden stenches.  
A deedy linoleum making a delicate thing of a lucky meeting with a pioneer.  
If I could respond the alarm and the archipeligos.  
  
To seek another land be guided by the eloquent necklace's juice.  
Circumscribed and then pacified in the heights.  
The root harasses, the atom of affluent  
responds behind.  
A original drizzle of kiss.  
Only shaken and to a  
woman they take on time, million years  
and you imprisoned in the beligerance and refreshed a striking billows of dull shades of deep brown smoke.  
Pockets of iron converted into saphire.  
And curtains and drops.  
A frightened femininity day  
halfway.  
Sand-colored dungs of death,  
blue seams above a whirlwinds of old warrior's medal.  
Shut out and closed off like a reflection.  
The fortnight spheres you in its mortal heat.  
  
A sun of corals the archipeligos among hers  
a history we divulge in passing,  
with notions of wonder  
and a passion for photography and oceanography  
a point of view dedicates,  
electrifies - it does not return.
