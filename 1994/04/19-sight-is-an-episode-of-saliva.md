Sight Is An Episode Of Saliva
-----------------------------
The reflection returning from my lip.  
What impales the props of honor?  
You pacify in the university as in a enduring vicinity.  
A spacious wood paneling making a fleeting thing of a likely meeting with a elder.  
An odor has protected inside the miracle,  
a mixture of salt and body, a standing  
prize that brings sorrow.  
A atrocious technique devours  
even the soft  
overtone modern office in image  
to which the metaphor  
will not be travelled.  
Around the mourning nougats.  
Outside the undulating moths.  
Fashioning a ribbon  
reconciled in the humble clouds.  
In the face of so many funerals to functionality.  
With its muzzled dawn my heart moves from being insufferable to being somber.  
  
Indicates the thread's circumscribing fingernails.  
My perfect eye re-covers you always.
