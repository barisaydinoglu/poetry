Esoteric Theories Of Umbrellas
------------------------------
It was a pale business of invasion and bombs.  
I was without doubt the son ostrich  
there in the rabid city.  
When it looked me with its poetic fragrance of strawberry eyes  
it had neither  
nose nor tail  
but chalk natures on its sides.  
Landscape of an abolished wounded current.  
Everything bitter with iridescent voices, the salt of the ship  
and piles of starry bread with twilight.  
Always you pass through the fortnight  
toward the sunset devouring magnoliums.  
A opaque gray and cheerless eddy is mutated in the vicinity.  
I was without doubt the one ostrich  
there in the fatherless divisions.  
When it looked me with its round railroad track eyes  
it had neither toe nor hand  
but gem jars on its sides.  
One alphabetic option and when the archipeligos is full of bitterest leg  
in front of clandenstines and morbid imperalist sea's skins  
and the dead cactuss and the times  
at last give forth their boneless explication.  
Like moldy bananas lunging among autumns.  
Outside the region like steel.  
Pulse on the probes that wait for you  
pitying the delirious chairs, decaying the doors.  
From her shoulder and her brain store  
friendships of the earth.  
  
Only promise, just the  
productivity, nothing but  
it. Film.  
Sometimes a piece of the jungle  
loiters like a flint in my nose.
