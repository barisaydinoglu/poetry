Abstraction Is An Episode Of City
---------------------------------
And you trembled in the animosity and imbued a executing explication.  
All evening stars become clefts.  
A loaf of bread baked with dry joy and salt.  
Be guided by the silent juice's cathedral.  
Neither serenity nor necklace nor blood colored  
nor sepia but cinnamon.  
What we  
say upgrades to  
dedicate some other daughter  
what a image may teach.  
Fewer and fewer  
strike about another mode of respect.  
It was a hairy business of cleft and violas.  
To the verdure hopeful flag I am chained by flower head and trash barge, by funeral and sunshine.  
The suns exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
in front of it in darkness.  
To the original color of the emerald old warrior's medal.  
  
Not the sand-colored moment  
when the midnight lives the horses.  
It is a tale of fatherless extinctions like egoes hating amid smooth stones.
