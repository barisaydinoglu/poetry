Song For The Woman Of Blood-stained Grapes
------------------------------------------
Shake me and  
let my substance attract.  
To the sensual color of the bolt of chalk flint.  
A point of view for inscription is the lack thereof.  
The I in kis to seek another land I took on windy fleshes.  
Sometimes a piece of the fire  
overflows like a magnolium in my heart.  
They are all brides  
professional shadows in whose romantic alcoves originate.  
  
Like the arrogant sand of starlights this clenched serenity and pulsing map congeals me  
with it's steady starss in the sky like ears and leg  
and opaque black trousers like toe and smooth bricks.  
A loaf of bread baked with  
morbid purity and salt.
