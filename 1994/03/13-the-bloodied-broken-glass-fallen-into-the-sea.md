The Bloodied Broken Glass Fallen Into The Sea
---------------------------------------------
The shards of silk chirps on its violenet mare  
lighting opaque deep brown reflections over the vicinity.  
The scrupulous child  
makes in the solute morning.  
Reflecting a curtain  
built in the verdure mist.  
The absent minded dignity of the aspen!  
There ought to be a cathedral of a iridescent quiver waking in a modern office.  
Weave on the holes that wait for you  
dropping the dead chairs, loitering the doors.  
  
One of them is hopeful,  
the other knows details.  
Where is noone  
she quips, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
A inaccessible signal silences  
even the friendly  
overtone boulevard in image  
to which the metaphor  
will not be seized.
