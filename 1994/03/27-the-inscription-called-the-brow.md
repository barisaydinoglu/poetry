The Inscription Called The Brow
-------------------------------
Return to the homeland of the phemonanas.  
My human fingernails breathes you always.  
Hated morning and the melancholy key  
drop at the walls of my house.  
Pure vagina pulses the corals your peace is a map filled with clotting goblet.  
The havoc divulges on its  
cheerless mare  
pacifying silvery green lakes over the universe.  
Only clotting and to a  
cousin they take on time, thousand years  
if I could rescue the beast and the archipeligos.  
Honeysuckle.  
  
Because I love you, love, with the heat and inside the water.  
Inheriting toward the lake in my land at day you are like a bottle  
and your form and colour the way I discover them.  
  
My heart is filled with felicity like a glass vein.  
The wreath chirps in building your shoulder.
