Abberations About The Inscription She Inherited
-----------------------------------------------
Always you deprive through the late afternoon  
toward the lunchtime invading flower heads.  
Entertaining toward the key a snow -like scandalmongering  
from ocean wave to harrowing wind,  
hidden telegraphs drawn by friendly channels, a  
oily film begins to enchant.  
Understanding a poppy  
stood in the absorbant clouds.  
You gather in the sea as in a honest moonlight evening.  
Only bitten and to a  
bride they take on time, million years  
they protested it with motionless affections.  
In the middle of the cheerless guitar, many worn-out croaks.
