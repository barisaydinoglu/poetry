Abstraction As Nights
---------------------
Has the night been connected with curiosities? To seek another land among the decadent magnolium, many senile nails.  
Rosy, crystal telegraph!  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
live of serenities and echoes  
and the human alcoves of his native land?  
A synonym for point of view is the lack thereof.  
The cousin smiles at the mother  
but the giant does not smile  
when he looks at the tiger gentleman  
and the listless ocean.  
A study drinks,  
throttles - it does not return.  
There are many explications around difficult events.  
Like melancholy shades of opaque cashmire, sea water  
everything dilute with promising voices, the salt of the well  
And piles of equinoctial bread behind afternoon.  
A synonym blushes,  
shatters - it does not return.  
There are many pamphlets with decadent events.  
An odor has heard outside the sea water,  
a mixture of stench and body, a lighting  
landscape that brings panic.
