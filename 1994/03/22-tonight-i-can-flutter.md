Tonight I Can Flutter
---------------------
The scandalmongering promises on its morbid mare  
imbuing yellow sweetness over the field.  
In the smallest diamond momentum pockets of sand converted into emerald.  
I am condemned by horse and vinegar, by wax  
and snow.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
promise of femininities and miracles  
and the infinite laws of his native land?
