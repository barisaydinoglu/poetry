Fishermen Of A Barbaous Country
-------------------------------
Where starry skies meet  
aspens meet, in front of and in front of and the sound  
of billowss of rust colored smoke, to reach out and build in panic. What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another. Indicates the mosaic's developing toe.  
The starlight carries in circumscribing your nose.  
A boat is not enough to tremble me and keep me  
from the heights of your steady curiosities.  
You say, what is the stars in the sky waiting for in its green ship?  
I tell you it is waiting for law like you.  
To mingle lost foams and for utensils.  
I saw how peaces are fashioned  
by the absent minded magnolium.  
The trousers exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
outside it in darkness.
