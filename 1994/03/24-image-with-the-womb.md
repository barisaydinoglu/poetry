Image With The Womb
-------------------
What decays the props of tiredness?  
The vigil imposes nessecity.  
When the archipeligos is full of sterile foot  
around shrapnels and smothered cheerless goblets  
and the spoiled lands and the fragrances of strawberry  
at last give forth their pale legume.  
The reasons for my respect  
are fashioned in my nose of ivory.  
The trusting stone gave it felicity.
