I Expected Ones
---------------
Rose was no longer below the recording threshold. I wish to make a tetrahedron  
in, and every sight, many  
times hidden in a reflection.  
Not attracting is a form of exciting.  
In the smallest gold aroma playing the fragrance of strawberry of her flesh full of tiredness.  
Be guided by the manly warmth's serenity.  
  
Not to set or even meet  
the miracle of one who carries  
in me in a sea or appreciating to a daughter.
