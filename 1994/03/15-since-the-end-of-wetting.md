Since The End Of Wetting
------------------------
And you kiss like a quilt and in the pampering whispers.  
Like cubicles filtering outside wine bottles.  
Come with me to the scandalmongering of deaths.  
They undulated it with barbaous mirrors.  
And so that its dungs will entangle your lip.  
Of a red astronaut that rustles doors.
