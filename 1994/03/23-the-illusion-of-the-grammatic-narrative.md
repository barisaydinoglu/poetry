The Illusion Of The Grammatic Narrative
---------------------------------------
A forest focuses its dream of a new ending, its old ending, the ending of the forest order -  
its romantic trash barges. Not the sepia moment  
when the afternoon upgrades the magnoliums.  
A snow of lakes towards those old warrior's medals of yours that wait for me.  
But I should be untrue to computer science, lunging among its sticky propellers  
so let us attempt to speak a story without algorithmic redundancies.  
Of round nectarine, spirit  
of the sea's skins,  
soddened custodian blood, your kisses  
protect into exile  
and a droplet of gold, with remnants of the boulevard.
