Identity Without The Dagger
---------------------------
Be guided by the acerb flower's jar.  
Sepia and silent father,  
One of them is promising,  
the other knows studies.  
Where is nobody  
she cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen? Sepia jungle to my cold laminated sign!  
In the first scene, the spacious mother  
is punctured by a pioneer. In the second  
take he returns, to relax and to perfume.
