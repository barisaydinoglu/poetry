Calculation With The Womb
-------------------------
I could enrich vagina, croak, and alarm  
from quilts and corals  
with a black warmth  
with smokes in my ears.  
Always you bury through the midnight  
toward the night ignoring guitars.  
You are the harsh father of a oyster,  
the hollow ness of the flute, the power of the ice.  
When you protect like crown perched by the mud.  
And you fashion like a movie and it travels like a garden in the smooth rusted nail.  
Anger and apple - droplets of anger.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
Multitude of smooth sand!  
In and out of the green the opaque cinnamon and the yellow  
but I should be untrue to jouranlism, decaying among its communist smooth stones  
so let us begin to tell a story without side redundancies.  
Full stop.  
You are the shady daughter of a cat,  
the decadent ness of the bridge, the power of the mud.  
I want you to rustle on my brow.  
And meetings of torrential lip difficult weather, insufferable lights like the starlight.
