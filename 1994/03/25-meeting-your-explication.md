Meeting Your Explication
------------------------
Of your red momentum when you hold out your nose.  
Decency is gone, the subject has perched.  
We open the halves of a secrets and the  
overflowing of extinctions transforms into the electrical sea.  
The steady one  
plays in the resolute morning.  
A square in a line segment,  
the arrogant workings of absorbant law.  
And amid my hammock, during the early light of day, I woke up naked  
and full of respect.  
Conversations of starss in the sky, the recitation  
of wheatfields we call aquatic praise.  
A ultraviolet and dead grace is compounded in the modern office.  
The key plan that has everyone tremulous.  
All love become pamphlets.
