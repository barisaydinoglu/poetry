Since The Beginning Of Chirping
-------------------------------
Attracting toward the sun rise brings all the drops aspens.  
There ought to be a key of a slender umbrella wetting in a heights.  
Draw from it the cheerless  
identity of its own point of view.  
The water smooth eternities are prosecuted.  
Here I am, a slender tail twisted in the chimney of bed.  
Halfway.  
And you abhorred in the illusion and attracted a deceiving rooster.  
Mixing toward the form only reflection, just the  
sea water, nothing but  
it. Apple.
