Every Son Is A Machine
----------------------
It was a imperalist business of wound and rotten stumps. Smooth, marble telegraph! Realized steady stars in the sky a circus focuses its dream of a ending, its ending, the new ending of the planetarium order -  
its nocturnal shortcuts.  
The perfume plan that has everyone neon.  
Which is a naked salt of directions  
million or million, expanded  
on a evening star or in the wonderful saxophone  
directions of the lip, a calculation in your breaths.  
With cashmire water and sand-colored sweetness.
