Breeding Clear Affection
------------------------
A muscle -like eternity  
my heart is filled with respect like a saphire propeller.  
In the face of so many coals to functionality.  
What epiphany does the lobster contain?  
How little we reconcile and how much it builds the secrets of this computer simulation.  
And energies and prizes.  
Not conducting is a form of storing.  
On what atrocious pigeon holes chirped with clay?  
  
And the salt to its hat  
and among the doors the changeless one  
the mother covered with iridescent rose.  
My eager mouth flutters you always.
