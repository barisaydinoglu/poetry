The Fear Of The Slightest Narrative
-----------------------------------
Like the negligent rusted nail of laminated signs dead morning and the lonely farm  
pass at the walls of my house.  
Full stop.  
Went made in river bank you wet headlong into an archipeligos to weave your business.  
I wish to make a line  
amid, and every sense, many  
times hidden in a perfume.
