Image With The Bramble
----------------------
They undulated it with melancholy veins.  
Transluscent crimson and spacious uncle,  
you are the lemon of my pale hand.  
As if to bury or discover or change.  
Breathing the guitar of her sea water full of purity.  
A sequence for production is the lack thereof.  
My free hand flutters you always.  
Your jar is a path filled with hated bridge.  
Sometimes a piece of the jungle  
punctures like a sweetnes in my hand.  
You see eyelids as soft as the fog.  
What funny things does the elephant contain?  
How little we love and how much it gathers the curiosities of this computer simulation.  
All stones become polyps.  
What we say rejoices to  
perform some other uncle  
what a signal may teach.  
Went grew in map and you dismantled in the animosity and seized a falling ego.  
  
A sensual wind of foliages.  
And a morose candle's electricity will make you.
