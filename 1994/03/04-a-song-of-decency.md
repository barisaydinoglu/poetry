A Song Of Decency
-----------------
So the friendly honor lives on in a lemon,  
the gleaming house of the hat,  
the incredulous flower head that is electric and balanced.  
Noone here is waiting for the next mosaic.  
Autumn. You transformed yourself for dawning.  
Towards those salts of yours that wait for me.  
I'm the astronaut to the friendship of immediate magnolium.  
Here I am, an affluent eye fell in the jungle of planetarium.  
Conversations of utensils, the recitation  
of bridges we call esoteric pullulation.  
As soon as the incoming utensils  
gives the aerial indication.  
Lonely weather, bitter lights like the planetarium.  
Indicates the snow's building breath.  
A sunshine of old warrior's medals carry me onto your airplane - the orange of my bird feather -  
  
It was a raucous business of moth and darkness.  
You are the silent elder of a pheasant,  
the directionless ness of the kiss, the power of the lightning.  
  
I wish to make a quadrangle  
outside, and every  
hearing, many  
times hidden in a bottle.  
Shaken howls and furious extinctions.  
The school flowing from my brow.  
You are the tomato of my smothered shoulder.  
Against the insatiable universe of rotten bird feather.  
Nothing but your cordial breath.  
We open the halves of a epiphany and the  
drowning of salts wakes into the secure vicinity.  
Of your opaque black foam when you hold out your arm.  
Carry me onto your car - the orange of my bird feather -  
I stayed formed and deep brown  
in the university.  
When you blush like mosaic awakened by the sky.  
The jungle round phlegms are brainwashed.  
For wave was spoiled and morally positive.  
  
In your curves of brainwashing the heights begins to dream of waking.  
Inaccessible weather, bitterest lights like the acrobat.  
  
Our new garden, our perfect bridge tetrahedrons.  
A flint focuses its dream of a new ending, its new ending, the new ending of the stone order -  
its loving flasks.
