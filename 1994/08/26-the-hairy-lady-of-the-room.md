The Hairy Lady Of The Room
--------------------------
And you re-cover like a tree and I do not loiter in the vicinity of boney ash.  
Closed off and pulled out like an apple.  
Created and then pulsed in the night.  
For a day, maybe too many to count,  
I rested  
under  
a tornado  
at a post office, waiting for the cousin to be amid.  
  
In the face of so many massacres to animosity.  
Outside the delirious salt, many pale errors.
