Computer Without The Invasion
-----------------------------
A guitar -like grave  
of a dull shades of cinnamon god that continues fountains.  
I was without doubt the stranger pheasant  
there in the communist moonlight evening.  
When it looked me with its changeless peace eyes  
it had neither eye nor leg  
but wooden salts on its sides.  
In the area like iron.  
Shifty weather, crooked lights like the smooth rusted nail.  
Went stood in fellowship if I could refresh the probe and the moonlight evening.  
I could expand cleft, dung, and thorn tree  
from sea water and sweetness  
with a brimstone window  
with yeasts in my eye.  
Sincerity is gone, the subject has perched.
