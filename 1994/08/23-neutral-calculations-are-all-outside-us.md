Neutral Calculations Are All Outside Us
---------------------------------------
Everything hollow with parenthetical voices, the salt of the cactus  
and piles of decisive bread within holiday.  
When the region is full of wounded eyelids  
inside eternities and negligent spoiled stars  
and the rusted evening stars and the ships  
at last give forth their hairy blade.  
I could hear death, trash barge, and bramble  
from utensils and curtains  
with a gray magnolium  
with stains in my hand.  
But the love formed the memory.  
  
It's a seizing honeysuckle of pamphlets.  
Here I am, a naked fingernails punctured in the thicket of starry sky.
