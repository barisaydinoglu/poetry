The Projection Has Not Entangled The Promise
--------------------------------------------
Changeless, silk railroad track!  
And the current to its river  
and among the tigers the free one  
the bride covered with sensible necklace.  
Only telegraph, just the  
rose, nothing but  
it. Stars in the sky.  
Carry me onto your wheel - the mango of my wreath -  
One slightest option and and so that its rectums will deprive your hips.  
Wave of wave of coats rolling down the sea.  
To seek another land marine and changeless elder,  
Return to the homeland of the curtains.  
And so that its funerals will disguise your hips.  
Because I love you, love, next to the jungle and around the clay.
