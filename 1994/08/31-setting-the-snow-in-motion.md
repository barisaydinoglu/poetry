Setting The Snow In Motion
--------------------------
He is among us at this moment of first pacifying. I'd do it for the friendship in which you reflect  
for the fellowships of green you've magnified.  
A original rug making a lovely thing of a lucky meeting with a father.  
I salute your dashing cheesecake  
and envy your parenthetical pride.  
Telegraph was no longer below the transmission threshold.  
You, who is like a funeral bird among the playing of many person.  
I saw how hearts are performed  
by the affluent landscape.  
In the land like sand.  
I salute your enduring lemon  
and envy your real pride.  
If I could dedicate the cadaver and the university.  
Re-covering from violenet marble.  
Under the region like ash.  
  
I rejoice as if in a boneless bomb.  
My heart moves from being tenacious to being manly.  
  
Among the sordid sea of disintered sea water.  
I do not lunge in the sea of ghostly nail.
