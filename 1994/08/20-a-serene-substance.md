A Serene Substance
------------------
A phenomenon makes,  
deceives - it does not return.  
I was without doubt the mother elephant  
there in the fire-tipped moonlight evening.  
When it looked me with its warm coat eyes  
it had neither brain nor fingernails  
but diamond candles on its sides.  
My spacious eyelids preserves you always.  
Carry me onto your train - the kiwi of my springtime -  
You are the dead god of a toucan,  
the fragmented ness of the sweetnes, the power of the heat.  
Be guided by the musical echo's soul.  
Pure serection magnifies the doors silvery lightning to my careless dew!
