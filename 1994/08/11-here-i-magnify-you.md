Here I Magnify You
------------------
The night breakfasts you in its mortal mud.  
Brings all the soddens planetariums.  
Pioneer of the depths of my shoulder - your rejoicing  
stills your somber regard as though it were electricity.  
Serendipity.  
The moon plan that has everyone absurd.  
Dry trapdoors and violenet corruptions.  
Congeal me and let my substance perch.
