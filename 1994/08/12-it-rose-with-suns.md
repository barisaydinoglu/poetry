It Rose With Suns
-----------------
Once there was a dry cousin who  
imbued at parties, sitting in a line, among knaves.  
Like ghostly thread, momenta  
because I love you, love, in the water and outside the sky.  
Come with me to the wax of traps.  
I do not invade in the city of insufferable vagina.  
If I could rise the extinction and the thicket.  
What careful lights -  
the boulevard is filled with it,  
laws for the splendor and the phosphorus ivory.  
Sometimes a piece  
of the jungle  
crushes like a droplet  
in my shoulder.
