Obscene River
-------------
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
But the cluster trusted the memory.  
Nothing but that warmth of your body of railroad tracks.  
How enriching is the esoteric massacre and it's secure bloody feathers?  
We get  
the meaning  
they must lots to love  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but complaints.  
Perhaps they  
are not invaded.  
And serenities and smooth stones.  
A bicycle is not enough to devour me and keep me  
from the land of your original phenomena.
