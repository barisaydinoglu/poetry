Inaccessible Productivity
-------------------------
Among the transparent foot of the mud.  
Like the lewd rusted nail of sea's skins with its cheerless dedicate a detail for camera is the lack thereof.  
A current of promising femininity  
that does not know why it flows and imbues.  
As if to lunge or grow or erupt.  
In the face of so many darkness to functionality.  
One of them is sweet-smelling,  
the other knows sequences.  
Where is everybody  
he quips, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
For a day, maybe too few to count,  
I rested under a unrelenting rain  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the astronaut to be with.
