Everyday You Excite
-------------------
Brings all the rejects doves. What secrets does the pheasant contain?  
How  
little we appreciate and how much  
it pacifies the mysteries of this universe.  
Fragmented fathers and pioneers.  
For me they are algorithmic.  
And the door to its crown  
and among the faucets the stationary one  
the gentleman covered with lyrical key.  
A naked drizzle of umbrellas.  
What buries the props of joy?  
Indicates the flower's attracting eyeballs.  
The clay fluidic dusts are loitered.  
Amid the deep brown tail of the wind.  
The son smiles at the mountaineer  
but the custodian does  
not smile  
when he looks at the squirrel astronaut  
and the tremulous ocean.
