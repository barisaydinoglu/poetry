Since The Beginning Of Filtering
--------------------------------
To seek another land not the transparent moment  
when the twilight lights the acrobats. How fluttering is the clear thorn tree and it's incredulous havocs?  
Nothing but your velvety foot.  
Of blazing peach, spirit  
of the essences,  
shattered mother blood, your kisses  
fly into exile  
and a droplet of gold, with remnants of the city.  
Flag.  
Not to swim or even meet  
the coral of one who builds  
among me in an area or rising to a daughter.  
Like the hated broken glass of aspens a technique reflects,  
changes - it does not return.  
But I should be true to photography, bristling among its mechanical lights  
so let us seek to divulge a story devoid of neutral redundancies.  
Burnt umber darkness of acid,  
yellow seams above a lewd warmth.
