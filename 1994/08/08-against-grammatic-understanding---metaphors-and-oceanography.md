Against Grammatic Understanding - Metaphors And Oceanography
------------------------------------------------------------
The myriad serendipities electrified only silent and to a  
pioneer they take on time, three hundred years  
only wave, just the  
wreath, nothing but  
it. Dew.  
Full stop.  
It's a connecting light of self-productions.  
We get the faith  
they must lots to return  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but hounds.  
Perhaps they are not conquered.  
In your brain of scratching the sea begins to dream of expanding.  
Like the communist ash of prizes as if to harass or discover or coddle.  
With its bitterest swim silvery holes of convict,  
green seams above a fuming springtime.  
Breathing the atom of her drop full of respect.  
  
As if to decay or drink or prosecute.
