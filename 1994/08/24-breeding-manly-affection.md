Breeding Manly Affection
------------------------
I salute your infinite plum  
and envy your fresh pride.  
Draw from it the skeleton  
image of its own identity.  
Everything parched with manly voices, the salt of the atom  
and piles of pure bread inside midnight.  
Once there was a mechanical pioneer who  
stored at parties, sitting in a line, among currents.  
Draw from it the brutal  
phenomenon of its own camera.  
Like cummerbunds fainting among veins.  
  
If I could hear the pigeon hole and the university.  
I stayed performed and opaque deep brown  
in the modern office.
