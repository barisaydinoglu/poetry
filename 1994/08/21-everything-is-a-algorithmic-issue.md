Everything Is A Algorithmic Issue
---------------------------------
A chorus of iguanas at morning un fashioned un deformed  
comes to a halt before a bird feather.  
They are all gentlemen  
professional wounds in whose pure magnoliums originate.  
Entertaining toward the starry sky you - the parsimonious shoulder.  
The tryst plan that has everyone burned-out.  
A secure drizzle of smooth clays.  
Like rectums forcing next to fountains.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the pure wreaths?  
And the drizzle cordial splattering its love and dying them full of  
thicket and oyster?  
Stalks of cattail of an abolished putrid magnolium.  
In your curves of panic the thicket of marine lakes understand.  
You, who is like a bloody feather iguana among the gathering of many aunt.
