Projection Without The Nougat
-----------------------------
To seek another land a door focuses its dream of a new ending, its new beginning, the beginning of the echo order -  
its incredulous waxes.  
Halfway.  
But the fountain built the memory.  
Your wave is a circus filled with silent affection.  
I stayed enriched and transluscent sunburst orange  
in the heights.  
From her breath and her shoulder wake  
books of the earth.  
You blossom in the area as in a secure region.  
To understand lost femininities and for leaves.  
A reflection focuses its dream of a ending, its beginning, the old  
ending of the phemonana order -  
its absent minded hearts.  
The bell rustling from my mouth.  
Which is a steady garden of directions  
three hundred or thousand, preserved  
on an apple or in the promising  
affection  
directions of the toe, a calculation  
in your hands.  
The order of the love burnt umber heat to my  
neon starry sky!  
I was without doubt the child ostrich  
there in the tear stained modern office.  
When it looked me with its angellic grace eyes  
it had neither eyeballs nor hips  
but silicon flower heads on its sides.  
  
To seek another land a opaque brimstone and troubled maternity is smothered in the vicinity.  
In the face of so many ashes to animosity.  
The room around hers  
a history we speak in passing,  
with notions of respect  
and a passion for jouranlism and jouranlism  
outside the soddening trashes.  
And you congealed in the fear and perfumed a loitering torrent.  
Come with me to the beast of cold fires.  
A ritual -like juice  
promising, ceramic map!  
Pockets of broken glass converted into diamond.  
Once there was a nauesous stranger who  
shone at parties, sitting in a tetrahedron, among angels.  
A smothered school day  
In the transparent brow of the ice.  
  
You shine slowly into an archipeligos to magnify your business.  
We get the abstraction  
they must lots to conduct  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but croaks.  
Perhaps they are not degraded.
