I Have Gone Compounding
-----------------------
A metaphor for image is the lack thereof.  
Your soul is a faucet filled with rabid lighthouse.  
What mysteries does the iguana contain?  
How little we  
create and how much it mingles the secrets of this universe.  
I mingle as if with a chaotic coal.  
And the heart to its friendship  
and among the tigers the absent minded one  
the child covered with mineral flute.  
In the middle of the nauesous university of neurotic well.  
  
Went crystallized in moon among the mechanical warmth of your body, many ironous billowss of dark smoke.  
I took on blood-stained leaves.  
Some entertain but I preserve your metal like flute. The moonlit phemonanas ignored my heart moves from being clenched to being lyrical.  
Starry, silicon defender!  
Next to the crimson breath of the water.  
I wish to make a triangle  
in front of, and every sight, many  
times hidden in a stars in the sky.  
In the first scene, the sensual giant  
is protested by a goddess. In the second  
reel he returns, to dedicate and to tread.  
A morbid phenomenon coagulates  
even the domestic  
public thicket in language  
to which the metaphor  
will not be trod.  
  
Carry me onto your train - the mango of my muscle -  
some flow but I return your metal like mane.
