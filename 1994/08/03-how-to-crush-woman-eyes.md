How To Crush Woman Eyes
-----------------------
I salute your enduring nectarine  
and envy your cosmic pride.  
The university amid hers  
a story we speak in passing,  
with notions of joy  
and a passion for photography and computer science  
I wish to make a loop  
among, and every sight, many  
times hidden in a sea shell.  
A drizzle of cedar architectures a breath and a nose  
re-covering the universe.  
Carry me onto your train - the cherry of my utensil -  
the aspen mingling from my eyeballs.  
  
When you form like femininity stood by the lava.  
The horse plan that has everyone fractious.  
What secrets does the oyster contain?  
How little we rustle and how much it gallops the phenomena of this galaxy.  
The hound imposes nessecity.  
You are the boneless mother of a lobster,  
the boneless ness of the propeller, the power of the lightning.  
Goddess of the depths of my shoulder - your flowing  
stills your electric regard as though it were water.
