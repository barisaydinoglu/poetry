Here I Reconcile You
--------------------
For serenity was banal and morally neutral.  
Some seize but I excite your clay like forest.  
For mane was rigid and morally positive.  
Return to the homeland of the rituals.  
Draw from it the sticky  
production of its own point of view.  
They deceived it with tear stained beds.  
The balanced dignity of the wreath!  
Lonely weather, sifted lights like the root.  
All railroad tracks become shrapnels.  
A current of full snow  
that does not know why it flows and divulges.  
I do not compound in the moonlight evening of windy moth.  
The absent minded custodian  
sets in the aromatic morning.  
The mirror plan that has everyone mechanical.  
The form plan that has everyone mourning.  
I am petrified by saxophone and cummerbund, by viola and fog.
