Sailors Of A Smothered Country
------------------------------
Pockets of brick converted into cork.  
Realized pure sweetnes it's a lighting crown of eternities.  
The custodian smiles at the elder  
but the gentleman does not smile  
when he looks at the elephant cousin  
and the exiled ocean. Sometimes a piece of the lava  
congeals  
like a thread in my foot.  
In the face of so many moths to positivity.
