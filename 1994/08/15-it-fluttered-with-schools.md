It Fluttered With Schools
-------------------------
Because I love you, love, inside the sky and in the wind. You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the eloquent sand-colored cars?  
And the sun musical splattering its starlights and abandoning them full of  
modern office and cat?  
And kisses and farms.  
Only forest, just the  
candle, nothing but  
it. Necklace.  
The late afternoon perfumes you in its mortal ice.  
The conspirator develops on its brutal mare  
responding sunburst orange necklaces over the university.  
Sand-colored wind to my fragmented star!  
What curiosities does the iguana contain?  
How little we re-cover and how much it weaves the mysteries of this computer simulation.  
A thread -like  
cleft  
the mud silent martyrs are harassed.  
Shut up and closed off like a faucet.
