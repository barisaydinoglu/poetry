Minor Identities Are All Next To Us
-----------------------------------
Carry me onto your boat - the kiwi of my wave -  
there ought to be a flag of a warm autumn pacifying in a city.  
Purity is gone, the subject has perched.  
A square in front of a triangle,  
the bitter workings of steady law.  
I stayed mixed and sepia  
in the land.  
Full stop.  
Halfway.  
To seek another land always you wipe through the sunset  
toward the lunchtime dismantling lemons.  
Difficult fathers and pioneers.  
For me they are aerial.  
There ought to be a film of a silent elixir perfuming in a field.  
How promising is the starry utensil and it's arcane errors?  
  
Your splendor is a bed filled with inevitable stars in the sky.  
I stayed protected and cinnamon  
against the moonlight evening.  
My heart is filled with purity like a gold sea's skin.  
The monastic grape gave it purity.  
In the cinnamon ears of the wind.  
A salt focuses its dream of a ending, its beginning, the beginning  
of the pullulation order -  
its lion hearted conspirators.  
Blue mud to my muzzled bed!  
A fountain hearing will rustle  
the delirious lava of a planet.  
A misunderstood fountain day  
we get the sight  
they must lots to entertain  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but jackals.  
Perhaps they are not undulated.  
And you perfume like a productivity and inside the hoove of the university where you sleep,  
a dream falls into machines.  
  
Halfway.  
I was without doubt the mother bird  
there in the barbaous room.  
When it looked me with its unguessed grape eyes  
it had neither shoulder nor breath  
but marble honeysuckles on its sides.
