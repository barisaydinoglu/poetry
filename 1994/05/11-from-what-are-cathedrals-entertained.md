From What Are Cathedrals Entertained
------------------------------------
But the map built the memory.  
The curtain perching from my arm.  
I do not compound in the field of chaotic abys.  
A ritual magnifying will drink  
the tremulous lightning of a planet.  
My heart is filled with joy like a gem coat.  
I salute your soft peach  
and envy your poetic pride.  
  
Brings all the congeals wheatfields.  
Transparent and monastic giant,
