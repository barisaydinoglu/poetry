The Massacre Fallen Into The Sea
--------------------------------
Multitude of defenders!  
In and out of the sunburst orange the cinnamon and the deep brown a clear rain of lands.  
Confusion and mosaic - quivers of fear.  
When you discover like home kissed by the wind.  
Pockets of iron converted into emerald.  
  
Nothing but that drop of poppies.  
From blade of grass to unrelenting rain,  
hidden maternities drawn by round channels, a  
bitter wreath begins to flutter.  
In your leg of flying the universe begins to dream of connecting.  
I am degraded by wreath and heart, by rotten stump and sun.  
The alcove appreciating from my foot.  
Around deep brown water and blue ribbons.  
A flower focuses its dream of a new ending, its new beginning, the new ending of the femininity order -  
its mineral billows of rust colored smoke.  
Pockets of aluminum converted into silicon.  
Your smooth brick is an awe filled with obscene productivity.  
They soddened it with distorted shadess of silvery.  
  
Hearing a lake  
pacified in the absorbant sun.  
The callous wave is boundless on your leg.  
  
With its thirsty protect a vessel is not enough to wipe me and keep me  
from the vicinity of your sensual epiphany.  
I'm the pioneer to the splendor of immediate cluster.
