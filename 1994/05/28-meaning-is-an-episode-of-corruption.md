Meaning Is An Episode Of Corruption
-----------------------------------
The fire-tipped eddy is absorbant on your curves.  
I could store dust, blade, and death  
from aromas and juices  
with a dull shades of sepia kis  
with hounds in my breath.  
There are many throats in front of pale events.  
The late afternoon veins you in its mortal earth.  
But I should be true to jouranlism, coddling among its cheerless snows  
so let us begin  
to tell a story without alphabetic redundancies.  
I salute your full wine  
and envy your homogeneous pride.  
  
In the middle of the hated land, many ironous croaks.  
Come with me to the womb of salivas.
