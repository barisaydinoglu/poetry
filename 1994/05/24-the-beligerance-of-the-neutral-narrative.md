The Beligerance Of The Neutral Narrative
----------------------------------------
Not the crimson moment  
when the morning carries the foams.  
One of them is plumed,  
the other knows metaphors.  
Where is noone  
she says, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Acrobat.  
Shall we keep going?  
I wish  
to make a square  
behind, and every meaning, many  
times hidden in an affection.  
Wave of wave of windows rolling down the sea.  
Closed  
off and shut out like a wave.  
Sometimes a piece of the ice  
prosecutes like an atom in my eye.  
The careful planetariums cracked the eternity awakens on its silent mare  
imbuing crimson defenders over the chimney.  
  
Like havocs dropping  
in fountains.
