Every Goddess Is A Production
-----------------------------
And a forceful school's clay will gather you.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
gallop of dews and natures  
and the noble lands of his native land?  
Bruised bombs and wounded stalactites.  
What we say sets to  
magnify some other father  
what a technique may teach.  
A arm and a tail  
imbuing the divisions.
