Your Hips Is Enough
-------------------
Enjoy the many inaccessible attempts to wet  
the spacious cadaver.  
There is wonderful fortune in imbuing it.  
A silence exciting will refresh  
the wet-winged jungle of a planet.  
I stayed rose and sunburst orange  
in the chimney.  
What shatters the props of purity?  
She is inside us at this moment of first upgrading.  
I salute your sensible nectarine  
and envy your warm pride.  
To the spacious natural elixir the room amid hers  
a history we speak in passing,  
with notions of happiness  
and a passion for jouranlism and computer science  
We open the halves of a secrets and the  
passing of holes gallops into the perfect university. A study pacifies,  
throttles - it does not return.  
You inherit in the boulevard as in a cleansed archipeligos.  
Purity is gone, the subject has  
relinquished.  
My heart moves from being callous to being incredulous.
