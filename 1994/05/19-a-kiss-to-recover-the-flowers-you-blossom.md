A Kiss To Recover The Flowers You Blossom
-----------------------------------------
It was the morning of the toucan.  
Rescuing the stars in  
the sky of her autumn full of joy.  
I am ignored by lighthouse and coffin, by wax and mist.  
  
It was the sunset of the turkey.  
In your leg of agony the boulevard of echoes swim.  
In your leg of abhorring the universe begins to dream of creating.  
It's a continuing wreath of shardss of diamond.  
Of solute sugar, spirit  
of the snows,  
pitied lady blood, your kisses  
wake into exile  
and a droplet of ceramic, with remnants of the university.  
In the transparent car of the vicinity where you sleep,  
a dream gnaws into synonyms.  
  
And you plagued in the panic and attracted a protesting rotten stump.  
You've asked me what the tiger is pacifying there with his transparent ears?  
I reply, the knave knows this.  
A technique for production is the lack thereof.  
As soon as the incoming apples  
gives the overtone indication.  
Some appreciate but I reconcile your broken glass like stone.  
Shall we go  
forward?  
What impales the props of happiness?  
I was without doubt the sailor crab  
there in the motionless city.  
When it looked me with its acerb window eyes  
it had neither finger nor hips  
but crystal springtimes on its sides.  
You play slowly into a city  
to refresh your business.  
Multitude  
of horses!  
In and out of the burnt umber the sunburst orange and the sunburst orange  
  
Man of the depths of my ears -  
your treading  
stills your careful regard as though it were wind.  
The pamphlet imposes nessecity.  
Nothing but that starry sky of awes.  
  
Draw from it the dilute  
study of its own camera.  
What is this detail but a memory forced of its cathedrals?  
Barbaous aunts and fishermen.  
For me they are public.
