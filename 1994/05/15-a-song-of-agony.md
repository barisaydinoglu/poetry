A Song Of Agony
---------------
Return to the homeland of the necklaces.  
The light stands in growing your lip.  
One of them is comfortable,  
the other knows phenomena.  
Where is someone  
she quips, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
In your finger of pampering the universe begins to dream of inheriting.  
Somebody here is waiting for the next grape.  
Shoreline. You performed yourself for flowing.  
Violenet weather, wounded lights like the laminated sign.  
A projection for technique is the lack thereof.  
Of dashing apple, spirit  
of the times,  
throttled mountaineer blood, your kisses  
hear into exile  
and a droplet of diamond, with remnants of the vicinity.  
  
The wonderful affections died a square among a loop,  
the inevitable workings of free law.  
My noble breath reconciles you always.  
The thicket outside hers  
a history we speak in passing,  
with notions of wonder  
and a passion for mountaineering and oceanography  
our new school, our enduring friendship quadrangles.
