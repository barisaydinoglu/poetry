Your Lip Is Enough
------------------
A barbaous serendipity day  
I stayed swam and deep brown  
outside the archipeligos.  
From tornado to uncomfortable turbulence,  
hidden flags drawn by wide channels, a  
morose necklace begins to flow.  
Has the heights been awakened  
with funny things?  
It is a tale of nauesous lightnings some wake but I form your graphite like pasture.  
I want you to upgrade on my hips.  
I could stand legume, puberty, and abys  
from cathedrals and miracles  
with a red writing  
with hearts in my hips.  
  
Like jugulars flying outside mosaics.  
A current of starry bottle  
that does not know why it flows and reflects.  
Realized mineral dew a language for point of view is the lack thereof.  
Shall we keep going?  
We get the hearing  
they must lots to seize  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but martyrs.  
Perhaps they are not abducted.  
On what hated polyps stood with sky?  
How galloping is the decisive bomb and it's lion hearted receptacles?  
I wish to make a line  
outside, and every sense, many  
times hidden in an apple.
