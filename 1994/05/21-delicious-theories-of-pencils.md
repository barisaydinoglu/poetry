Delicious Theories Of Pencils
-----------------------------
One of them is parenthetical,  
the other knows computers.  
Where is someone  
he exclaims, and when can we  
see what  
is going to happen?  
The spoiled grace that carries in your awe.  
Like errors mourning next to lakes.  
I create as if among a bitterest consequence.  
I took on hairy forms.  
And you undulated in the fear and mingled a deluding shortcut.  
Conversations of hats, the recitation  
of suns we call plumed cactus.  
The domestic dignity of the writing!
