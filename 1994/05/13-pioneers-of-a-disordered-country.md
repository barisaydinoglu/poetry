Pioneers Of A Disordered Country
--------------------------------
And you enchant like a moon and not to light or even meet  
the peace of one who connects  
outside me in a chimney or chirping to a father.  
Pure consequence circumscribes the spheres pure death hears the echoes the perfume sobs, the dew of secure  
makes outside.  
Here I am, a cleansed eye congealed in the boulevard of hoove.  
I stayed divulged and yellow  
behind the area.  
Not the blue moment  
when the holiday rises the leaves.  
For a day, maybe twenty-seven,  
I rested under a tornado  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the father to be within.  
The somber dignity of the root!  
I'd do it for the coat in which you rescue  
for the perfumes of sepia you've played.  
Full stop.  
To seek another land the forceful fellowship is eloquent on your eye.  
How gathering is the irreducable invasion and it's poetic cadavers?  
Aunt of the depths of my eyeballs - your fluttering  
stills your human regard as though it were heat.  
  
Amid the penetrating depths.  
And a fragmented serendipity's heat will shower you.  
  
Realized handsome drop not the crimson moment  
when the early light of day preserves the fellowships.  
In the first scene, the smooth elder  
is wetted by a lady. In the second  
scene he returns, to connect and to rescue.
