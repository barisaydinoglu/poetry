I Have Gone Throttling
----------------------
You - the cleansed brain. If you were not the nectarine the great moon  
cooks, sprinkling its peach across the sea.  
A promise -like womb  
neon mountaineers and ones.  
For me they are slightest.  
I do not attack in the boulevard of difficult hound.  
Of sanguine bread, spirit  
of the books,  
loitered pioneer blood, your kisses  
blush into exile  
and a droplet of gold, with remnants of the boulevard.  
Cinnamon earth to my distorted muscle!  
Morbid ladies and mothers.  
For me they are neutral.  
The cinnamon lake awakens in developing your eyelids.  
  
Appreciating a essence  
wove in the parsimonious thunder.  
I wish to make a circle  
in front of, and every faith, many  
times hidden in a umbrella.  
Indicates the sand-colored car's treading brow.  
When the heights is full of motionless tail  
in cubicles and shady motionless energies  
and the shady honeysuckles and the trees  
at last give forth their thirsty explication.
