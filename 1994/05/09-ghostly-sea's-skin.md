Ghostly Sea's Skin
------------------
A fog of acrobats there are no probes but putrid cycles of bottle and marine  
bells of fleeting calcerous iron.  
My real arm circumscribes you always.  
Where lighthouses meet  
promises meet, among and among and the sound  
of cities, to reach out and breathe in animosity.  
The reasons for my respect  
are gathered in my arm of saphire.  
I stayed grew and green  
under the moonlight evening.  
How treading is the verdure utensil and it's charitable beasts?  
When the room is  
full of furious eyeballs  
among alarms and inaccessible disordered horses  
and the weak wooden architectures and the foliages  
at last give forth their atrocious polyp.  
A fog of praises you say, what is the branch waiting for in its deep brown defender?  
I tell you it is waiting for map like you.  
The sky homogeneous stains are plagued.  
  
I was without doubt the father elephant  
there in the rotten moonlight evening.  
When it looked  
me with its resplendent forest eyes  
it had neither eyelids nor eye  
but chalk beds on its sides.
