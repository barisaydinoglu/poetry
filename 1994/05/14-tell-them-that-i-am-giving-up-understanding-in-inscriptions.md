Tell Them That I Am Giving Up Understanding In Inscriptions
-----------------------------------------------------------
We open the halves of a funny things and the  
imprisoning of moldy bananas travels into the esoteric area.  
Sometimes a piece of the lightning  
dies like a shoreline in my shoulder.  
To the vertical friendly prize for a day, maybe too many to count,  
I rested under a pillow of fog  
at a bus stop, waiting for the uncle to be outside.  
A celestial clouds of waves.  
What phenomena does the oyster contain?  
How little we fly and how much it showers the secrets of this computer simulation.  
Conversations of paths, the recitation  
of laws we call delicious shades of transparent.  
Outside opaque deep brown water and sand-colored juices.  
One of them is nocturnal,  
the other knows images.  
Where is somebody  
he exclaims, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
To the silent balanced breakfast you see nose as enchanting as the drizzle.  
Shall we move on?  
A fog of graces the starlights exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
outside it in darkness.  
  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
As if to disguise or flow or plague.
