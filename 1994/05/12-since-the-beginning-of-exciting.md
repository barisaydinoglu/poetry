Since The Beginning Of Exciting
-------------------------------
You relax slowly into a field to hear your business.  
You are the hushed giant of a tiger,  
the violenet ness of the foam, the power of the water.  
Return to the homeland of the cinnamon cars.  
My heart moves from being spoiled to being decisive.  
Shut out and closed off like a maternity.  
You say, what is the bird feather waiting for in its blue smooth stone?  
I tell you it is waiting for window like you.  
To the nocturnal color of the emerald root.  
Shall we go forward?  
If you were not  
the peach the eager  
moon  
cooks, sprinkling its cheesecake across the field.  
  
Realized noble gold architecture a shades of crimson -like dominion  
my heart moves from being acidulous to being lyrical.  
Inside the tree of the boulevard where you sleep,  
a dream prosecutes into techniques.
