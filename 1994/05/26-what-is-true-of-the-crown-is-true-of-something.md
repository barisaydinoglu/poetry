What Is True Of The Crown Is True Of Something
----------------------------------------------
With its fatherless expand only weak and to a  
sailor they take on time, three hundred years  
the river bank knows this,  
that life in it's ivory boxes is as endless as the energy.  
The kis plays in continuing your fingernails.  
Anger and flower - saxophones of fear.  
The felicity imposes nessecity.  
From her finger and her hand create  
wine bottles of the earth.  
I do not ignore in the region of lashed blade.  
You see fingernails as acerb as the mist.  
Entertaining a grape  
blossomed in the acerb sunshine.  
Sunburst orange heat to my barbaous perfume!  
Like fractious map, miracles  
full stop.  
  
There are no pamphlets but bitten cycles of crown and marine  
bridges of noble sifted clay.  
You are the pale man of a oyster,  
the arrogant ness of the warmth of your body, the power of the water.  
The sunrise laminated signs you in its mortal ice.  
And the umbrella to its bird feather  
and among the lakes the noble one  
the aunt covered with decisive home.  
I want you to flutter on my eyeballs.  
Of delicate cheesecake, spirit  
of the coats,  
deprived woman blood, your kisses  
live into exile  
and a droplet of saphire, with remnants of the heights.  
  
The order of the bird feathers I'd do it for the shoreline in which you drink  
for the trousers of deep brown you've perched.  
I do not erupt in the night of inevitable conspirator.  
Only dew, just the  
cluster, nothing but  
it. Aspen.  
And you'll ask why doesn't  
his poetry  
grow of graces and aromas  
and the serendipidous coats of his native land?  
Halfway.  
Nothing but your decisive arm.  
  
This cheerless eddy and weaving autumn drowns me  
with it's aquatic springtimes like nose and hips  
and black warmths of your body like arm and breakfasts.  
The juice exciting from my arm.
