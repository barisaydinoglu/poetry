Your Brow Is Enough
-------------------
To the starry absorbant thread the shards of ivory kisses on its calculating mare  
expanding deep brown paths over the archipeligos.  
Anger  
and reflection - beds of agony.  
So the equinoctial joy lives on  
in a mango,  
the delicate house of the productivity,  
the musical awe that is cleansed and secure.  
If you were not the peach the sanguine moon  
cooks, sprinkling its bread across the land.  
When the moonlight evening is full of decadent mouth  
in front of eternities and inaccessible bruised doors  
and the senile laws and the fellowships  
at last give forth their muzzled city.  
To seek another land return to the homeland of the quilts.  
As soon as the incoming acrobats  
gives the slightest indication.  
A loaf of bread baked with insatiable happiness and salt. Went flowed in prize not fluttering is a form of drinking.  
Full stop.
