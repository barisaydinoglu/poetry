The Lashed Cousin Of The Night
------------------------------
If I could return the trash barge and the universe.  
Like morbid leaf, currents  
a blue mist flows.  
Always you bristle through the lunchtime  
toward the morning pitying landscapes.  
And so that its lards will throttle your curves.  
A snow of lights amid the foliage of the city where you sleep,  
a dream bristles into sequences.  
A flower breathing will upgrade  
the shaken lightning of a planet.  
Multitude of quilts!  
In and out of the deep brown the transluscent cashmire and the green  
Like the inaccessible aluminum of gardens the one smiles at the lady  
but the custodian does not smile  
when he looks at the pheasant woman  
and the communist ocean.  
A line behind a loop,  
the callous workings of aquatic law.  
  
The melancholy jaguar trusts in the middle of the mineral alarms.  
What electrifies the props of tiredness?
