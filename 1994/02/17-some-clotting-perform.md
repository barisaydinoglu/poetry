Some Clotting Perform
---------------------
Sordid afternoon and the tear stained lunar  
entangle at the walls of my house.  
Inside the circus of the divisions where you sleep,  
a dream falters into languages.  
Amid the mirror of the room where you sleep,  
a dream abducts into metaphors.  
Yellow and sensual astronaut,  
Shut up and closed off like a stalks of cattail.  
Be guided by the boundless curtain's breakfast.  
I could upgrade corpse, stain, and trap  
from drops and faucets  
with a blood colored momentum  
with bloods in my nose.  
We get the sight  
they must lots to fly  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but explications.  
Perhaps they are not faltered.  
You build slowly into a vicinity to stand your business.  
It's  
a discovering hat of legumes.
