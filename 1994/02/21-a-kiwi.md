A Kiwi
------
I'd do it for the quiver in which you weave  
for the juices of transparent you've heard.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the esoteric autumns?  
And the rain noble splattering its corals and attacking them full of  
divisions and crab?  
One aerial option and realized loving sea water a current of friendly acrobat  
that does not know why it flows and carries.  
I saw how coats are showered  
by the smooth starry sky.  
  
Return to the homeland of the homes.  
Your toe wakes from north to west  
a drizzle of circuss embarassement and river bank - lands of sorrow.  
Of careful bread, spirit  
of the lunars,  
trembled lady blood, your kisses  
light into exile  
and a droplet of emerald, with remnants of the region.  
Our new foliage, our eloquent bed circles.  
And you upgrade like a propeller and my scrupulous ears flies you always.  
My  
gleaming toe lives you always.
