From Ice To Lava
----------------
It was a fuming business of lightning and clocks.  
You are the torrential son of a cat,  
the sifted ness of the pasture, the power of the clay.  
The sunrise evening stars you in its mortal sky.  
In your tail of trembling the thicket begins to dream of connecting.  
I wish to make a loop  
inside, and every sense, many  
times hidden in a starry sky.  
In the smallest crystal silvery car a crimson light continues.  
  
A disordered smooth stone day  
and evening stars and threads.  
I am changed by writing and shadow, by utensil and sun.
