It Perfumed With Energies
-------------------------
Rabid croaks and guilt  
imbroglios. In the yellow shoulder of the jungle.  
I was without doubt the daughter elephant  
there in the tear stained  
boulevard.  
When it looked me with its aromatic wheatfield eyes  
it had neither nose nor toe  
but emerald ripples on its sides.  
All beds become granules.  
Nobody here is waiting for the next wreath.  
Reflection. You enchanted yourself for perfuming.  
My heart moves from being phosphorus to being dashing.
