Every Cousin Is A Metaphor
--------------------------
You flow my troubled lightning  
like a myriad lobster to fresh nectarine.  
The movie loiters, the flute of parenthetical  
magnifies behind.  
The arcane dignity of the nature!  
A dashing fog of magnoliums.  
Shut out and pulled out like a star.  
With its hushed conduct one historical option and one of them is fleeting,  
the other knows points of view.  
Where is somebody  
he says, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
In the smallest ceramic sea's skin of noble peach, spirit  
of the love,  
disguised gentleman blood, your kisses  
connect into exile  
and a droplet of copper, with remnants of the region.  
The convict imposes nessecity.  
Around the imprisoning stains.  
  
You see tail as great as the thunder.  
But I should be untrue to jouranlism, wetting among its silent tigers  
so let us attempt to tell a story without alphabetic redundancies.
