A Kiss To Magnify The Echoes You Reconcile
------------------------------------------
Deep brown martyrs of bomb,  
green seams above a inaccessible magnolium.  
Around the room I like to blossom like a tear stained sun rise.  
The reasons for my respect  
are built  
in my eyelids of silicon.  
If you were not the lemon the sensual moon  
cooks, sprinkling its sugar across the heights.
