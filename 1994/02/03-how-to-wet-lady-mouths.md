How To Wet Lady Mouths
----------------------
In the face of so many sticks to functionality.  
Always you force through the early light of day  
toward the afternoon loathing eddies.  
It treads like a juice inside the sun rise.  
I wish to make a line segment  
with, and every color, many  
times hidden in a honeysuckle.  
As if to bristle or travel or ignore.  
The I in crown  
connect on the corruptions that wait for you  
degrading the mourning chairs, deceiving  
the doors.  
  
A silence -like shortcut  
where lemons meet  
lemons meet, with and next to and the sound  
of whispers, to reach out  
and light in illusion.  
The reasons for my respect  
are responded in my lip of silk.  
And so that its granules will attack your tail.  
Furious noises and smothered bloodied  
aluminums.  
With the opaque dull shades of yellow anger of the moldy banana.  
From pillow of fog to pillow of fog,  
hidden paths drawn by iridescent channels, a  
distorted mane begins to dedicate.  
Which is a lyrical praise of directions  
twenty-seven or million, expanded  
on a saxophone or in the sanguine forest  
directions of the brow, a calculation in your tails.  
And meetings of sterile hips around the falling receptacles.  
  
On what violenet acids mixed with lava?  
A brow and a heart  
conducting the divisions.  
  
Be guided by the comfortable planetarium's soul.  
You are the arrogant aunt of a toucan,  
the forceful ness of the springtime, the power of the water.  
If I could chirp the massacre and the jungle.  
But I should be untrue to jouranlism, fainting among its decadent praises  
so let us attempt to speak a story devoid of slightest redundancies.
