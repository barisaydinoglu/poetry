Since The End Of Decaying
-------------------------
A secure thunder of moons. Of hidden grape, spirit  
of the fountains,  
entangled giant blood, your kisses  
flutter into exile  
and a droplet of silicon, with remnants of the land.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
flow of trousers and acrobats  
and the careful lunars of his native land?  
Come with me to the puberty of lampreys.
