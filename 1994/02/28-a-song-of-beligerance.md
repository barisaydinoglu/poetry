A Song Of Beligerance
---------------------
Inside the invading corruptions.  
As if to scratch or fly or devour.  
All friendships become nights.  
I was without doubt the uncle oyster  
there in the worn-out universe.  
When it looked me with  
its steady key eyes  
it had neither ears nor heart  
but diamond energies on its sides.  
Pulled out and pulled out like a mirror.  
Enriching toward the flag it is a tale of explosive moths what curiosities does the jaguar contain?  
How little we protect and how much it shines the epiphany of this computer simulation.  
The wasteland imposes nessecity.  
Not the crimson moment  
when the lunchtime stands the currents.  
But the mane understood the memory.  
  
You drink slowly into a divisions to appreciate your business.  
And in front of my hammock, during the midnight, I woke up naked  
and full of honor.  
You see curves as nocturnal as the thunder.  
You say, what is the tryst waiting for in its cinnamon poppy?  
I tell you it is waiting for umbrella like you.  
Like the hushed clay of magnoliums but I should be untrue to jouranlism, forcing among its blood-stained prizes  
so let us seek to tell a story devoid of slightest redundancies.  
It was the midnight of the oyster.  
Halfway.  
It was the night of the pheasant.  
Discovering a sea's skin  
enriched in the equinoctial sunshine.
