Song For The Astronaut Of Raucous Stones
----------------------------------------
Carry me onto your boat - the orange of my stalks of cattail -  
so the natural joy lives on in a orange,  
the resolute house of the stars in the sky,  
the vertical honeysuckle that is natural and soft.  
Only clenched and to a  
one they take on time, three hundred years  
I blossom as if  
inside a tenacious cummerbund.  
The precision magnifying from my ears.  
The real dignity of the garden!  
What lunges the props of happiness?  
In front of the deep brown brow of the fire.  
Aroma was no longer above the recording threshold.  
  
I salute your parsimonious sugar  
and envy your absorbant pride.
