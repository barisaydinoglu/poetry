I Have Gone Divulging
---------------------
Not the green moment  
when the holiday flies the leaves.  
So the mineral love lives on in a lemon,  
the sanguine house of the railroad track,  
the homogeneous bottle that is original and boundless.  
Halfway.  
A decadent machine buries  
even the equinoctial  
individual room in antenna  
to which the metaphor  
will not be galloped.  
  
A nose and a foot  
carrying the night.  
Shut out and shut out like a school.  
Wave of wave of river banks rolling down the sea.  
I stayed sought and sunburst orange  
against the sea.  
Lived and then preserved  
in the universe.  
Seizing from boneless gold.  
Behind the rust colored fear of the invasion.
