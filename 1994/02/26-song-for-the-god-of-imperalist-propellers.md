Song For The God Of Imperalist Propellers
-----------------------------------------
Everything rotten with real voices, the salt of the femininity  
and piles of scrupulous bread outside sunset. As soon as the incoming bells  
gives the aerial indication.  
A current of decisive river bank  
that does not know why it flows and recovers.  
  
Nothing but your serendipidous  
arm.
