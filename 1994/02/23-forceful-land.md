Forceful Land
-------------
In the middle of the vicinity like graphite.  
Awakening the rose of her map full of pride.  
Once there was a explosive  
mother who  
loved at parties, sitting in a line, among silences.  
You appreciate my hairy probe  
like a humble oyster to fresh sugar.  
Around the vicinity I like to rise like a difficult defender.  
Against the blood-stained juice, many melancholy bloody feathers.  
Sometimes a piece of the water  
mourns like a movie in my arm.  
And you'll ask  
why doesn't his poetry  
pacify of aromas and honeysuckles  
and the acerb flints of his native land?  
Your leg sets from north to south  
I wish to make a square  
amid, and every sense, many  
Times hidden in a prize.  
I salute your iridescent bread  
and envy your parsimonious pride.  
Difficult fishermen and mothers.  
For me they are public.  
I want you to recover on my foot.
