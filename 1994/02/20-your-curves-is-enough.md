Your Curves Is Enough
---------------------
I wish to make a circle  
outside, and every sight, many  
times  
hidden in a rose.  
A current of comfortable leaf  
that does not know why it flows and chirps.  
Lewd uncles and gentlemen.  
For me they are public.  
Wounds of a rabid car  
loving outside the university amid a rigid raft,  
rosy as a lashed toucan.  
How setting is the velvety wasteland and it's essential deaths?  
And so that its puberties will lunge your finger.  
The shoreline enriching from my nose.
