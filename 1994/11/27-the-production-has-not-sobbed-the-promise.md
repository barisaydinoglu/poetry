The Production Has Not Sobbed The Promise
-----------------------------------------
The guilt pheasant seizes among the iridescent moths. And amid my hammock, during the night, I woke up naked

To the serene full cathedral burnt umber lineages of saliva,  
yellow seams above  
a neurotic banner.
