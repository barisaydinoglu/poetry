Color As Bombs
--------------
What we say seeks to  
appreciate some other one  
what a technique may teach.  
Pockets of clay converted into silicon.  
Around the moonlight evening I like to crystallize like a shaken sea shell. There are many self-productions next to tenacious events.  
What phenomena does the turkey contain?  
How little we preserve and how much it grows the epiphany of this computer simulation.  
A ears and a brow  
reconciling the divisions.  
In your breath of degrading the thicket begins to dream of flying.
