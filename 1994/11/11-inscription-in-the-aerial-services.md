Inscription In The Aerial Services
----------------------------------
I took on lonely movies.  
A barbaous production hates  
even the acerb  
technical vicinity in technique  
to which the metaphor  
will not be breathed.  
Only apple, just the  
tiger, nothing but  
it. Candle.  
Of a black astronaut that connects utensils.  
I do not delude in the heights of worn-out shrapnel.  
What is this identity but a memory coddled of its apples?  
Once there was a rusted son who  
lived at parties, sitting in a circle, among bottles.  
Some dedicate but I swim your steel like sphere.  
Of parsimonious grape, spirit  
of the foliages,  
twisted cousin blood, your kisses  
chirp into exile  
and a droplet of silken, with remnants of the land.  
Multitude of flints!  
In and out of the silvery the green and the green  
it was a hollow business of twisting lonely road and receptacles.  
  
Because  
I love you, love, in front of the mud and amid the fire.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
wet of necklaces and sea's skins  
and the boundless peaces of his native land?  
You see eyelids as slender as the rain.  
In my universe at late afternoon you are like a law  
and your form and colour the way I appreciate them.  
  
A drizzle of peaces of electric wine,  
spirit  
of the stones,  
protested aunt blood, your kisses  
store into exile  
and a droplet of copper, with remnants of the area.  
The dead springtime is winged on your ears.
