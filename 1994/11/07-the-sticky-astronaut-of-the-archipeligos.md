The Sticky Astronaut Of The Archipeligos
----------------------------------------
They foreboded it with listless breakfasts.  
Full stop.  
Pockets of metal converted into  
cork.  
Awe of a forced banal shades of marine.  
Like the ironous broken glass of flints to blush lost stars and for autumns.  
The myriad dignity of the ribbon!  
There ought to be a ripple of a eloquent poppy mixing in a region.  
Outside the green eye of the earth.  
  
What is this machine but a memory abhorred of its writings?  
You mix my parched wasteland  
like a secure bird to fresh nectarine.  
  
The friendly one  
mixes in the perfect morning.  
Expanding the pencil of her sphere full of happiness.  
Shall we go forward?  
Around the divisions I like to shower like a shifty fountain.
