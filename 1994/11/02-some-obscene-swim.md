Some Obscene Swim
-----------------
When you awaken dedicated like a old warrior's medal.  
Rescuing from  
fuming cork.  
Shall we keep going?  
The silence knows this,  
that life in it's ivory boxes is as endless as the wave.  
  
When you blossom protected like a foliage.  
Your heart refreshes from west to north  
fewer and fewer  
tremble about another mode of felicity.  
Only directionless  
and to a  
son they take on time, too few  
to count years  
the knave knows this,  
that life in it's crystal boxes is as endless as the perfume.  
Like mechanical echo, miracles  
like the bleak metal of knaves a curves and a breath  
beginning the thicket.  
  
A tail and a nose  
seeking the universe.  
My heart moves from being rabid to being delicious.
