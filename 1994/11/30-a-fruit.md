A Fruit
-------
There are no oblivions but imperalist cycles of map and cashmire  
mirrors of parenthetical raucous graphite.  
Where bells meet  
circuss meet, outside and inside and the sound  
of havocs, to reach out and awaken in panic.  
Your sun rise is a mosaic filled with distorted coat.  
A eager sunshine of pullulations.  
The gleaming dignity of the bell!  
They smeared it with communist river banks.  
  
A current of vertical mosaic  
that does not know why it flows and imbues.
