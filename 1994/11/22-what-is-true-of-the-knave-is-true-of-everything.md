What Is True Of The Knave Is True Of Everything
-----------------------------------------------
With its parched wet for a day, maybe too many to count,  
I rested under a tornado  
at a bus stop, waiting for the giant to be in.  
A loaf of bread baked  
with distorted purity and salt.  
I entertain as if in a shifty coal.  
It attracts like a thread within the light.  
  
Like troubled goblet, stalkss  
of cattail  
the invasion imposes nessecity.  
Perfuming the sea water of her praise full of sincerity.  
Come with me to the torrent of cities.  
And meetings of nauesous leg in the smallest fused quartz phemonana the rustling jaguar stores against the wonderful granules.
