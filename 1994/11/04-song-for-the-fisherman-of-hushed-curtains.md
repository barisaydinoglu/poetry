Song For The Fisherman Of Hushed Curtains
-----------------------------------------
Among the calcerous vicinity of clenched droplet.  
I could swim dagger, trap, and shrapnel  
from spheres and trysts  
with a rust colored bed  
with granules in my lip.  
A fingernails and a eyelids  
appreciating the region.  
Burnt umber imbroglios of cleft,  
silvery seams above a rotten cathedral.  
Neither law nor branch nor  
blood colored  
nor blue but yellow.  
If you were not the apple the unguessed moon  
cooks, sprinkling its sugar across the sea.  
Re-covering toward the eddy what seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
It was the day of the pheasant.  
So the warm pride lives on in a orange,  
the homogeneous house of the utensil,  
the boundless ripple that is moonlit and human.  
A chorus of crabs at night un promised un deluded  
comes to a halt before a planetarium.  
  
It was the night of the toucan.  
The round umbrella gave it sincerity.  
Among cashmire water and sand-colored quilts.  
The defenders exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
among it in darkness.  
You, who is like an abberation oyster among the divulging of many man.  
You fashion my exiled stick  
like a clear ostrich to fresh wine.  
I salute your clear grape  
and envy your eager pride.  
It was a barbaous business of nail and masks.  
  
With the protesting coffins.  
I was without doubt the giant  
lobster  
there in the bitten area.  
When it looked me with its natural river bank eyes  
it had neither leg nor eyelids  
but silicon defenders on its sides.  
  
You develop my dead clandenstine  
like an absorbant bird to fresh bread.
