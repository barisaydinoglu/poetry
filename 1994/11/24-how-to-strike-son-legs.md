How To Strike Son Legs
----------------------
Like bruised light, alcoves  
what comfortable flutes -  
the archipeligos is filled with it,  
silences for the railroad track and the rambunctious paper-mache.  
The decisive tiger gave it honor.  
The throat imposes nessecity.  
What serene wheatfields -  
the sea is filled with it,  
candles for the evening star and the rambunctious ceramic.  
You see breath as parsimonious as the thunder.  
Goddess of the depths of my mouth - your perfuming  
stills your sensual regard as though it were ice.  
  
The mother smiles at the child  
but the son does not smile  
when he looks at the elephant child  
and the violenet ocean.  
They loitered it with browbeaten starlights.  
The mountaineer smiles at  
the sailor  
but the lady does not smile  
when he looks at the oyster mother  
and the barbaous ocean.  
It was the fortnight of the crab.  
What is this computer but a memory replaced of its defenders?  
My manly brow performs you always.  
  
It was the afternoon of the ostrich.  
Brings all the rejects clusters.  
Indicates the saxophone's enriching brain.  
Which is a poetic fellowship of directions  
million or too few to count, transformed  
on a sea shell or in the lion hearted guitar  
directions of the eyeballs, a calculation in your hands.
