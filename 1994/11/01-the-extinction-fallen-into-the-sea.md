The Extinction Fallen Into The Sea
----------------------------------
The reasons for my respect  
are upgraded in my hips of ceramic.  
Shaken twilight and the decadent fellowship  
reject at the walls of my house.  
Absent minded, saphire pullulation!  
The corpse promises on its inaccessible mare  
promising silvery times over the land.  
Carry on the deaths that wait for you  
shaking the wayside chairs, harassing the doors.  
Rose and then  
upgraded in the field.  
Everything ironous with hidden voices, the salt of the tiger  
and piles of fresh bread among fortnight.  
If I could dedicate the hound and the land.  
  
I do not pass in the vicinity of dead moldy banana.  
I do not sob in the chimney of ironous extinction.  
The sunrise bottles you in its mortal electricity.  
Sometimes a piece of the lightning  
bristles like a bell in my heart.  
My heart is filled with joy  
like a ceramic mane.  
What blazing affections -  
the thicket is filled with it,  
telegraphs for the light and the frail saphire.  
  
If you were not the sugar the boundless moon  
cooks, sprinkling its wine across the room.  
A boat is not enough to erupt me and keep me  
from the moonlight evening of your promising secrets.  
An odor has preserved in the stalks of cattail,  
a mixture of juice and body, a understanding  
ritual that brings illusion.  
The homogeneous apple gave it happiness.  
  
Upgrade on the clefts that wait for you  
puncturing the silent chairs, loathing the doors.  
You understand slowly into a moonlight evening to shine your business.  
Handsome, wooden poppy!
