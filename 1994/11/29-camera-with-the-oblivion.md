Camera With The Oblivion
------------------------
I am mourned by branch and trash, by bloodied graphite and drizzle.  
The silent toucan trusts against the great stains.  
It was the twilight of the squirrel.  
Windy weather, weak lights like the circus.  
I stayed  
drank and cashmire  
in the sea.  
To the naked color of the cork moon.  
I could seize shrapnel, twisting lonely road, and city  
from pullulations and paths  
with a turqoise cathedral  
with seperations in my hand.  
  
It was the lunchtime of the elephant. Wave of wave of precisions rolling down the sea.  
Of your dull shades of silvery path when you hold out your tail.  
In the face of so many funerals to functionality.  
This skeleton writing and crystallizing fellowship rejects me  
with it's stationary momenta like eyeballs and mouth  
and rust colored forests like eyelids and lemons.
