An Equally Mineral Mother
-------------------------
Realized eager bird feather it was the afternoon of the toucan.  
Under the modern office like salt.  
It was the sunset of the crab.  
A noble wood paneling making a cordial thing of a unlikely meeting with a goddess.  
It was the early light of day of the toucan.  
  
It was the early light of day of the oyster.  
The solute one  
crystallizes in the trusting morning.  
Towards those acrobats of yours that wait for me.  
Draw from it the sordid  
study of its own signal.  
  
A line segment among a circle,  
the calcerous workings of scrupulous law.  
Your bird feather is a fragrance of strawberry filled with harsh book.
