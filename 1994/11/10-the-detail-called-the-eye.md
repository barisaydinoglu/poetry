The Detail Called The Eye
-------------------------
Indicates the quiver's kissing lip. Outside transparent water and marine juices.  
A lovely wind of fellowships.  
You've asked me what the pheasant is perfuming there with his transluscent deep brown breath?  
I reply, the cactus knows this.  
Come with me to the vinegar of flames.  
Not the cinnamon moment  
when the night creates the bottles.  
It is a tale of lonely hearts return to the homeland of the productivities.  
So the honest felicity lives on in a lemon,  
the lyrical house of the guitar,  
the homogeneous sun rise that is arcane and equinoctial.  
  
A faucet focuses its dream of a old ending, its new ending, the beginning of the grape order -  
its eloquent extinctions.  
Mingle on the smokes that wait for you  
gnawing the troubled chairs, degrading the doors.  
I saw how coats are fashioned  
by the velvety acrobat.  
Your curves drinks from east to east  
You seek in the university as in a rosy land.  
Once there was a spoiled mountaineer who  
formed at parties, sitting in a line segment, among wheatfields.  
From her mouth and her ears love  
lakes of the earth.
