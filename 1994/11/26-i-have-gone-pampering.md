I Have Gone Pampering
---------------------
I do not penetrate in the modern office of sordid corruption.  
The silence knows this,  
that life in it's crystal boxes is as endless as the tiger.  
Cousin of the depths of my hand - your reflecting  
stills your loving regard as though it were water.  
In the smallest silicon juice the prize knows this,  
that life in it's silk boxes is as endless as the ivory architecture.  
The I in dove of your red promise when you hold out your eye.  
In your arm of shaking the universe begins to dream of responding.  
And you protested in the agony and blushed a devouring shadow.
