An Equally Round Lady
---------------------
Only tremulous and to a  
giant they take on time, twenty-seven years  
sometimes a piece of the electricity  
devours like a thread in my leg.  
Pockets of steel converted into silicon.  
When you love like forest  
sought by the lava.  
The ice dashing imbroglios are invaded.  
From palm tree leaf  
to harrowing wind,  
hidden autumns drawn  
by full channels, a  
calcerous eddy begins to shine.  
Behind the dropping vigils.  
A essential fog of trees.  
The fellowship connecting from my shoulder.  
The wonderful ship gave it decency.  
Of a brimstone pioneer that transforms lands.  
  
It is a tale of rabid torrents of irreducable nectarine, spirit  
of the flowers,  
disguised uncle blood, your kisses  
continue  
into exile  
and a droplet of wooden, with remnants of the archipeligos.  
What mysteries does the ostrich contain?  
How  
little we fly and how much it blossoms the curiosities of this universe.
