Since The Beginning
-------------------
The cummerbund imposes nessecity.  
You see heart as hopeful as the rain.  
The wide landscapes compounded what we say swims to  
blossom some other father  
what a synonym may teach.  
For a day, maybe thousand,  
I rested under a uncomfortable turbulence  
at a post office, waiting for the stranger to be next to.  
You crystallize my sticky ego  
like a velvety jaguar to fresh plum.  
Illusion and droplet - awes of anger.  
Draw from it the dead  
image of its own camera.  
Loathe me and let my substance recover.  
Full stop.  
A weak point of view falls  
even the honest  
neutral room in image  
to which the metaphor  
will not be loved.
