A Quilt To Connect The Ribbons You Crystallize
----------------------------------------------
And among my hammock, during the early  
light of day, I woke up naked  
and full of decency.  
Fewer and fewer  
deprive about another mode of wonder.  
A crimson wine bottle forms.  
Green and infinite bride,  
  
Behind the windy room of bleak perfume.
