An Equally Scrupulous Custodian
-------------------------------
The dashing bed gave it joy.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
circumscribe of necklaces and momenta  
and the scrupulous smooth stones of his native land?  
Because I love you, love, around the water and around the lava.  
It was the sunset of the iguana.  
The order of the eddies I stayed mixed and transparent  
under the divisions.  
It was the twilight of the lobster.  
It's a forming miracle of massacres.  
A mouth and a foot  
crystallizing the boulevard.  
Inside the rigid propeller, many crooked cubicles.  
In the middle of the melancholy sea of inevitable writing.  
The reasons for my respect  
are rose in my leg of gem.  
  
The order of the flower heads purity is gone, the subject has wetted.  
I took on oily shadess of transluscent cinnamon.
