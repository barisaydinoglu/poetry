Your Nose Is Enough
-------------------
Appreciating the key of her stone full of felicity. The wet-winged atom is  
scrupulous on your eyelids.  
Return to the homeland of the laminated signs.  
I saw how mists are fluttered  
by the solute cactus.  
Sometimes a piece of the heat  
twists like a current in my ears.  
Inside the passing pamphlets.  
You see lip as verdure as the sun.  
How circumscribing is the indespensable noise and it's angellic polyps?  
A guitar -like yeast  
a crooked language kills  
even the clear  
technical modern office in machine  
to which the metaphor  
will not be wove.  
Reflection of an abandoned inaccessible grape.  
Nothing but that productivity of phemonanas.  
A loaf  
of bread baked with hushed respect and salt.  
  
A rusted projection undulates  
even the decisive  
slightest field in camera  
to which the metaphor  
will not be awakened.  
Some rejoice but I travel your metal like quiver.  
One technical option and it was a hushed business of cold fire and oblivions.  
Sometimes a piece of the clay  
degrades like a door in my nose.
