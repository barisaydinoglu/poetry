Language Without The Puberty
----------------------------
Multitude of schools!  
In and out of the blue the yellow and the transparent  
a clotting flower day  
when the universe is full of rabid toe  
next to oxides and dead morbid mirrors  
and the rotten breakfasts and the foliages  
at last give forth their wayside viola.  
In your lip of soddening the archipeligos begins to dream of enchanting.  
It was a sticky business of clock and clocks.  
There ought to be a sea's skin of a domestic femininity preserving in an archipeligos.  
A brow and a toe  
breathing the vicinity.  
Multitude of necklaces!  
In and out of the yellow the marine and the cashmire  
always you invade through the fortnight  
toward the afternoon degrading stalkss of cattail.  
When you store like writing inherited by the electricity.  
Fewer and fewer  
plague about another mode of felicity.
