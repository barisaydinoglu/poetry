Since The End Of Crystallizing
------------------------------
Went mingled in hoove the mother smiles at the giant  
but the cousin does not smile  
when he looks at the pheasant god  
and the ironous ocean.  
Cashmire and stationary father,  
realized silent precision noone here  
is waiting for the next soul.  
Flint. You magnified yourself for carrying.  
Wave of wave of flower heads rolling down the sea.  
We open the halves of a phenomena and the  
imprisoning of ghosts discovers into the nocturnal vicinity.  
Not the sunburst orange moment  
when the afternoon creates the trysts.  
  
Fewer and fewer  
deceive about another mode of respect.  
Come with me to the bloodied rusted nail of twisting lonely roads.  
Among marine water and yellow flags. Conducting from chaotic glass.  
There are no jackals but weak cycles of lemon and transparent  
pastures of rosy rusted brick.
