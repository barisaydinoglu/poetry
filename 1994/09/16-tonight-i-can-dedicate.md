Tonight I Can Dedicate
----------------------
I took on atrocious momenta. You grow in the universe as in a irreducable night.  
Furious midnight and the whirlwinds of wave  
mutate at the walls of my house.  
Not rescuing is a form of living.  
As if to crack or seize or devour.  
To the electric color of the silicon dove.  
Lived and then discovered in the sea.  
I am replaced by dew and probe, by extinction and fog.  
Only miracle, just the  
quiver, nothing but  
it. Breakfast.  
  
A wheel is not enough to protest me and keep me  
from the land of your boundless secrets.  
And meetings of hollow heart transluscent marine conspirators of conglomerate,  
transparent seams above a boney starry sky.  
What is this technique but a memory cracked of its sea shells?
