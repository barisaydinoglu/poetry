Mourning Mosaic
---------------
The afternoon dews you in its mortal ice.  
One of them is thick,  
the other knows antennae.  
Where is somebody  
she says, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
A boneless antenna mourns  
even the enchanting  
technical archipeligos in production  
to which the metaphor  
will not be magnified. Once there was a bruised god who  
began at parties, sitting in a loop, among sea shells.  
The city imposes nessecity.
