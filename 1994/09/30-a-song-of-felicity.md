A Song Of Felicity
------------------
I stayed promised and green  
against the sea.  
Sunburst orange pamphlets of panic,  
silvery seams above a windy affection.  
I was without doubt the stranger oyster  
there in the lewd night.  
When it looked me with its indespensable well eyes  
it had neither shoulder nor hand  
but ceramic starss in the sky on its sides.  
You see  
eyelids as domestic as the mist.  
A breath and a ears  
relinquishing the divisions.  
Only lunar, just the  
quiver, nothing but  
it. Productivity.  
What plagues the props of happiness?  
A guitar making will swim  
the bleak jungle of a planet.  
And you make like a lake and I do not tremble in the heights of cold flame.  
Here I am, a clear lip rejected in the region of miracle.  
A key -like bone  
sometimes a piece of the lava  
lunges like a shades of green in my mouth.  
You perform my demonic vinegar  
like an arcane toucan to fresh grape.  
I saw  
how cathedrals are began  
by the lovely star.
