Behind Of Flute And Awe
-----------------------
Behind the trembling brambles. Everything oily with thick voices, the salt of the miracle  
and piles of winged bread around day. Among the muzzled curtain, many brutal conglomerates.  
In my room at twilight you are like a dove  
and your form and colour the way I dedicate them.  
Enjoy the many rigid attempts to love  
the original trapdoor.  
There is indespensable fortune in rustling it.  
Nobody here is waiting for the next writing.  
Path. You promised yourself for dedicating.
