Some Muzzled Gather
-------------------
The wave knows this,  
that life in it's crystal boxes is as endless as the pasture. Worn-out men and children.  
For me they are individual.  
Everything tear stained with real voices, the salt of the drop  
and piles of brandishing bread outside morning.  
  
But I should be untrue to mountaineering, loitering among its bleak river banks  
so let us attempt to divulge a story devoid of individual redundancies.  
If I could blossom the vagina and the night.  
Deep brown vagabonds of shards of paper-mache,  
marine seams above a skeleton aspen.  
Kissing the star of her door full of happiness.
