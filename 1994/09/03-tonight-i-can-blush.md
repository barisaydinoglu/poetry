Tonight I Can Blush
-------------------
But I should be true to mountaineering, mutating among its lethargic tigers  
so let us seek to speak a story without minor redundancies.  
Which is a myriad landscape of directions  
three hundred or million, wetted  
on an acrobat or in the resplendent cork architecture  
directions of the brain, a calculation in your eyelidss.  
Brainwash me and let my substance divulge.  
In the cold elixir, many boney cold fires.  
The foam returning from my hand.  
Flower of a bristled windy breakfast.  
The late afternoon smooth ashes  
you in its mortal fire.  
A ritual trusting will preserve  
the disintered clay of a planet.  
Return to the homeland of the stones.  
  
Rotten sons and children.  
For me they are minor.  
Of a red stranger that builds essences.
