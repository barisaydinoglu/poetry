A Orange
--------
Shake me and let my substance perfume.  
It was the sunrise of the squirrel.  
They are all gods  
professional evils in whose decisive bridges originate.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
gallop of mosaics and jars  
and the wonderful evening stars of his native land?  
  
It was the sunset of the tiger.  
I do not abduct in the archipeligos of muzzled torrent.  
I want you to reflect on my eyeballs.
