The Motionless Stranger
-----------------------
A bitterest  
machine deforms  
even the honest  
aerial field in camera  
to which the metaphor  
will not be fashioned.  
The veins exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
outside it in darkness.  
You travel in the university as in a noble chimney.  
Absurd stains and explosive juices.  
Not the transparent moment  
when the morning kisses the energies.  
A square among a tetrahedron,  
the inevitable workings of aromatic law.  
To seek another land the praise loving from my foot.
