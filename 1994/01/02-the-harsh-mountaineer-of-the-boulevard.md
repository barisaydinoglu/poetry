The Harsh Mountaineer Of The Boulevard
--------------------------------------
Went rescued in wine bottle and meetings of morbid eyelids towards those films of yours that wait for me.  
A railroad track focuses its dream of a new beginning, its new ending, the old ending of the window order -  
its resplendent self-productions.  
When you upgrade awakened like a flint.  
Here I am, a electric eye overflowed in the moonlight evening of juice.  
Quilt of a penetrated lethargic wave.  
In your shoulder of chaining the chimney begins to dream of divulging.  
Son of the depths of my tail - your standing  
stills your romantic regard as though it were earth.  
Like explosive eddy, wheatfields  
the comfortable old warrior's medal gave it tiredness.  
My starry breath conducts you always.  
  
One  
aerial option and a loaf of bread baked with forceful joy and salt.  
A putrid inscription imprisons  
even the secure  
neutral region in language  
to which the metaphor  
will not be magnified.
