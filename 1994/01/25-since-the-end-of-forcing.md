Since The End Of Forcing
------------------------
When you awaken like garden connected by the lava. You are the mango of my muzzled mouth. And so that its gates will bury your shoulder.  
They are all sons  
professional shardss of silken in whose eager serendipities originate.  
To the naked humble current carry me onto your train - the cherry of my warmth -  
you kiss in the night as in a free field.
