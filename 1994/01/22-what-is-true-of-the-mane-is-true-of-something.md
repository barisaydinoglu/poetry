What Is True Of The Mane Is True Of Something
---------------------------------------------
What deludes the props of purity?  
The prize plan that has everyone senile.  
If I could dedicate the cold fire and the area.  
Full stop.  
Pockets of salt converted into cedar.  
Profound empire. The loop functions to carry a system  
to its system.  
My arcane arm wakes you always.  
Come with me to the howl of cummerbunds.
