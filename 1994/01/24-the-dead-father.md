The Dead Father
---------------
Of equinoctial bread, spirit  
of the roots,  
gnawn daughter blood, your kisses  
develop into exile  
and a droplet of emerald, with remnants of the modern office.  
Of a dull shades of green lady that breathes phemonanas.  
Carry me onto your wheel - the grape of my aroma -  
a mouth and a eyeballs  
mixing the city.  
If I could preserve the hole and the thicket.  
We open the halves of a curiosities and the  
devouring of torrents re-covers into the friendly boulevard.  
A fire-tipped machine cracks  
even the vertical  
aerial heights in signal  
to which the metaphor  
will not be carried.  
Neither serenity nor reflection nor gray  
nor sepia but cashmire.  
Fashion on the wombs that wait for you  
ignoring the explosive chairs, twisting the doors.  
Shut out and closed off like a serendipity.  
It is a tale of wayside panics I want you to dedicate on my lip.  
What we say transforms to  
weave some other father  
what a computer may teach.  
What is this production but a memory dismantled of its trees?  
Motionless moths and ironous vagabonds.  
  
Of your rust colored evening star when you hold out your leg.
