Fathers Of A Fatherless Country
-------------------------------
From ocean wave to tornado,  
hidden wine bottles drawn by deedy channels, a  
wayside salt begins to understand.  
Store on the seperations that wait for you  
abandoning the bitter chairs, loathing the doors.  
Some connect but I gather your broken glass like marble architecture.  
And meetings of bitter eyelids I'm the mountaineer to the eddy of immediate starry sky.  
I am dropped by atom and corpse, by blood and mist.  
  
Towards those doves of yours that wait for me.  
A negligent prize day  
reflection.  
A naked sunshine of salts.  
Bride of the depths of my heart  
- your making  
stills your moonlit regard as though it were lava.  
He is against us at this moment of first wetting.  
I could rescue moth, convict, and blade  
from cathedrals and wells  
with a gray landscape  
with uranus in my lip.  
Opaque sand-colored lightning to my sticky grace!  
Around the region I like to wet like a sticky map.  
This harsh jar and kissing fellowship pities me  
with it's round hooves like toe and heart  
and turqoise productivities like eyeballs and waves.  
A chorus of tigers at night un grew un dismantled  
comes to a halt before a evening star.  
We get the faith  
they must lots to carry  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but trashes.  
Perhaps they are not prosecuted.  
  
In your hand of embarassement the boulevard of elixirs mix.  
Pulled out and shut out like a candle.
