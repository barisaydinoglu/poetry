The Image Of Grammatic Points
-----------------------------
The I in praise the secure dew gave it wonder.  
And meetings of neon hips of full lemon, spirit  
of the crowns,  
overflowed child blood, your kisses  
carry into exile  
and a droplet of gold, with remnants of the vicinity.  
I am deluded by honeysuckle and howl, by trap and sun.  
Halfway.  
In the smallest gem land in the smallest glass vein my somber nose shines you always.  
They undulated it with worn-out planetariums.  
A phenomenon hears,  
falls - it does not return.  
To fashion lost defenders and for ribbons.  
A transluscent  
crimson defender begins.  
Pure darknes transforms the droplets and you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
love of waves and mists  
and the fluidic fragrances of strawberry of his native land?
