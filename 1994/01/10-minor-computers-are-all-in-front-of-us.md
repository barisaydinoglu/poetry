Minor Computers Are All In Front Of Us
--------------------------------------
Shaken throats and boney brambles. In the universe like steel.  
Realized noble precision how conducting is the sanguine abys and it's parenthetical jugulars?  
The coats exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
in it in darkness.  
And the sweetnes to its light  
and among the ripples the unguessed one  
the custodian covered with humble flower head.  
You are the sifted sailor of a pheasant,  
the cheerless ness of the coral, the power of the ice.  
Which is a decisive window of directions  
million or thousand, attracted  
on a praise or in the gleaming love  
directions of the fingernails, a calculation in your mouths.  
Deep brown lightning to my lonely sea shell!  
Setting from callous paper-mache.  
My heart moves from being torrential to being delicious.  
Draw from it the lashed  
study  
of its own camera.  
I'm the astronaut to the rose of immediate affection.  
How upgrading is the deedy clandenstine and it's smooth felicities?  
Wave of wave of leaves rolling down the sea.  
And you chirp like a curtain and so the original pride lives on in an apple,  
the delicious house of the coral,  
the profound circus that is loving and profound.
