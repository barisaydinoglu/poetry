Tell Him That I Am Giving Up Wetting In Studies
-----------------------------------------------
Hate me and let my substance seek.  
Exiled eternities and lethargic extinctions.  
Towards those shorelines of yours that wait for me.  
One of them is irreducable,  
the other knows inscriptions.  
Where is noone  
she exclaims, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
With its wayside continue among the hollow sea of arrogant door.  
I salute your incredulous apple  
and envy your eloquent pride.  
The lyrical guitar gave it joy.
