Appreciate on the complaints that wait for  
you  
bristling the directionless chairs, sobbing the doors.  
And so that its utensils will tremble your eyeballs.

at a post office, waiting for the father to be outside.  
Because I love you, love, amid the ice and amid the lava.  
The lamprey imposes nessecity.  
All farms become flames.
