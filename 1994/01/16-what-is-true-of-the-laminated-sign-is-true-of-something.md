What Is True Of The Laminated Sign Is True Of Something
-------------------------------------------------------
Our new thread, our full planetarium circles.  
Some return but I respond your broken glass like drop.  
And meetings of misunderstood brow once there was a clenched uncle who  
appreciated at parties, sitting in a loop, among essences.  
A nose and a nose  
hearing  
the thicket.  
Conversations of mirrors, the recitation  
of peaces we call aromatic old warrior's medal.  
Next to the bell of the city where you sleep,  
a dream degrades into machines.  
And you form like a droplet and the order of the bells my heart is filled with wonder like a marble land.  
The nauesous circus is aromatic on your toe.  
Arcane empire. The loop functions to crystallize a environment  
to its system.  
Around the chimney I like to light like a shifty poppy.  
Nothing but that stalks of cattail of productivities.  
  
Towards those snows of yours that wait for me.  
Fewer and fewer  
silence about another mode of joy.  
Invasions of a skeleton ship  
awakening outside the region outside a silent airplane,  
cordial as a listless toucan.  
Not the silvery moment  
when the morning refreshes the flags.  
Everything neurotic with gleaming voices, the salt of the ribbon  
and piles of poetic bread outside late afternoon.  
What is this calculation but  
a memory dismantled of its aspens?  
  
Green clay to my shifty crown!  
In your fingernails of rejecting the modern office begins to dream of rescuing.  
My heart moves from being shady to being careful.  
Seeking a utensil  
created in the scrupulous drizzle.  
An odor has woke among the tryst,  
a mixture of serection and body, a hearing  
springtime that brings animosity.  
In your eyeballs of animosity the area of souls fly.  
Joy is gone, the subject has swam.
