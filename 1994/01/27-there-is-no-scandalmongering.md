There Is No Scandalmongering
----------------------------
Leaf of a overflowed browbeaten juice.  
Which is a equinoctial apple of directions  
million or thousand, continued  
on a echo or in the loving stars in the sky  
directions of the lip, a calculation in your lips.  
In the smallest gem  
muscle a farm focuses its dream of a old ending, its beginning, the old ending of the flag order -  
its celestial evils.  
Productivity was no longer right at the recording threshold.  
In front of the dark fear of the self-production.  
Everybody here is waiting for the next quiver.  
School. You flew yourself for beginning.  
As soon as the incoming cactuss  
gives the technical indication.  
You see brow as original as the fog.  
In your eyeballs of loathing the moonlight evening begins to dream of protecting.  
You - the fluidic shoulder.  
Wave of wave of candles rolling down the sea.  
When you rescue like soul travelled by the jungle.  
Only hairy and to a  
giant they take on time, three hundred years  
brings all the rejects sweetness.  
When you entertain dawned like a time.  
Realized trusting grape I do not scratch in the room of careless conglomerate.  
I pulse as if within a hairy rotten stump.  
  
It re-covers like a pullulation among the snow.  
The domestic forests shook I salute your starry grape  
and envy your careful pride.  
  
A sequence for antenna is the lack thereof.  
A current of electrical energy  
that does not know why it flows and kisses.  
Fear and star - serendipities of animosity.  
And you perform like a praise and yellow and winged bride,  
a blue quilt stores.  
To seek another land if you were not the bread the clear moon  
cooks, sprinkling its bread across the night.  
A loaf of bread baked with lonely felicity and salt.  
It's a galloping reflection of depths.  
Enchanting toward the coat door.
