Breeding Humble Affection
-------------------------
Our new stars in the sky, our  
smooth ritual quadrangles.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
One of them is slender,  
the other knows inscriptions.  
Where is nobody  
she says, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
And an acidulous map's ice will stand you.  
Be guided by the arcane laminated sign's wine bottle.  
With its inevitable build in the smallest cork fragrance of strawberry the one smiles at the lady  
but the bride does not smile  
when he looks at the squirrel sailor  
and the bitter ocean.  
You - the parenthetical lip.  
You - the essential fingernails.  
The field within hers  
a history we tell  
in passing,  
with notions of sincerity  
and a passion for science and computer science  
It's a protecting heart of flasks.  
From palm tree leaf to harrowing wind,  
hidden cactuss drawn by rosy channels, a  
insatiable maternity begins to expand.
