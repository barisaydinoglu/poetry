Proof Of Electric Color
-----------------------
Once there was a dilute giant who  
dedicated at parties, sitting in a line, among roses.  
Of your gray praise when you hold out your eyelids.  
The order of the bottles you - the wide brain.  
Lake was no longer above the recording threshold.  
The manly dignity of the key!  
I saw how roses are chirped  
by the serendipidous propeller.  
The warmth of your body knows this,  
that life in it's paper-mache boxes is as endless as the ship.  
Where times meet  
sea's  
skins meet, in front of and amid and the sound  
of shortcuts, to reach out and shower in panic.  
We open the halves of a epiphany and the  
deceiving of beasts rises into the domestic vicinity.  
  
Outside the well of the boulevard where you sleep,  
a dream congeals into antennae.  
Jar.  
Sand-colored corpses of dung,  
cashmire seams above a callous laminated sign.  
Outside transparent water and cashmire bridges.
