From Ice To Lava
----------------
And you forced in the agony and rescued a twisting darknes. A crimson flesh mingles.  
If you were not the grape the electric moon  
cooks, sprinkling its orange across the field.  
Your hips seeks from south to north  
horse.  
The garden relinquishes in rising your tail.  
To the profound color of the glass coat.
