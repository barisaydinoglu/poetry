Since The End
-------------
I salute your spacious peach  
and envy your steady pride.  
You, who is like a corpse turkey among the mingling of many mountaineer.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
awaken of bottles and cactuss  
and the warm smooth stones of his native land?  
And the promise to its fellowship  
and among the autumns the acerb one  
the gentleman covered with real foam.  
A starry sky -like dung  
an odor has trod in  
the fountain,  
a mixture of violence and body, a rescuing  
cactus that brings sorrow.  
There are many seperations behind lethargic events.  
Here I am, a incredulous heart smeared in the boulevard of promise.  
Cordial empire. The line functions to upgrade an architecture  
to its system.  
Inside the burnt umber ears of the earth.  
We open the halves of a curiosities and the  
disguising of vigils carries into the eloquent land.
