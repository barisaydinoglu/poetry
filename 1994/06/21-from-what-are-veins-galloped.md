From What Are Veins Galloped
----------------------------
As soon as the incoming praises  
gives the aerial indication.  
It is a tale of morbid gates a cathedral focuses its dream of a beginning, its new beginning, the old ending of the land order -  
its soft nights.  
A communist identity conquers  
even the trusting  
overtone divisions in point of view  
to which the metaphor  
will not be loved.  
Pockets of aluminum converted into glass.
