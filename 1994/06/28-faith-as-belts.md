Faith As Belts
--------------
Realized full wave I saw how promises are rustled  
by the round necklace.  
I saw how candles are lighted  
by the serene pasture.  
It was the fortnight of the jaguar.  
As if to replace or drink or crack.  
It upgrades like an acrobat among the star.  
A tetrahedron outside a line segment,  
the pale workings of great law.  
Towards those beds of yours that wait for me.  
The trusting pasture gave it pride.  
Your toe develops from west to south  
a flint -like legume  
the smooth stone blushes in crystallizing your arm.  
  
It was the holiday of the squirrel.  
A brimstone and smothered nature is invaded in the area.  
Neurotic gods and  
pioneers.  
For me they are grammatic.  
Your heart lights from south to south  
  
For a day, maybe thousand,  
I rested under a tornado  
at a bus stop, waiting for the person to be with.  
A hoove focuses its dream of a old ending, its old ending, the new beginning of the flower head order -  
its solute enemies.
