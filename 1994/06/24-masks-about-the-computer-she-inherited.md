Masks About The Computer She Inherited
--------------------------------------
So the myriad  
pride lives on in a grape,  
the aquatic house of the hat,  
the lovely quiver that is changeless and deedy.  
You flow my inaccessible abberation  
like a fresh  
cat to fresh apple.  
A silvery telegraph loves.  
Carry me onto your boat - the grape of my horse -  
In the transluscent  
cinnamon lip of the wind.  
The pure  
dignity of the branch!  
Towards those guitars of yours that wait for me.  
Inside the ghostly farm, many careless dominions.  
Your ribbon is a starry sky filled with obscene banner.  
  
Our new sphere, our essential sphere circles.  
I could perform dust, complaint, and shrapnel  
from starss in the sky and maps  
with a blood colored evening star  
with howls in my brow.  
I stayed flowed and yellow  
among the night.  
The tear stained cluster is winged on your leg.
