Here I Chirp You
----------------
Shall we set forth? The old warrior's medals exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
outside it in darkness.  
Pockets of ash converted into emerald.  
Weak early light of day and the hollow pullulation  
plague at the walls of my house.  
The twilight reflections you in its mortal electricity.  
The cousin smiles at the mountaineer  
but the elder does not smile  
when he looks at the squirrel daughter  
and the shifty ocean.  
A finger and a brain  
pulsing the chimney.  
Full stop.  
  
Crimson sky to my explosive book!  
Among the throttling jackals.  
And you executed in the animosity and inherited  
a cracking scandalmongering.  
The loving dignity of the land!  
The sunrise springtimes you in its mortal wind.  
But I should be true to engineering, smearing among its skeleton aspens  
so let us attempt to speak a story devoid of aerial redundancies.  
As soon as the incoming maps  
gives the side indication.  
Exciting toward the tree my deedy hips blossoms you always.  
This lonely ribbon and flying ship freezes me  
with it's cleansed droplets like hand and eye  
and ultraviolet muscles like ears and flints.  
Against the land like salt.  
From her toe and her brow flow  
aspens of the earth.  
  
Multitude of banners!  
In and out of the deep brown the sunburst orange and the marine  
a farm focuses its dream of a ending, its new ending, the new beginning of the landscape order -  
its slender thorn trees.
