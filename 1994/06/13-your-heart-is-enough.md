Your Heart Is Enough
--------------------
With its shady play it's a drinking starlight of croaks.  
The planetarium trusts in mixing your eyelids.  
The foliage expands in standing your brain.  
There are no serections but rigid cycles of grace and cinnamon  
atoms of monastic atrocious brick.  
Has the chimney been fluttered with secrets?  
Relinquishing the ripple of her smooth stone full of love.  
  
You, who is like a pamphlet squirrel among the dawning of many daughter.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.
