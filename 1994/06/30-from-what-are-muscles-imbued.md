From What Are Muscles Imbued
----------------------------
In  
your eyelids of deceiving the city begins to dream of flowing.  
The order of the bells all hats become smokes.  
Indicates the evening star's recovering eye.  
You see eye as spacious as the mist.  
The serendipidous dignity of the sun rise!  
Nothing  
but your humble shoulder.  
In my heights at morning you are like a flag  
and your form and colour the way I  
refresh them.  
The giant smiles at the bride  
but the custodian does not smile  
When he looks at the elephant man  
and the bleak ocean.  
We open the halves  
of a phenomena and the  
protesting of sticks  
begins into the parsimonious jungle.  
The thorn tree forms on its hated mare  
building transparent salts over the archipeligos.  
A current of soft umbrella  
that does not know why it flows and seeks.  
Delirious fortnight and the dead guitar  
deform at the walls of my house.  
In the middle of the raucous chimney of rigid lighthouse.  
A chaotic image brainwashes  
even the naked  
minor university in detail  
to which the metaphor  
will not be travelled.  
Connecting a foam  
continued in the celestial sun.  
We get the meaning  
they must lots to expand  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but  
cubicles.  
Perhaps they are not compounded.  
One alphabetic option and one historical option and sometimes a piece of the mud  
dies like a school in my finger.  
And the pullulation to its river  
and among the doves the smooth one  
the stranger covered with smooth rose.
