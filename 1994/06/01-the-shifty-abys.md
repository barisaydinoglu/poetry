The Shifty Abys
---------------
To re-cover lost horses and for railroad tracks.  
I could play cadaver, belt, and serection  
from angels and veins  
with a rust colored form  
with massacres in my brain.  
All landscapes become legumes.  
Our new aroma, our naked flower head loops.  
They deluded it with phosphorus momenta.  
Silence.  
It is a tale of clotting lampreys of a red gentleman that carries shadess of burnt umber.  
The demonic banner is enchanting on your hips.  
Understood and then excited in the area.
