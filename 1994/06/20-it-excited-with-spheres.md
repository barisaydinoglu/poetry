It Excited With Spheres
-----------------------
Morbid granules and boney circumstances.  
Of your gray precision when you hold out your arm.  
Crimson and decisive lady, the dew knows this,  
that life in it's glass boxes is as endless as the serendipity.  
Your kis is a land filled with thirsty writing.  
My heart is filled with honor like a bolt of ceramic coral.  
What brainwashes the props of love?  
The sun rise knows this,  
that life in it's ivory boxes is as endless as the poppy.  
What pampers the props of purity?  
  
Spoiled eternities and difficult utensils.  
One of them is hopeful,  
the other knows phenomena.  
Where is noone  
he says, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?
