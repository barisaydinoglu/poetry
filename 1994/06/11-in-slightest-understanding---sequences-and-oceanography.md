In Slightest Understanding - Sequences And Oceanography
-------------------------------------------------------
They are all astronauts  
professional phlegms in whose irreducable hooves originate.  
Everything oily with stationary voices, the salt of the sea shell  
and piles of brandishing bread next to morning.  
With the cashmire brow of the water.  
The stars in the sky discovers in rising your finger.  
Wave of wave of affections rolling down the sea.  
Crimson jungle to my troubled grace!  
For a day, maybe million,  
I rested under a tornado  
at a office cubicle, waiting for  
the bride to be inside.
