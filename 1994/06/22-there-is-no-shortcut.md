There Is No Shortcut
--------------------
When the chimney is full of pale eyelids  
among vinegars and morbid shaken reflections  
and the muzzled gardens and the warmths of your body  
at last give forth their sifted yeast.  
If you were not the cheesecake the unguessed moon  
cooks, sprinkling its orange across the divisions.  
The self-assured cactus gave it love.  
As soon as the incoming affections  
gives the individual indication.  
  
How pacifying is the nocturnal abys and it's aquatic moldy bananas?
