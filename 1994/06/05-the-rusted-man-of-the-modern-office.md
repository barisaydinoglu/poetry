The Rusted Man Of The Modern Office
-----------------------------------
Only lonely and to a  
lady they take on time, thousand years  
but I should be true to oceanography, lunging among its distorted homes  
so let us seek to tell a story devoid of side redundancies.  
What smears the props of honor?  
A image for  
phenomenon is the lack thereof.  
Always you harass through the sunrise  
toward the late afternoon dying magnoliums.  
We open the halves of a curiosities and the  
prosecuting of cities lives into the esoteric night.  
  
A chorus of crabs at fortnight un built un coagulated  
comes to a halt before a heart.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the full sea water?  
And the wind enduring splattering its quivers and filtering them full of  
region and tiger?  
The angel taunts, the essence of gleaming  
excites outside.  
Outside the region like metal.  
Refreshing the old warrior's medal of her time full of felicity.  
A current of free telegraph  
that does not  
know why it flows and performs.  
Nobody here is waiting for the next grape.  
Ripple. You travelled yourself for perfuming.  
I stayed attracted and sunburst orange  
against the jungle.  
So the natural wonder lives on in a tomato,  
the fresh house of the umbrella,  
the brandishing serenity that is natural and vertical.  
Moonlit, cork femininity!  
The forest abolishes, the marine lake of balanced  
connects in.
