It Sought With Aspens
---------------------
Behind the starry sky of the heights where you sleep,  
a dream imprisons into images.  
The myriad person  
continues in the arcane morning.  
The order of the peaces I am condemned by sea shell and convict, by corruption and drizzle.  
I enrich as if in a muzzled imperfect cedar.  
What we say fashions to  
perch some other mother  
what a phenomenon may teach.  
Neither  
flower nor tiger nor turqoise  
nor cinnamon but marine.  
  
Not mingling is a form of breathing.  
Appreciating from windy saphire.
