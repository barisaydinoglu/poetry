Meeting Your Belt
-----------------
A necklace focuses its dream of a new ending, its old ending, the new beginning of the window order -  
its original  
uranus.  
Not to blush or even meet  
the bridge of one who lives  
under me in a vicinity or returning to a man.  
My heart moves from being bleak to being celestial.  
What is this camera but a memory mutated of its spheres?  
Fewer and fewer  
falter about another mode of happiness.  
A warmth of your body focuses its dream of a new ending, its beginning, the old ending of the fellowship order -  
its wide invasions.
