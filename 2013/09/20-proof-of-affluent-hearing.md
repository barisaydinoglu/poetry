Proof Of Affluent Hearing
-------------------------
Has the heights been loved with secrets?  
In my chimney at morning you are like a ship  
and your form and colour the way I breathe them.  
Shall we move on?  
Once there was a callous one who  
connected at parties, sitting in a triangle, among currents.  
The elixir expands in refreshing your heart.  
Neither mirror nor sphere nor blood colored  
nor  
opaque yellow but sepia.  
Pale lampreys and wounded extinctions.  
Has the vicinity been galloped with phenomena?  
From her eye and her toe perfume  
Pastures of the earth.  
A cinnamon path relaxes.  
The divisions amid hers  
a history we tell in passing,  
with notions of sincerity  
and a passion for computer science and mountaineering  
What cracks the props of sincerity?  
I saw how horses are relaxed  
by the silent banner.  
I was without doubt the father crab  
there in the careless field.  
When it looked me with its round farm eyes  
it had neither ears nor brain  
but gold productivities on its sides.  
  
As soon as the incoming mirrors  
gives the public indication.  
A study for projection is the lack thereof.
