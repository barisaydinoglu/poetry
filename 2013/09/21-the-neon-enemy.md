The Neon Enemy
--------------
And so that its stalactites will pamper your hand.  
And a obscene perfume's earth will chirp you.  
I saw how warmths of your body are upgraded  
by the warm land.  
I salute your perfect grape  
and envy your silent  
pride.  
A language for detail is the lack thereof.  
In my modern office at sunset you are like a energy  
and your form and colour the way I dawn them.  
  
How perfuming is the enchanting mask and it's delicious hounds?  
Lighthouse was no longer right at the transmission threshold.  
I took on disintered suns.  
Fluttering from dilute silicon.  
Honor is gone, the subject has recovered.  
You say, what is the dew waiting for in its burnt umber knave?  
I tell you it is waiting for grace like you.  
Amid the stealing granules.  
You've asked me what the iguana is weaving there with his burnt umber heart?  
I reply, the law knows this.
