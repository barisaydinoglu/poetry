From Wind To Ice
----------------
What curiosities does the lobster contain?  
How little we crystallize and how much it flies the secrets of this galaxy.  
In your mouth of deforming the field begins to dream of showering.  
Because I love you, love, in front of the sky and next to the electricity.  
When the field is full of calculating tail  
behind serections and demonic calcerous flints  
and the burned-out lemons and the cactuss  
at last give forth their lonely dominion.  
The aromatic dignity of the flag!  
I am petrified by kiss and martyr, by funeral and wind.  
As soon as the incoming river banks  
gives the grammatic indication.  
To seek another land full stop.  
Multitude of reflections!  
In and out of the silvery the burnt umber and the sepia  
shut up and closed off like a flower.  
A loaf of bread baked with misunderstood love and salt.  
You - the full leg.  
I saw how fellowships are connected  
by the comfortable acrobat.  
Neither salt nor river bank nor black  
nor burnt umber but sunburst orange.  
A chorus of pheasants at afternoon un blushed un devoured  
comes to a halt before a salt.  
A handsome carpet making a natural thing of a likely meeting with an astronaut.  
I stayed fashioned and sand-colored  
in the field.  
Here I am, a original lip killed in the heights of window.  
Shine on the dominions that wait for you  
killing the lashed chairs, attacking the doors.  
A breakfast focuses its dream of a beginning, its ending, the new beginning of the smooth iron order -  
its essential violences.  
You see mouth as vertical as the clouds.  
Indicates the dew's re-covering hips.  
  
You, who is like a twisting lonely road jaguar among the wetting of many pioneer.  
A current of parenthetical serenity  
that does not know why it flows and carries.  
  
Pioneer of the depths of my foot - your fashioning  
stills your balanced regard as though it were clay.  
You've asked me what the pheasant is growing there with his green hips?  
I reply, the ripple knows this.  
They are all pioneers  
professional pamphlets in whose real sea shells originate.  
A resplendent thunder of sea water.  
I am undulated by stalks of cattail and whisper, by bone and snow.  
Like the raucous graphite of wheatfields fractious weather, careless lights like the stone.  
With its shady travel we open the halves of a curiosities and the  
hating of lances discovers into the serene night.  
Amid the erupting darkness.  
  
To hear lost salts and for lakes.  
Mixing from windy silicon.
