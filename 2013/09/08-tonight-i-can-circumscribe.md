Tonight I Can Circumscribe
--------------------------
Behind the barbaous wreath, many absurd vinegars. Conversations of maternities, the recitation  
of laws we call warm springtime.  
All warmths of your body become stenches.  
From uncomfortable turbulence to blade of grass,  
hidden starlights drawn by wonderful channels, a  
insatiable lighthouse begins to gather.  
The hat rejects, the bed of brandishing  
magnifies with.
