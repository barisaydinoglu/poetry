What Is True Of The Fragrance Of Strawberry Is True Of Something
----------------------------------------------------------------
You say, what is the atom waiting for in its transparent wreath?  
I tell you it is waiting for smooth stone like you.  
In my archipeligos at afternoon you are like a shoreline  
and your form and colour the way I refresh them.  
  
Re-covering  
from crooked silk.  
The hated grape is sweet-smelling on your mouth.  
  
Not to inherit or even meet  
the kis of one who transforms  
under me in a land or transforming to a bride.  
With the ignoring  
moths.
