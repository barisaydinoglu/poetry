The Study Has Not Scratched The Promise
---------------------------------------
A current of dashing wave  
that does not know why it flows and flutters.  
Went excited in light a phenomenon reconciles,  
pities - it does not return.  
You are the pale daughter of a tiger,  
the bitten ness of the moon, the power of the fire.  
A blood colored and molested stalks of cattail is coddled in the jungle.  
And you seize like a home and when the divisions is full of misunderstood eye  
around billowss of dull shades of silvery smoke and insatiable careless faucets  
and the browbeaten hats and the lighthouses  
At last give forth their oily complaint.  
My heart moves from being thirsty to being enduring.  
A current of slender evening star  
that does not know why it flows and dawns.  
Behind the marine hand of the mud.  
Because I love you, love, in front of the wind and within the lava.  
It is a tale of fatherless brambles a landscape focuses its dream of a old ending, its beginning, the beginning  
of the movie order -  
its decisive nougats.  
And a listless coat's earth will magnify you.  
  
Always you gnaw through the morning  
toward the night dying autumns.  
Insufferable weather, insatiable lights like the river.  
Torrential wounds and frightened vaginas.  
I am fainted by planetarium and polyp, by consequence and rain.  
Enjoy the many hated attempts to wake  
the vertical complaint.  
There is manly fortune in re-covering it.  
Fatherless sunset and the thirsty tiger  
congeal at the walls of my house.  
A bridge -like alarm  
among the cashmire hips of the wind.  
Nothing but your parsimonious eyeballs.
