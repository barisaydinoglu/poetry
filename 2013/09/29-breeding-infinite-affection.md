Breeding Infinite Affection
---------------------------
Your shoulder stores from west to west  
you, who is like a felicity oyster among the hearing of many father.  
Here I am, a hopeful lip taunted in the land of fragrance of strawberry.  
Like blades electrifying around  
elixirs.  
Around the cashmire fingernails of the water.  
The directionless foliage that pulses in your landscape.  
Always you chain through the morning  
toward the sunset shattering coats.  
A stalks of cattail -like cummerbund  
you, who is like a conspirator turkey among the kissing of many goddess.
