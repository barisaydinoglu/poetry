The Imperalist Son Of The Night
-------------------------------
Realized starry sun rise be guided by the absorbant sea water's bed.  
You are the apple of my cold eyelids.  
And meetings of worn-out mouth they filtered it with fuming moons.  
A loaf of bread baked with careless decency and salt.  
The reasons for my respect  
are magnified in my heart of cork.  
So the scrupulous honor lives on in a fruit,  
the lyrical house of the mist,  
the cosmic  
shades of sunburst orange that is sensual and aromatic.  
You see leg as equinoctial as the sun.  
You tread in the heights as in a hidden modern office.
