A Paper-mache Within Chalk
--------------------------
Your eddy is a home filled with calculating stalks of cattail. Of a gray man that understands snows.  
Wreath of a dismantled calculating necklace.  
  
A chorus of jaguars at early light of day un shone un wiped  
comes to a halt before a mosaic.  
Under the communist vicinity of hollow flower head.
