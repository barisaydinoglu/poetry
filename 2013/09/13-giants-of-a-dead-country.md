Giants Of A Dead Country
------------------------
I wish to make a line  
next to, and every feeling, many  
times hidden in a mosaic.  
Not to flutter or even meet  
the curtain of one who blossoms  
outside me in a boulevard or divulging to an aunt.  
Burnt umber dusts of martyr,  
deep brown seams above a smothered defender.  
All alcoves become waxes.  
  
A curves and a ears  
storing the land.  
When you pulse like window travelled by the earth.  
Of a dark stranger that imbues warmths.  
Among the boney land of directionless apple.
