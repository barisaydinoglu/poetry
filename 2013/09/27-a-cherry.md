A Cherry
--------
Which is an aquatic miracle of directions  
thousand or too many to count, carried  
on a smooth brick or in  
the serene snow  
directions of the tail, a calculation in your earss.  
Return to the homeland of the autumns.  
They are all uncles  
professional jugulars in whose fluidic currents originate. The order of the essences neither praise nor umbrella  
nor dull shades of burnt umber  
nor transparent but opaque sepia.  
Draw from it the arrogant  
antenna of its own point  
of view.
