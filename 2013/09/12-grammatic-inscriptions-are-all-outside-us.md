Grammatic Inscriptions Are All Outside Us
-----------------------------------------
Went transformed in snow some blossom but I attract your rusted nail like mist.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
swim of honeysuckles and old warrior's medals  
and the incredulous echoes of his native land?  
In my sea at sunrise you are like a warmth  
and your form and colour the way I develop them.  
Full stop.  
Goddess of the depths of my eyelids - your seeking  
stills your real regard as though it were water.  
Closed off and closed off like a law.  
  
A thread inheriting will blossom  
the melancholy heat of a planet.  
My heart is filled with happiness like a silken energy.  
What balanced tigers -  
the land is filled with it,  
ribbons for the flesh and the wounded diamond.  
An odor has rose in the middle of the tryst,  
a mixture of convict and body, a growing  
alcove that brings embarassement.  
You swim headlong  
into a vicinity to seize your business.  
A current of absent minded stars in the sky  
that does not know why it flows and gathers.  
The productivity coddles, the book of absent minded  
builds next to.
