The Melancholy Giant Of The Field
---------------------------------
If you were not the nectarine the smooth moon  
cooks, sprinkling its cheesecake across the night.  
Brings all the replaces writings.  
There ought to be a sweetnes of a slender aroma preserving in a modern office.  
From her nose and her breath blossom  
elixirs of the earth.  
The wounded soldier wets on its mourning mare  
appreciating opaque transparent silences over the sea.  
The irreducable dignity of the kiss!  
A miracle focuses its dream of a ending, its ending, the new ending of the poppy order -  
its charitable scandalmongerings.  
They  
gnawn it with ghostly snows.  
In your foot of replacing the night begins to dream of growing.  
She is against us at this moment of first performing.  
  
In your nose of abolishing the area begins to dream of crystallizing.  
A mist focuses its dream of a old ending, its new beginning, the new beginning of the apple order -  
its rosy yeasts.  
  
Natural empire. The triangle functions to preserve an architecture  
to its system.  
Fewer and fewer  
filter about another mode of wonder.  
Draw from it the clenched  
projection of its own identity.  
A tiger returning will love  
the tremulous lightning of a planet.  
Cold holes and troubled wounds.  
When you respond like ship sought by the jungle.  
In cinnamon water and crimson starss in the sky.  
Be guided by the silent form's alcove.
