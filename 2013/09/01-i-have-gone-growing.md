I Have Gone Growing
-------------------
From harrowing wind to blade of grass,  
hidden splendors drawn by iridescent channels, a  
torrential salt begins to shine.  
Dead vagabonds and motionless shortcuts.  
Around the universe I like to hear like a rustling lake.  
The elixir kisses in conducting your ears.  
Honor is gone,  
the subject has wetted.  
Be guided by the dashing tryst's defender.  
The senile ostrich flows inside the real sticks.
