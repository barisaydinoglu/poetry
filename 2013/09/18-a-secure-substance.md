A Secure Substance
------------------
To form lost salts and for films.  
A chorus of tigers at lunchtime un set un fell  
comes to a halt before a cactus.  
Of your brimstone flint when you hold out your arm.  
Draw from it the exiled  
machine of its own study.  
Once there was a browbeaten cousin who  
pacified at parties, sitting in a loop, among warmths.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.
