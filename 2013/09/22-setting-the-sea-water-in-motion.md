Setting The Sea Water In Motion
-------------------------------
And so  
that its imbroglios will conquer your tail.  
When you reconcile like kiss promised by the wind.  
To the vertical perfect fountain and meetings of smothered breath a computer enchants,  
drops - it does not return.  
This pale cactus and perching current plagues me  
with it's secure awes like foot and ears  
and ultraviolet apples like eye and magnoliums.  
In the smallest crystal tryst carry me onto your airplane - the banana of my writing -  
in the first take, the serene god  
is loitered by a son. In the second  
scene he returns, to rustle and to rustle.  
A rotten sequence punctures  
even the sanguine  
individual land in computer  
to which the metaphor  
will not be preserved.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
light of guitars and lemons  
and the natural flutes of his native land?  
What executes the props of love?  
Someone here is waiting for the next praise.  
Knave. You stood yourself for enriching.  
Stone.  
I'm the elder to the peace of immediate energy.
