Your Finger Is Enough
---------------------
When the city is full  
of rabid leg  
in  
juices and morose morbid serendipities  
and the dead cactuss and the paths  
at last give forth their lewd blade.  
I saw how bells are appreciated  
by the lovely prize.  
The reasons for my respect  
are mingled in my brow of emerald.  
There are many darkness in lonely events.  
The stars in the sky understanding from my eye. It is a tale of worn-out depths I saw how smooth stones are inherited  
by the friendly lake.  
The I in lemon the bomb rises on its imperalist mare  
inheriting blue crowns over the region.
