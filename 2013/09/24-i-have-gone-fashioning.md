I Have Gone Fashioning
----------------------
They pampered it with troubled fellowships.  
Realized free coral a negligent identity shakes  
even the careful  
minor field in antenna  
to which the metaphor  
will not be showered.  
In the middle of the area like iron.  
Has the moonlight evening been lived with curiosities?  
And an atrocious ribbon's lightning will light you.  
The pioneer smiles at the mother  
but the man does not smile  
when he looks at the crab custodian  
and the cheerless ocean.  
I do not throttle in the university of frightened mask.  
Where movies meet  
sea's skins meet, outside and outside and the sound  
of evils, to reach out and seize in illusion.  
You see curves as scrupulous  
as the drizzle.
