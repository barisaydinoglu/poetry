What Is True Of The Saxophone Is True Of Everything
---------------------------------------------------
Relinquishing the poppy of her utensil full of joy.  
Nothing but that aspen of ribbons.  
Burnt umber and scrupulous goddess,  
a cashmire foliage grows.  
I could continue circumstance, conglomerate, and phlegm  
from praises and honeysuckles  
with a black saxophone  
with clandenstines in my arm.  
Around the land I like to hear like a lewd starlight.  
In your arm of penetrating the jungle begins to dream of conducting.
