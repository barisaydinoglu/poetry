A Banana
--------
And meetings of communist finger a curtain focuses its dream of a new beginning, its new ending, the beginning of the mane order -  
its cordial wombs.  
Pure self-production rejoices the wells to seek another land neither wheatfield nor pasture nor rust  
colored  
nor marine but yellow.  
Conversations of bottles, the recitation  
of roots we call vertical leaf.  
Shut up and closed off like a femininity.  
For a day, maybe thousand,  
I rested under a pillow of fog  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the custodian to be behind.  
Always you pamper through the midnight  
toward the night replacing silences.  
And meetings of rambunctious eyelids a clouds of railroad tracks and you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
weave of farms and energies  
and the loving love of his native land?
