The Phenomenon Of Side Points
-----------------------------
Rambunctious weather, bruised lights like the ripple.  
There ought to be a flute of a cosmic horse reflecting in a night.  
Return  
to the homeland  
of the foliages.  
I could rustle violence, serection, and stench  
from fellowships and trees  
with a brimstone kis  
with bloodied graphites in my lip.
