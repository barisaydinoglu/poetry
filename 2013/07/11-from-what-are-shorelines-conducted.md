From What Are Shorelines Conducted
----------------------------------
Not entertaining is a form of breathing.  
Everything melancholy with parsimonious voices, the salt of the splendor  
and piles of lion hearted bread within sunrise.  
Only burned-out and to a  
stranger they take on time, million years  
You are the orange of my morbid heart.  
The essential dignity of the form!  
A neon image undulates  
even the full  
neutral moonlight evening in machine  
to which the metaphor  
will not be blossomed.  
  
Neither momentum  
nor evening star nor brimstone  
nor sepia but green.  
You - the round breath.
