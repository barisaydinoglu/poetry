There Is No Eternity
--------------------
And outside my hammock, during the afternoon, I woke up naked  
and full of joy. In my moonlight evening at twilight you are like a river  
and your form and colour the way I attract them.  
Return to the homeland of the foams.  
Come with me to the throat of seperations.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
When you respond loved like a echo.  
A great sun of productivities.  
As if to shake or reconcile or fall.  
You say, what is the garden waiting for in its cinnamon river?  
I tell you it is waiting for well like you.  
In the first reel, the dashing gentleman  
is invaded by a god. In the second  
scene he returns, to gallop and to excite.
