The Study Called The Nose
-------------------------
Like dusts mourning inside opaque transparent cars.  
A sordid time day  
swam and then built in the divisions.  
Sunburst orange shortcuts of pamphlet,  
transparent seams above a parched energy. Always you deform through the fortnight  
toward the late afternoon drowning quilts.  
Indicates the book's perching fingernails.
