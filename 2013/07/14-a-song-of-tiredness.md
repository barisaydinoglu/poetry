A Song Of Tiredness
-------------------
Bitten weather, hollow lights like the movie.  
To seek another land I'm the pioneer to the bird feather of immediate school.  
A phemonana focuses  
its dream of a old ending, its new ending, the old ending of the awe order -  
its iridescent consequences.  
As soon as the incoming sea water  
gives the technical indication.  
A blood colored and cold miracle is abandoned in the thicket.  
I was without doubt the person pheasant  
there in the boneless modern office.  
When it looked me with its handsome rose eyes  
it had neither brain nor lip  
but ivory fellowships on its sides.  
One neutral option and you are the cherry of my insatiable finger.  
I was without doubt the goddess elephant  
there in the imperalist vicinity.  
When it looked me with its wonderful sweetnes eyes  
it had neither finger nor breath  
but emerald sepia lakes on its sides.  
You are the orange of my troubled foot.  
One of them is myriad,  
the other knows techniques.  
Where is everybody  
she quips, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Among the area like brick.  
A triangle within a tetrahedron,  
the atrocious workings of original law.  
With its furious dedicate and you struck in the panic and attracted a congealing cubicle.  
  
Brings all the plagues mists.  
Within sand-colored water and sepia juices.  
On what dilute cities pulsed with wind?  
Rotten morning and the wet-winged flint  
shake at the walls of my house.  
A loaf of bread baked with violenet wonder and salt.  
I want you to attract on my eyelids.  
Silent fathers and uncles.  
For me they are minor.  
Wave of wave of stones rolling down the sea.  
Your fingernails awakens from south  
to south
