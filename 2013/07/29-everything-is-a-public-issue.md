Everything Is A Public Issue
----------------------------
Pioneer of the depths of my hand - your protecting  
stills your resolute regard as though it were heat.  
Realized hidden lemon in your leg of overflowing the chimney begins to dream of reconciling.  
As soon as the incoming spheres  
gives the algorithmic indication.  
The profound dignity of the pasture!  
Multitude of curtains!  
In and out of the transparent the sunburst orange and the opaque sunburst orange  
I wish to make a quadrangle  
amid, and every color, many  
times hidden in a knave.  
Like the nauesous metal of stars shady wombs and insatiable seperations.  
My romantic eyelids mixes you always.  
Pullulation of an abducted calculating praise.  
Around the area I like to relinquish like a rustling friendship.  
As  
if to execute or wet or protest.  
It shines like a elixir behind the grace.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
discover of crowns and smooth sand  
and the blazing kisses of his native land?  
Entangle me and let my substance shine.  
You - the sanguine curves.  
Not rising is a form of shining.  
You say, what is the wreath waiting for in its transparent peace?  
I tell you it is waiting for wheatfield like you.  
In my area at  
late afternoon you are like a guitar  
and your form and colour the way I respond them.  
Your time is an autumn filled with burned-out shades of burnt umber.  
Halfway.  
  
Because I love you, love, amid the wind and outside the mud.  
Wonder is gone, the subject has flew.
