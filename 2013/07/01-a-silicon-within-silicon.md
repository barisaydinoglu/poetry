A Silicon Within Silicon
------------------------
Sterile night and the frail promise  
fly at the walls of my house.  
All grapes become oblivions.  
Around the filtering noises.  
The vicinity inside hers  
a history we tell in passing,  
with notions of love  
and a passion for engineering and mountaineering  
Under the fragmented dew, many wet-winged dominions.  
And you smeared in the confusion and travelled a burying bramble.  
  
Amid transluscent cashmire water and yellow phemonanas.
