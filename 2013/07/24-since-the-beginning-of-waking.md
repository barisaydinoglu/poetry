Since The Beginning Of Waking
-----------------------------
So the careful purity lives on in a fruit,  
the blazing house of the aspen,  
the careful autumn that is decisive and real.  
Here I am, a original nose shattered in the room of maternity.  
You are the cherry of my dead leg.  
A thirsty bird feather day  
around the area I like to reflect like a thirsty branch.  
Furious sunset and the rustling soul  
crack at the walls of my house.  
Draw from it the negligent  
study of its own production.  
To the silent honest wreath return to the homeland of the sweetness.  
I am trembled by nature and trash barge, by dust and mist. I took on violenet starss in the sky.  
In my moonlight evening at twilight you are like a door  
and your form and colour the way I discover them.
