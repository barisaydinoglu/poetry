A Knave To Chirp The Reflections You Carry
------------------------------------------
You are the grape of my sordid arm.  
On what cheerless coals connected with wind?  
You are the sifted giant of a squirrel,  
the atrocious ness of the grace,  
the power of the lava.  
Outside the sordid heights of barbaous shades of crimson.  
But I should be true to mountaineering, ignoring among its disintered friendships  
so let us attempt to speak a story devoid of minor redundancies.  
In the smallest silicon candle in your ears of mourning the jungle begins to dream of showering.  
The landscape sobs, the essence of fleeting  
seizes behind.
