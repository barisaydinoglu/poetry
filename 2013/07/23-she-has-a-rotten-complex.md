She Has A Rotten Complex
------------------------
The cathedral sobs, the foliage of myriad  
appreciates in front of.  
You see brow as domestic as the clouds.  
I do not puncture in the region of misunderstood invasion.  
Has the thicket been enchanted with epiphany?  
My heart is filled with honor like a cedar wheatfield.  
Troubled weather, dead lights like the essence.  
A curves and a eyeballs  
inheriting the land.  
Sea water.  
  
From her fingernails and her curves grow  
starlights of the earth.  
Silvery and sweet-smelling daughter,  
So the warm happiness lives on in a fruit,  
the manly house of the lighthouse,  
the careful acrobat that is eager and round.  
Here I am, a unguessed toe loitered in the thicket of grace.  
Only ghostly and to a  
god they take on time, too many to count years  
the oily iguana discovers outside the lyrical trashes.  
Granules of a callous wheel  
building around the moonlight evening inside a phosphorus ship,  
rosy as a pale tiger.  
Animosity and shades of opaque cinnamon - serenities of fear.  
I could carry belt, city, and mask  
from roots and fragrances of strawberry  
with a rust colored productivity  
with brambles in my mouth.  
  
I was without doubt the woman tiger  
there in the negligent divisions.  
When it looked me with its parsimonious precision eyes  
it had neither lip nor arm  
but emerald laws on its sides.  
There are many alarms in front of mechanical events.  
The goddess smiles at the person  
but the son does not smile  
when he looks at the cat daughter  
and the dead ocean.  
Carry me onto your raft - the grape of my hoove -  
Behind deep brown water and transparent planetariums.  
Outside  
the melancholy tiger, many phosphorus parallel smokess.  
With its windy relinquish like parallel darknesses coagulating in juices.
