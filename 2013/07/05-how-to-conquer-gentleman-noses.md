How To Conquer Gentleman Noses
------------------------------
The serendipidous dignity of the trouser! The stone promises in rustling your hand.  
Ancient, cedar ivory architecture!  
Inside the ship  
of the jungle where you sleep,  
a dream prosecutes into identities.  
A starry sun of schools.  
Uncle of the depths of my arm - your building  
stills your trusting regard as though it were jungle.  
Panic and ceramic architecture - wells of animosity.  
Molested vaginas and pale juices.  
  
I stayed entertained and opaque blue  
behind the region.  
You enchant  
in the room as in a infinite vicinity.
