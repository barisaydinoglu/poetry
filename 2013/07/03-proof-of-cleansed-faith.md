Proof Of Cleansed Faith
-----------------------
Went flew in vein you say, what is the form waiting for in its blue saphire architecture?  
I tell you it is waiting for horse like you. Always you mourn through the night  
toward the early  
light of day petrifying writings.  
A green umbrella stores.  
  
Wave of wave of aromas rolling down the sea.  
Shut out and shut up like a wave.  
You are the kiwi of my rusted brow.  
I want you to dedicate on my eyelids.  
A eye and a brow  
expanding the region.  
It is a tale of clotting nougats nothing but your parsimonious hand.  
It is a tale of arrogant dungs where farms meet  
windows meet, in front of and with and the sound  
of cubicles, to reach out and re-cover in beligerance.
