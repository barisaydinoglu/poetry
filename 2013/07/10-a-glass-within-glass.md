A Glass Within Glass
--------------------
Only river bank, just the  
dove, nothing but  
it. Farm.  
Everything ghostly with sensible voices, the salt of the quilt  
and piles of friendly bread with midnight.  
When you dedicate blossomed like a sweetnes.  
I imbue as if behind a torrential stain.  
  
Outside the springtime of the region where you sleep,  
a dream plagues into antennae.  
An odor has lighted behind the wave,  
a mixture of twisting lonely road and body, a perfuming  
garden that brings beligerance.  
Neither crown nor autumn nor dull shades of transluscent deep brown  
nor burnt umber but opaque deep brown.  
And so that its salts will entangle your breath.
