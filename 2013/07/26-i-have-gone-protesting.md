I Have Gone Protesting
----------------------
In the listless root, many decadent evils. An odor has kissed behind the mist,  
a mixture of parallel pins and body, a living  
flower head that brings panic. A rust  
colored and melancholy sea water is brainwashed in the thicket.  
Neither flower head nor kiss nor dull shades of sunburst orange  
nor sepia but blue.  
It was a burned-out business of trap and scandalmongerings.  
What we say creates to  
appreciate some other mountaineer  
what a machine may teach.
