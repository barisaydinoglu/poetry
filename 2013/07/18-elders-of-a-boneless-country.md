Elders Of A Boneless Country
----------------------------
In the land like metal.  
Our new flesh, our warm door loops.  
Of your rust colored movie when you hold out your curves.  
Your propeller is an aroma filled with imperalist tiger.  
  
Careful, chalk femininity!  
Because I love you, love, with the lava and outside the earth.
