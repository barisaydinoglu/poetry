A Song Of Confusion
-------------------
The charitable ivory architecture gave it decency.  
A blood colored and fatherless dove is plagued in the land.  
I was without doubt the child oyster  
there in the putrid night.  
When it looked me with its perfect film eyes  
it had neither arm nor brain  
but saphire starss in the sky on its sides.  
Full stop.
