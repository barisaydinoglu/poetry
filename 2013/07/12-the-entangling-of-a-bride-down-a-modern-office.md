The Entangling Of A Bride Down A Modern Office
----------------------------------------------
Among the black illusion of the bramble.  
Not to fly or even meet  
the wheatfield of one who pulses  
in me in a modern office or loving to a uncle.  
There ought to be a femininity of a great film carrying in an area.  
He is behind us at this moment of first weaving.  
  
A callous technique twists  
even the delicate  
individual room in camera  
to which the metaphor  
will not be excited.
