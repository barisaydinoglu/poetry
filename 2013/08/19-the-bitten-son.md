The Bitten Son
--------------
Standing from disordered cedar.  
Come with me to the legless horse of lineages.  
Come with me to the probe of flames.  
Once there was a delirious one who  
responded at parties, sitting in a circle, among corals.  
To the aromatic parenthetical grace I do not prosecute in the city of obscene lightning.  
To pulse lost pastures and for fountains.  
Where necklaces meet  
rivers meet, outside and outside and the sound  
of lances, to reach out and perfume in agony.
