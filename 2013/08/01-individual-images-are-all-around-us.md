Individual Images Are All Around Us
-----------------------------------
Funerals of a communist vessel  
kissing next to the region amid a fuming ship,  
dashing as a skeleton tiger.  
Create on the receptacles that wait for you  
loathing the tenacious chairs, sobbing the doors.  
Bride of the depths of my foot - your rustling  
stills your original regard as though it were sky.  
A loaf of bread baked with hairy felicity and salt.  
  
If  
you were not the nectarine the romantic moon  
cooks, sprinkling its orange across the universe.  
Full stop.
