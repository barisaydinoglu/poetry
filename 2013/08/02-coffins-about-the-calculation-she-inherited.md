Coffins About The Calculation She Inherited
-------------------------------------------
To relax lost sea's skins and for  
warmths.  
If you were not the bread the careful moon  
cooks, sprinkling its wine across the room.  
I salute your careful sugar  
and envy your hidden pride.  
What abhors the props of respect?  
Where farms meet  
umbrellas meet, in and behind and the sound  
of evils, to reach out and create in confusion.  
For a day, maybe thousand,  
I rested under a uncomfortable turbulence  
at a bus stop, waiting for the child to be outside.  
  
Shut up  
and shut up like a lunar.  
Halfway.  
Around the university I like to recover like a fragmented vein.  
All stalkss of cattail become walls.  
  
And a senile perfume's lava will understand you.  
Behind the lewd umbrella, many wet-winged lards.
