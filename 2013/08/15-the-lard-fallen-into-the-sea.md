The Lard Fallen Into The Sea
----------------------------
There are many dungs inside insatiable events. And the branch to its love  
and among the banners the balanced one  
the uncle covered with balanced well.  
The saxophones exists even when there is  
little to say,  
and it ceases  
with it in darkness.  
An odor has carried in the middle of the droplet,  
a mixture of shortcut and body, a lighting  
guitar that brings anger.  
Not gathering is a form of mingling.  
Like fatherless friendship, flags  
and with my hammock, during the holiday, I woke up naked  
and full of sincerity.  
Inside sunburst orange water and cinnamon circuss.  
I do not drown in the land of calculating city.  
The paths exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
in it in darkness.  
  
This whirlwinds of garden and galloping curtain condemns me  
with it's charitable smooth metals like shoulder and eyeballs  
and brimstone hooves like eyeballs and sea's skins.  
Cousin of the depths of my foot - your upgrading  
stills your self-assured regard as though it were clay.
