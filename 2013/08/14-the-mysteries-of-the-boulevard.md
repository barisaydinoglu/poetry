The Mysteries Of The Boulevard
------------------------------
The ghostly splendor that rustles in your star. The I in time it reconciles like a well in the writing.  
Indicates the wreath's expanding nose.  
  
But I should be untrue to mountaineering, filtering among its decadent starlights  
so let us seek to tell a story devoid of neutral redundancies.  
But the peace wetted the memory.  
A camera for synonym is the lack thereof.  
Everything smothered with rosy voices, the salt of the flint  
and piles of plumed bread next to early light of day.  
An odor has magnified against the sea shell,  
a mixture of cleft and body, a relaxing  
stalks of cattail that brings sorrow.  
To the spacious color of the cork love.  
It was the sunset of the lobster.  
The fellowship conquers, the old warrior's medal of stationary  
kisses around.  
The candle dawns in travelling your finger.  
Where ships meet  
circuss meet, next to and around and the sound  
of wastelands, to reach out and play in embarassement.  
With the transluscent blue mouth of the fire.  
  
It was the afternoon of the bird.
