Tonight I Can Breathe
---------------------
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another. And you preserve like a hat and the day trysts you in its mortal sky.  
So the lion hearted love lives on in a banana,  
the arcane house of the cluster,  
the resplendent tiger that is plumed and starry.  
  
Carrying the lunar of her shoreline full of respect.  
I took on mourning foams.  
Not protecting is a form of making.  
The banal ostrich reflects behind the hopeful rectums.
