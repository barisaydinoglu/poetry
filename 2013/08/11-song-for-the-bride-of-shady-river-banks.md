Song For The Bride Of Shady River Banks
---------------------------------------
You relinquish slowly into a divisions to form your business.  
This disordered cathedral and fluttering flower drowns me  
with it's mineral souls like eyelids and eye  
and turqoise railroad tracks like heart and leaves.  
My heart is filled with wonder like a bolt of cork pasture.  
I saw how suns are lighted  
by the verdure flute.  
A vein focuses its dream of a new ending, its new beginning, the old ending of the trouser order -  
its great panics.  
Conducted and then developed in the sea.  
Sand-colored flasks of clandenstine,  
burnt umber seams above a fuming grace.  
The sea outside hers  
a story we divulge in passing,  
with notions of felicity  
and a passion for mountaineering and jouranlism  
a rambunctious inscription penetrates  
even the electric  
public modern office in signal  
to which the metaphor  
will not be crystallized.  
  
A vessel is not enough to shatter me and keep me  
from the city of your absent minded funny things.  
Some mingle but I dedicate your ash like circus.
