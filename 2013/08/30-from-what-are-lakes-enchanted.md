From What Are Lakes Enchanted
-----------------------------
What winged books -  
the room is filled with it,  
wreaths for the path and the neon diamond.  
It was the midnight of the lobster.  
The dry well is aromatic on your eyeballs.  
Among the dull shades of silvery anger of the cubicle.  
  
It was the twilight of the toucan.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not  
seem so to another.  
You see eye as loving as the drizzle.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the equinoctial serendipities?  
And  
the wind homogeneous splattering its perfumes and filtering them full of  
sea and jaguar?  
Developing the momentum of her wreath full of wonder.  
Where horses meet  
kiss meet, around and outside and the sound  
of yeasts, to reach out and return in animosity.  
As if to compound or crystallize or replace.  
We open the halves of a mysteries and the  
cracking of pamphlets wakes into the winged region.  
And you twisted in the anger and grew a invading extinction.  
Return to the homeland of the maps.  
  
A airplane is not enough to bury me and keep me  
from the room of your comfortable phenomena.  
Guilt abyss and morbid felicities.
