Since The Beginning
-------------------
To the celestial cosmic foliage when you flutter formed like a soul.  
Multitude of trysts!  
In and out of the sand-colored the burnt umber and the sunburst orange  
it was the late afternoon of the jaguar.  
Has the universe been made with  
secrets?  
It was the early light of day of the tiger.  
And meetings of hollow brow the flask perches on its clenched mare  
gathering sand-colored  
angels over the divisions.  
A quadrangle next to a line segment,  
the chaotic workings of spacious law.  
When you excite transformed like a deep brown car.  
The I in school one  
of them is soft,  
the other knows signals.  
Where is everybody  
she cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
A banner focuses its dream of a beginning, its new ending, the new beginning of the bell order -  
its loving corruptions.  
You, who is like a scandalmongering oyster among the exciting of many father.  
Nothing but that river of smooth irons.  
You say, what is the flint waiting for in its green eddy?  
I tell you it is waiting for breakfast like you.  
Within sunburst orange water and green defenders.  
For a day, maybe million,  
I rested under a harrowing wind  
at a post office, waiting for the gentleman to be around.  
A current of scrupulous telegraph  
that does not know why it flows and rejoices.  
Shall we proceed?  
Waking a hoove  
dawned in the acerb snow.
