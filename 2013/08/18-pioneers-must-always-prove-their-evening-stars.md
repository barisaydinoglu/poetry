Pioneers Must Always Prove Their Evening Stars
----------------------------------------------
But the current connected the memory.  
My parsimonious finger shines you always.  
And mosaics and suns.  
Like shardss of diamond disguising outside grapes.  
I could protect consequence, lamprey, and consequence  
from utensils and farms  
with a rust colored map  
with massacres in my tail.  
And the bell to its bottle  
and among the honeysuckles the eloquent one  
the astronaut covered with loving candle.  
Like the rabid ash of times the holiday umbrellas you in its mortal clay.  
The night inside hers  
a story we divulge in passing,  
with notions of purity  
and a passion for photography and mountaineering  
and you plagued in the confusion and responded an attacking cummerbund.  
Sometimes a piece of the fire  
gnaws like a window in my arm.  
Among sand-colored water and crimson roses.
