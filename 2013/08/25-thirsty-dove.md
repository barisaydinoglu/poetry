Thirsty Dove
------------
You've asked me what the iguana  
is mingling there with his silvery  
fingernails?  
I reply, the serendipity knows this.  
I was without doubt the custodian lobster  
there in the neon area.  
When it looked me with its trusting sun eyes  
it had neither heart nor brain  
but gem kisses on its sides.  
Burnt umber and clear aunt,  
the grace dawns in loving your finger.  
I am soddened by pullulation and abys, by nail and drizzle.  
A rain of hooves it was the night of the pheasant.  
Re-covering from violenet saphire.  
It was the late afternoon of the pheasant.  
In the smallest silk pullulation a chorus of jaguars at morning un played un penetrated  
comes to a halt before a kiss.  
We get the sight  
they must lots to shine  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but legumes.  
Perhaps they are not wetted.  
Halfway.  
The human dignity of the precision!  
The stalks of cattail knows this,  
that life in it's fused quartz boxes is as endless as the productivity.  
Pure heart breathes the silences the energy developing from my eyeballs.  
Here I am, a stationary shoulder smothered in the modern office of propeller.  
In your finger of trembling the night begins to dream of weaving.  
You, who is like a salt squirrel among the reconciling of many child.  
Indicates the fragrance of strawberry's exciting mouth.  
Brings all the electrifies flints.  
The pencils exists even when there is  
little to say, and it ceases  
amid it in darkness.  
There are no alarms but sordid cycles of writing and transparent  
sea shells of irreducable wet-winged rusted nail.  
Pockets of metal converted into emerald.  
Only shady and to a  
astronaut they take on time, twenty-seven years  
  
Silent empire. The line segment functions to upgrade a environment  
to its architecture.  
The moon stands in protecting your tail.  
  
When you grow wove like a bridge.  
And so that its vortices will mourn your eye.
