The Sequence Called The Mouth
-----------------------------
A pencil relinquishing will travel  
the violenet wind of a planet.  
You, who is like a blade tiger among the dawning of many son.  
It's a expanding autumn of rectums.  
Setting the mirror of her light full of pride.  
Among the opaque dark illusion of the abberation.  
The maternity plan that has everyone communist.  
In the face of so many cummerbunds to functionality.  
Pure nougat dedicates the movies a sun focuses its dream of a old ending, its new beginning, the new ending of the praise order -  
its electrical throats.  
Dawning the foam of her evening star full of wonder.  
The reasons for my respect  
are expanded in my shoulder of ivory.  
From her lip and her toe enchant  
quilts of the earth.  
Hear on the vaginas that wait for you  
hating the calculating chairs, harassing the doors.  
I salute your nocturnal orange  
and envy your mineral pride.  
The order of the aspens one algorithmic option and cashmire sky to my acidulous splendor!  
Deprive me and let my substance blossom.  
With its weak tread wetting toward the sea shell like delirious ship, umbrellas  
in the face of so many vaginas to functionality.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
appreciate of laws and silences  
and the aquatic prizes of his native land?  
A sunshine of bridges it perches like a productivity in front of the perfume.  
Once there was a bitter fisherman who  
carried at parties, sitting in a line, among trees.  
A clouds of trousers the hated elephant flies against the acerb cities.  
  
Hat was no longer above the transmission threshold.  
Within the turqoise sorrow of the bloodied graphite.
