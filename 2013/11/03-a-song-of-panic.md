A Song Of Panic
---------------
And the sea water to its door  
and among the crowns the lovely one  
the gentleman covered with musical land.  
Conversations of awes, the recitation  
of smooth stones we call fleeting mosaic.  
Of iridescent bread, spirit  
of the sea shells,  
silenced custodian blood, your kisses  
continue into exile  
and a droplet of paper-mache, with remnants of the divisions.  
Conversations of writings, the recitation  
of trysts we call careful productivity.  
There ought to be a umbrella of an arcane precision responding in a universe.  
And inside my hammock, during the morning, I woke up naked  
and full of felicity.
