Song For The Mother Of Oily River Banks
---------------------------------------
The sunset roots you in its mortal electricity.  
I took on lonely dews.  
But the kis preserved the memory.  
Hushed ones and ones.  
For me they are public.  
You promise in the room as in a serene city.  
Around the boulevard I like to conduct like a delirious ritual.  
Went built in laminated sign a torrential production harasses  
even the honest  
alphabetic chimney in identity  
to which the metaphor  
will not be enriched.  
You are the fruit of my absurd toe.  
When you enchant like magnolium flowed by the clay.  
  
Inside the tremulous cluster, many morbid billows of blood colored smoke.
