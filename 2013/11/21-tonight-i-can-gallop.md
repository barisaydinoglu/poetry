Tonight I Can Gallop
--------------------
Pure bramble connects the fellowships with its whirlwinds of flow of human peach, spirit  
of the energies,  
twisted custodian blood, your kisses  
make into exile  
and a droplet of cork, with remnants of the sea.  
Respect is gone, the subject has carried.
