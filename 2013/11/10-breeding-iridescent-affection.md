Breeding Iridescent Affection
-----------------------------
Behind the mist of the modern office where you sleep,  
a dream chains into synonyms.  
And you'll  
ask why doesn't his poetry  
enrich of serendipities and cashmire lakes  
and the real candles of his native land?  
Barbaous mountaineers and goddesses.  
For me they are alphabetic.  
Not to reconcile or even meet  
the bed of one who wakes  
against me in a vicinity or relinquishing to a stranger.  
You shower in the universe as in a musical archipeligos.  
Not to store or even meet  
the apple of one who crystallizes  
in me in a region or living to a child.  
  
A serene wood paneling making a fleeting thing of a lucky meeting with a god.
