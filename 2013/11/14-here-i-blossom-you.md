Here I Blossom You
------------------
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the winged farms?  
And the clouds serendipidous splattering its grapes and drowning them full of  
field and cat? Not the cashmire moment  
when the holiday dedicates the ships.  
I wish to make a circle  
behind, and every sight, many  
times hidden in a tryst.  
But the aroma blushed the memory.  
If you were not the lemon the sweet-smelling moon  
cooks, sprinkling its plum across the region.  
The telegraph standing from my brow.  
Like salts imprisoning inside alcoves.  
Chirped and then wetted in the field.  
The nocturnal autumn gave it honor.  
Our new river bank, our romantic stars in the sky line segments.
