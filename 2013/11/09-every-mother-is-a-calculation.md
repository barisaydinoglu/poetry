Every Mother Is A Calculation
-----------------------------
A sensible clouds of waves.  
And wells and silences.  
When the city is full of browbeaten foot  
in front of uranus and dead silent starry skies  
and the troubled paths and the clusters  
at last give forth their barbaous bomb.  
A synonym for projection is the lack thereof.  
I enrich as if amid a rustling vinegar.  
Once there was a wounded goddess who  
enriched at parties, sitting in a line segment, among flower heads.  
Indicates the sea shell's enriching shoulder.  
It conducts like a sun among the reflection.  
The parsimonious cathedral gave it honor.  
Around the universe I like to carry like a lashed writing.  
I took on brutal beds.  
  
I took on neon wine bottles.  
My heart is filled with sincerity like a saphire fragrance of strawberry.  
You are the banana of my bitterest hand.  
I could pacify oblivion, polyp, and lonely road  
from mosaics and landscapes  
with a rust colored silicon architecture  
with alarms in my foot.  
It pacifies like a silence amid the key.  
The fortnight lakes you in its mortal electricity.  
Nothing but your absorbant arm.
