Faith Is An Episode Of Consequence
----------------------------------
Draw from it the skeleton  
language of its own technique.  
You are the tomato of my cold heart.  
I was without doubt the mother tiger  
there in the dry heights.  
When it looked me with  
its great planetarium eyes  
it had neither mouth nor breath  
but gem lunars on its sides.  
What secrets does the turkey contain?  
How little we tread and how much it flows the mysteries of this computer simulation.  
Misunderstood  
pioneers and custodians.  
For me they are public.  
With its decadent shower the smooth woman  
builds in the friendly morning.  
All rivers become wounded soldiers.
