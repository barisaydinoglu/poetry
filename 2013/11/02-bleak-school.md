Bleak School
------------
Realized sweet-smelling kiss wave of wave of fellowships rolling down the sea.  
I want you to inherit on my eye.  
Like the hated clay of quivers a current of comfortable movie  
that does not know why it flows and builds.  
Nothing but that perfume of laminated signs.  
When you transform like stars in the sky crystallized by the jungle.  
A angel -like throat  
Deep brown electricity to my crooked star!  
Went responded in fellowship wave of wave of starss in the sky rolling down the sea.  
A burnt umber tiger reflects.  
What funny things does the ostrich contain?  
How little we mix and how much it stands the secrets of this computer simulation.  
Behind the blood colored fear of the oxide.  
I saw how fleshes are galloped  
by the honest drop.  
Ripple was no longer below the recording threshold.  
You perform in the archipeligos as in a romantic night.  
Shut up and closed off like a moon.  
  
To the original color of the paper-mache productivity.  
Behind the cashmire finger of the electricity.
