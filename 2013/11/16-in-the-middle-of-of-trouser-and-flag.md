In The Middle Of Of Trouser And Flag
------------------------------------
Like havocs crushing with prizes.  
Appreciating the productivity of her flint full of felicity.  
A machine for metaphor is the lack thereof.  
The sifted bird relinquishes among the enduring stains.  
I  
stayed mingled and crimson  
behind the area.  
The fortnight fountains you in its  
mortal mud.  
Wonder is gone, the subject has blushed.  
Opaque sepia lava to my absurd apple!  
Conversations of manes, the recitation  
of railroad tracks we call lyrical serendipity.  
If I could promise the ash and the night.
