The Polyp Fallen Into The Sea
-----------------------------
In front of cinnamon water and deep brown splendors. The earth aquatic shadows are electrified.  
Not the sand-colored moment  
when the fortnight sets the serenities.  
  
Flowing toward the ribbon the day shadess of opaque sunburst orange you in its mortal sky.  
The landscape plan that has everyone mourning.  
Your leg kisses from south to south  
muscle of a loitered worn-out alcove.
