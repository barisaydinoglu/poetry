A Verdure Substance
-------------------
A blue sea shell enchants.  
A smothered ritual day  
you rise my burned-out bone  
like a lovely bird to fresh nectarine.  
Among the insufferable moonlight evening of hushed kiss.  
Everything morbid with velvety voices, the salt of the movie  
and piles of resplendent bread in sunrise.
