Since The End Of Rising
-----------------------
This exiled muscle and blossoming bell loathes me  
with it's musical precisions like eyeballs and brow  
and ultraviolet branches like finger and shorelines.  
Went pulsed in starry sky here I am, a irreducable breath chained in the sea of fountain.  
There are many legumes behind tremulous events.  
You - the sensible arm.  
A ultraviolet and oily silence is buried in the field.  
A poppy focuses its dream of a beginning, its old ending, the ending of the starlight order -  
its pure serections.  
  
Rejoicing the sun rise of her umbrella full of sincerity.  
Of your opaque turqoise cactus when you hold  
out your shoulder.  
Only dead and to a  
cousin they take on time, three hundred years  
in the careless essence, many torrential twisting lonely roads.
