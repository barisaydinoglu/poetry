Rotten Key
----------
Your eyeballs reconciles from west to north to seek another land I salute your solute plum  
and envy your deedy pride.  
This disordered forest and blushing hoove decays me  
with it's fluidic affections like brow and foot  
and opaque blood colored beds like eyeballs and snows.  
The natural dignity of the land!
