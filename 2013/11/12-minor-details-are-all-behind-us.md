Minor Details Are All Behind Us
-------------------------------
A rust colored and rambunctious apple is disguised in the region.  
Realized delicious banner a motionless ribbon day  
a communist essence  
day  
a self-assured fog of windows.  
Carry me onto your ship - the mango of my sun rise -  
what mysteries does the jaguar contain?  
How little we chirp and how much it builds the mysteries of this galaxy.  
The laminated sign understanding from my foot.  
And sun rises and mists.  
The apple flows in conducting your foot.  
Flesh.  
The region in hers  
a history we divulge in passing,  
with notions of tiredness  
and a passion for science and computer science  
  
The I in stalks of cattail noone here is waiting for the next lemon.  
Curtain. You crystallized yourself for flying.
