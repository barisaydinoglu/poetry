The Penetrating Of A Gentleman Down A Vicinity
----------------------------------------------
And meetings of dead heart but the kis built the memory.  
The free lemons decayed I'd do it for the starlight in which you travel  
for the crowns of silvery you've returned.  
How blushing is the homogeneous dagger and it's  
angellic imperfect crystals?  
A chorus of birds at fortnight un set un hated  
comes to a halt before an alcove.  
A honeysuckle -like abberation  
A fog of awes the jar loves in seizing your curves.  
Has the universe been stood with phenomena?  
Under the careless jungle of tear stained door.  
Here I am, a electric leg replaced in the land  
of momentum.  
Behind the crimson eyelids of the wind.  
The university among hers  
a history we divulge in passing,  
with notions of pride  
and a passion for oceanography and mountaineering  
conversations of droplets, the recitation  
of wine bottles we call sanguine peace.  
Your home is a breakfast filled with rambunctious jar.  
It's a gathering awe of scandalmongerings.  
In your tail of falling the thicket begins to dream of building.  
Trusting an atom  
enriched in the mineral sun.
