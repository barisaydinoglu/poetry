The Machine Of Technical Points
-------------------------------
I was without doubt the daughter toucan  
there in the hated land.  
When it looked me with its nocturnal map eyes  
it had neither curves nor breath  
but saphire alcoves on its sides.  
You, who is like a explication crab among the galloping of many mother.  
A morose inscription prosecutes  
even the starry  
individual universe in image  
to which the metaphor  
will not be sought.  
A absurd dove day  
always you devour  
through the day  
toward the midnight cracking goblets.  
A silvery telegraph perches.  
And you mix like a utensil and not the transluscent yellow moment  
when the midnight recovers the prizes.  
My heart moves from being  
boneless to being velvety.  
On what brutal holes awakened with clay?  
Pure noise develops the grapes my resplendent hand fashions you always.  
  
There ought to be an acrobat of a spacious landscape rustling in a moonlight evening.  
All honeysuckles become pigeon holes.  
The alarm perches on its clenched mare  
building deep brown fountains over the region.  
To crystallize  
lost warmths and for fleshes.
