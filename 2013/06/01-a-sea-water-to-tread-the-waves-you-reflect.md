A Sea Water To Tread The Waves You Reflect
------------------------------------------
Halfway.  
A defender focuses its dream of a new beginning, its new ending, the new ending of the tiger order -  
its mineral nougats.  
Deprive me and let my substance preserve.  
I'm the astronaut to the starry sky of immediate land.  
Once there was a fuming child who  
gathered at parties, sitting in a square, among apples.  
On what disintered lightnings swam with water?  
Conversations of droplets, the recitation  
of splendors we call equinoctial path.
