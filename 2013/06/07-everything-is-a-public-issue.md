Everything Is A Public Issue
----------------------------
The celestial shoreline gave it decency.  
Conversations of utensils, the recitation  
of roots we call serendipidous moon.  
If I could store the torrent and the thicket.  
Not making is a form of building.  
She is  
against us at this moment of first fluttering.  
My heart is filled with sincerity like a marble poppy.  
Which is a winged thread of directions  
three hundred or million, entertained  
on an alcove or in the comfortable love  
directions of the arm, a calculation in your fingers.
