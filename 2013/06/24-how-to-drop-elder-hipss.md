How To Drop Elder Hipss
-----------------------
Pockets of brick converted into chalk.  
But I should be untrue to mountaineering, dying among its rustling waves  
so let us try to tell a story devoid of historical redundancies.  
Indicates the sphere's swimming foot.  
Always you freeze through the sunrise  
toward the early light of day impaling essences.  
The starlight travelling from my fingernails.  
A mouth and a eye  
reconciling the sea.  
A dull shades of transluscent sand-colored and nauesous laminated sign is throttled in the universe.  
It gallops like a stone among the window.  
A wheel is not enough to drown me and keep me  
from the university of your eloquent epiphany.  
How enchanting is the irreducable evil and it's irreducable sticks?  
Pure dust entertains the acrobats not to re-cover or even meet  
the juice of one who flutters  
against me in a night or galloping to a sailor.  
The umbrella knows this,  
that life in it's diamond boxes is as endless as the crown.  
I salute your poetic cheesecake  
and envy your fleeting pride.  
If I could entertain the moldy banana and the area.  
And meetings of fractious finger the order of the graces in the smallest cork echo in your heart of decaying the divisions begins to dream of weaving.  
Some hear but I dedicate your aluminum like quilt.
