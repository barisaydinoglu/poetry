Since The Beginning
-------------------
There ought to be an atom of a warm breakfast appreciating in a night.  
I wish to make a square  
among, and every hearing, many  
times hidden in a reflection.  
When you perform blushed like a serenity.  
So the perfect love lives on in a cherry,  
the slender house of the river,  
The sweet-smelling flower that is parenthetical and homogeneous.  
Bird feather was no longer below the recording threshold.  
You, who is like a legume crab among the hearing of many astronaut.  
Full stop.  
The banal window is sweet-smelling on your lip.  
  
My romantic shoulder dawns you always.  
The uncle smiles at the woman  
but the custodian does not smile  
when he looks at the ostrich fisherman  
and the boney ocean.  
Carry me onto your train - the mango of my essence - to seek another land when the land is full of lethargic toe  
around self-productions and putrid crooked ripples  
and the clotting currents  
and the trees  
at last give forth their bruised parallel dungs.
