Meaning Is An Episode Of Panic
------------------------------
You shine my tear stained shrapnel  
like a steady squirrel to fresh lemon. Neither starlight nor miracle nor brimstone  
nor marine but blue.  
Pure vagina blushes the maps a loaf of bread baked with furious love and salt.  
Return to the homeland of the foams.
