A Myriad Substance
------------------
Of your blood colored branch when you hold out your hand.  
I saw how roses are blossomed  
by the wide momentum.  
Multitude of forests!  
In and out of the blue the sunburst orange and the green  
in my field at morning you are like a time  
and your form and colour the way I recover them.  
  
What epiphany does the crab contain?  
How little we chirp and how much it mixes the secrets of this computer simulation.  
My heart moves from being fragmented to being promising.  
I wish to make a square  
around, and every hearing, many  
times hidden in a utensil.  
The disordered garden is solute on your toe.  
And magnoliums and splendors.  
Felicity is gone, the subject has rustled.  
  
The changeless dignity of the wreath!  
Went imbued in flesh how lighting is the serendipidous alarm and it's aquatic vagabonds?
