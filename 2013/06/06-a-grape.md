A Grape
-------
It's a re-covering defender of legumes.  
What we say returns to  
shine some other lady  
what a identity may teach.  
With its ironous weave you've asked me what the lobster is relinquishing there with his green lip?  
I reply, the grape knows this.  
You recover in the divisions as in a slender sea.  
Sometimes a piece of the wind  
Congeals like a fragrance of strawberry in my ears.  
If you were not the cheesecake the slender moon  
cooks, sprinkling its peach across the universe.  
Ripple was no longer right at the recording threshold.  
With its rotten gallop only fractious and to a  
pioneer they take on time, million years  
inside the jar of the boulevard where you sleep,  
a dream brainwashes into signals.  
Draw from it the morose  
calculation of its own projection.
