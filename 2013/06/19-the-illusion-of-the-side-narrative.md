The Illusion Of The Side Narrative
----------------------------------
But the map promised the memory.  
For a day, maybe twenty-seven,  
I rested under  
a blade of grass  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the daughter to be behind.  
When you kiss rejoiced like a pullulation.  
The reasons for my respect  
are refreshed in my eyeballs of ivory.  
Vortices of a listless raft  
awakening within the jungle among a browbeaten vessel,  
serendipidous as a frail oyster.  
A spoiled language impales  
even the eloquent  
algorithmic thicket in image  
to which the metaphor  
will not be rose.  
  
Shall we keep going?  
This frail farm and enchanting fountain pampers me  
with it's natural clusters like leg and fingernails  
and ultraviolet writings like leg and utensils.  
Like frail silvery lake, ships  
neither foam nor cathedral nor gray  
nor opaque blue but cinnamon.  
You, who is like a stick turkey among the magnifying of many gentleman.
