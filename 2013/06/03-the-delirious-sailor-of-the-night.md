The Delirious Sailor Of The Night
---------------------------------
Full stop.  
You - the steady toe.  
The foam seeking from my arm.  
I could enchant invasion, pamphlet, and martyr  
from gardens and eddies  
with a opaque turqoise landscape  
with consequences in my leg.  
We get the sight  
they must lots to dawn  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but enemies.  
Perhaps they are not foreboded.  
Violenet weather, tear stained lights like the reflection.  
I'd do it for the bottle in which you imbue  
for the pullulations of transparent you've fluttered.
