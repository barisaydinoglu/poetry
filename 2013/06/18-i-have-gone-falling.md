I Have Gone Falling
-------------------
Not the burnt umber moment  
when the night pulses the sun rises.  
A phenomenon develops,  
rejects - it does not return.  
It's a magnifying river of noises.  
Of your blood colored law when you hold out your heart.  
Lady of the depths of my leg - your wetting  
stills your incredulous regard as though it were sky.  
The convict imposes nessecity.  
  
Enjoy the many browbeaten attempts to wet  
the changeless lard.  
There is pure fortune in pulsing it.  
And you gnawn in the fear and perched a erupting clandenstine.
