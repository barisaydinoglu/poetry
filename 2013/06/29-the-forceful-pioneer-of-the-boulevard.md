The Forceful Pioneer Of The Boulevard
-------------------------------------
The mirror plan that has everyone phosphorus.  
You are the cherry of my lethargic hips.  
Closed off and closed off like a book.  
The dew seizes in circumscribing your arm.  
So the humble sincerity lives on in a fruit,  
the lion hearted house of the root,  
the balanced miracle that is careful  
and infinite.  
The stranger smiles at the sailor  
but the child does not smile  
when he looks at the iguana son  
and the rotten ocean.  
  
Somebody here is waiting for the next shoreline.  
Flower. You heard yourself for mixing.  
I want you to hear on my arm.
