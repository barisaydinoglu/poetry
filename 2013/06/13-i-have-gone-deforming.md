I Have Gone Deforming
---------------------
I wish to make a loop  
in, and every meaning, many  
times hidden in a key. One of them is eloquent,  
the other knows synonyms.  
Where is noone  
she cries, and  
when can we see what  
is going to happen? The order of the foliages come with me to the darknes of traps.  
Like mourning fellowship, lighthouses  
lightnings of a communist car  
wetting behind the vicinity within a listless airplane,  
essential as a boney cat.
