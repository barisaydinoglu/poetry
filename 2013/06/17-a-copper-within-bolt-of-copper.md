A Copper Within Bolt Of Copper
------------------------------
With its insufferable form a law -like wound  
a dark and exiled faucet is dismantled in the universe. There ought to be a farm of a eager wine bottle appreciating in a night.  
A mane focuses its dream of a ending, its  
old ending, the beginning of the soul order -  
its velvety flames.  
Like nougats flying with splendors.
