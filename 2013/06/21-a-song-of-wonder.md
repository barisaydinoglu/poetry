A Song Of Wonder
----------------
And meetings of clenched eyelids and coats and dews.  
You are the apple of my decadent curves.  
Be guided by the indespensable snow's bridge.  
Towards those honeysuckles of yours that wait for me.  
And so that its throats will change your hand.  
Fewer and fewer  
mourn about another mode of happiness.  
And the flesh to its promise  
and among the waves the aromatic one  
the sailor covered with unguessed essence.  
Marine and hidden cousin,  
nothing but your arcane leg.  
Not the sand-colored moment  
when the midnight refreshes the rivers.  
Morbid ladies and gods.  
For me they are side.  
  
From her leg and her shoulder enchant  
landscapes of the earth.
