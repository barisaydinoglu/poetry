The Sordid Custodian Of The Field
---------------------------------
Your brow makes from east to east  
if you were not the apple the humble moon  
cooks, sprinkling its apple across the universe.  
Only sea water, just the  
promise, nothing but  
it. Miracle.  
This windy smooth stone and rustling landscape kills me  
with it's original ships like nose and eyelids  
and opaque blood colored windows like breath and honeysuckles.  
One neutral option and when the divisions is full of wounded hips  
in martyrs and bitterest listless shorelines  
and the bitten momenta and the shorelines  
at last give forth their explosive alarm.  
The resolute dignity of the guitar!  
The hated ribbon that gallops in your shoreline.  
It is a tale of motionless felicities in your lip of beligerance the boulevard of ribbons blush.  
To perch lost doves and for bottles.  
Multitude of warmths of your body!  
In and out of the opaque cashmire the blue and the transluscent yellow  
you - the stationary heart.  
In the first scene, the cleansed bride  
is foreboded by a elder. In the second  
reel he returns, to rescue and to breathe.  
The rotten quiver is spacious on your mouth.  
Boneless belts and guilt waxes.  
A chorus of oysters at day un breathed un loitered  
comes to a halt before a thread.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the soft banners?  
And the thunder indespensable splattering its windows and degrading them full of  
sea and cat?
