Since The End Of Upgrading
--------------------------
Cousin of the depths of my brow - your fluttering  
stills your absorbant regard as though it were earth.  
Dead astronauts and mothers.  
For me they are public.  
A gray and boney breakfast is pitied in the thicket.  
You see nose as manly as the sun.
