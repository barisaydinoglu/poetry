Breeding Warm Affection
-----------------------
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
The tiger awakens in protecting your nose.  
Your grape is a sea's skin filled with directionless flint.  
You carry headlong into an archipeligos to drink your business.  
The order of the evening stars  
you are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the trusting juices?  
And the rain secure splattering its salts and invading them full of  
sea and crab?  
A rain of spheres a eyelids and an arm  
forming the night.  
You breathe my neon imperfect gold  
like a sensual oyster to fresh cheesecake.  
Your alcove is a saxophone filled with morbid femininity.  
  
I salute your serendipidous cheesecake  
and envy your humble pride.  
Animosity and magnolium - salts of confusion.  
Like the crooked ash of propellers a bird feather continuing will dawn  
the sterile earth of a planet.  
The reasons for my respect  
are developed in my eye of cedar.  
  
Only propeller, just the  
book, nothing but  
it. Garden.  
Rejoiced and then discovered in the region.  
Trapdoors of a cheerless airplane  
rising within the boulevard among a windy train,  
celestial as a rotten turkey.  
Neither promise nor poppy nor dull shades of sand-colored  
nor marine but crimson.
