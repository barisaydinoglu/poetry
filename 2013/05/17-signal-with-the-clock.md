Signal With The Clock
---------------------
Multitude of pencils!  
In and out of the transparent the burnt umber and the sand-colored  
mountaineer of the depths of my nose - your setting  
stills your aromatic regard as though it were ice.  
Has the land been crystallized with funny things?  
Everything boneless with original voices, the salt of the railroad track  
and piles of serene bread among sunrise.  
  
This communist drop and appreciating dew silences me  
with it's cordial energies like ears and breath  
and brimstone hats like brow and yellow lakes.  
Silent sunrise and the forceful flower head  
abhor at the walls of my house.
