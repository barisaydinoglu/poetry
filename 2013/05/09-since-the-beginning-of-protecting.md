Since The Beginning Of Protecting
---------------------------------
One of them is somber,  
the other knows inscriptions.  
Where is nobody  
he cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Flower was no longer right at the recording threshold.  
What boundless atoms -  
the night is filled with it,  
tigers for the atom and the chaotic crystal.  
Of a opaque opaque dull shades of cashmire one that wets autumns.  
If I could hear the ghost and the vicinity.  
Nothing but your poetic hips.  
When the vicinity is full of windy mouth  
in trapdoors and mechanical violenet lunars  
and the difficult love and the ships  
at last give forth their absurd ghost.  
When you perform like breakfast showered by the electricity.  
In the face of so many noises to positivity.  
  
And graces and foams.  
A humble rain of banners.
