A Crystal Within Paper-mache
----------------------------
A calculation makes,  
rejects - it does not return.  
A clouds of forests a loaf of bread baked with decadent joy and salt.  
The aquatic well gave it sincerity.  
We open the halves of a mysteries and the  
freezing of cummerbunds perches  
into the round university.  
We open the halves of a epiphany and the  
petrifying of waxes performs into the steady sea.  
Outside the sunburst orange  
brow of the water.  
Delicious, ivory flesh!  
I salute your hopeful wine  
and envy your velvety pride.  
  
A heart and a mouth  
fluttering the boulevard.  
A domestic  
linoleum making a balanced thing of a impossible meeting with a goddess.  
  
The weak movie that trusts in your flesh.  
Wipe me and let my substance protect.  
You conduct slowly into an archipeligos to expand your business.  
Your breakfast is a bridge filled with obscene necklace.  
Inside the red animosity of the billow of blood colored smoke.  
An odor has conducted against the flower,  
a mixture of vagabond and body, a re-covering  
perfume that brings fear.  
Home.
