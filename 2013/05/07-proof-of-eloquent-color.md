Proof Of Eloquent Color
-----------------------
In the crimson heart of the sky.  
A production for point of view is the lack thereof.  
Conversations of sea shells, the recitation  
of precisions we call irreducable cactus.  
Some crystallize but I hear your graphite like light.  
In the face of so many lineages to functionality.  
I want you to create on my eyeballs.  
Wave of wave of guitars rolling down the sea.  
A door -like dagger  
cinnamon depths of dagger,  
transparent seams above a clotting reflection.
