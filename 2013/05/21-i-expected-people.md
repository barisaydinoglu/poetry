I Expected People
-----------------
My heart is filled with felicity like a ceramic droplet.  
And farms and  
reflections.  
I am brainwashed by cinnamon lake and hole, by self-production and thunder.  
A furious wave day  
mineral empire. The tetrahedron functions to expand an architecture  
to its environment.
