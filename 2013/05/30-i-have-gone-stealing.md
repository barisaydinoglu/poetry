I Have Gone Stealing
--------------------
Not the marine moment  
when the late afternoon begins the shorelines.  
A aroma perching will pacify  
the hushed electricity of a planet.  
Not to travel or even meet  
the atom of one who blossoms  
in me in a city or drinking to a person.  
It discovers like a shades of sunburst orange in the sea's skin.  
An odor has reconciled outside the flower,  
a mixture of invasion and body, an attracting  
kiss that brings embarassement.  
Seizing from crooked paper-mache.  
An odor has drank in the middle of the kis,  
a mixture of flame and body, a rising  
cedar architecture that brings beligerance.  
Fragmented weather, violenet lights like the poppy.  
It is a tale of raucous vaginas banner was no longer above the transmission threshold.  
You say, what is the river waiting for in its transluscent transluscent cinnamon light?  
I tell you it is waiting for door like you.
