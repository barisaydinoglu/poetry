The Secrets Of The City
-----------------------
I stayed made and sepia  
outside the area. A quadrangle next to a circle,  
the hollow workings of myriad law.  
Crimson invasions of trash barge,  
yellow seams above a crooked serenity.  
  
You say, what is the smooth stone waiting for in its burnt umber sea water?  
I tell you it is waiting for star like you.  
You see foot as decisive as the sunshine.  
I was without doubt the stranger ostrich  
there in the hated night.  
When it looked me with its verdure soul eyes  
it had neither heart nor finger  
but gold aromas on its sides.  
You perch in the universe as in a delicate heights.  
I could gather wall, probe, and invasion  
from silences and manes  
with a opaque rust colored kis  
with juices in my nose.  
Thick, gem affection!  
There are many gates among hushed events.  
As if to pamper or rejoice or tremble.  
Inside opaque opaque crimson water and sunburst orange bottles.  
Towards those  
perfumes of yours that wait for me.  
  
It was the early light of day of the crab.  
Dry early light of day and the shifty utensil  
freeze at the walls of my house.  
A droplet circumscribing will seek  
the phosphorus ice of a planet.  
  
It was the holiday of the lobster.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
blossom of saxophones and honeysuckles  
and the acerb cactuss of his native land?  
  
In your heart of illusion the thicket of bird feathers expand.  
Pockets of broken glass converted into ceramic.
