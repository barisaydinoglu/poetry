Your Finger Is Enough
---------------------
A boat is not enough to taunt me and keep me  
from the jungle of your homogeneous secrets.  
A putrid study wets  
even the absorbant  
side modern office in identity  
to which the metaphor  
will not be inherited.  
All flints become bloody feathers.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
fashion of quivers and atoms  
and the unguessed dews of his native land?  
In front of the crown of the boulevard where you sleep,  
a dream harasses into signals.  
Thirsty lonely roads and negligent shrapnels.  
Multitude of flutes!  
In and out of the crimson the marine and the silvery  
the insatiable law that upgrades in your river.  
So the warm decency lives  
on in a cherry,  
the aromatic house of the bridge,  
the resplendent silvery car that is electrical and honest.  
Prize was no longer right at the transmission threshold.  
Halfway.  
Has the chimney been played with phenomena?  
It was a violenet business of stalactite and coffins.
