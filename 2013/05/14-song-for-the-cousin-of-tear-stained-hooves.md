Song For The Cousin Of Tear Stained Hooves
------------------------------------------
Coddle me and let my substance perch.  
The smooth fountain gave it wonder.  
The balanced faucet gave it respect.  
Fewer and fewer  
sodden about another mode of felicity.  
A airplane is not enough  
to dismantle me and keep me  
from the universe of your mineral funny things.  
Strike me and let my substance fly.  
Pockets of aluminum converted into gem.
