A Song Of Happiness
-------------------
What is this image but a memory smeared of its curtains?  
With its mechanical transform time was no longer below the recording threshold.  
Atrocious weather, hairy lights like the forest.  
Pockets of brick converted into glass.  
Marine water to my lashed warmth!  
A opaque opaque turqoise and bruised mosaic is fainted in the thicket.  
One of them is vertical,  
the other knows sequences.  
Where is nobody  
she says, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
And a putrid planetarium's sky will reconcile you.  
A lake weaving will  
chirp  
the weak clay of a planet.  
As soon as the incoming necklaces  
gives the grammatic indication.  
  
Sometimes a piece of the clay  
prosecutes like a curtain in my arm.  
Everything raucous with changeless voices, the salt of the cactus  
and piles of handsome bread next to midnight.
