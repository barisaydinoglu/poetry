Since The End
-------------
I took on hairy old warrior's medals. Your eyelids loves from east to north  
the charitable necklaces executed the pigeon hole stands on its thirsty mare  
fluttering sunburst orange dews  
over the room.  
Like the exiled iron of hats inside crimson water and sand-colored stalkss of cattail.
