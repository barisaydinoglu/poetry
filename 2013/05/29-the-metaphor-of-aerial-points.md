The Metaphor Of Aerial Points
-----------------------------
The massacre entertains on its negligent mare  
recovering marine sea shells over the chimney.  
My serene eye blushes you always.  
The jungle inside hers  
a story we speak in passing,  
with notions of love  
and a passion for computer science and oceanography  
halfway.  
From her shoulder and her leg transform  
foams of the earth.  
You've asked me what the jaguar is mingling there with his cinnamon eyeballs?  
I reply, the ribbon knows this.  
For a day, maybe too few to count,  
I rested under a harrowing wind  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the person to be inside.  
You form in the room as in a somber vicinity.  
Brings all the gnaws flower heads.  
Multitude  
of pastures!  
In and out of the yellow the green and the blue  
a ghostly language mutates  
even the absent minded  
individual jungle in technique  
to which the metaphor  
will not be began.
