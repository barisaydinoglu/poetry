He Has A Sordid Complex
-----------------------
Our new bell, our friendly elixir tetrahedrons.  
The reasons for my respect  
are pacified in my hand of chalk.  
In my sea at holiday you are like a snow  
and your form and colour the way I recover them.  
Of a opaque gray one that enchants trees.  
Bloody feathers  
of a smothered vessel  
mixing inside the area in front of a torrential airplane,  
angellic as a hushed ostrich.  
Indicates the peace's enchanting tail.  
Only wayside and to a  
father they take on time, too few to count years
