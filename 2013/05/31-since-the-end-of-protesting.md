Since The End Of Protesting
---------------------------
The circumstance imposes nessecity. She is among us at this moment of first breathing.  
Crimson earth to my torrential  
flint!  
Come with me to the trapdoor of billows of gray smoke.  
Behind the candle of the region where you sleep,  
a dream lunges into inscriptions.  
  
Fewer and fewer  
pass about another mode of decency.
