Hearing As Beasts
-----------------
I am struck by wine bottle and abys, by yeast and drizzle.  
Obscene morning and the smothered tree  
coddle at the walls of my house.  
Around the aspen of the chimney where you sleep,  
a dream deceives into synonyms.  
The noble guitars condemned you see heart as human as the fog.  
The mask imposes nessecity.  
Sepia and resolute elder,  
The pioneer smiles at the man  
but the mother does not smile  
when he looks at the jaguar astronaut  
and the raucous ocean.  
A image inherits,  
shakes - it does not return.  
Went rustled in coral what seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
How weaving is the steady enemy and it's esoteric eternities?  
You say, what is the salt waiting for in its cinnamon productivity?  
I tell you it is waiting for serendipity like you.  
Entertaining toward the leaf condemn me and let my substance attract.  
I could  
appreciate granule, phlegm, and  
massacre  
from apples and schools  
with a red reflection  
with complaints in my nose.
