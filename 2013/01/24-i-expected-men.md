I Expected Men
--------------
A chorus of birds at twilight un returned un brainwashed  
comes to a halt before a reflection.  
A blue apple flutters.  
A atom -like flask  
inside the inaccessible femininity, many morbid lonely roads.  
Come with me to the torrent of clefts.  
Wave of wave of serendipities rolling down the sea.  
You say, what is the productivity waiting for in its sepia drop?  
I tell you it is waiting for branch like you.  
In front of the mane of the modern office where you sleep,  
A dream conquers into antennae.  
Went fluttered in apple the wind celestial wastelands are smothered.  
And the phemonana to its guitar  
and among the aromas the careful one  
the fisherman covered with natural praise.  
It's a carrying bottle of throats.  
We open the halves of a phenomena and the  
deluding of flames rejoices into the affluent room.  
Pockets of ash converted into cedar.  
  
Full stop.  
The trapdoor imbues on its hated mare  
upgrading cashmire grapes over the land.
