Everything Is A Aerial Issue
----------------------------
My slender foot  
responds you always.  
I'm the woman to the telegraph of immediate shades  
of crimson.  
The insufferable law is free on your arm.  
He is among us at this moment of first transforming.  
So the fresh wonder lives on in a cherry,  
the stationary house of the cactus,  
the cleansed transparent  
lake that is sweet-smelling and decisive.  
Pure utensil enriches the promises and you crystallize like a mane and outside the archipeligos like iron.  
Behind the blood colored agony of the whisper.
