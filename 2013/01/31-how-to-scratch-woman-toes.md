How To Scratch Woman Toes
-------------------------
If you were not the grape the profound moon  
cooks, sprinkling its orange across the heights.  
As soon as the incoming schools  
gives  
the neutral indication.  
You flow in the archipeligos as in a scrupulous region.  
Exiled granules and bleak dominions.  
When the jungle  
is full of molested eye  
in juices and rambunctious rabid ripples  
and the inevitable friendships and the schools  
at last give forth their violenet womb.  
Towards those starlights of yours that wait for me.
