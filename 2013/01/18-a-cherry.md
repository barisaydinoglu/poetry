A Cherry
--------
Promise.  
And meetings of hushed foot my soft hand blossoms you always.  
My heart moves from being insatiable to being humble.  
Be guided by the equinoctial sphere's cluster.  
You pacify in the area as in a celestial sea.  
Went enchanted in eddy on what arrogant bloodied irons reflected with wind?  
  
Enjoy the many wayside attempts to protect  
the romantic consequence.  
There is aquatic fortune in recovering it.  
Difficult weather, imperalist lights like the perfume.  
Outside the sand-colored eyeballs of the heat.  
The nauesous sun rise is spacious on your eyeballs.  
Full stop.  
What phenomena does the pheasant contain?  
How little we set and how much it appreciates the curiosities of this galaxy.
