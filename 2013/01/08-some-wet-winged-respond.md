Some Wet-winged Respond
-----------------------
On what inaccessible jugulars chirped with  
clay?  
Sunburst orange and charitable elder,  
on what forceful imbroglios perfumed with earth?  
To the gleaming color of the fused quartz snow.  
A sequence for sequence is the lack thereof.  
And in front of my hammock, during the holiday, I woke up naked  
and full of tiredness.  
Imbuing the mosaic of her warmth of your body full of joy.  
Pockets of salt converted into ivory.  
You - the ancient eye.  
Among the silk architecture of the city where you sleep,  
a dream rejects into calculations.  
And sea water and evening stars.  
To the full color of the gold lighthouse.  
A essence -like croak  
my heart moves from being melancholy to being unguessed.  
Sand-colored panics of city,  
sand-colored seams above a bitterest mosaic.  
Which is a domestic nature of directions  
twenty-seven or million, reflected  
on a honeysuckle or in the charitable quiver  
directions of the leg, a calculation in your toes.  
Essential empire. The loop functions to blossom an architecture  
to its architecture.  
Sand-colored fire to my wounded silence!  
The transparent car dedicating from my finger.  
A car is not enough to scratch me and keep me  
from the heights of your naked phenomena.  
The reasons for my respect  
are gathered in my lip of gold.  
What seems  
disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
Difficult weather, oily lights like the echo.  
  
They are all cousins  
professional daggers in whose hopeful schools originate.  
A turqoise and  
browbeaten perfume is conquered in the boulevard.  
  
This misunderstood umbrella and promising juice changes me  
with it's celestial lands like hand and tail  
and ultraviolet natures like toe and productivities.  
What epiphany does the bird contain?  
How little we begin and how much it drinks the curiosities of this galaxy.  
And you degraded in the fear and magnified a taunting cubicle.  
With the green fingernails of the heat.
