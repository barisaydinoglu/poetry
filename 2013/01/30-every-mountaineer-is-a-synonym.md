Every Mountaineer Is A Synonym
------------------------------
Like the lethargic broken glass of corals to the winged color of the fused quartz curtain.  
We open the halves of a curiosities and the  
imprisoning of utensils stores into the delicious heights.  
A identity reflects,  
overflows - it does not return.  
Towards those sea shells of yours that wait for me.  
Green martyrs of felicity,  
transluscent sand-colored seams above a crooked quilt.  
As soon as the incoming alcoves  
gives the alphabetic indication.  
Halfway.  
Trusting the necklace of her fragrance of strawberry full of pride.  
Silent weather, fire-tipped lights like the banner.  
  
Neither lighthouse nor grape nor blood colored  
nor cinnamon but transparent.
