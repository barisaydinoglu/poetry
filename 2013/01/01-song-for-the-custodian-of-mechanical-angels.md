Song For The Custodian Of Mechanical Angels
-------------------------------------------
Multitude of sea shells!  
In and out of the deep brown the transluscent marine and the transparent  
went expanded in stars in the sky the archipeligos outside hers  
a story we speak in passing,  
with notions of felicity  
and a passion for computer science and oceanography  
the sun rise shining from my eyelids.  
There ought to be a umbrella of a cosmic hoove making in a city.
