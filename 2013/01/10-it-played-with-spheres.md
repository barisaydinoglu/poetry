It Played With Spheres
----------------------
Not the blue moment  
when the midnight inherits the awes.  
I stayed recovered and marine  
inside the heights.  
In the middle of the absurd university of raucous sphere.  
He is in the middle of us at this moment of first drinking.  
In the guilt divisions of blood-stained garden.  
Be guided by the nocturnal old warrior's medal's knave.  
You fashion slowly into a jungle to trust your business.  
Praise of a buried sifted cluster.  
You are the disordered uncle of a cat,  
the sticky ness of the juice, the power of the sky.
