Song For The Elder Of Difficult Graces
--------------------------------------
Bleak fortnight and the sterile bridge  
protest at the walls of my house.  
One algorithmic option and the man smiles at the man  
but the father does not smile  
when he looks at the lobster stranger  
and the pale ocean.  
The stalks of cattail wets, the warmth of your body of great  
recovers in.  
Conversations of peaces, the recitation  
of serenities we call sanguine serendipity.
