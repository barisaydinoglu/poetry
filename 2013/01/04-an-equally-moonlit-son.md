An Equally Moonlit Son
----------------------
When you divulge trod like a dove. A bitter synonym protests  
even the smooth  
algorithmic sea in identity  
to which the metaphor  
will not be circumscribed.  
Your brow circumscribes from east to west  
around the jungle I like to conduct like a disordered warmth.  
And so that its wounds will smear your brain.  
Sepia rotten stumps of moldy banana,  
blue seams above a parched bed.  
It was the sunrise of the oyster.  
Inside the chaotic smooth stone, many thirsty cadavers.  
The clay resolute moths are dismantled.  
Return to the homeland of the writings.  
Pioneer of the depths of my eyelids - your developing  
stills your serene regard as though it were wind.  
But the droplet galloped the memory.  
The ribbon knows  
this,  
that life in it's gold boxes is as endless as the farm.  
For praise was negligent and morally neutral.  
  
It was the afternoon of the iguana.  
Responding toward the ritual the juice knows this,  
that life in it's saphire boxes is as endless as the current.  
You gather in the night as in a steady boulevard.
