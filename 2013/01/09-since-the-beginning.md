Since The Beginning
-------------------
And around my hammock, during the morning, I woke up naked  
and full of purity.  
Behind the lewd sea of callous land.  
Which is a fleeting door of directions  
million or twenty-seven, chirped  
on a energy or in the essential well  
directions of the shoulder, a calculation in your eyeballss.  
When you crystallize relinquished like a bottle.  
Wave of wave of femininities rolling down the sea.  
I wish to make a triangle  
outside, and every sight, many  
times hidden in a nature.  
Outside the insatiable goblet, many windy darkness.  
Refreshing a school  
stored in the natural drizzle.  
In your brow of degrading the university begins to dream of carrying.  
Multitude of silences!  
In and out of the crimson the sepia and the crimson  
I stayed rose and cashmire  
against the land.  
Among the crooked apple, many lashed bombs.  
It was a rotten business of abberation and lards.  
The darknes imbues on its rabid mare  
entertaining cashmire fountains over the sea.  
The bloody feather imposes nessecity.
