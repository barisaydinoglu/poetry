Behind Alphabetic Understanding - Languages And Mountaineering
--------------------------------------------------------------
Once there was a distorted cousin who  
seized at parties, sitting in a loop, among forests.  
Circumscribe on the depths that wait for you  
dying the acidulous chairs, decaying the doors.  
How beginning is the wide wasteland and it's profound shadows?  
I do not steal in the field of rusted ego.  
In the smallest silicon sea's skin the scandalmongering grows on its sifted mare  
creating burnt umber circuss over the night.  
In my archipeligos at night you are like a cinnamon lake  
and your form and colour the way I divulge them.  
  
The lake passes, the map of plumed  
gathers outside.  
A burnt umber essence sets.  
To seek another land sometimes  
a piece of the fire  
filters like a flute in my shoulder.  
There ought to be a foliage of a musical phemonana waking in a city.
