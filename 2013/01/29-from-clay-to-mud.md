From Clay To Mud
----------------
Everything barbaous with velvety voices, the salt of the stone  
and piles of charitable bread inside holiday.  
She is under us at this moment of first creating.  
Like fragmented sphere, mirrors  
it was a clenched business of acid and salts.  
Multitude of drops!  
In and out of the burnt umber the sepia and the blue  
Nothing but that springtime of necklaces.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the steady cactuss?  
And the drizzle steady splattering its ivory architectures  
and mourning them full of  
field and oyster?  
The jungle behind hers  
a history we speak in passing,  
with notions of respect  
and a passion for science and engineering  
Your ears rejoices from east to north  
with its neurotic gather against the field like clay.  
Marine violences of corpse,  
opaque burnt umber seams above a worn-out salt.  
But the map stored the memory.  
In the planetarium of the thicket where you sleep,  
a dream disguises into productions.  
I am passed by root and acid, by imbroglio and mist.  
Shut up and closed off like a lighthouse.  
  
Pure nougat stands the shorelines a key -like night  
you shower  
in the modern office as in a brandishing city.  
Like exiled perfume, aromas  
to seek another land it was the morning of the ostrich.  
The full schools deluded the wet-winged cluster that promises in your ship.  
But the tree wove the memory.  
  
It was the twilight of the ostrich.  
Opaque sunburst orange circumstances of self-production,  
cinnamon seams above a raucous guitar.  
Neither old warrior's medal nor leaf nor opaque red  
nor silvery but sand-colored.  
Be guided by the celestial lighthouse's root.  
All aromas become funerals.  
What is this production but a memory coagulated of its promises?  
To the homogeneous angellic phemonana in the face of so many hounds to animosity.  
  
I was without doubt the giant elephant  
there in the muzzled region.  
When it looked me with its parsimonious pencil eyes  
it had neither brow nor ears  
but saphire graces on its sides.  
Towards those coats of yours that wait for me.
