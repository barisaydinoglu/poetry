Acids About The Metaphor She Inherited
--------------------------------------
The deedy elder  
continues in the musical morning.  
You are the tomato of my fuming breath.  
Not the silvery moment  
when the day enchants the shadess of cashmire.  
Carry me onto your boat - the mango of my film -  
I'm the father to the affection of immediate femininity.  
In the gray beligerance of the blade.  
And a distorted serenity's wind will store you.  
For a day, maybe twenty-seven,  
I  
rested under a palm tree leaf  
at a bus stop, waiting for the cousin to be outside.  
A humble rug making a friendly thing of a likely meeting with a sailor.  
Multitude of magnoliums!  
In and out of the burnt umber the yellow and the crimson  
and stalkss of cattail and lights.  
Deedy empire. The quadrangle functions to dawn an architecture  
to its architecture.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the cordial curtains?  
And the drizzle celestial splattering its flower heads and invading them full of  
thicket and crab?  
Sensual, gold stalks of cattail!  
  
Outside the crimson eye of the jungle.  
Musical, ceramic promise!
