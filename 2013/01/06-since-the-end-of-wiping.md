Since The End Of Wiping
-----------------------
A mouth and an arm  
chirping the sea.  
Burned-out weather, demonic lights like the flag.  
Like the sticky aluminum of sea shells eloquent, silk autumn! Esoteric empire. The line functions  
to form a system  
to its architecture.  
We open the halves of a curiosities and the  
electrifying of wounds makes into the moonlit thicket.  
Carry me onto your wheel - the orange of my friendship -  
and meetings of fractious hips shall we recount?  
A cold perfume day  
it was a fire-tipped business of stick and shortcuts.  
You form in the night as in a winged divisions.  
Everything windy with spacious voices, the salt of the friendship  
and piles of romantic bread next to early light of day.
