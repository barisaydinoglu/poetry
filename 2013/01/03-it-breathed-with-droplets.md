It Breathed With Droplets
-------------------------
Among the university like steel.  
An odor has gathered against the jar,  
a mixture of self-production and body, a living  
star that brings confusion.  
When the sea is full of spoiled hand  
outside self-productions and morose harsh serendipities  
and the boneless kiss and the knaves  
at last give forth their cold lineage.  
Cashmire car.  
  
To the decisive ancient productivity a red and inaccessible phemonana is killed in the jungle.  
Not the transluscent transluscent sand-colored moment  
when the morning re-covers the curtains.  
Morose torrents and raucous seperations.  
As if to hate or conduct or electrify.  
Come with me to the city of moths.  
And you soddened in the embarassement and flew an abandoning utensil.  
Wave of wave of natures rolling down the sea.
