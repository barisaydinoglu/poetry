Feeling Is An Episode Of Ash
----------------------------
And you tread like a stalks of cattail and halfway.  
A sun of wheatfields you are the kiwi of my putrid brow.  
Only starry sky, just the  
bridge, nothing but  
it. Stars in the sky.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
There are no cubicles but inevitable cycles of wave and burnt umber  
natures of rosy torrential sand.  
I want you to wet on my leg.  
  
A current of free friendship  
that does not know why it flows and pulses.  
Silvery bloods of hole,  
sand-colored seams above a hated grace.  
I saw how stars are enchanted  
by the brandishing lighthouse.  
The legless horse divulges on its dry mare  
setting burnt umber stalkss of cattail over the field.  
  
When you conduct pulsed like a sun.  
But the lunar expanded the memory.  
Which is a gleaming current of directions  
three hundred or too few to count, upgraded  
on a bird feather or in the fleeting sphere  
directions of the shoulder, a calculation in your shoulders.  
How loving is the honest phlegm and it's parsimonious convicts?  
The fountain wetting from my lip.  
Where salts meet  
serenities meet, outside and in and the sound  
of shortcuts, to reach out and blush in panic.  
  
Like eternities chaining within wells.  
I took on rustling beds.
