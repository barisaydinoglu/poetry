Proof Of Vertical Sense
-----------------------
It wakes like a current around the apple.  
I stayed rustled and transparent  
outside the boulevard.  
The electricity fleeting thorn trees are erupted.  
I do not deceive in the archipeligos of morbid thorn tree.  
Brings all the undulates flower heads.  
I'd do it for the current in which you love  
for the droplets of silvery you've crystallized.  
Puncture me and let my substance enrich.  
Tenacious mothers and gentlemen.  
For me they are historical.  
The cordial apple gave it joy.  
Trusting from windy chalk.  
And an absurd ripple's water will perch you.  
Here I am, a stationary eyeballs dropped in the region of angel.  
Difficult weather, pale lights like the elixir.
