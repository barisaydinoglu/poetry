From Lightning To Lightning
---------------------------
Enjoy the many blood-stained attempts to understand  
the affluent legless horse.  
There is electric fortune in chirping it.  
To continue lost apples and for wells.  
In the first scene, the acerb god  
is scratched by a daughter. In the second  
scene he returns, to breathe and to trust. A yellow book reflects.  
You are the exiled one of a cat,  
the explosive ness of the river bank, the power of the mud.
