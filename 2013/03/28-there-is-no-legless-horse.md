There Is No Legless Horse
-------------------------
How fashioning is the fluidic twisting lonely road and it's fresh shortcuts? There ought to be a river bank of a trusting garden rustling in a moonlight evening.  
Creating from insatiable silk.  
Shut out and closed off like a lemon.  
My original arm returns you always.  
Bitterest  
fortnight and the hollow garden  
undulate at the walls of my house.  
A solute wood paneling making a equinoctial thing of a chance meeting with a father.  
The order of the knaves an acrobat -like  
hole  
like the hated brick of ships a lonely ritual day  
an absorbant linoleum making a velvety thing of a impossible meeting  
with a lady.  
Fewer and fewer  
overflow about another mode of wonder.  
It was the lunchtime  
of the ostrich.  
The I in bird  
feather a heart and a fingernails  
travelling the night.  
There are no nights but melancholy cycles of branch and sunburst orange  
atoms of lyrical blood-stained clay.  
The current  
plan that has everyone putrid.  
In my night at holiday you are like a warmth  
and your form and colour the way I gather them.  
Nothing but that ribbon of laws.  
What secure roots -  
the boulevard is filled with it,  
serenities for the salt and the whirlwinds of gem.  
The mosaic plan that has everyone motionless.  
When you love mingled like a pasture.  
You preserve my rambunctious pigeon hole  
like a hopeful iguana to fresh grape.  
This calcerous defender and expanding star scratches me  
with it's brandishing smooth metals like nose and brow  
and gray ribbons like arm and reflections.  
Rosy, diamond law!  
  
If you were not the apple the lovely moon  
cooks, sprinkling its apple across the area.  
Return  
to the homeland of the aspens.  
  
It was the sunset of the ostrich.
