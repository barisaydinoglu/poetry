Discovering Muzzled Nostalgia
-----------------------------
Cactus was no longer below the recording threshold. From her breath and her breath stand  
mists of the earth.  
You are the wayside fisherman of a ostrich,  
the explosive ness of the utensil, the power of the sky.  
I am replaced by kis and funeral, by city and thunder.  
And the tryst to its smooth stone  
and among the sweetness the electric one  
the son covered with sensible jar.  
They coddled it with violenet necklaces.  
In your hand of animosity the heights of spheres light.  
I could shower polyp, vinegar, and acid  
from films and knaves  
with a gray cathedral  
with dusts in my tail.  
Return to the homeland of the peaces.  
In your eyelids of devouring the land begins to dream of pulsing.  
You are the cherry of my fractious lip.  
Draw from it the delirious  
machine of its own phenomenon.  
Around the night I like to circumscribe like a insatiable ship.  
Like the putrid steel of river banks full stop.  
  
Nothing but that  
praise of promises.  
But I should be untrue to computer science, fainting among its mechanical pastures  
so let us seek to speak a story devoid of aerial redundancies.
