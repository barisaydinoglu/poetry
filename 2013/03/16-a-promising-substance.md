A Promising Substance
---------------------
I'm the woman to the cathedral of immediate grace. You relax headlong into a heights to perch your business.  
Fewer and fewer  
lunge about another mode of purity.  
And so that its egoes will pity your hips.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the velvety serenities?  
And the snow original splattering its precisions and degrading them full of  
sea and jaguar?  
Pockets of metal converted into silicon.  
Of a gray father that expands prizes.  
  
It is a tale of tenacious abberations absurd weather, muzzled lights like the tryst.  
I want you to flow on my finger.  
I'd do it for the maternity in which you reflect  
for the sun rises of sepia you've began.  
For a day, maybe million,  
I rested under a harrowing wind  
at a office cubicle, waiting for the elder to be amid.  
Sometimes a piece of the water  
prosecutes like an apple in my breath.  
Return to the homeland of the circuss.
