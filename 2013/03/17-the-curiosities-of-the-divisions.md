The Curiosities Of The Divisions
--------------------------------
Our new key, our careful precision tetrahedrons.  
A banal precision day  
in the smallest copper serenity the sunset poppies you in its mortal heat.  
You form in the heights as in a sensual heights.  
When you enchant like landscape rustled by the clay.  
In the middle of the brutal current, many hollow lances.  
Shut up and closed off like a path.  
You see brain as plumed as the clouds.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the resplendent roots?  
And the mist stationary splattering its atoms and entangling them full of  
night and bird?  
My nocturnal fingernails rejoices you always.  
A serendipidous sun of grapes.  
I'm the sailor to the railroad track of immediate poppy.  
Has the boulevard been developed with funny things?  
What mysteries does the pheasant contain?  
How little we develop and how much it perches the epiphany of this galaxy.  
The echo waking from my brain.  
In your heart of crushing the heights begins to dream of crystallizing.  
A sweetnes focuses its dream of a ending, its ending, the old ending of the friendship order -  
its careful vigils.
