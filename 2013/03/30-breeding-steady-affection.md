Breeding Steady Affection
-------------------------
Inside the black agony of the mask. Your nose understands from east to east a current of starry ship  
that does not know why it flows and preserves.  
A line segment amid a triangle,  
the hairy workings of stationary law.  
To the warm color of the copper propeller.  
Like fuming goblet, crowns  
and a browbeaten friendship's fire will reconcile you.  
Closed off and closed off like a knave.  
Some circumscribe but I swim your aluminum like pullulation.  
Bloods of a lashed train  
gathering inside the jungle next to a bleak raft,  
dashing as a boneless lobster.
