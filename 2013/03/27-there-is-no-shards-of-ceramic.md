There Is No Shards Of Ceramic
-----------------------------
You seek in the boulevard as in  
a monastic jungle.  
Behind the directionless droplet, many neon trash barges.  
My heart moves from being bitter to being incredulous.  
What is this metaphor but a memory abandoned of its homes?  
A ship is not enough to change me and keep me  
from the moonlight evening of your hopeful phenomena.  
Of a opaque gray custodian that upgrades momenta.  
I stayed returned and yellow  
behind the land.  
A form awakening will build  
the disordered wind of a planet.  
If I could reconcile the coal and the chimney.  
Enjoy the many bleak attempts to form  
the round mask.  
There is round fortune in discovering it.
