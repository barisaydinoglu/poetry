Since The End Of Shining
------------------------
Green masks of womb,  
crimson seams above a negligent evening star.  
I took on misunderstood bridges.  
Deep brown smokes of vagina,  
cinnamon seams above a negligent mist.  
And the garden to its rose  
and among the pullulations the musical one  
the pioneer covered with eager elixir.  
Mixing toward the friendship multitude of opaque sand-colored lakes!  
In and out of the sunburst orange the crimson and the deep brown  
fewer and fewer  
abduct about another mode of love.  
In the middle of the calculating vein, many negligent imbroglios.  
I want you to seize on my eyelids.  
Not the cinnamon moment  
when the twilight loves the trysts.  
  
A musical thunder of deep brown lakes.  
And the river to its aspen  
and among the elixirs the velvety one  
the aunt covered with handsome coral.
