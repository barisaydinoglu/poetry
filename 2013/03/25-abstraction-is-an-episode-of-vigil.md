Abstraction Is An Episode Of Vigil
----------------------------------
Towards those poppies of yours that wait for me.  
Only senile and to a  
sailor they take on time, too few to count years  
be guided by the slender precision's poppy.  
Pure, wooden landscape!  
You weave headlong into a university to fashion your business.  
Shall we keep going?  
You - the ancient brain.  
The parsimonious utensils scratched I wish to make a triangle  
with, and every sense, many  
times hidden in a smooth stone.  
How beginning is the gleaming dust and it's hopeful self-productions?  
Return to the homeland of the faucets.  
Neither bell nor poppy nor turqoise  
nor transluscent sunburst orange but sunburst orange.
