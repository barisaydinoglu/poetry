Proof Of Naked Feeling
----------------------
She is under us at this moment of first pacifying.  
If you were not the bread the indespensable moon  
cooks, sprinkling its peach across the field.  
In the middle of the fire-tipped home, many obscene receptacles.  
Draw from it the harsh  
calculation of its own detail.  
Felicity is gone, the subject has recovered.  
What seems disjoint to one will  
not seem so to another.  
What unguessed railroad tracks -  
the divisions is filled with it,  
smooth stones for the shades of yellow and the furious chalk.  
In the face of so many brambles to animosity.  
And a burned-out flint's jungle will gallop you.  
And roses and bells.
