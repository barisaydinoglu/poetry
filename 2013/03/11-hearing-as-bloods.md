Hearing As Bloods
-----------------
Lighting toward the umbrella I do not devour in the moonlight evening of lonely belt.  
The jungle delicious traps are forced.  
Like lightnings sobbing inside angels.  
If I could begin the probe and the night.  
  
I want you to attract on my hand.  
A loaf of bread baked with whirlwinds of honor and salt.
