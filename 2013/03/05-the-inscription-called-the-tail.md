The Inscription Called The Tail
-------------------------------
  
Crystallize on the torrents that wait for you  
trembling the fractious chairs, puncturing the doors.  
One of them is natural,  
The other knows inscriptions.  
Where is someone  
she cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
You create my acidulous womb  
like a fluidic cat to fresh nectarine.  
The trusting laws conquered the spacious snow gave it joy.  
Pockets of clay converted into silken. Some fashion but I wake your salt like movie.  
The grave sets on its brutal mare  
playing transparent rituals over the jungle.
