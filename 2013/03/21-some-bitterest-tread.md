Some Bitterest Tread
--------------------
Of honest orange, spirit  
of the tigers,  
mourned bride blood, your kisses  
pulse into exile  
and a droplet of crystal, with remnants of the night. For a day, maybe thousand,  
I rested under a unrelenting rain  
at a post office, waiting for the sailor to be outside.  
The jungle sensual panics are prosecuted.  
  
A chorus of squirrels at early light of day un wove un undulated  
comes to a halt before a landscape.  
Not the deep brown moment  
when the sunrise awakens the beds.
