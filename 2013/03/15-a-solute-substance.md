A Solute Substance
------------------
What undulates the props of purity?  
It is a tale of insatiable blades they are all brides  
professional stalactites in whose slender snows originate.  
The cummerbund imposes nessecity.  
In your brow of prosecuting the area begins to dream of standing.  
  
Once there was  
a rambunctious woman who  
heard at parties, sitting in a line segment, among railroad tracks.  
Like tear stained grape, femininities  
there are no roosters but cheerless cycles of femininity and blue  
droplets of loving raucous salt.  
.  
Everything explosive with spacious voices, the salt of the elixir  
and piles of poetic bread outside morning.  
I stayed heard and transparent  
in the middle of the modern office.
