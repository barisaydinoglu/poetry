The Furious Uncle Of The Boulevard
----------------------------------
My friendly ears blushes you always. I do not condemn in the room of obscene rotten stump.  
A tremulous study abhors  
even the lyrical  
technical vicinity in detail  
to which the metaphor  
will not be woke.  
  
Here I am, a indespensable eyeballs coagulated in the moonlight evening of fellowship.  
Come with me to the depth of puberties.
