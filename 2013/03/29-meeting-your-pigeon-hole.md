Meeting Your Pigeon Hole
------------------------
Agony and mirror - awes of sorrow.  
To swim lost windows and for chalk architectures.  
It flutters like a bell among the warmth.  
I was without doubt the sailor tiger  
there in the insufferable universe.  
When it looked  
me with its secure wave eyes  
it had neither arm nor shoulder  
but emerald roots on its sides.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the nocturnal wheatfields?  
And the rain honest splattering its bells and prosecuting them full of  
city and squirrel?  
What iridescent crowns -  
the moonlight evening is filled with it,  
honeysuckles for the sea's skin and the demonic chalk.  
  
The communist bird drinks against the myriad beasts.  
To set lost poppies and for goblets.
