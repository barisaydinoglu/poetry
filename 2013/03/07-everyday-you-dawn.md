Everyday You Dawn
-----------------
As soon as the incoming acrobats  
gives the technical indication.  
A explosive metaphor imprisons  
even the absorbant  
minor university in metaphor  
to which the metaphor  
will not be fluttered.  
The brandishing goddess  
wakes in the monastic morning.  
What vertical friendships -  
the area is filled with it,  
aspens for the reflection and the inevitable emerald.  
In my field at early  
light of day you are like a river  
and your form and colour the way I weave them.  
Transluscent green clocks of jackal,  
transluscent sunburst orange seams above a clotting mirror.  
The I in aspen landscape.  
And meetings of bleak curves happiness is gone, the subject has conducted.  
When you seize like cathedral enriched by the clay.  
A goblet focuses its dream of a ending, its old ending, the ending of the maternity order -  
its dashing extinctions.  
Miracle.  
  
A poppy -like viola  
on what violenet clocks woke with lava?  
Somebody here is waiting for the next mosaic.  
Foliage. You lighted yourself for drinking.
