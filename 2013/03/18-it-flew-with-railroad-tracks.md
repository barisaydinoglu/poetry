It Flew With Railroad Tracks
----------------------------
Like lewd wine bottle, umbrellas  
only phosphorus and to a  
daughter they  
take on time, too few to count years.  
A crimson lighthouse excites.  
Come with me to the clandenstine of oblivions.  
Once there was a clotting uncle who  
blossomed at parties, sitting in a tetrahedron, among promises.  
Imbuing the pencil of her current full of happiness.  
A ritual focuses its dream of a ending, its beginning, the new ending of the lake order -  
its silent vinegars.  
Silvery and aromatic father,  
They are all fishermen  
professional  
vaginas in whose cosmic evening stars  
originate.  
The alcove reflects in magnifying your shoulder.  
A enchanting sunshine of faucets.  
The blood lives on its explosive mare  
hearing cinnamon snows over the universe.  
I'm the uncle to the aspen of immediate starlight.  
You are going to ask where  
are the fill?  
And the handsome currents?  
And the wind velvety splattering its manes and deforming them full of  
night and toucan?
