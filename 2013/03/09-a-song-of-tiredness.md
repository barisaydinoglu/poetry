A Song Of Tiredness
-------------------
A calculation for point of view is the lack thereof.  
This raucous honeysuckle and perfuming cedar architecture protests me  
with it's  
pure kisses like eyelids and brain  
and brimstone serendipities like fingernails and cork architectures.  
On what chaotic invasions sought with heat?  
You've asked  
me what the lobster is loving there with his sepia nose?  
I reply, the flesh knows this.  
If I could relax the stain and the divisions.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
hear of sea water and serendipities  
and the cosmic schools of his native land?  
  
Like the mechanical rusted nail of graces he is against us at this moment of first reflecting.
