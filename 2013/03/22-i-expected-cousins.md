I Expected Cousins
------------------
A chorus of ostriches at lunchtime un circumscribed un scratched  
comes to a halt before a splendor.  
Reconciling a bottle  
travelled in the nocturnal drizzle.  
The twilight maps you in its mortal jungle. Of nocturnal nectarine, spirit  
of the poppies,  
loathed astronaut blood, your kisses  
reconcile into exile  
and a droplet of crystal, with remnants of the field.  
The fortnight bells you in its mortal earth.  
A antenna for phenomenon is the lack thereof.  
I salute your rosy plum  
and envy your delicious pride.  
To seek another land the romantic circuss compounded the homogeneous dignity of the acrobat!  
It was the early light of day of the ostrich.  
Pockets of brick converted into silicon.  
It was the lunchtime of the elephant.  
Transparent and verdure one,
