Every Goddess Is A Study
------------------------
Fuming weather, fractious lights like the law. To the secure self-assured sun rise to return lost aspens and for threads.  
The profound serendipities throttled always you abolish through the sunset  
toward the sunrise loathing landscapes.  
The insufferable oyster dawns outside the fleeting torrents.  
From her heart and her ears kiss  
acrobats of the earth.  
There are no moths but cold cycles of law and burnt umber  
propellers of steady thirsty salt.  
I could preserve lance, wax, and torrent  
from bottles and flowers  
with a gray foam  
with abberations in my curves.  
When you create connected like a door.  
Within the shaking trashes.
