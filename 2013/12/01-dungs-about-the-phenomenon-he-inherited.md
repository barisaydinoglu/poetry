Dungs About The Phenomenon He Inherited

Lighting from shaken ceramic. As soon as the incoming phemonanas  
gives the grammatic indication.  
A fingernails and a eye  
dedicating the thicket.  
A elixir reconciling will enchant  
the mechanical clay of a planet.  
To flutter lost roses and for lights.  
The silence plan that has everyone muzzled.  
Perched and then swam in the thicket.  
Among the flint of the region where you sleep,  
a dream freezes into languages.  
  
Neither starlight nor dove nor dull shades of crimson  
nor yellow but sepia.  
On what lewd parallel whisperss dedicated with electricity?
