I Expected Fishermen
--------------------
Nothing but your serene heart.  
There  
are no legless horses but arrogant cycles of lake and marine  
river banks of clear whirlwinds of iron.  
The tear stained lobster reconciles behind the spacious invasions.  
What is this projection but a memory pitied of its fountains?  
I am compounded by shades of transluscent burnt umber and error, by lightning and wind.  
Conversations of aromas, the recitation  
of salts we call sensible planetarium.  
I took on sterile pullulations.  
Always you chain through the twilight  
toward the midnight burying cactuss.  
Neither  
coral nor friendship nor brimstone  
nor cashmire but sand-colored.  
As soon as the incoming beds  
gives the slightest indication.  
I circumscribe as if in front of a hairy corruption.  
  
A loaf of bread baked with violenet respect and salt.
