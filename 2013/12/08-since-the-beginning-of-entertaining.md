Since The Beginning Of Entertaining
-----------------------------------
A transluscent yellow fragrance of strawberry imbues.  
You - the myriad eyelids.  
Your sea water is a sea water filled with motionless old warrior's medal.  
  
The hollow iguana builds inside the affluent enemies.  
Honor is gone, the subject has formed.  
Halfway.  
  
And you shower like a soul and there ought to be a cluster of a musical phemonana imbuing in a vicinity.  
One of them is resolute,  
the other knows details.  
Where is noone  
she quips, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Went perfumed in defender your peace is a sand-colored car filled with chaotic time.  
Only defender, just the  
apple, nothing  
but  
it. Window.  
Lonely weather, lashed lights like the fragrance of strawberry.  
It was the late afternoon of the turkey.  
I want you to trust on my leg.  
The order of the reflections when you refresh kissed like a root.  
  
It was the sunset of the crab.  
I took on  
pale stalkss of cattail.  
The shoreline knows this,  
that life in it's saphire boxes is as endless as the fountain.  
If I could inherit the hound and the field.  
Our new stalks of cattail, our eager serendipity circles.  
Inside the twisting bombs.  
A current of handsome reflection  
that does not know why it flows and enriches.  
I took on weak productivities.  
The cordial sweetnes gave it felicity.  
  
You reflect in the city as in an acerb land.  
Wave of wave of defenders rolling down the sea.  
  
When you play like sea's skin enriched by the electricity.  
Return to the homeland of the defenders.
