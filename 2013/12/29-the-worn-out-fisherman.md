The Worn-out Fisherman
----------------------
Hearing toward the flint the lashed juice is sensual on your lip.  
It is a tale of acidulous waxes come with me to the wasteland of nougats.  
You've asked me what the cat is rescuing there with his transluscent marine toe?  
I reply, the wine bottle knows this.  
From her ears and her toe return  
promises of the earth.  
The I in elixir only motionless and to a  
son they take on time, too few to count years  
only warmth of your body, just the  
banner, nothing but  
it. Opaque transluscent yellow car.  
  
Our new flesh, our irreducable sea water triangles.  
Somebody here is waiting for the next bird feather.  
Dove. You built yourself for transforming.  
A computer for phenomenon is the lack thereof.  
The humble crown gave it respect.
