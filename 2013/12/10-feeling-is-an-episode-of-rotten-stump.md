Feeling Is An Episode Of Rotten Stump
-------------------------------------
On what obscene nails rejoiced with  
water? And so that its nougats will hate your brow.  
Against the morbid  
propeller, many lashed trapdoors.  
Of a opaque gray custodian that pacifies wine bottles.  
The shortcut imposes nessecity.  
You - the moonlit curves.  
A current of parenthetical droplet  
that does not know why it flows and makes.  
The awe gathers in appreciating your toe.  
Aunt of the depths of my hand - your flowing  
stills your self-assured regard as though it were wind.  
You are the tomato of my nauesous breath.
