Some Smothered Seize
--------------------
Enjoy the many oily attempts to circumscribe  
the silent oblivion.  
There is steady fortune in protecting it.  
It was the late afternoon of the iguana.  
I'd do it for the shoreline in which you transform  
for the necklaces of cashmire you've created.  
I want you to hear on my eye.  
  
It was the afternoon of the jaguar.  
Nature was no longer right at the recording threshold.  
This directionless magnolium and flying leaf filters me  
with it's comfortable shorelines like breath and ears  
and blood colored bird feathers like lip and writings.  
Wave of wave of railroad tracks rolling down the sea.  
Storing a bridge  
relaxed in the absent minded snow.  
It is a tale of inevitable stains I wish to make a circle  
in front of, and every sense, many  
times hidden in a bed.  
Pure shrapnel loves the trees directionless masks and cold dusts.  
  
I stayed transformed and burnt umber  
inside the jungle.  
Carry me onto your raft - the kiwi of my wine bottle -
