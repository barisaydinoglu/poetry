It Woke With Keys
-----------------
You are the frail father of a tiger,  
the hairy ness of the bridge, the power of the clay.  
I took on inevitable cactuss.  
A thunder of books there are no thorn trees but arrogant cycles of necklace and transluscent transparent  
quivers of enchanting shifty iron.  
The chimney outside hers  
a history we divulge in passing,  
with notions of tiredness  
and a passion for science and science  
crimson ice to my sordid starry sky!  
With its tenacious wake I want you to appreciate on my mouth.  
I'd do it for the sphere in which you flutter  
for the souls of transparent you've developed.  
What absent minded saxophones -  
the land is filled with it,  
praises for the magnolium and the acidulous silk.  
A line segment in front of a quadrangle,  
the morose workings of full law.  
In cinnamon water and sand-colored silences.  
Not dawning is a form of forming.  
Fluttering from inevitable copper.  
Carry me onto your helicopter - the lemon of my hat -  
we get the abstraction  
they must lots to breathe  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but enemies.  
Perhaps they are not loathed.  
  
When you grow like springtime gathered by the lava.  
The indespensable land gave it respect.
