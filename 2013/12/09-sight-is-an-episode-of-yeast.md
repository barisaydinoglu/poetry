Sight Is An Episode Of Yeast
----------------------------
Bottle of a throttled boneless flint.  
Your mosaic is a window filled with  
boney eddy.  
A lethargic mane day  
because I love you, love, inside the ice and outside the fire.  
One public option and brings all the faints lakes.  
A quadrangle next to a quadrangle,  
the sordid workings of natural law.  
The twilight smooth stones you in its mortal electricity.  
  
Where fleshes meet  
springtimes meet, with and inside and the sound  
of imbroglios, to reach out and perfume in fear.  
Shall we go forward?  
I pulse as if in a dilute vagina.  
I saw how ribbons are flowed  
by the ancient quiver.
