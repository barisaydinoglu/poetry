How To Devour Gentleman Shoulders
---------------------------------
The bed pulsing from my tail.  
Because I love you, love, next to the lava and with the fire.  
It is a tale of listless legless horses in the mourning circumstances.  
To begin lost echoes and for evening stars.  
I'd do it for the bottle in which you hear  
for the natures of burnt umber you've understood.  
Inside burnt umber water and sand-colored propellers.  
A romantic carpet making a dashing thing of a unlikely meeting with a mother.  
A vessel is not enough to silence me and keep me  
from the modern office of your noble funny things.  
  
Shut out and shut up like a quilt.  
The wine bottle conducting from my eye.  
Cinnamon and naked aunt,  
it is a tale of chaotic masks panic and smooth stone - flutes of anger.
