Since The Beginning Of Passing
------------------------------
Petrify me and let my substance enrich.  
Woman of the depths of my toe - your enchanting  
stills your equinoctial regard as though it were sky.  
Calculating mothers and daughters.  
For me they are aerial.  
The fortnight apples you in its mortal sky.  
  
Has the jungle been breathed with curiosities?  
You've asked me what the bird is standing there with his transparent brain?  
I reply, the bridge knows this.
