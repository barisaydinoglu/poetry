The Machine Called The Curves
-----------------------------
I'd do it for the poppy in which you excite  
for the hearts of sepia you've discovered.  
Silvery and indespensable father,  
You create slowly into a vicinity to love your business.  
A smooth stone storing will shine  
the windy lightning of a planet.  
It treads like a branch among the flesh.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
relax of river banks and roots  
and the slender femininities of his native land?
