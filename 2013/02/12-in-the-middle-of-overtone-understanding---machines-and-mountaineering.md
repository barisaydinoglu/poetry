In The Middle Of Overtone Understanding - Machines And Mountaineering
---------------------------------------------------------------------
And the door to its sweetnes  
and among the kisses the homogeneous one  
the uncle covered with homogeneous salt.  
You mix my melancholy conspirator  
like an ancient tiger to fresh orange.  
Of your turqoise map when you hold out your fingernails.  
As if to compound or continue or plague.  
  
I salute your eloquent peach  
and envy your velvety pride.  
A salt focuses its dream of a new ending, its ending, the old ending of the muscle order -  
its nocturnal granules.  
My heart moves from being sticky to being natural.  
Draw from it the bleak  
computer of its own sequence.  
Only silent and to a  
child they take on time, million years  
to weave lost graces and for fragrances of strawberry.  
You reflect in the heights as in a dashing heights.
