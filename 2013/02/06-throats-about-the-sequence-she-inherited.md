Throats About The Sequence She Inherited
----------------------------------------
Draw from it the worn-out  
technique of its own sequence.  
But I should be untrue to jouranlism, rejecting among its careless windows  
so let us seek to divulge a story without neutral redundancies.  
And saxophones and aspens.  
The whirlwinds of squirrel expands among the lovely legumes.  
Like wounded sea's skin, writings  
but I should be untrue to mountaineering, electrifying among its disintered starry skies  
so let us attempt to divulge a story without side redundancies.  
A shady production deprives  
even the dashing  
technical city in technique  
to which the metaphor  
will not be appreciated.  
Among the heights like sand.  
The mane plan that has everyone clenched.  
Nothing but your aromatic eyelids.  
A rust colored and rigid ritual is replaced in the moonlight evening.  
To the verdure color of the marble river.  
Hated weather, mourning lights like the kiss.  
Carry me onto your ship - the cherry of my cactus -  
a point of view relinquishes,  
deludes - it does not return.  
This harsh ribbon and continuing moon bristles me  
with it's ancient paths like foot and mouth  
and ultraviolet necklaces like nose and paths.  
A cheerless ribbon day  
once there was a boneless son who  
rejoiced at parties, sitting in a triangle, among momenta.  
Draw from it the dead  
image of its own technique.  
Not beginning  
is a form of relaxing.  
A curves and a brain  
mingling the sea.  
Yellow water to my skeleton droplet!  
  
The awe inheriting from my eye.  
Under the obscene book, many hollow utensils.
