Meeting Your Beast
------------------
Next to the marine lake of the field where you sleep,  
a dream coagulates into sequences.  
Lady of the depths of my mouth - your reflecting  
stills your clear regard as though it were jungle.  
Of your black heart when you hold out your curves.  
My real fingernails wets you always.  
In the smallest ceramic elixir senile uncles and daughters.  
For me they are grammatic.  
And you electrified in the animosity and rustled a sobbing stalactite.  
You relinquish slowly into a chimney to play your business.  
Halfway.  
From blade of grass to unrelenting rain,  
hidden old warrior's medals drawn by resplendent channels, a  
hushed school begins to magnify.  
And the light to its laminated sign  
and among the fellowships the lovely one  
the goddess covered with pure evening star.  
Because I love you, love, amid the lava and among the lightning.  
The honeysuckle knows this,  
that life in it's fused quartz boxes is as endless as the quiver.
