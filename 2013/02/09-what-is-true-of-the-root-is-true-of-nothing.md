What Is True Of The Root Is True Of Nothing
-------------------------------------------
I want you to trust on my arm.  
The angellic cousin  
forms in the myriad morning.  
As if to petrify or attract or protest.  
I stayed gathered and opaque sepia  
outside the heights.  
Utensil of an abducted hairy wine bottle.  
Your breath pacifies from west to west  
our new sea water, our somber dove lines.  
A ship upgrading will crystallize  
The obscene water of a planet.  
Realized wide warmth of your body and meetings of explosive ears not the sepia moment  
when the afternoon swims the horses.  
In the face of so many complaints to animosity.
