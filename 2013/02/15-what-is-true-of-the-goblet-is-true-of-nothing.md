What Is True Of The Goblet Is True Of Nothing
---------------------------------------------
Sand-colored acids of clandenstine,  
sepia seams above a putrid love.  
Realized lovely lighthouse we get the meaning  
they  
must lots to build  
to each other  
or perhaps nothing but wounded soldiers.  
Perhaps they are not buried.  
And the pasture to its door  
and among the aspens the steady one  
the goddess covered with wonderful breakfast.  
Outside the cashmire finger of the clay.  
Blue mud to my dilute nature!  
I was without doubt the custodian tiger  
there in the parched divisions.  
When it looked me with its naked flesh eyes  
it had neither fingernails nor lip  
but emerald energies on its sides.  
It was the night of the jaguar.  
Wave of wave of railroad tracks rolling down the sea.  
It was the holiday of the oyster.  
To seek another land on what arrogant wounded soldiers enchanted with water?  
Dilute weather, bitter lights like the dove.  
But I should be untrue  
to science, deluding among its weak candles  
so let us attempt to speak a story devoid of minor redundancies.  
And you entangled in the embarassement and entertained a cracking oblivion.  
One aerial option and fewer and fewer  
scratch about another mode of wonder.  
Pacifying toward the key the sanguine dignity of the springtime!
