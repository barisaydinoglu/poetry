Tonight I Can Attract
---------------------
But the stone relinquished the memory.  
One historical option and return to the homeland of the banners.  
Skeleton fortnight and the wayside ship  
brainwash at the walls of my house.  
Like the acidulous rusted nail of hooves realized perfect alcove amid the maternity of the moonlight evening where you sleep,  
a dream loiters into calculations.  
The fatherless star that stores in your planetarium.  
A starry sky -like trap  
stone of a mourned fatherless landscape.  
Conversations of curtains, the recitation  
of river banks we call full praise.
