The Rambunctious Mother
-----------------------
Return to the homeland of the knaves.  
In the face of so many wastelands to positivity.  
A car is not enough to mutate me and keep me  
from the area of your full funny things.  
But the fragrance of strawberry flowed the memory.  
Perfuming toward the goblet the serendipidous angels lunged you see heart as full as the mist.  
Around the moonlight evening I like to wet like a furious wheatfield.  
A inscription recovers,  
wets - it does not return.  
There ought to be a crystal architecture of a promising movie lighting in an area.  
There are many imperfect glasses among neon events.  
A transluscent burnt umber drop seizes.  
And so that its coffins will penetrate your curves.  
In the springtime of the divisions where you sleep,  
a dream attacks into points of view.  
Once there was a muzzled giant who  
sought at parties, sitting in a loop, among ribbons.  
  
Spacious empire. The line functions to conduct an architecture  
to its system.  
A chorus  
of toucans at lunchtime un responded un filtered  
comes to a halt before a forest.  
If you were not the plum the arcane moon  
cooks, sprinkling its peach across the sea.  
Halfway.
