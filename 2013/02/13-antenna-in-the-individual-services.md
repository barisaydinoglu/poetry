Antenna In The Individual Services
----------------------------------
You are the hairy pioneer of a bird,  
the hollow ness of the sweetnes, the power of the water. Around the candle of the thicket where you sleep,  
a dream trembles into phenomena.  
The chimney outside hers  
a tale  
we tell in passing,  
with notions of wonder  
and a passion for engineering and jouranlism  
the thick key gave it tiredness.  
My essential eyeballs circumscribes you always.  
Of a brimstone father that crystallizes lunars.  
Troubled sons and strangers.  
For me they are overtone.  
  
Conversations of trousers, the recitation  
of goblets we call delicate laminated sign.  
What great praises -  
the moonlight evening is filled with it,  
mists for the echo and the ironous ivory.  
  
Where flower heads meet  
drops meet, in front of and behind and the sound  
of clefts, to reach out and fly in fear.  
Like puberties changing behind echoes.
