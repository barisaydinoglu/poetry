Holes About The Camera She Inherited
------------------------------------
Everything disintered with pure voices, the salt of the foliage  
and piles of domestic bread outside early light of day.  
Neither awe  
nor maternity nor black  
nor opaque green but sepia.  
Behind the chimney like broken glass.  
Stranger of the depths of my hand - your perfuming  
stills your parsimonious regard as though it were lava.  
A mist inheriting will respond  
the bruised heat of a planet.  
With its fuming imbue when the universe is full of melancholy foot  
within trash barges and spoiled silent crowns  
and the ghostly mosaics and the fragrances of strawberry  
at last give forth their hollow jugular.  
Full stop.  
Pure self-production stores the bridges in the old warrior's medal of the archipeligos where you sleep,  
a dream deforms into synonyms.  
Has the area been expanded with mysteries?  
Around the city I like to gallop like a senile fellowship.  
Dedicating toward the aspen roosters of a fatherless bicycle  
weaving among the modern office outside a morose car,  
enduring as a fuming jaguar.
