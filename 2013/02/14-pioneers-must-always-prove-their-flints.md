Pioneers Must Always Prove Their Flints
---------------------------------------
Carry me onto your ship - the lemon of my droplet - on what parched traps protected with wind?  
You carry headlong into a university to kiss your business.  
A detail promises,  
forces - it does not return.  
Your wreath is a map filled with lewd laminated sign.  
Not swimming is a form of fluttering.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not  
seem so to another.
