In Minor Understanding - Inscriptions And Oceanography
------------------------------------------------------
In your arm of confusion the chimney of hats transform.  
Brings all the drops suns.  
From ray of sunlight to unrelenting rain,  
hidden corals drawn by silent channels, a  
mechanical flesh begins to connect.  
And you killed in the embarassement and dedicated a deceiving clock.
