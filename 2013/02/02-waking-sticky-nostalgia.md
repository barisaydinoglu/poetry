Waking Sticky Nostalgia
-----------------------
The blade swims on its neurotic mare  
rising sepia cathedrals over the land.  
A quadrangle with a square,  
the inevitable workings of thick law.  
A yellow bed mixes.  
And outside my hammock, during the holiday, I woke up naked  
and full of decency.  
A old warrior's medal focuses its dream of a beginning, its beginning, the beginning of the star order -  
its domestic hounds.
