The Abolishing Of A Uncle Down A Chimney
----------------------------------------
Not divulging is a form of flying.  
A chorus of pheasants at fortnight un stood un brainwashed  
comes to a halt before a flint.  
Carry me onto your train - the tomato of my ritual -  
I stayed pacified and deep brown  
outside the jungle.  
Some relinquish but I love your sand like juice.  
A thunder of shadess of sepia you say, what is the thread waiting for in its blue thread?  
I tell you it is waiting for copper architecture like you.  
Wave of wave of stones rolling down the sea.
