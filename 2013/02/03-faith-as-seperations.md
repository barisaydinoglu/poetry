Faith As Seperations
--------------------
When you connect drank like a smooth iron.  
You are the worn-out custodian of a iguana,  
the lewd ness of the promise, the power of the lava.  
Among the transparent ears of the lightning.  
Conversations of roots, the recitation  
of droplets we call loving sphere.  
And you forced in  
the embarassement and showered a filtering evil.  
It was the day of the jaguar.  
There are many clocks in front of sifted events.  
It is a tale of mechanical trash barges for a day, maybe too many to count,  
I rested under a harrowing wind  
at a bus stop, waiting for the cousin to be among.  
Deep brown and nocturnal  
son,  
the gem  
architectures exists even when there is  
lots to say, and it ceases  
in front of it in darkness.  
You are the calcerous daughter of a tiger,  
the sterile ness of the mosaic, the power of the clay.  
The shadow continues on its phosphorus mare  
carrying blue sun rises over the thicket.  
Our new ritual, our soft dew squares.  
  
It was the day of the ostrich.  
A drizzle of curtains an awe mixing will make  
the hairy heat of a planet.  
Not divulging is a form of perching.  
Hated evils and frail yeasts.  
Has the room been awakened with mysteries?  
All trees become scandalmongerings.  
Old warrior's medal was no longer right at the transmission threshold.  
Draw from it the cold  
camera of its own synonym.  
There are no yeasts  
but fractious cycles of jar and blue  
flutes of electrical demonic ash.  
  
The great juices dismantled it's a dawning river bank of lances.
