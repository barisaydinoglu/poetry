Detail With The Throat
----------------------
Not the yellow moment  
when the morning  
forms the snows.  
It's a hearing flint of clandenstines.  
Sepia extinctions of shortcut,  
sepia seams above a disordered poppy.  
The cousin smiles at the person  
but the son does not smile  
when he looks at the tiger gentleman  
and the wayside ocean.  
I do not wet in the boulevard of rustling lightning.  
From her eyelids and her hand wake  
hearts of the earth.  
  
Because I love  
you, love, with the water and in the lightning.  
And you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
grow of movies and miracles  
and the iridescent mists of his native land?
