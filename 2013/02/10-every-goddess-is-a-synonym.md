Every Goddess Is A Synonym
--------------------------
As if to throttle or seize or freeze.  
So the irreducable purity lives on in an apple,  
the blazing house of the starlight,  
the manly bottle that is nocturnal and warm.  
In your hand of illusion the area of umbrellas begin.  
A projection wakes,  
pities - it does not return.  
My heart moves from being windy to being lovely.  
A delicious wood paneling making a hopeful thing of a chance meeting with a cousin.  
Chirped and then preserved in the night.  
The sea water excites in drinking your leg.
