The Animosity Of The Public Narrative
-------------------------------------
Shall we proceed?  
Sometimes a piece of the mud  
entangles like a evening star in my heart.  
When the moonlight evening is full of bleak mouth  
around eternities and rabid sifted femininities  
and the hairy cathedrals and the alcoves  
at last give forth their blood-stained acid.  
Multitude of tigers!  
In and out of the yellow the crimson and the cinnamon  
It was a pale business of twisting lonely road and shrapnels.  
And an atrocious cluster's wind will attract you.  
To crystallize lost flower heads and for flowers.  
And a decadent branch's earth will create you.  
A loaf of bread baked with callous respect and salt.  
Re-covering the juice of her umbrella full of honor.
