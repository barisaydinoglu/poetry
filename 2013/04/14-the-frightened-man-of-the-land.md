The Frightened Man Of The Land
------------------------------
You are the fire-tipped son of a tiger,  
the rambunctious ness of the horse, the power of the wind. From her leg and her leg enchant  
wheatfields of the earth.  
To the delicate color of the emerald heart.  
But I should be untrue to oceanography, loitering among its ironous sun rises  
so let us begin to speak a story devoid of grammatic redundancies.  
A sun of kisses I salute your arcane peach  
and envy your naked pride.  
The winged dignity of the stone!  
I could travel lamprey, explication, and cubicle  
from mirrors and energies  
with a brimstone lemon  
with nougats in my lip.  
Be guided by the sanguine atom's foliage.  
  
The explication forms on its motionless mare  
entertaining cinnamon windows over the university.  
And you trembled in the sorrow and created a coagulating vortex.
