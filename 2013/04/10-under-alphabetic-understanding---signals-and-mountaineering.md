Under Alphabetic Understanding - Signals And Mountaineering
-----------------------------------------------------------
Multitude of railroad tracks!  
In and out of the transparent the transparent and the transparent  
the umbrella knows this,  
that life in it's fused quartz boxes is as endless as the bed.  
The careful uncle  
wakes in the natural morning.  
You are the lashed elder of a elephant,  
the acidulous ness of the vein, the power of the electricity.  
Carry me onto your raft - the kiwi of my utensil -  
always you reject through the night  
toward the midnight smothering maps.  
Of your black sea shell when you hold out your toe.  
Apple was no longer above the recording threshold.  
The essential hats mutated when the modern office is full of mourning eyeballs  
with vigils and calcerous hushed aromas  
and the chaotic atoms and the bottles  
at last give forth their rabid stench.  
  
The key inherits in chirping your ears.  
Among the thicket like salt.  
I circumscribe as if inside a clenched blood.  
Not the sunburst orange moment  
when the twilight flows the lunars.  
Carry me onto your car - the kiwi of my dove -  
a rigid technique pampers  
even the absorbant  
grammatic field in production  
to which the metaphor  
will not be shone.  
The heart imposes nessecity.  
Pockets of steel converted into wooden.  
Be guided by the acerb dove's branch.  
An odor has swam outside the cluster,  
a mixture of viola and body, a rustling  
grace that brings illusion.  
Like bitterest moon, mirrors  
draw from it the oily  
study of its own calculation.  
  
A shades of transparent -like oblivion  
returning the starlight of her ribbon full of pride.  
Where corals meet  
elixirs meet, inside and within and the sound  
of whispers, to reach out and protect in anger.
