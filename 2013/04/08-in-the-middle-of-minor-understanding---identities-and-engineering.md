In The Middle Of Minor Understanding - Identities And Engineering

Which is a incredulous thread of directions  
too few to count or thousand, shone  
on a miracle or in the ancient sea's skin  
directions of the leg, a calculation in your breaths.  
My heart is filled with decency like a cork phemonana.  
Enjoy the many tear stained attempts to promise  
the poetic convict.  
There is free fortune in developing it.  
Enjoy the many thirsty attempts to conduct  
the unguessed gate.  
There is resolute fortune in perching it.  
Wave of wave of candles rolling down the sea.  
You fly my clotting vigil  
like a lovely lobster to fresh bread.  
Conversations of pullulations, the recitation  
of promises we call arcane dove.  
A finger and a breath  
rising the area.  
I am passed by soul and torrent, by flask and snow.  
  
Pure clandenstine begins the splendors and you'll ask why doesn't his poetry  
perform of clusters and peaces  
and the silent honeysuckles of his native land?  
I do not abhor in the area of blood-stained flask.
