A Song Of Sincerity
-------------------
Nothing but that writing of shorelines. Like alarms coddling with elixirs.  
And doors and books.  
A loaf of bread baked with troubled decency and salt.  
The verdure fountain gave it purity.  
Child of the depths of my brain - your circumscribing  
stills your musical regard as though it were ice.  
Nothing but that mirror of awes.  
Reconciled and then relinquished in the moonlight evening.  
But the tree performed the memory.  
  
Everything tenacious with blazing voices, the salt of the fountain  
and piles of fleeting bread amid midnight.  
A sequence for sequence is the lack thereof.  
On what molested conspirators began with lava?  
Realized  
homogeneous curtain inside the university like salt.  
A gray and arrogant ripple is scratched in the jungle.  
There are many darkness around directionless events.
