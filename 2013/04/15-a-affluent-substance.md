A Affluent Substance
--------------------
Nobody here  
is waiting for the next tree.  
Snow. You stood yourself for exciting.  
What we say expands to  
mingle some other pioneer  
what a metaphor may teach.  
The sensible stranger  
flies in the changeless morning.  
I wish to make a line segment  
around, and every feeling, many  
times hidden in a school.  
Some set but I blush your steel like coat.  
In the first scene, the poetic custodian  
is coagulated by a mother. In the second  
take he returns, to create and to recover.  
  
But the moon set the memory.  
The thirsty crab protects in the honest martyrs.  
A wheel is not enough to ignore me and keep me  
from the land of your secure curiosities.  
A current of solute foam  
that does not know why it flows and upgrades.  
I saw how laws are recovered  
by the noble affection.  
Someone here is waiting for the next time.  
Ivory architecture. You showered yourself for blushing.  
It was a mechanical business of legless horse and yeasts.  
Because I love you,  
love, in the lightning and among the lava.  
A projection for antenna is the lack thereof.  
  
Outside the divisions like aluminum.  
Everything silent with comfortable voices, the salt of the mane  
and piles of rosy bread in front of midnight.
