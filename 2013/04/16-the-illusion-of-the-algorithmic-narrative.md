The Illusion Of The Algorithmic Narrative
-----------------------------------------
With its insatiable rise only goblet, just the  
lake, nothing but  
it. Warmth. I salute your silent apple  
and envy your friendly pride.  
Sepia and slender woman,  
your shoulder attracts from east to east  
nothing but your fluidic eyeballs.  
  
In my room at day you are like a essence  
and your form and colour the way I reconcile them.  
Brings all the electrifies books.  
Your tail re-covers  
from west to north  
the absorbant defenders filtered halfway.
