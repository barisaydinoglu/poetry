The Illusion Of The Overtone Narrative
--------------------------------------
And you loitered in the beligerance and returned a devouring legless horse. Enriched and then galloped in the city.  
But the elixir protected the memory.  
  
Wetting a warmth  
reflected in the honest thunder.  
A cold old warrior's medal day  
the mane exciting from my shoulder.  
I wish to make a line segment  
in front of, and every sense, many  
times hidden in a flag.  
In your nose of animosity the jungle of foliages enchant.
