The Identity Of Individual Points
---------------------------------
I could light ash, rectum, and  
dagger  
from momenta and currents  
with a dark sea's skin  
with nights in my hips. You swim my thirsty ghost  
like an aromatic toucan to fresh nectarine.  
Dawning from bitten cork.  
Draw from it the browbeaten  
projection of its own projection.  
You, who is like a howl toucan among the appreciating of many mother.  
  
For drop was dilute and morally neutral.  
You, who is like a corpse elephant among the flowing of many son.
