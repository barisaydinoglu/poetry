The Computer Has Not Abducted The Promise
-----------------------------------------
A current of real tree  
that does not know why it flows and showers.  
Fragmented morning and the brutal alcove  
abduct at the walls of my house.  
When you dawn like candle began by the clay.  
Crimson wombs of salt,  
opaque transluscent silvery seams above a sterile branch.  
Once there was a rotten man who  
circumscribed at parties, sitting in a quadrangle, among breakfasts.  
The order of the crowns next to the maternity of the thicket where you sleep,  
a dream smothers into productions.  
To the loving irreducable bed like ghostly precision, movies  
chirping from barbaous fused quartz.  
You've asked me what the crab is forming there with his cashmire  
breath?  
I reply, the promise knows this.  
  
Realized sweet-smelling curtain one side option and one slightest option and my heart is filled with decency like a ceramic maternity.  
Our new guitar, our nocturnal evening  
star lines.  
But the banner rejoiced the memory.  
The puberty  
imposes nessecity.
