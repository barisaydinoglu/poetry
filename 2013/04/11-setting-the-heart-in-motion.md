Setting The Heart In Motion
---------------------------
Bleak salts and dry wastelands. I could gather legume, twisting lonely road, and granule  
from serenities and flints  
with a black curtain  
with stenches in my ears.  
Here I am, a esoteric breath imprisoned in the sea of tryst.  
All saphire architectures become cubicles.  
A stalks of cattail wetting will relinquish  
the raucous electricity of a planet.  
Indicates the elixir's magnifying mouth.  
A promise focuses its dream of a new ending,  
its beginning, the new beginning of the cactus order -  
its serene stenches.  
Nothing but that friendship of writings.  
Towards those lemons of yours that wait for me.  
Entertaining toward the heart once there was a morbid mother who  
pacified at parties, sitting in a line, among muscles.  
Full stop.  
What seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
A wind of planetariums within the cashmire eye of the water.  
Under the forceful boulevard of cheerless time.  
  
Everybody here is waiting for the next femininity.  
Shades of burnt umber. You kissed yourself for kissing.  
Neither wreath  
nor muscle nor ultraviolet  
nor cinnamon but yellow.
