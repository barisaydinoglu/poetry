Everyday You Inherit
--------------------
Outside the tenacious promise, many windy probes.  
Fewer and fewer  
penetrate about another mode of tiredness.  
But the honeysuckle flowed the memory.  
Only promise, just the  
coral, nothing but  
it. Salt.  
Neither key nor kiss nor rust colored  
nor transparent but transluscent opaque yellow.  
And a dead rose's lava will perch you.  
Perfumed and then magnified in the region.  
Pure consequence returns the spheres you say, what is the leaf waiting for in its opaque sand-colored love?  
I tell you it is waiting for tree like you. A mist of essences not protecting is a form of developing.  
To the hidden color of the ivory silvery car.
