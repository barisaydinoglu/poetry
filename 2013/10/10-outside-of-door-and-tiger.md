Outside Of Door And Tiger
-------------------------
You see mouth as human as the thunder. You are the grape of my banal fingernails.  
There are many vaginas in bleak events.  
Kis.  
Inside the burned-out moonlight evening of muzzled energy.  
  
Your heart perches from west to south  
a turqoise and wet-winged starlight is hated in the vicinity.
