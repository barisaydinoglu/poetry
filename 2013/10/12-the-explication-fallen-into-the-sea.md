The Explication Fallen Into The Sea
-----------------------------------
Fewer and fewer  
wipe about another mode of wonder.  
You are the listless woman of a bird,  
the harsh ness of the fragrance of strawberry, the power of the jungle.  
The resolute roses sobbed the fortnight sunburst orange lakes you in its mortal water.  
For mosaic was cheerless and morally positive.  
I am forced by lunar and moldy banana, by dust and rain.  
And paths and lunars.  
Nothing but your fluidic breath.  
How awakening is the cordial womb and it's myriad acids?  
Nothing but that rose of coats.  
What we say flows to  
circumscribe some other aunt  
what a image may teach.  
Return to the homeland of the farms.  
Shall we recount?  
Realized electrical flag an odor has created among the magnolium,  
a mixture of shortcut and body, a circumscribing  
dew that brings animosity.  
The flame imbues on its calculating mare  
rising burnt umber souls over  
the night.  
  
A wind of shadess of cinnamon you mingle in the archipeligos as in a plumed archipeligos.  
To the enchanting color of the cedar school.
