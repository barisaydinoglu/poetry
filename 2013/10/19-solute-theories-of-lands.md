Solute Theories Of Lands
------------------------
In your hips of throttling the chimney begins to dream of galloping. They hated it with harsh wells.  
To the ancient decisive peace what seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
Went expanded in grape the silent shorelines hated circus of a coddled dilute sun.  
Like jackals depriving outside planetariums.  
Always you deceive through the sunrise  
toward the midnight puncturing writings.  
A grace focuses its dream of a new beginning, its new beginning, the beginning of the farm order -  
its poetic moldy bananas.
