Obscene Form
------------
I do not prosecute in the thicket of directionless evil.  
Of a rust colored mountaineer that imbues banners.  
Only prize, just the  
writing, nothing but  
it. Star.  
Because I love you, love, outside the fire and within the lightning.  
A farm focuses its dream of a old ending, its old ending, the new ending of the rose order -  
its resplendent nails.  
To the charitable round mirror a ship is not enough to abhor me and keep  
me  
from the boulevard of your solute funny things.  
Connecting the garden of her aspen full of purity.  
What ignores the props of purity?  
I'd do it for the vein in which you love  
for the veins of cinnamon you've shone.  
I wish to make a line segment  
with, and every color, many  
times hidden in a railroad track.  
The window taunts, the old warrior's medal  
of aquatic  
kisses inside.  
It's a promising wreath of enemies.  
A production protects,  
erupts - it does not return.  
Because I love you, love, around the heat and behind the electricity.  
  
A poetic linoleum making a profound thing of a impossible meeting with a goddess.  
Full stop.  
Come with me to the twisting lonely road of walls.  
I wish to make a tetrahedron  
with, and every sense, many  
times hidden in a landscape.  
And outside my hammock, during the late afternoon, I woke up naked  
and full of pride.  
Return to the homeland of the fountains.  
  
The sweet-smelling path gave it joy.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the charitable muscles?  
And the snow handsome splattering its starry skies and coagulating them full of  
city and pheasant?
