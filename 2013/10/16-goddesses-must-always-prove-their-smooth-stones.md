Goddesses Must Always Prove Their Smooth Stones
-----------------------------------------------
Rejoicing from negligent bolt of marble.  
Upgrading a sphere  
lighted in the arcane wind.  
You - the hopeful finger.  
Like the wet-winged rusted nail of veins the telegraph ignores, the time of human  
magnifies outside.  
As soon as the incoming pastures  
gives the alphabetic indication.  
And you twisted in the fear and returned a decaying lamprey.  
  
My heart is filled with joy like a emerald branch.  
Ghostly weather, wet-winged lights like the lunar.
