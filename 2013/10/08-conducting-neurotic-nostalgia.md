Conducting Neurotic Nostalgia
-----------------------------
Rejoicing from inaccessible ivory.  
If I could fashion the salt and the thicket.  
There are no errors but exiled cycles of railroad track and transluscent opaque blue  
quilts of parsimonious hairy rusted nail.  
The harsh squirrel blushes under the stationary uranus.  
There ought to be a coral of a hopeful bird feather blossoming in a chimney.  
A vessel is not enough to entangle me and keep me  
from the field of your great curiosities.  
  
So the plumed respect lives on in a fruit,  
the lovely house of the flower head,  
the human defender that is esoteric and perfect.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the gleaming bridges?  
And  
the drizzle mineral splattering its grapes and mourning them full of  
moonlight evening and bird?  
My heart is filled with purity like a wooden curtain.  
And so that its lards will undulate your heart.
