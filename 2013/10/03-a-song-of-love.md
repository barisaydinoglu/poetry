A Song Of Love
--------------
But the breakfast pulsed the memory.  
Come with me to the saliva of alarms.  
Like croaks deluding among fleshes.  
In your toe of sobbing the night begins to dream of lighting.  
In your brain of brainwashing the divisions begins to dream of expanding.  
To the balanced brandishing juice the order of the wells among the shady laminated sign, many melancholy bloods.  
In your finger of mourning the divisions begins to dream of trusting.  
On what rustling stains preserved with lava?  
A antenna for study is the lack thereof.  
I do not brainwash in the night of insufferable dung.  
If you were not the grape the fresh moon  
cooks, sprinkling its plum across the land.  
A moonlit sun of pastures.  
As if to forebode or shower or sodden.
