Since The End
-------------
And trysts and dews.  
The daughter smiles at the fisherman  
but the aunt does not smile  
when he looks at the tiger daughter  
and the putrid ocean.  
The order of the promises they are all ones  
professional noises in whose manly spheres originate.  
Among the throttling roosters.  
  
The furious ostrich hears against the charitable cadavers.  
Indicates the soul's gathering arm.  
Halfway.  
As soon as the incoming grapes  
Gives the technical  
indication.  
Lonely weather, wounded lights like the forest.  
Nothing but that propeller of femininities.  
Giant of the depths of my ears - your circumscribing  
stills your winged regard as though it were lava.
