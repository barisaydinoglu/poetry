A Gold Within Glass
-------------------
You say, what is the soul waiting for in its sunburst orange splendor?  
I tell you it is waiting for starry sky like you.  
Opaque transluscent transparent heat to my pale crown!  
In the middle of the sticky flag, many troubled rectums.  
Wave was no longer above the transmission threshold.
