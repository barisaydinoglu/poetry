I Expected Children
-------------------
You - the rosy leg.  
Shall we recount?  
The bloodied iron imposes nessecity.  
A opaque dull shades of transluscent burnt umber and pale springtime is attacked in the archipeligos.  
The order of the hearts yellow fire to my inevitable lemon!  
Everything rigid with real voices, the salt of the writing  
and piles of boundless bread in twilight.  
Like the fractious broken glass of curtains draw from it the morbid  
detail of its own detail.  
You are the grape of my careless mouth.  
It gallops like a pasture in the faucet.  
Only tryst, just the  
fellowship, nothing but  
it. Film.  
From harrowing wind to unrelenting rain,  
hidden tigers drawn by winged channels, a  
distorted star begins to begin.  
But I should be true to engineering, abandoning among its lashed lunars  
so let us try to divulge a story devoid of neutral redundancies.  
What is this signal but a memory erupted of its landscapes?  
You see shoulder as sanguine as the sun.  
A loaf of bread baked with mourning wonder and salt.  
Sticky aunts and aunts.  
For me they are overtone.
