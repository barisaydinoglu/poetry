Your Leg Is Enough
------------------
Because I love you, love, amid the water and in front of the fire. My heart moves from being rigid to being poetic.  
Deep brown invasions of shards of glass,  
cinnamon seams above a directionless tiger.  
  
The blazing stranger  
chirps in the serendipidous morning.  
Echo was no longer below the recording threshold.
