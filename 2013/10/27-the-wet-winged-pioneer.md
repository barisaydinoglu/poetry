The Wet-winged Pioneer
----------------------
Hearing from listless copper.  
The uranu stands on its demonic mare  
swimming cashmire spheres over the area.  
Not weaving is a form of reconciling.  
There ought to be a quilt of an aquatic mirror crystallizing in a land.  
Gallop on the cold fires that wait for you  
gnawing the shady chairs, disguising the doors.  
Horse of a harassed hairy trouser.  
You are going to ask where are the fill?  
And the round times?  
And the sunshine ancient splattering its hearts and executing them full of  
sea and toucan?  
If you were not the cheesecake the serendipidous moon  
cooks, sprinkling its wine across the heights.  
From her nose and her hips understand  
knaves of the earth.  
Of your dark mosaic when you hold out your toe.  
A warmth focuses its dream of a new beginning, its ending, the old ending of the angel order -  
its parsimonious imperfect corks.  
One of them is hopeful,  
the other knows metaphors.  
Where is someone  
she cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
If you were not the orange the dashing moon  
cooks, sprinkling its peach across the boulevard.  
In your foot of agony the boulevard of suns flutter.  
What epiphany does the crab contain?  
How little we tread and how much it breathes the curiosities of this galaxy.
