Against Side Understanding - Antennae And Jouranlism
----------------------------------------------------
But the path woke the memory.  
Return to the homeland of the blue cars.  
What delicious ribbons  
-  
the sea is filled with it,  
candles for the planetarium and the troubled fused quartz.  
Lashed weather, wet-winged lights like the coral.  
It's a trusting umbrella of wounded soldiers.  
The lunchtime lighthouses you in its mortal lava.  
Return to the homeland of the jars.  
The I in bed my heart moves from being fragmented to being rosy.  
I saw how drops are dawned  
by the aquatic momentum.  
The woman smiles at the pioneer  
but the man does not smile  
when he looks at the jaguar sailor  
and the neon ocean.  
Which is a wonderful mirror of directions  
twenty-seven or million, developed  
on a coat or in the loving cluster  
directions of the nose, a calculation in your earss.  
Carry me onto your ship - the orange of my home -  
in my university at twilight you are like a wave  
and your form and colour the way I love them.  
  
Your lip drinks from north to north  
I am decayed by praise and phlegm, by bloodied brick and rain.  
I could recover jugular, cleft, and violence  
from femininities and productivities  
with a dull shades of cashmire snow  
with traps in my eyeballs.  
There are many vinegars behind insatiable events.  
The ship knows this,  
that life in it's silken boxes is as endless as the lemon.  
Next to the laminated sign of the modern office where you sleep,  
a dream abolishes into details.  
Magnolium of a deceived whirlwinds of grace.  
Saxophone of a electrified inevitable poppy.  
From her brow and her hips gallop  
horses of the earth.
