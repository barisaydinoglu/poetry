Some Raucous Develop
--------------------
Fluttering toward the energy I do not puncture in the area of fire-tipped funeral.  
To seize lost sepia cars and for keys.  
What forces the props of purity?  
All atoms become utensils.  
There are no flasks but  
bitten cycles of salt and cinnamon  
bottles of esoteric browbeaten broken glass.  
Sometimes a piece of the sky  
faints like a rose in my brain.  
  
Under the sea like metal.
