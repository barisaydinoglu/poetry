Some Burned-out Upgrade
-----------------------
Where snows meet  
currents meet, in front of and in and the sound  
of scandalmongerings, to reach out and appreciate in anger.  
The clay resplendent cadavers are shook.  
One of them is thick,  
the other knows metaphors.  
Where is someone  
he cries, and when can we see what  
is going to happen?  
Not growing is a form of mixing.  
The silent dignity of the garden! And you shook in the agony and performed a stealing conspirator.  
Like skeleton movie, railroad tracks  
one alphabetic option and a rust colored and disintered aspen is pitied in the vicinity.
