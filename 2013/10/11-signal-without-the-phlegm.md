Signal Without The Phlegm
-------------------------
Multitude of lemons!  
In and out of the blue the cashmire and the transparent  
they foreboded it with listless guitars.  
What seems simultaneous to one will not seem so to another.  
Once there was a tenacious woman who  
preserved at parties, sitting in a circle, among lands.  
To the serendipidous color of the bolt of silk propeller.  
The sunset times you in its mortal sky.  
As if to loiter or grow or gnaw.  
The leaf twists, the phemonana of sensual  
enchants in front of.  
A loaf of bread baked with dilute love and salt.  
Nothing but that sea shell of forms.  
Bitter invasions and rotten hearts.  
A laminated sign -like pigeon hole  
like the explosive ash of peaces outside deep brown water and blue leaves.
