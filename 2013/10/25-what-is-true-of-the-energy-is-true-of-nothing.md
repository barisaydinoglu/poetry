What Is True Of The Energy Is True Of Nothing
---------------------------------------------
In the middle of the rustling farm, many bruised cummerbunds.  
In the smallest saphire droplet the lava deedy nougats are gnawn.  
Deep brown earth to my absurd miracle!  
Formed and then flowed in the vicinity.  
As soon as the incoming warmths  
gives the algorithmic indication.  
The reasons for my respect  
are promised in my shoulder of chalk.  
To the eager hopeful goblet what replaces the props of happiness?
