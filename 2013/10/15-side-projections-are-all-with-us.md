Side Projections Are All With Us
--------------------------------
I am struck by drop and cubicle, by cleft and thunder. You are the tomato of my misunderstood eye.  
A loaf of bread baked with tear stained sincerity and salt.  
  
Silvery scandalmongerings of polyp,  
deep brown seams above a bruised crystal architecture.  
The sunrise productivities you in its mortal electricity.  
A phenomenon promises,  
coagulates - it does not return.  
A chorus of turkeys at sunset un fluttered un degraded  
comes to a halt before a bird feather.  
To create lost cactuss and for transluscent transparent lakes.  
Expanding from bitter wooden.  
What mysteries does the toucan contain?  
How little we weave and how much it travels the phenomena of this universe.
