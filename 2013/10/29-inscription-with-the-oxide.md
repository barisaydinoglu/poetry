Inscription With The Oxide
--------------------------
A loaf of bread baked with fuming honor and salt.  
Pure nail perches the fragrances  
of strawberry as if to crush or hear or protest.  
Mane of a killed imperalist poppy.  
I'd do it for the lake in which you enrich  
for the miracles of opaque opaque blue you've imbued.  
  
A tetrahedron amid a triangle,  
the wounded workings of incredulous law.  
The wide doors entangled what seems disjoint to one will not seem so to another.  
I saw how ships are galloped  
by the serene aspen.  
A snow of saxophones not blushing is a form of upgrading.  
Shall we set forth?  
The skeleton splendor is natural on your toe.  
A car is not enough to tremble me and keep me  
from the sea of your somber epiphany.  
To the natural color of the paper-mache tryst.  
It was the holiday of the turkey.  
I am congealed by dove and pin, by rotten stump and snow.  
Draw from it the harsh  
image of its own phenomenon.  
The smooth stone chains, the writing of handsome  
mingles outside.  
Tree.  
  
It was the day of the pheasant.  
Mingling toward the faucet a fog of mirrors you are the hushed custodian of a lobster,  
the delirious ness of the mist, the power of the ice.  
  
And a inevitable friendship's fire will love you.  
If you were not the cheesecake the angellic moon  
cooks, sprinkling its sugar across the night.
