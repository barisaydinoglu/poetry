An Equally Promising Lady
-------------------------
Nothing but that sea water of bottles.  
To connect lost bridges and for wreaths.  
Indicates the stalks of cattail's travelling fingernails.  
To relinquish lost ships and for roses.  
What is this identity but a memory crushed of its utensils?  
The smooth stone flutters in playing your brow.  
Of your opaque brimstone elixir when you hold out your shoulder.  
Against the rusted law, many delirious bloody feathers.  
Shall we keep going?  
Your hand blushes from east to south  
  
A gray and dead flint is abhorred in the region.  
You, who is like a ghost pheasant among the setting of many mother.  
  
Transluscent sunburst orange sky to my explosive shoreline!  
The juice imposes nessecity.  
You circumscribe slowly into a chimney to seek your business.  
The cactus plan that has everyone bitterest.  
When you play relaxed like a elixir.  
Within the falling legless horses.  
An odor has discovered outside the home,  
a mixture of lance and body, a carrying  
affection that brings illusion.  
Which is a balanced lunar of directions  
twenty-seven or three hundred, imbued  
on a productivity or in the promising smooth rusted nail  
directions of the eyelids, a calculation in your brows.  
And the kiss to its railroad track  
and among the bird feathers the hopeful one  
the sailor covered with steady bridge.  
In front of sunburst orange water and transparent lighthouses.
