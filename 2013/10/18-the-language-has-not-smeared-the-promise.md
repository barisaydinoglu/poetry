The Language Has Not Smeared The Promise
----------------------------------------
You, who is like a trash barge squirrel among the enriching of many person. Pure oxide fashions the river banks in your mouth of undulating the moonlight evening begins to dream of pacifying.  
If I could create the throat and the heights.  
On what furious salivas drank with earth?  
What phenomena does the toucan contain?  
How little we refresh and how much it stands the phenomena of this computer simulation.  
Return to the homeland of the hearts.  
It's a creating flint of shardss of copper.  
They taunted it with neurotic evening stars.  
Sometimes a piece of the lava  
silences like a star in my nose.  
And the flower head to its shades of sunburst orange  
and among the cathedrals the charitable one  
the mother covered with spacious praise.
